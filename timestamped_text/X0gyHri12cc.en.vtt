00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.500
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.270
Today, I'm going to explain a drama and sci-fi
film called "Only."

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.560
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.670
Watch out and take care.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.360
A young couple named Will and Eva decides
to subject themselves to a strict set of safety

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.820
protocols after a comet released ashes that
caused the spread of a mysterious disease

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.170
across the world.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.210
The stress brought on by the isolation and
preventive measures has not been easy for

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.210
the couple.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.720
To top it off, Draconian mandates from the
government have left them no choice but to

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.960
hide, not just from the authorities but also
from their neighbors.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.260
On Day 400 of the pandemic, Eva uses a test
kit to find out if she is infected.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.989
But while they are waiting for the results,
they hear the authorities knocking at the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.760
door, so Eva runs to her room and hides in
a compartment under the bed.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.989
When Will answers the door, military personnel
immediately enter their apartment to inspect

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.300
the rooms.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.269
The Sargeant looks at Will's I.D. and points
out that he isn't mentioned in the apartment's

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:49.510
lease records.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.001
Will tells them that the place belonged to
his girlfriend, Carolyn Hartley, but she had

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.670
already died from the virus.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.179
The Sargeant takes another look at his records
and asks Will about Eva Balsora, who was also

00:00:58.179 --> 00:00:59.600
listed on the lease.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.859
Will tells them that Eva went back to England
to visit her parents when the pandemic hit,

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.869
and he never heard from her again.

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.950
As The Sargeant looks around the apartment,
he interrogates Will about all the plastic

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.409
covering the furniture.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.631
Will tells them that it was part of the quarantine
measures to keep his girlfriend safe, but

00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:15.259
it didn't work because she still succumbed
to the disease.

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.409
When the man inquires about the test kit,
Will explains that he tested himself because

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.850
he could be carrying the virus unknowingly.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.979
One of the soldiers calls the attention of
the Sargeant after finding a room with numerous

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.890
pictures of women on the wall.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.780
Most of them hold papers with dates on them,
but others have written dates directly on

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.900
their skin.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.289
Will discloses that these were women that
he once knew.

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.159
The Sargeant finally tells his men to move
out of the apartment after finding nothing

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.960
suspicious inside.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.040
On the way out, the Sargeant tells Will that
he's impressed that they've managed to survive

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.850
the pandemic for so long.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.770
He assures Will there's no cause for worry
because he has no intention of taking the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.840
infected individual living with him.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.829
When Will asks him what he meant, the Sargeant
points to the vial of the test kit on the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.030
kitchen table.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.520
The Sargeant hints that he knows what the
government does with the people they take

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.640
with them.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.570
Before leaving the apartment, he tells Will
to enjoy the last few moments he has with

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.639
her.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.100
While Will broods over the result of the test,
Eva tells him to start packing, so they could

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.100
leave.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.009
While they drive on the streets, an emergency
announcement notifies the area's residents

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.710
that a curfew is in effect.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.009
The announcer tells the residents to avoid
exposure to the ash and report any sighting

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.799
of females to the authorities.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.080
They stop by a store to buy some groceries,
but Will tells Eva to stay close to him and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.319
keep quiet before getting out.

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.510
Inside the store, most of the shelves are
almost empty save for the feminine hygiene

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.349
section, where the products are offered free
of charge.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.150
While Eva inspects a tampon, a store employee
grabs her bonnet from behind, exposing her

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.560
long hair.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.870
Will hears the commotion, so he points a gun
at the startled employee, telling him to lie

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.240
on the ground.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.629
After being convinced that no one else is
in the store, Will leaves the man $40 to pay

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.170
for the groceries and tells him to stay down
until he finishes counting down from 500.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.050
Several weeks before the disease emerged,
Eva had asked Will if they could go on a trip.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.610
Eva says she wants to go to a waterfall because
she hasn't been to one in years.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.290
After breakfast, Eva and Will start reminiscing
about their last road trip, but their serene

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.170
moment is suddenly interrupted by a bird hitting
their window.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.450
When they look outside, they notice the ashes
falling from the sky.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.840
As they continue to stare outside the window,
their roommate Carolyn enters the apartment

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.799
and collapses on the floor.

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.010
Back on the road, Will and Eva stop by the
motel to stay the night.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.550
In the morning, Eva tapes a girdle around
her chest to conceal her breasts.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.810
She notices some dust on the edge of the sink
and rubs it on her cheeks to give her a scruffy

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.810
look.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.870
She smiles as she continues applying the dust
to her face.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.500
Later on, Will and Eva stop by a diner for
food, but Will is worried that it might be

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.829
too risky for both of them to go inside.

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.700
However, Eva hints that she doesn't want to
eat her last cooked meal on the road.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.519
Inside the diner, Will orders the food as
Eva refrains from speaking to anyone.

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.900
While they wait for their meal, a news anchor
reveals that the Embryo Project was able to

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.250
grow a fetus inside an artificial womb up
to the second trimester.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.579
The authorities look at the promising experiment
as a possible way to repopulate the Earth

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.060
once they find a cure for the virus known
as H.N.V. 21.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.510
As other men arrive at the diner, the news
reveals that the reward for reporting a living

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.060
woman to the authorities has been increased
from one million to two million dollars.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.670
Will and Eva start to feel uneasy as the other
men discuss the reward.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.250
When the waiter approaches their table, Will
orders two pie slices to go and asks for the

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.250
check.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.370
While preparing to leave, Will notices blood
dripping from Eva's ear.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.920
Will tries to wipe off the blood from Eva's
face, but he knocks over a coffee mug, calling

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.209
other people's attention.

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.409
Will and Eva try to avoid the gaze of other
customers as they rush out of the restaurant

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.090
without paying for their food.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.290
When the waiter tries to come after them,
a man offers to pay their bill as he watches

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.530
them drive away.

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.890
The man, named Arthur, tells his stepson,
Casey, to finish his meal and prepare to leave.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.360
Will and Eva soon arrive at the entrance to
a forest leading to a waterfall.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.580
Will tries to convey his concerns about Eva's
health, but she urges him to enjoy their trip.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.280
In the past, When Will and Eva took Carolyne
to the hospital, Will noticed that the nurses

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.180
and doctors seemed to be on edge.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.510
As more people arrive, he realized that all
the patients were women.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.760
Will tells Eva that they'll have to leave,
but Eva insists on staying behind to find

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.560
out what's wrong with Carolyne.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.560
Will only manages to convince her to leave
when he tells her that only women are getting

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.560
sick.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.780
On their way out of the hospital, Will decides
to stop by a restricted area to grab two hazmat

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.780
suits.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.950
When they get home, Eva receives a call from
her Dad, Peter, who advises them to quarantine.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.570
Peter gives them instructions on how to disinfect
their apartment.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.740
First, Will covers the doors and furniture
with plastic.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.260
Then they apply bleach on the floor and spray
disinfectant into the air.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.150
Back in the present, while taking a break
from their journey to the waterfall, Will

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.450
sees Eva taking photos, so he asks her why
she's still doing it when no one would see

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.690
the images.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.980
Eva suggests that other women might still
be out there, noting that she's not that special.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.130
In another flashback and on the second day
of the ash fall, Will had incorporated the

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.710
quarantine protocols into their morning routine.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.650
Will says they need to start boiling the water
because the virus has entered the water supply.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.620
Will had installed U.V. lights all over the
apartment because they can kill pathogens

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.290
and germs within two feet.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.530
They will be eating canned food for a while,
but Will assures Eva that the quarantine will

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.810
be over soon.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.970
When Eva hears her phone buzzing, Will advises
her not to take it out of the bag when she

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.570
answers the call.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.490
On the news, they hear that thousands of women
have died from H.N.V. 21, and millions more

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.690
are infected.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.950
At least a dozen males have been found with
the virus, but none have exhibited any symptoms.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.200
By Day 44, Eva has started to become weary
from eating ravioli all the time.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.570
The couple tries to keep themselves physically
close by caressing each other while wearing

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.570
gloves.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.720
As the days go by, Will builds a compartment
that they can place under the bed so Eva can

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.470
hide in case of emergencies.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.560
By that time, the government has begun to
hold women in captivity.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.660
The news shows that the women appear to be
happy as the President pays them a visit,

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.880
but articles on the internet claim that the
government has been conducting horrific experiments

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.250
on women.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.940
Since Eva is not allowed to go out, she settles
for taking pictures by the window.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.460
Will, however, warns her that it's still not
safe, so he asks her to give him the camera.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.170
Eva is slowly becoming more irritable during
her isolation, as she feels constricted by

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.260
the protocols and the smell of the Lysol all
over the house.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.710
While browsing the internet, Eva comes across
a chatroom for women who managed to avoid

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:38.980
getting infected.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.920
The group called "She Will Survive," has 131
participants when she joined.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.410
Meanwhile, Will is becoming more protective
of Eva as more women die from the disease.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.371
As Eva searches for her phone, Will tells
her that he has hidden it for fear that she

00:06:50.371 --> 00:06:53.030
might be sending critical information to strangers.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.340
Eva is shocked to learn that Will went through
her phone without her knowledge.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.910
Eva confesses to the women in the S.W.S. chatroom
that she's starting to feel helpless because

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.660
of the quarantine protocols.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.070
On the other hand, Will is often displeased
with Eva every time she fails to follow the

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.270
preventive measures.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.190
Soon, they hear from the news that 10 million
women have already died from H.N.V. 21.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.340
The number of participants in the S.W.S chatroom
has been reduced to 89, with some members

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.010
noticing that fewer people are logging on
each day.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.020
Eva tells the women in the chatroom not to
lose hope because other survivors are still

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.500
probably out there.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.240
She then points out that her mother is still
safe in England.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.150
Will and Eva continue to argue about the quarantine
rules as the disease continues to wreak havoc

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.150
worldwide.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.590
Meanwhile, the number of participants in the
S.W.S chatroom has continued to dwindle.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.550
When Eva goes online, she finds that there
are only 14 women in the group.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.050
Back in the forest, Will and Eva practice
shooting a can after setting up camp.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.730
Will misses the target, so he asks Eva to
try it.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.830
Eva hits the can on her first shot, so Will
asks her to try again.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.530
Meanwhile, Arthur and Casey have found Will's
car at the forest entrance, and Arthur punctures

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.290
a tire on Will's vehicle before going after
them.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.630
After shooting, Eva and Will relax in the
tent and get intimate, but their lovemaking

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.510
is soon cut off when Eva's body starts to
tremble.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.110
On Day 238 of the pandemic, Will decides to
buy the gun.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.050
When he entered the store, the clerk told
him that he's a little late because most of

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.210
his merchandise has already been sold.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.410
The man offers Will a rifle and suggests that
it will be suitable for hunting women because

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.720
it's not lethal.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.820
Will says he only wants something he could
use for self-defense.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.920
Will gets home carrying a handgun with him
as he disinfects himself before entering the

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.920
living room.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.860
Will also brings home a test kit and tells
Eva that he wants to use it to find out if

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.050
he's a carrier.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.330
Will says that he is also tired of the quarantine,
and he is hoping that he'd be able to touch

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.990
Eva again if he's clear.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.820
He rubs the swab into his mouth and puts the
sample into the vial.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.149
They watch the vial for a while, waiting to
see if it changes color.

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:40.110
Soon, they see the vial turning indigo, which
indicates that Will is infected.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.240
Will is distraught to learn that he's a carrier,
but he tells Eva not to worry because she's

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.639
still safe.

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:47.480
Back in the woods, Eva gets out of the tent
in the morning to take a walk while Will is

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.680
still asleep.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.279
When Will wakes up, he calls for Eva, but
when he gets out of the tent, Casey and Arthur

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:54.339
greet him by pointing a rifle at him.

00:08:54.339 --> 00:08:57.269
Arthur tells him to get out of the tent and
asks him where Eva is.

00:08:57.269 --> 00:09:00.180
He starts yelling, telling her not to come
back to their camp.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.519
Eva hears his voice and sneaks back to their
camp.

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:05.890
Upon reaching the area, she sees Arthur tying
Will to a tree.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.250
Arthur tells Casey to check the trail while
he looks for Eva near the river.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.140
Arthur soon sees Eva running, so he chases
after her.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.420
She manages to evade Arthur by hiding between
two huge rocks.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.740
While Arthur looks for her, she suddenly palpitates.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.310
Fortunately, Arthur gives up and decides to
wait for her at the camp.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.990
That night, Arthur asks Will how he managed
to keep Eva safe for so long.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.170
Arthur tells him that he tried sealing and
sterilizing their basement to keep his wife

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.389
safe, but she died after a few weeks.

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:32.500
Arthur assures Will that he's not a monster.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.670
He only wants to repopulate the Earth so that
his son can raise his own family someday.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.810
Will reminds Arthur that Eva is already sick
to be of any use to him.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.680
Arthur tells him that they need to find her
soon because her eggs only last around six

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.110
hours after death.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.120
Will asks Arthur if he would've turned his
wife over to the authorities.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.480
He says he wouldn't have, but his wife, Cathy,
would've gladly turned herself in if it would

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.480
help.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.899
When an alarm starts beeping, Arthur wakes
up Casey and tells him that it's his turn

00:09:54.899 --> 00:09:56.529
to watch over Will.

00:09:56.529 --> 00:10:01.940
By Day 374 of the pandemic, only Eva and another
woman with the username Hope365 are online

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.689
in the S.W.S. chatroom.

00:10:03.689 --> 00:10:06.750
Hope tells her that another survivor has been
raided the previous night.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.949
Hope says that she went online to say goodbye
to Eva because she has already started feeling

00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:11.000
the symptoms.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.699
Eva tells her that it could be anything, but
she says that she had taken the test.

00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:18.499
Hope sends Eva a photo of herself holding
a paper with the date "March 23."

00:10:18.499 --> 00:10:21.630
Eva prints the image and sticks it to the
wall in her room, where other pictures of

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.160
the women from S.W.S. are displayed.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.649
In the forest, Will wakes up at night and
sees Eva walking toward them.

00:10:27.649 --> 00:10:30.620
Eva walks toward Casey without her clothes
on as he stares at her in awe.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.000
When she gets close, she strokes Casey's face
gently and suddenly hits him in the head with

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.209
a rock, knocking him unconscious.

00:10:36.209 --> 00:10:40.399
Eva unties Will, but as they prepare to leave,
they hear Arthur calling out to Casey.

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:43.740
As Will points the rifle towards the tent,
Arthur shoots from the inside, causing Will

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.999
to fire back.

00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:48.050
Will is hit in the leg, but he still manages
to get away with Eva.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.240
Arthur remains in the tent as he cries out
in pain, indicating that he has also been

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.270
hit.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:56.160
On Day 400, Eva receives a call from her Dad,
but Will tells her that they should contact

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.190
him via a secure VPN instead of calling him
back.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.580
Eva tells Will that maybe it was an emergency
because Peter wasn't supposed to use the phone

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.269
under normal circumstances.

00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:07.569
Will decides to dial the phone, but he tells
Eva not to say anything.

00:11:07.569 --> 00:11:11.529
Peter, who has bruises on his face, answers
the phone and tells Eva that he wants to know

00:11:11.529 --> 00:11:12.649
if she's okay.

00:11:12.649 --> 00:11:14.990
He informs Eva that his mother has been taken.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.060
He had thought that his wife would be safe
because of her age, but people still took

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.060
her.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.319
Peter cries as he begs Eva to say something.

00:11:21.319 --> 00:11:25.079
Unable to hold back her longing to communicate
with her father, Eva calls out to Peter, saying

00:11:25.079 --> 00:11:26.290
she's okay.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:30.389
Will quickly takes away the phone, arguing
that she cannot talk on an unsecured line.

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:33.209
Eva begs him to give back the phone, but Will
doesn't relent.

00:11:33.209 --> 00:11:36.410
He warns her that people will arrive in 15
minutes to take her away if she speaks on

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.189
an unsecured line.

00:11:38.189 --> 00:11:41.470
Eva lashes out at Will, telling him that her
home has become a prison because of his quarantine

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:42.509
rules.

00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:45.499
Will assures Eva that they will survive the
pandemic, but he tells her that she should

00:11:45.499 --> 00:11:47.839
realize that this would be her life now.

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:51.209
Eva becomes even more frustrated, so she grabs
the gun from the table.

00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:53.959
She then asks Will to leave while pointing
the firearm at him.

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:58.399
Will tries to reason with her, but she reiterates
her demand, so he walks out of the apartment.

00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:01.829
On his way out, Will sees the ashes falling,
so he heads back inside.

00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:05.839
Meanwhile, Eva is already on her way to the
rooftop wearing her hazmat suit.

00:12:05.839 --> 00:12:09.209
When Will gets back inside the apartment,
he notices that Eva is not around, so he goes

00:12:09.209 --> 00:12:10.940
to the rooftop to find her.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.199
When Eva reaches the rooftop, she walks close
to the edge of the building and watches the

00:12:14.199 --> 00:12:15.990
ashes fall from the sky.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.339
Will soon reaches the rooftop and runs toward
Eva, but he is disheartened and crushed when

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:21.709
he sees her removing her hazmat suit.

00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:24.769
Eva and Will walk slowly on their way to the
waterfall in the forest due to Will's limp

00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:26.019
from the gunshot.

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:29.839
Upon reaching the breathtaking site, Will
plants a kiss on Eva's lips and embraces her,

00:12:29.839 --> 00:12:32.139
knowing that she won't be around for much
longer.

00:12:32.139 --> 00:12:35.120
Later on, Eva takes out her camera and gives
it to Will.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:46.760
He takes a selfie with Eva, showing the date
written on the back of her hand.
