after they were left then mickey looked for the&nbsp;
key that had been thrown but the key was not found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.680
they were forced to continue the search the next&nbsp;
day the day turned into night everything went dark&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.840
the zombies knew their position they&nbsp;
couldn't go anywhere without a car key

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.800
the next day instead of disappearing the zombies&nbsp;
were getting more and more and surrounded them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.040
mickey couldn't even continue the search for&nbsp;
their lost car key feel annoyed with zombies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.800
look that always appeared in the car window mickey&nbsp;
decided to cover the car window with a blanket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:39.520
you done can't look at their [ __ ] faces&nbsp;
anymore so that he could relax a bit now

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.640
day by day past the zombies don't go away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.840
the food is running low they spend their time by&nbsp;
playing together keep silence and getting drunk

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.520
spend their rest by lives in the car and it seems&nbsp;
they have lost the rest of their spirit for life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.600
because the zombies never leave their car&nbsp;
then because the zombies have gone mickey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.600
also ventured to went out to get the keys and&nbsp;
because ben's legs still hurt from being shot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.840
so ben didn't accompany mickey&nbsp;
and decided to stay in the car

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.560
after a while ben was anxious waiting&nbsp;
for mickey who never came back

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.000
then after minutes of anxiety and the zombies&nbsp;
had surrounded their car mickey finally came&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.080
back but unfortunately he came back in a&nbsp;
state his hand had been bitten by zombies

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.520
oh jesus

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.120
they were very panicked and the ben&nbsp;
immediately distanced themselves from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.960
mickey and took a gun in his bag ben&nbsp;
was very panicked so he decided to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.840
immediately shoot mickey's head which&nbsp;
instantly killed mickey on the spot

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.400
ben was very beaten to see his friend who is&nbsp;
now dead because if ben doesn't shoot mickey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.720
he will become a zombie and then he will bite&nbsp;
him and ben will surely become a zombie too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.640
then at the end of the film we see ben bravely&nbsp;
getting out of the car limping along followed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:29.840
by a bunch of zombies walking behind him&nbsp;
and the movie ends thanks for watching
