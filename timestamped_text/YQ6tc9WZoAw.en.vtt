00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.880
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today, I am going&nbsp;
to explain the fifth and sixth episodes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.640
of the South Korean survival drama “Squid&nbsp;
Game” called “A fair world” and “Gganbu”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.560
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.680
In the previous episode, Gi-hun’s team&nbsp;
was about to lose the game of tug of war,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.720
so Sangwoo thought of a last-minute plan. He&nbsp;
asked everyone to loosen their grip on the rope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.400
for a few seconds so their opponents would fall&nbsp;
down. As they do, Gi-hun, who was at the front,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.280
almost falls off the bridge. But the plan&nbsp;
works, and their opponents trip and fall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.800
losing their hold on the rope. The team uses this&nbsp;
opportunity to pull the rope harder than ever and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.320
finally wins the game. They lie on the ground in&nbsp;
exhaustion, feeling the adrenaline rush in their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.840
bodies. While returning back to their room, the&nbsp;
girl who Saebyeok had recruited, Jiyeong, makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.880
fun of a team member who happens to be a priest.&nbsp;
They return to the room to see Deoksu’s team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.480
talking to each other. Minyeo stares at the man,&nbsp;
subtly telling him she doesn’t need him anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.760
The group then sits together while talking. Minyeo&nbsp;
tries to charm everyone so they would favor her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.120
She also belittles Ali for being a foreigner&nbsp;
and asks for his passport. As they talk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.000
it is announced that the lights will be off in&nbsp;
some minutes. They know people might start killing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.800
at night, so the group plans to make a barricade&nbsp;
and stay awake in pairs to keep watch. 
&nbsp;

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.560
As they try to build a safe zone using the bunk&nbsp;
beds, Deoksu approaches Gi-hun and makes fun of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.440
him for thinking the beds can stop them from being&nbsp;
killed. Gi-hun, on the other hand, warns him of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.720
his own team members. He thinks since Deoksu has&nbsp;
been ordering them around, he might be their first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.160
target. His words get into Deoksu’s head, so he&nbsp;
tells his team that they won’t be killing tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.880
Ilnam offers to be the first one to keep watch,&nbsp;
saying that old people do not need to sleep. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.600
the kind man is told to shut up by a new member&nbsp;
because they cannot keep an old man as a guard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.440
Soon the lights go out, and Sangwoo and Ali&nbsp;
stay awake to guard the others. Ali thanks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.560
Sangwoo for saving his life today and hands&nbsp;
him a corn that he had saved for him. Sangwoo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.760
breaks it in half, and the two enjoy the corn&nbsp;
while talking. He asks Ali to call him “Hyung”,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.320
which means big brother in Korean. They share&nbsp;
stories about how they ended up in the game.
&nbsp;

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.760
After a while, Sangwoo wakes&nbsp;
Gi-hun to swap the duties.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.240
Deoksu also can’t seem to fall asleep&nbsp;
with the fear of being killed. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.200
realises that the doctor who had gone to the&nbsp;
washroom isn’t back yet. Meanwhile, the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.640
officer Junho is taken to the room where some&nbsp;
staff secretly harvest the dead player’s organs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.280
He finds out that the man he killed on the ship&nbsp;
was also involved in the secret program. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.840
doctor is also there performing the procedures.&nbsp;
He gets into an argument with the staff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.760
for being slow. Back in the room, Ilnam joins&nbsp;
Gi-hun to keep watch. Gi-hun tells him how he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.120
was not paid for ten years worth of work because&nbsp;
the car company he worked at was at a loss. Ilnam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.240
sympathizes with him and starts crying all of a&nbsp;
sudden. Gi-hun tries to calm him and realises that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.520
the old man has a fever. He makes him lay down&nbsp;
but doesn’t have water to help reduce his fever.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.280
Saebyeok offers him some, and the two put Inam&nbsp;
to sleep. It is now their turn to keep watch.
&nbsp;

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.400
Meanwhile, the doctor gets done harvesting the&nbsp;
organs and hands them to Junho and another staff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.040
who are supposed to dive underwater and give&nbsp;
them to the buyers in the sea. After they leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.000
he asks the others about tomorrow’s game. But it&nbsp;
turns out even they do not know what it will be.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.480
The doctor freaks out, saying that he will be&nbsp;
killed if they do not tell him. He holds one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.880
them hostage and asks the other staff to figure&nbsp;
out about the game quickly. They get into a fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.440
leading the doctor to run out to the hallways.&nbsp;
But he gets lost in the maze and doesn’t know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.400
how to return. A staff member follows him to the&nbsp;
playground where the game honeycomb was played.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.960
He asks the doctor to calm down because if&nbsp;
they are caught all of them will be killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.080
The doctor asks him to show his face so that he&nbsp;
can trust him. The two are talking when suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.880
the overseer of the facility shoots the staff.&nbsp;
He then says that he doesn’t care what the staff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.200
does with the dead bodies but they aren’t&nbsp;
allowed to tell the players about the games.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.320
That ruins the main essence of the facility,&nbsp;
that is equality. He then kills the man while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.120
the other staff shoots the doctor dead.
At the same time, Junho and a staff member&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.720
go down through an emergency exit which the man&nbsp;
claims are for the VIPs. Junho vaguely asks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.000
about the VIPs, but the man reveals no one knows&nbsp;
who they are. He becomes suspicious of Junho for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.360
inquiring so much and asks him to open his mask.&nbsp;
The man finds out Junho is a different person,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.160
but before he can react, Junho points his gun&nbsp;
at him. He inquires about his brother, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.400
man doesn’t know anything about him. But he tells&nbsp;
him about the players’ information file in their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.280
overseer’s room, where he can find his brother’s&nbsp;
information. A secret stairway that leads him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.640
to the overseer’s room lies nearby. Junho shoots&nbsp;
the man dead and enters the overseer’s room. 
&nbsp;

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.560
After he is gone, the overseer and the staff come&nbsp;
downstairs to see the man who was killed by Junho.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.280
The overseer takes the bullet out of his body&nbsp;
and realises it belongs to a policeman. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.080
staff are ordered to find the man as soon as&nbsp;
possible. An alarm starts blaring, waking the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.120
players up. They are quickly made to line up in&nbsp;
the middle by the staff. Ilnam refuses to get up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.480
because it turns out he had peed himself at night.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Junho is in the overseer’s room, where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.760
he finds the files of every single person who has&nbsp;
ever participated in the game. He figures that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.560
games have been played for many years now. 
The players are then made to stand in lines in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.520
the middle of the room. Gi-hun helps Ilnam by&nbsp;
tying his jacket around the old man’s waist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.240
so he wouldn’t be embarrassed. After that, the&nbsp;
players are then taken outside through the halls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.320
where everyone is horrified to see the dead&nbsp;
bodies of the doctor and the staff who helped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.200
him being hung to the ceiling. An announcement&nbsp;
is made saying that this will happen to anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.480
who breaks the rules for his own benefit. In the&nbsp;
meantime, Junho is still in the overseer’s office,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.480
taking pictures of the documents he thinks are&nbsp;
important. He is searching for his brother’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.120
file when he hears a phone ringing outside.&nbsp;
The overseer comes into the room and picks it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.240
up. He talks to a foreign man in English about a&nbsp;
minor disturbance that happened between the staff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.800
and assures the person on the other end everything&nbsp;
will be good when the VIPs arrive. After the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.920
overseer leaves, Junho picks up the phone and&nbsp;
tries to call the number but to no avail.
&nbsp;

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.040
In the meantime, the players are taken to an&nbsp;
empty white room where they will have to separate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.360
in a group of two each. Gi-hun’s team needs&nbsp;
to separate as well; they look at each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.880
in confusion, knowing that they will have&nbsp;
to go against each other now. Minyeo tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.000
to sweet-talk Gi-hun to team up with her. When&nbsp;
he doesn’t speak, she makes her way to Sangwoo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.520
who also declines her offer. Sangwoo asks Ali&nbsp;
to be his teammate, and the two look at Gi-hun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.800
to see if he objects. Gi-hun asks them to go&nbsp;
ahead and starts looking for a teammate himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.120
Ilnam makes his way towards him, but Gi-hun&nbsp;
knows he cannot win with an old man as his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.320
partner so he apologises to him. Ilnam simply&nbsp;
gives him his jacket saying that the others might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.040
look down upon him if he doesn’t have one.
Gi-hun feels bad for the man but goes looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.640
for a member anyway. Saebyeok and Jiyeong&nbsp;
join hands as well. A man asks Gi-hun to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.680
his teammate. He reveals that since the doctor&nbsp;
is dead, it leaves an odd number of players. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.960
the one with no partner will probably be killed.&nbsp;
Gi-hun looks at Ilnam sitting alone in a corner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.840
and feels awful for abandoning him, so&nbsp;
he asks the old man to be his partner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.320
In the end, the one person who doesn’t have a&nbsp;
partner is Minyeo. She makes a fuss about them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.960
not being able to win without her. As the players&nbsp;
make their way to play the game, she is taken away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.200
by the guards. The players are then brought to&nbsp;
a mock neighbourhood with several houses and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.400
streets. Ilnam and Gi-hun talk about the allyways
looking like their childhood homes while Ali&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.640
and Sangwoo promise each other that they will&nbsp;
win the money together for their families. 
&nbsp;

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.240
However, all their plans fail when it is announced&nbsp;
that the pairs will be going against each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.720
They are given ten marbles each and are told&nbsp;
to play any game they want to with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.960
Most of them choose either a game where you should&nbsp;
throw the marbles into a pit or a game in which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.360
one guesses how many marbles the other person&nbsp;
has. They are given thirty minutes to complete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.800
the game. Gi-hun is shocked, but Ilnam seems&nbsp;
to be looking at the marbles in fascination.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.680
He has completely forgotten what he was here&nbsp;
for. As the game starts, everyone starts playing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.320
but Ilnam goes around the blocks looking&nbsp;
for his house. Gi-hun tries to stop him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.440
but he doesn’t want to play the game, saying&nbsp;
it to be childish. At last, Gi-hun slams the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.960
old man to the wall in frustration, knowing that&nbsp;
both of them will die if they do not play. Ilnam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.520
trembles in fear and accepts to play with him. 
At the same time, Ali and Sangwoo, who treat each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.600
other like brothers, have to go against each&nbsp;
other now. Ali doesn’t want to play the game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.960
but Sangwoo insists they do, or else both of them&nbsp;
will lose. Ali doesn’t even know how to play it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:37.920
so Sangwoo teaches him. One of them will have to&nbsp;
keep a certain number of marbles hidden in a fist.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.480
The other one will guess if the number of marbles&nbsp;
in their fist is odd or even. If the guess is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.120
right, all the marbles the person is holding will&nbsp;
go to the person who made the correct guess. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.320
two start playing, and Ali makes the right guess&nbsp;
at first, taking two of Sangwoo’s marbles. 
&nbsp;

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.360
Eventually, Ali wins all of Sangwoo’s&nbsp;
marbles except one. When people start dying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.920
Sangwoo claims that he has a way they both can&nbsp;
win. An innocent Ali who doesn’t want to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.640
the reason Sangwoo dies listens to his plan.&nbsp;
Sangwoo claims that at the end of the game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.400
people are not going to agree on a winner&nbsp;
because they will nitpick the rules. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.120
staff will then have only one way to continue,&nbsp;
that is to make one team go against another.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.880
So, they make a deal to go around the playing&nbsp;
zone looking for the players who are older&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.920
so they can go against them at the end. Ali&nbsp;
still doesn’t understand Sangwoo's plan,

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.200
but agree to do whatever he wants because he&nbsp;
trusts him. Sangwoo also makes him wear his marble&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.200
bag on his neck so no one can snatch it. 
Meanwhile, Jiyeong and Saebyeok sit together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.080
not knowing what to do. Saebyeok, being from&nbsp;
North Korea, doesn't know any marble games,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.640
so Ji Yeong offers to teach her. But both&nbsp;
girls do not want to play for thirty minutes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.280
so they decide to just talk for the most of the&nbsp;
time and bet all of their marbles on one game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.080
at the end. Saebyeok, who normally doesn’t like&nbsp;
to speak much, reveals that her father died while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.320
trying to cross the border, and her mother was&nbsp;
caught by the Chinese police and sent back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.520
North Korea. She wants to buy a house and bring&nbsp;
her mother back after she wins the money. Jiyeong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.600
laughs, saying that she could do a lot more&nbsp;
than that with the money. Saebyeok innocently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.720
claims she wants to visit Jeju island, to which&nbsp;
Jiyeong offers to go together. They realise that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.960
it cannot happen because one of them will die&nbsp;
today. Jiyeong then reveals that she killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:23.120
her abusive father and went to prison. She has no&nbsp;
motive to live for even if she wins the money.
&nbsp;

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:28.240
In the meantime, Ilnam and Gi-hun start the&nbsp;
game, and Ilnam wins five of Gi-hun’s marbles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.520
in just the first round. As they go on, Gi-hun is&nbsp;
left with only one marble. He nervously guesses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:39.520
odd for the number of marbles inside Ilnam’s fist,&nbsp;
only for it to be even. Gi-hun loses the game;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.000
however, Ilnam forgets what Gi-hun had&nbsp;
predicted, allowing him to change his answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.880
Starting that round, Gi-hun uses Ilnam’s&nbsp;
dementia to win every round. At last,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.840
Ilnam only has one marble left, but he starts&nbsp;
looking for his house again instead of playing.
&nbsp;

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.760
Similarly, Deoksu also wins the game against one&nbsp;
of his minions when his marble accidentally falls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.640
into the pit. Now only three minutes of the game&nbsp;
are left. Jiyeong and Saebyeok decide to throw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.920
one marble to the wall, the one who throws the&nbsp;
closest will win. Saebyeok goes first and does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.560
pretty well. But when it is Jiyeong’s turn,&nbsp;
she drops the marble on the ground lazily,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.000
making Saebyeok win. Saebyeok corners her and&nbsp;
asks her to go again because it isn’t fair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.600
However, Jiyeong claims she has nothing to live&nbsp;
for, unlike her. They say their last goodbyes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.040
before a staff member shoots Jiyeong dead.
Ali, on the other hand, goes looking for Sangwoo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.880
because only a few minutes of the game are&nbsp;
left. But when he checks his bag of marbles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.320
he realises that his brother-like friend has&nbsp;
betrayed him. Sangwoo had exchanged Ali’s marbles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.680
with pebbles. Ali sheds the last tear, still&nbsp;
in disbelief, before a guard shoots him dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:50.320
Now, only Ilnam and Gi-hun are left. They have to&nbsp;
play one last game for Gi-hun to win. But Ilnam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:56.080
suggests they bet all their marbles for the last&nbsp;
game. Gi-hun is enraged, claiming that it isn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.200
fair. To Gi-hun’s surprise, Ilam reveals that he&nbsp;
knows Gi-hun has been cheating on him. The old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:07.360
man had faked having dementia to make Gi-hun win.&nbsp;
At last, Ilnam happily hands his last marble to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.560
Gi-hun and thanks him for playing with him. Gi-hun&nbsp;
hugs his friend for the last time and walks out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:18.880
the house sobbing. The episode ends as a gunshot&nbsp;
startles him, indicating that Ilnam has been killed.
