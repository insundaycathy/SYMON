00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.720
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain a Horror film called "Devil's Gate."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.960
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.200
Somewhere in North Dakota, Pearce Bacca is driving&nbsp;
along a desolate road when his car suddenly breaks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.520
down. He tries to call for help using his&nbsp;
cellphone, but the device wouldn't turn on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.120
Having no other options, Pearce approaches&nbsp;
an old farm nearby and steps through the gate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.600
despite the "No Trespassing" sign. He knocks on&nbsp;
the door and asks for help, but no one answers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.600
so he looks around for any signs of the owner.&nbsp;
Soon, he hears a man yelling at someone in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.280
basement, so he looks through the window.&nbsp;
He staggers back when he sees the man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.440
causing him to step into a trap hidden beneath the&nbsp;
ground. He manages to break free from the trap,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.880
but as he walks away, he gets caught in&nbsp;
another device that kills him almost instantly.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.040
Days later, F.B.I. agent Daria Francis arrives&nbsp;
in a town called Devil's Gate to investigate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.720
the disappearance of a woman and her son. Deputy&nbsp;
Conrad' Colt' Salter fetches her from the airport&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.840
and takes her to the police station to meet&nbsp;
Sheriff Gruenwell. |At the farm, Jackson Pritchard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.960
discovers Pearce's dead body in the booby trap,&nbsp;
so he wraps it in a white sheet and buries it.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.840
The sheriff soon arrives at the station and&nbsp;
introduces himself to agent Francis. As soon as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.840
they enter the sheriff's office, Gruenwell gives&nbsp;
Francis the files for the case of Maria Pritchard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.000
and her son, Jonah. Francis says she&nbsp;
wants to talk to Maria's husband, Jackson,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.160
but Gruenwell says he and Colt already went to the&nbsp;
farm three days ago and found nothing suspicious.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.960
Francis finds it odd that Jackson didn't report&nbsp;
that his wife and son were missing. Gruenwell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.400
explains that Maria and Jonah were on their way to&nbsp;
visit Maria's sister, Theresa. So Theresa was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.320
first one to notice that her sister and nephew&nbsp;
were missing. Gruenwell notes that Jackson has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.240
a temper, but he assures Francis that he's&nbsp;
not the type to kill his wife and son. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.080
F.B.I. agent argues that domestic partners tend&nbsp;
to be the perpetrators in almost half the cases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.160
of murdered women. Gruenwell believes that it's&nbsp;
more likely that Maria got tired of Jackson and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.240
ran off with her son, but Francis thinks that it's&nbsp;
suspicious that Maria didn't inform her sister.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.560
Gruenwell gets irritated by Francis' lack of&nbsp;
confidence in the local police department's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.320
ability to investigate the case properly.&nbsp;
So he points out that Francis herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.120
had failures of her own when she was&nbsp;
assigned to find a girl named Breeland.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.920
Francis defends herself, saying she found&nbsp;
the girl despite how the case turned out.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.160
The sheriff asks Colt to take Francis to Theresa's&nbsp;
house so she can ask her questions directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.280
On the way, Colt asks Francis what&nbsp;
happened to the Breeland case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.040
Francis tells him that she was assigned to find&nbsp;
17-year-old Tanya Breeland about a year ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.400
After months of searching, Francis&nbsp;
found her at a homeless shelter run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.080
by an Islamist group in St. Paul, but&nbsp;
Breeland didn't want to go home. Psych&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.160
Evaluation indicated that she is normal and&nbsp;
there were no traces of drugs in her system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.880
Despite Breeland's objections, Francis still&nbsp;
took her home. A few days later, Breeland went to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.360
Francis' office and took her own life by stabbing&nbsp;
herself in the neck with a shard of glass. Francis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.800
regrets that she was more focused on solving&nbsp;
the case than making sure that Breeland is safe.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.240
When they reach Theresa's house, Francis asks&nbsp;
Theresa if Maria and Jonah visit her regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.280
She says that their visits are not regular,&nbsp;
but they stop by when they felt like they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.200
needed to get away from the farm. Theresa&nbsp;
notes that Maria is often stressed because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.320
the farm has not been earning money for a&nbsp;
while, and the house has been falling apart.&nbsp;

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.120
When Francis asks Theresa whether Jackson could be&nbsp;
one of the reasons that Maria is stressed, Therese&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.960
notes that Jackson has been in the county lock up&nbsp;
more than once. Colt points out that he was there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.280
for public intoxication and simple assault.&nbsp;
Theresa explains that Jackson has become very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.760
short-tempered in the last few years. One night,&nbsp;
Jackson locked up Jonah in his room overnight for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.480
spilling some paint on the porch. Jackson wouldn't&nbsp;
let the boy eat or even go to the bathroom. Maria&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.360
was furious because she considers Jonah a miracle&nbsp;
after experiencing multiple miscarriages. Jackson,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.120
a deeply religious man, believes that Jonah&nbsp;
was a reward from God for their faithfulness.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.000
Theresa reveals Jonah liked to stay at her house&nbsp;
because there's a playground nearby. She also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.600
made a little room for the boy in the closet&nbsp;
because it made him feel safer to sleep there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.920
When Francis takes a look at the room, she finds&nbsp;
Jonah's sketchbook full of his scribblings. While&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.160
she's looking through the drawings, Theresa's&nbsp;
mother barges in, saying Jackson is a monster.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.680
She warns Francis that the souls of Jonah and&nbsp;
Maria would never rest if they die on the farm.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.240
When they go back to the car, Francis tells Colt&nbsp;
that they have to go to the farm and interrogate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.720
Jackson. Colt suggests looking for Maria's car&nbsp;
instead, but Francis says Jackson might already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.040
be doing terrible things to his wife and son. Colt&nbsp;
surmises that Jackson wouldn't hurt Jonah because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.520
the boy is still his son. Francis reminds him&nbsp;
about what Theresa said about Jackson's temper and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.520
shows Colt Jonah's drawing of a woman and child&nbsp;
in tears while a man stares at them menacingly.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.120
Colt agrees to visit Jackson and tells Francis&nbsp;
that they have to contact the station to inform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.040
them that they're going to the farm. Francis,&nbsp;
however, tells him that the sheriff will only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.640
prevent them from going there, so they go&nbsp;
on their way without notifying the station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.560
When they arrive at the farm, Francis notices&nbsp;
Pearce's car and wonders why anyone would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.680
leave their vehicle on the side of the road&nbsp;
without taking the keys and locking the doors.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.280
Inside the house, Jackson&nbsp;
suddenly hears his dog, Earl,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.800
barking, suggesting that someone has&nbsp;
arrived. Outside, Francis notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.320
that all the windows are boarded up, and the&nbsp;
picket fences are covered with barbed wire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.680
Colt tells the agent that the place didn't look&nbsp;
that creepy when they visited three days ago.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.240
After checking their C.B. radio, Colt&nbsp;
and Francis split up to look for Jackson.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.240
Francis goes inside the barn and finds&nbsp;
Maria's car inside. Jackson soon arrives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.920
and points a shotgun at Francis, saying&nbsp;
she made a mistake coming to the farm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.120
He takes Francis outside and tells her and&nbsp;
Colt to leave his property immediately.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.120
Colt tries to calm him down and warns him&nbsp;
that Gruenwell will be sending more cops to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.680
the premises if he shoots them. While Colt tries&nbsp;
to pacify Jackson, Francis swiftly turns around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.920
and hits Jackson in the face as she grabs his&nbsp;
gun. Colt cuffs Jackson while Francis asks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.320
about the disappearance of his family. Jackson&nbsp;
assures her that they are not on the farm. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.400
suddenly hear a noise coming from the house,&nbsp;
so Francis decides to go in and investigate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.000
Jackson warns her not to go inside, saying&nbsp;
he will not be responsible for what happens.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.160
When she reaches the porch, she notices&nbsp;
a tripwire connected to a crossbow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.240
so she steps over it. While looking around the&nbsp;
house, she sees Jackson's cache of weapons on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.080
a table near the door to the basement. She&nbsp;
hears Earl repeatedly barking downstairs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.400
so she goes down to the basement&nbsp;
to see what's bothering the dog.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.880
As Francis walks down the stairs, the&nbsp;
dog just keeps barking and ignores her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.280
A loud boom suddenly reverberates across the&nbsp;
sky, causing the power at the farm to go out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.440
Jackson, agitated by the noise, tells Colt to&nbsp;
call Francis and ask her to get out of the house.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.320
After lighting a lamp, Francis soon comes across&nbsp;
a cage and sees a lump of jelly-like substance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.880
inside the cell. When she uses a wooden staff&nbsp;
to pierce it open, tentacles suddenly emerge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.600
trying to grab the wood. On the next cell, she&nbsp;
sees an otherworldly creature facing the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.480
As she looks at it in shock, the&nbsp;
creature turns towards her and growls.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.040
Francis gets out of the house and asks Jackson&nbsp;
to explain what she found in the basement. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.280
suspects that Jackson has been experimenting with&nbsp;
the livestock, but he tells her that it's a demon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.960
Jackson explains that another creature like the&nbsp;
one in the basement had taken his wife and son.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.560
Now, he wants to use the creature in his&nbsp;
house as leverage to get his family back.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.200
When Francis asks about the&nbsp;
jelly-like material in the cage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.400
Jackson says that the creature was&nbsp;
wearing it like a suit to cover its body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.640
Jackson refuses to say anything when Francis&nbsp;
asked him how he managed to capture the creature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.720
As Colt puts Jackson inside the car, they&nbsp;
notice that their phones have stopped working.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.640
As the sky begins to darken, they soon find out&nbsp;
that none of the vehicles at the farm are working.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.440
Soon, clouds start to form a circle in the&nbsp;
sky as multiple lightning bolts hit the farm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.520
When lightning strikes the vehicle, Francis&nbsp;
tells Colt to run to the front door of the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.200
On his way to the door, Colt trips the wire on&nbsp;
the porch and gets hit in the leg by an arrow.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.720
When they get inside, Francis says&nbsp;
she'll take a walk to find help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.920
but Jackson tells her that the&nbsp;
nearest farm is 13 miles away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.640
Jackson warns her that the creatures&nbsp;
won't probably let them leave anyway.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.800
Colt says that the sheriff will come looking for&nbsp;
them, but Francis notes that they didn't tell the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.320
station where they were going. Francis tells&nbsp;
Colt that she thought she saw something where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.560
the lightning hit the ground. Jackson suddenly&nbsp;
hears Earl barking and looks out the window.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.080
He tells Francis that Maria is out there on&nbsp;
the exact spot where the lightning bolt struck.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.000
Francis takes Jackson outside to&nbsp;
see if Maria is really out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.160
They soon see Maria lying down on the ground,&nbsp;
so they run toward her and check her vitals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.920
Jackson asks Francis to take off the cuffs&nbsp;
so he can carry Maria back to the house.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.400
Inside, Maria wakes up and asks for Jonah, but&nbsp;
Jackson tells her that the boy is not with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.960
Maria gets agitated, saying&nbsp;
she failed to help her son.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.840
She tells Jackson that it was his&nbsp;
fault that Jonah went missing.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.680
Francis asks Maria if she remembers&nbsp;
anything when Jonah was taken.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.600
Maria tells them that Jackson gave the boy to&nbsp;
the creatures. Maria explains that Jackson's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.240
father believes that the creatures are&nbsp;
angels sent to watch over their house.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.280
Jackson decides to tell Francis what happened&nbsp;
before Maria and Jonah went missing. Maria and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.600
Jonah were supposed to go to Theresa's house,&nbsp;
but the boy suddenly fell ill. Jackson refused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.520
to take him to the doctor and prays for healing&nbsp;
instead. Despite his wife's plea to take the boy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.000
to a hospital, he brings Jonah to the field and&nbsp;
continues praying there. As they pray, lightning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.560
strikes Jonah and lifts him to the sky. Jackson&nbsp;
soon finds out that his wife has also disappeared,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.920
so he ferociously attacks one of the creatures&nbsp;
in the field and takes it inside their house.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.000
Jackson reveals that it wasn't the first&nbsp;
time that he'd encountered the creatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
After his father took his own life, he saw a&nbsp;
beam of light in the field and went inside it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.800
He suddenly found himself elsewhere,&nbsp;
surrounded by the creatures,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.640
but he doesn't remember if&nbsp;
they did anything to him.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.480
When they hear the creature growling in the&nbsp;
cage, Jackson guesses that it's calling out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.080
to the others. Soon, they hear thumping&nbsp;
noise on the floor above them and realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.600
that the creatures are inside. Jackson&nbsp;
asks Francis to take the cuffs off so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.640
he can turn the generator on and activate&nbsp;
the electrified fences around the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.280
While Jackson turns on the generator, Colt&nbsp;
suddenly sees one of the aliens in the woods. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.960
before he could take a closer look, Jackson grabs&nbsp;
him and tells him to get back inside the house.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.120
Maria and Francis suddenly hear someone&nbsp;
approaching the basement. While Francis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.400
waits for it to open the door, the creature&nbsp;
inside the cage reaches out and grabs her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.320
shoulder. When she turns to look at&nbsp;
it, another alien turns up behind her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.400
She shoots the creature several times, but the&nbsp;
light suddenly goes out, and the alien disappears.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.920
Jackson surmises that the creatures&nbsp;
probably won't leave them alone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.280
so he asks Francis to let him retrieve&nbsp;
his shotgun and look for his dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.200
As Jackson calls out to Earl, Colt suddenly&nbsp;
feels something dripping down on his head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.360
When he looks up, he sees the dog lying&nbsp;
lifeless on the roof. Jackson tells Maria&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.480
and Francis to go upstairs and throw anything&nbsp;
against the creatures when they approach.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.320
Jackson asks Colt to help him grab the creature&nbsp;
with a dog control pole. When Colt asks him what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.000
he intends to do with the alien, Jackson tells&nbsp;
him that he only wants retribution for taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.640
his family. He tells Colt that he can either help&nbsp;
him or step aside. After they hook the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.240
with the pole, it starts writhing and shrieking&nbsp;
as Jackson grabs its hand and cuts its finger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.960
with a scissor. Jackson quickly runs outside and&nbsp;
digs a hole in the spot where Maria was taken.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.040
After uncovering a disc with strange symbols, he&nbsp;
puts the alien's finger at the center, showing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.762
them what he did to the creature he captured. Not&nbsp;
long, a bolt of lightning hits the severed digit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.762 --> 00:09:53.280
causing it to disappear. Francis tells Jackson to&nbsp;
set up the traps and get back into the house. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.640
worries that the aliens will retaliate because&nbsp;
of what Jackson did to the one in the basement.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.200
Inside the house, Francis deduces that&nbsp;
the disc must be some kind of a gateway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.160
She points out that the drawings made by&nbsp;
Jonah resemble the patterns on the disc.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.840
Francis believes the aliens are interested&nbsp;
in the boy because he knows what they are.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.040
Francis also notices the symbols&nbsp;
in one of the pictures on the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.200
When Jackson takes a close look at the image,&nbsp;
they see a disc on the back of a pick-up truck.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.480
Colt surmises that Jackson's&nbsp;
father was working with the aliens.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.840
Francis notes that the land doesn't&nbsp;
look like a good place for farming,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.160
so she asks Jackson why they held on to it despite&nbsp;
the lack of profits. Jackson tells them that his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.000
father warned him not to be like Esau, who&nbsp;
sold his birthright because he got hungry.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.200
His father believed that they would someday&nbsp;
reap bountiful harvests from the land because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.600
Jackson's great-great-grandfather&nbsp;
was led to the farm by God.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.400
Francis contends that the key to finding Jonah&nbsp;
is the creature in the cage. They go down to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.640
basement and see that the jelly-like substance&nbsp;
has turned to ashes. Jackson opens the next cell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.880
and grabs the creature to trade it for his son.&nbsp;
But when the alien touches him, he starts seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.680
images of himself being cloned. He learns from the&nbsp;
vision that one of them had died. After Colt pulls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.520
him away from the creature, Jackson realizes that&nbsp;
he was the clone and was left there by the aliens.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.280
Maria confirms to them that Jackson is&nbsp;
no longer the same person she married.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.000
She soon realizes that Jackson also caused&nbsp;
the numerous miscarriages she had in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.280
When they take a look at the fetuses,&nbsp;
they resemble the alien in the cage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.560
Maria discloses that Jackson refused to&nbsp;
give them a proper burial, saying they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.560
were abominations. Francis surmises that&nbsp;
the aliens are trying to replace humans.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.640
Jackson explains that the creatures wanted to&nbsp;
change and adapt to life on earth until they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.320
are able to breed. He reveals that their world&nbsp;
is dying, and they're running out of time to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.080
find a way to reproduce. Jackson says that&nbsp;
Jonah is important to the creatures because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.880
he's the first natural-born. Colt gets infuriated&nbsp;
at Jackson after hearing about the aliens' plans,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.640
so Francis tells him to go upstairs and secure&nbsp;
the area to make sure the creatures can't get in.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.040
Colt argues that their situation is no different&nbsp;
from the white Europeans in Little Bighorn,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.240
where they were surrounded by Native&nbsp;
Americans who eventually scalped them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.280
Francis convinces him to hold the line,&nbsp;
noting that no one else will do it. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.560
Colt gets upstairs, he witnesses one&nbsp;
of the aliens drop down from the sky.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.920
The generator suddenly breaks down,&nbsp;
leaving them without any power.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.880
Francis suggests negotiating with the aliens and&nbsp;
gives them what they want. She tries to convince&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.720
Jackson to help them by telling him that there&nbsp;
still must be some part of Jackson left in him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.840
When she mentions that Jonah still needs&nbsp;
him, Jackson reminds her that the boy is one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.840
of the aliens. Francis argues that they will&nbsp;
never find out unless they retrieve his son.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.920
Upstairs, Colt jams the door with a chair&nbsp;
to prevent the alien from getting inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.000
but the creature eventually breaks it and enters&nbsp;
the house. The creature sees Jackson's weapons and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.920
destroys them. Colt emerges from his hiding&nbsp;
place and shoots the alien with a revolver,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.080
but it has no effect, so he decides to charge&nbsp;
at it. The creature lifts Colt telekinetically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.080
and pins him to the wall. As Colt struggles&nbsp;
to break free, the creature tears him apart.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.320
Jackson asks Francis for a tarp to wrap&nbsp;
the creature, but when she turns her back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.840
Jackson knocks her out. Jackson then wraps&nbsp;
the alien in the tarp and takes it upstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.320
He walks past another creature on his way&nbsp;
out of the house, but it doesn't stop him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.640
The alien approaches Maria in the basement and&nbsp;
touches her womb. When the creature disappears,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:51.040
Maria checks on the fetuses and finds that they're&nbsp;
all gone. When Francis wakes up, Maria tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.960
her that she's scared of what Jackson will do.&nbsp;
Francis promises her that she'll get Jonah back.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.280
Outside the house, the aliens soon release&nbsp;
Jonah after Jackson brings the creature to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.680
the teleportation site. Jackson points a weapon at&nbsp;
Jonah's head, telling him that the bloodline ends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.080
with him. Francis stops him, arguing they can't&nbsp;
be sure that the boy is one of the creatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.720
The terrified boy begs Jackson not to hurt him.&nbsp;
Jackson seems intent on killing his own son,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.040
so Francis shoots Jackson before&nbsp;
he could pull the trigger.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.680
Fearing that Francis will take away Jonah, Maria&nbsp;
points a shotgun at the agent and tells her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.160
drop her firearm. Francis assures Maria that&nbsp;
she has no intention of taking Jonah from her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.480
but Maria refuses to believe her. The alien soon&nbsp;
leaves the farm and destroys the disc on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.560
ground with a huge blast of energy. Francis&nbsp;
gets blown away by the powerful explosion.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.760
In the morning, Gruenwell tells Francis that Maria&nbsp;
has confirmed most of the things in her report.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.440
Gruenwell says that a man-made bomb can&nbsp;
explain the crater left by the explosion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.200
Maria had credited Francis for launching&nbsp;
the assault that set them free from Jackson.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.200
However, Francis insists that she didn't launch&nbsp;
an assault and Jackson didn't hold them hostage.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.280
Gruenwell tells Francis that she may lose&nbsp;
her position at the F.B.I if she mentions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.200
the aliens to others. He reminds her that there is&nbsp;
no evidence to prove that aliens were involved in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.120
the incident the previous night. Francis tells&nbsp;
him to check the basement for D.N.A., but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.360
sheriff argues that there is not enough manpower&nbsp;
to conduct further investigations on the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.640
He tells Francis that her initial&nbsp;
suspicions about Jackson were correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.240
Gruenwell advises her to forget about the&nbsp;
aliens because she might end up in the asylum.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.560
A few days after the incident, Mary wakes up&nbsp;
and finds that Jonah is nowhere to be found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.800
in the house. She goes to the barn and finds&nbsp;
him opening the floorboards with a crowbar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.480
When she asks him what he's doing, the boy&nbsp;
tells her that it's time for the harvest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.840
When she looks at what's underneath the floor,&nbsp;
she sees numerous teleportation discs lined up.
