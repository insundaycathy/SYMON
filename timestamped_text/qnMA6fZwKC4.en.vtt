00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.979
If a meteor filled with giant, armored, sound-seeking
predators landed in your neighborhood, what

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:06.979
would you do?

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:10.940
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
the Abbotts, see if we can make better decisions,

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.040
and ultimately attempt to beat the Death Angels
for the second time in, A Quiet Place 2.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.240
If you think you could do better, leave a
comment letting me know how.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.359
If you enjoy watching me berate the townsfolk
for running down the street screaming while

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:34.750
under attack by aliens, go ahead and hit those
like and 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:01:01.670
subscribe buttons.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:28.200
We 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.610
start out following Lee Abbott getting some
oranges for the ballgame the day the apocalypse

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.610
started.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.979
When Lee’s son gets up to bat, a giant meteor
starts plowing through Earth’s atmosphere.This

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.729
must have been what the dinosaurs felt like
watching their impending doom descend from

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.729
the heavens.

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.630
The Abbotts race home, which is about the
best thing you could do without any information.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.470
The meteor impact could send shock waves,
earthquakes and walls of fire your way.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.440
They need to hide under a table in their basement
with some snacks until the initial effects

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.340
blow through, or they’re vaporized and their
dust is violently ejected into outer space.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.880
Before Lee can make it to his truck, all hell
breaks loose.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.840
John panic signs to his deaf daughter that
shit hit the fan and they need to get the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.870
hell out of there.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.070
Evelyn gets attacked and pulls a high speed
reverse 180 into a light pole to get away

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.240
from the monster.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.330
Regan sees the crash and runs out into the
street after her.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.240
Luckily, she doesn’t get targeted by the
monsters because all the panicky screamers

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.440
are running cover.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.099
Lee grabs her and they dive into a restaurant
where tons of other people are holding out.

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.950
They need to find another hiding spot pronto.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.280
One of these dipshits is going to start crying,
loudly praying to their God, or calling their

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.760
family.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.760
How ironic.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.660
A mother’s call to check on her daughter
was what got her killed.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.880
Lee and Regan run for someplace that isn’t
being attacked by giant aliens.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.530
They get tailed by one of them, but before
they get pimp-smacked across the street the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.020
town cop hits it with the pump.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.680
Someone had to learn the hard way that guns
don’t work well.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.810
The beginning of any apocalypse is the most
crucial time.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.010
You need to observe as much as possible.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.920
These initial moments are key to figuring
out what you’re up against.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.020
Kind of like how Brad Pitt in World War Z
took the time to watch how long it took for

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.050
the infected to turn into zombies.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.280
Lee survived long enough to figure out that
the aliens are too strong to fight, too armored

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.870
to shoot, too fast to outrun, but they’re
blind and have terrible ADHD.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.030
With this knowledge he kept his family hidden
in plain sight.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.720
In the end, it wasn’t enough.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.700
We fast forward 473 days to right after Lee
sacrificed himself for his kids and Regan

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.870
figured out that her cochlear implant can
get the monsters to open up wide enough for

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.080
Evelyn to pop a slug into their suck hole.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.620
The next morning they head over to their burning
barn to assess the damage.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.920
Evelyn hands little Marcus the shotty so he
and Regan can split up to make a sound bomb

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.709
and light the fire signal while she tiptoes
past the hopefully fully dead aliens to find

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.550
a carriage for her newborn.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.170
Right after Evelyn headshotted the monster
at the end of the first movie, they had looked

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.350
at their camera monitors and saw a couple
more coming towards them in a dead sprint.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.030
Regan upped the bass and Evelyn racked the
shotty like she was the Doom Slayer.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.239
I’m confused.

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.031
Did they already mow these monsters down too,
or did they just decide to split up for a

00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:22.620
scavenger hunt as they were being descended
upon?

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.040
We don’t know what Regan saw when her dad
was mauled.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.949
Maybe his head was lopped off and flew through
the air, maybe it just looked bad but he only

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.650
suffered a flesh wound and got knocked unconscious.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.160
Depending on what she saw, it might be worth
checking a pulse.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.580
As for not burying him, totally understandable.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.470
You don’t want your final memory of your
dad to be a pile of unidentifiable meat.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.010
The remaining members of the Abbott family
decide they need help and can’t stay here

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.740
any longer, so they head in the direction
of the sole surviving fire signal.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.770
There’s no warm welcome when they arrive.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.160
It is a year and a half after the meteor impacts.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.520
Looters and bandits are a danger that any
group of survivors will need to defend against.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:09.530
I don’t understand the tactic of loudly
sprinting to get away from the noise you just

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.530
made.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.870
You’re just creating a more constant source
of noise.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.910
You also have no idea which direction the
monsters could be in.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.940
They could easily be running towards a monster.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.520
There have been numerous occasions where a
monster has been within inches of them and

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.000
wasn’t able to detect them.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.210
A bit unrealistic given their auditory capabilities,
but that’s what the movie is saying.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.130
The better strategy is to just continue cat-walking
away from the location the noise was made.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.620
If a monster does intercept you, a suggestion
from my last video on A Quiet Place 1 was

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.800
to bring lures that you can throw to create
a secondary source of noise some distance

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.860
away from you.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.729
Aimlessly running after setting off a trap
is also a bad idea, because there could be

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:54.650
more traps.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.050
So much for staying quiet.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.949
I’m a firm proponent of running it stealth
first, but always having the firepower in

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:04.550
your backpack for when you inevitably fuck
up and need to go loud.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.853
Regan and Evelyn know what’s up.

00:06:07.853 --> 00:06:10.539
Evelyn should have had that shotgun pre-racked
with a shell in the breach.

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:14.210
You don’t want to short-stroke it under
stress and have the trigger go click when

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.570
you need it to go boom.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.110
She unlocks the bear trap and gets him up
and running again because nobody learned their

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.110
lesson.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.860
I know it would turn this movie into a comedy,
but it’d be fucking hilarious if Marcus

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.300
stepped on another bear trap with his other
foot.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.650
A man intercepts them and guides them through
the steel foundry and into a soundproof furnace.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.729
It’s Emmett.

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.210
He pleads that he can’t help them and that
they can’t stay.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.120
That there’s not enough food, water, or
anything.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.780
Easy to turn away young strong adults, not
so easy to turn away a helpless baby.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.740
His stopwatch beeps again after setting it
when they entered the container, signaling

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.820
that their oxygen is running out.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.550
Emmett hands Evelyn some hard alcohol to disinfect
Marcus' leg before wrapping and splinting

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.910
it.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:07:01.190
I know there’s three feet of concrete above
them and he’s in the furnace, but maybe

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.530
give him something to bite down on first.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.410
Not being able to run isn’t too terrible
in this flavor of the apocalypse.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:12.130
He needs to sit the next few expeditions out
and make damn sure his leg doesn’t get infected

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.010
or he’s going to suffer a slow painful death.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.389
Regan tries to soothe Marcus’s pain with
some easy-listening from her boombox.

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:22.340
Which is a total misuse of the limited power
they have.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.950
The speaker is the only reason they are alive.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.990
Without it, the shotgun is near-useless and
they are as good as dead.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.470
Emmett asks Evelyn how the speaker works.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.400
She says she has no clue.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.199
It might be a good idea to start figuring
it out and finding a way to broadcast what’s

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:40.419
essentially the only reliable strategy survivors
can use to fight back.

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:45.430
The radio starts playing a song called Beyond
the Sea, a clear indication there are other

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.430
survivors.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.020
Emmett says he’s heard it before, but isn’t
interested in saving whoever is left alive.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.729
Not after the atrocities he’s seen survivors
commit on one another.

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:56.410
In fact, he says he wants them gone the next
morning.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.580
Dude, can you atleast give Marcus a day’s
rest after he stepped on your bear trap?

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.030
And if you didn’t want company why did you
light the fire signal.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.430
Regan pulls Marcus into the furnace to tell
him her grand plan.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.009
She thinks that the song is a signal directing
them to the islands off the coast.

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:14.580
It’d be a one day walk and she could follow
the railroad tracks to it.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.460
She’s planning on going alone since Marcus
can’t walk and Evelyn needs to monitor his

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.000
wounds and take care of the baby.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.580
This is a mistake.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.690
The song could very well be leading her into
a trap, she’s not capable enough to use

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.570
the shotgun effectively, and she’s deaf
so she won’t be able to hear monsters or

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.190
scavs sneaking up on her.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.169
There’s no reason to rush into this.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:37.110
Evelyn should be able to convince Emmett to
let them stay until Marcus heals up well enough

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.169
to walk, or they could go home and Marcus
could heal up there.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:43.459
Then, they could all leave for the coast together
since there isn’t anything for them at the

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:44.459
foundry.

00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:49.059
Evelyn’s good with the shotgun, Regan’s
good with the implant boombox, and Marcus

00:08:49.059 --> 00:08:50.879
can watch their backs or something.

00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:52.850
Emmett could also be convinced to join.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.129
There’s legitimately nothing here for him
either.

00:08:55.129 --> 00:08:57.489
He has nothing to lose at this point.

00:08:57.489 --> 00:09:01.569
Regan knows Evelyn would never allow her to
go alone, and doesn’t consider the alternative

00:09:01.569 --> 00:09:06.130
option of staying until Marcus can walk, so
she sneaks out before everyone wakes up the

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.130
next morning.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.300
When Evelyn finds out, she convinces Emmett
to go out searching for her.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.259
Shouldn’t be too hard if Marcus let them
know she was following the railroad tracks

00:09:14.259 --> 00:09:15.420
the whole way there.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.519
Regan finds a train car and pops in to take
a look-see.

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:20.199
Nothing but rotting corpses.

00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:21.839
This was a total massacre.

00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:25.420
She does find a first aid kit that will be
useful for Marcus’s leg.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.029
When she goes to grab it, what was left of
the conductor slumps onto her causing her

00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:30.589
to have a mini freakout.

00:09:30.589 --> 00:09:34.530
She doesn’t realize how loud she squeaked,
nor is she able to hear the sound of the alien

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:42.010
stalking her from the other side of the train
car until it’s right on top of her.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:48.860
She’s good with the radio, not so much with
the shotgun.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.839
She should have put the radio down after turning
it on so she could two hand the shotgun.

00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:56.990
Still, without any training, and being too
weak to properly handle that large of a gun,

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.160
she was bound to miss.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.190
I’m surprised she even got the shot off.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:04.639
Evelyn had kept it with an empty chamber before,
and had she put the safety back on, Regan

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:07.929
might not have been able to switch it off,
load and fire it in time.

00:10:07.929 --> 00:10:11.769
People totally underestimate the skill needed
to be effective with a firearm, they think

00:10:11.769 --> 00:10:15.439
you can point it in the general direction
of a bad thing, pull the trigger, and whatever’s

00:10:15.439 --> 00:10:17.410
on the smoking side of the barrel gets deleted.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.939
A long barreled shotgun at that distance is
going to have a quarter size group, so there’s

00:10:21.939 --> 00:10:24.149
not enough spread to make up for shitty accuracy.

00:10:24.149 --> 00:10:30.779
Regan’s unable to rack the pump action in
time and kisses her own ass goodbye.

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:36.510
Yah, maybe the whole lone wolf thing wasn’t
such a good idea.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:40.480
They duck into the train station and he tries
to tell her that he’s taking her home.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.749
Except he forgot that she was deaf and can’t
understand a thing he’s saying.

00:10:43.749 --> 00:10:46.779
Emmett should have brought a pencil and notepad
he could use to write her messages.

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:48.790
A notepad should be standard equipment.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.929
It’s such a good way to communicate silently,
with deaf people, and over distances.

00:10:52.929 --> 00:10:55.699
It’s pretty obvious that he’s here to
take her back though.

00:10:55.699 --> 00:10:59.019
Regan convinces him to help her bring the
radio gun to the islands.

00:10:59.019 --> 00:11:01.490
Honestly, you guys are already pretty far
down the road.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.209
You might as well go all the way.

00:11:03.209 --> 00:11:06.970
Once you get there, you can use their radio
to let Evelyn know you made it so she doesn’t

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.799
have a meltdown and do something stupid.

00:11:08.799 --> 00:11:11.339
Emmett and Regan wait until the next morning
to head for the coast.

00:11:11.339 --> 00:11:13.899
It’s a good idea to only travel during daylight.

00:11:13.899 --> 00:11:18.139
You’re much less likely to step on a tree
branch or trip on something and make noise,

00:11:18.139 --> 00:11:21.299
and other wildlife will be active which will
provide some distraction.

00:11:21.299 --> 00:11:26.010
Meanwhile, Evelyn heads back home to gather
the medical supplies necessary to treat Marcus’s

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.910
wounds, which she should have brought with
her or picked up along the way in the first

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:30.910
place.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.369
She also finds two spare compressed air tanks
in the back.

00:11:33.369 --> 00:11:35.449
How lucky and convenient.

00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:37.519
Marcus is left to tend to the baby.

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:40.579
Compressed oxygen is hard to come by, so I
don’t get why they’re wasting it when

00:11:40.579 --> 00:11:43.879
the baby isn’t crying and doesn’t need
to be in the enclosed basket.

00:11:43.879 --> 00:11:48.449
Like Emmett said, there is 3 feet of concrete
above them which will muffle most noises.

00:11:48.449 --> 00:11:52.459
Which doesn't matter at all if you’re an
idiot that decides to go explore the foundry

00:11:52.459 --> 00:11:55.819
at night with an injured leg while your baby
is left alone in the basement.

00:11:55.819 --> 00:12:00.100
What the fuck is this kid thinking?

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:05.549
Bro, you just walked past 10 hanging corpses.

00:12:05.549 --> 00:12:08.920
Why are you all the sudden getting uncontrollably
freaked out by dead bodies?

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.959
If you were that much of a bitch, you shouldn’t
have even left the basement to begin with.

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:14.740
Now a monster’s on your ass.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.100
He grabs the baby and radio and shuts himself
inside the air tight furnace.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.579
That’s about the only thing he could do
at this point.

00:12:20.579 --> 00:12:24.980
He does only have a few minutes of air inside
it, so he’ll need to slow his HR and breathing

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.239
or siphon some of that O2 off.

00:12:27.239 --> 00:12:30.240
Bad news though, it’s nearly empty after
wasting it all earlier.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.329
And you blew through all the oxygen in the
container far more rapidly by having your

00:12:34.329 --> 00:12:35.329
lighter on.

00:12:35.329 --> 00:12:36.329
Good going.

00:12:36.329 --> 00:12:40.189
You know you have limited oxygen, it’s not
necessary to see anything right now, why would

00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:41.850
you turn your lighter on.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:46.079
Marcus’s dumb decisions lead to him having
to choose between being slaughtered by aliens

00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:47.899
or carbon dioxide poisoning.

00:12:47.899 --> 00:12:50.260
I’d choose carbon dioxide poisoning.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.649
You just get really light headed and sleepy,
then once you pass out, you just don’t wake

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:55.649
up.

00:12:55.649 --> 00:12:56.649
Not a bad way to go.

00:12:56.649 --> 00:13:00.529
Marcus chooses death by alien claws, except
he can’t get the furnace unlocked with his

00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:04.350
noodle arms and starts hyperventilating, which
is the worst thing you could possibly do in

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.410
that situation.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.230
Evelyn should be back soon and can help.

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.100
He just needs to chill so he doesn’t suffocate
before then.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.720
Evelyn hears the foundry crucible crash and
immediately knows something is horribly wrong.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.639
She hurries inside, places one of her precious
compressed air cans in the middle of an oil

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:26.670
pit, fires a shot off to draw the creature
into it, and a second shot to ignite the mix.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.079
Well that didn’t work.

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:31.839
Firstly, the shot would be louder than the
ricochet, so the monster would have killed

00:13:31.839 --> 00:13:32.839
her.

00:13:32.839 --> 00:13:36.179
Second, these things rode a meteor through
the flaming atmosphere and crashed into the

00:13:36.179 --> 00:13:37.679
planet.

00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:41.759
The alien will be able to seal it’s armor
up before it gets burned.

00:13:41.759 --> 00:13:46.089
The only way to put them down is to fire a
projectile into their exposed fleshy innards

00:13:46.089 --> 00:13:47.980
before they can seal their armor.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.689
She should have kept the ammo and thrown some
scrap metal across the foundry.

00:13:52.689 --> 00:13:56.609
The fire sets off the sprinklers which also
does the trick of covering her sound while

00:13:56.609 --> 00:14:05.009
she sneaks downstairs to the furnace where
her children are inevitably hiding and dying.

00:14:05.009 --> 00:14:09.459
How about shut the door behind you before
yelling and shaking Marcus back to life..

00:14:09.459 --> 00:14:13.739
I guess you’d want some airflow for Marcus
first, but the monster is right behind you

00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:16.459
and you do have a spare air tank you can hook
him up to.

00:14:16.459 --> 00:14:20.129
While all this is going down, Emmett and Regan
are just reaching the coast.

00:14:20.129 --> 00:14:23.660
When they get to the dock there’s a little
girl kneeling down by some fishing line.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.220
That’s a red flag if I ever saw one.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:30.959
No child is going to be out at night by themselves
unsupervised unless they’re bait for a trap

00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:33.889
Emmett and Regan need to back out now if they
still can.

00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:37.540
To be honest, they should have scouted this
area for a while before walking in.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.309
Broadcasts to survivors in the apocalypse
are always suspect.

00:14:41.309 --> 00:14:46.079
Walking in without doing some recon first
is asking to become food for the local cannibals.

00:14:46.079 --> 00:14:51.019
Emmett sets his rifle down and tries to help
the little girl, who then slips a noose around

00:14:51.019 --> 00:14:52.959
his neck and runs off with his gun.

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:57.299
How did he get overpowered by a little girl,
why did he let her go after she roped him.

00:14:57.299 --> 00:15:00.899
He should have immediately grabbed her and
prevented her from taking her gun.

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:04.290
Even though Regan’s trash with the shotgun,
she should have had it up and at the ready.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.509
Emmett’s tied up in some fish net with rattling
cans attached to it.

00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:10.269
If he tries to make a move, monsters will
be all over him.

00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:12.160
It’s not looking too good for Regan either.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:30.680
Emmett tells her to dive because he’s about
to make some noise.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.429
What was the point of the fishnet and rope
if it didn’t restrict his movement at all.

00:15:34.429 --> 00:15:38.549
The leader of the looters should have kicked
Emmett into the water or outright killed him

00:15:38.549 --> 00:15:40.290
with a knife before turning his back.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:44.249
It’s a no-brainer that Emmett would make
a ton of noise to attract monsters which would

00:15:44.249 --> 00:15:47.670
attack the looters in a last ditch move to
save himself and Regan.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.199
Jumping into the water is also a no brainer
move.

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:51.610
These things can’t swim for shit.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.470
They are too dense, their armor is too heavy,
and they can’t use their hearing to navigate

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.669
well underwater.

00:15:56.669 --> 00:16:03.290
It didn’t make sense for the Abbotts to
leave for an island because they needed to

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.629
stay at the farm and grow their own food.

00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:08.079
Without food, the safety of the island means
nothing.

00:16:08.079 --> 00:16:11.439
When Regan picks Emmett up in a paddle boat,
he spits out her cochlear implant he snagged

00:16:11.439 --> 00:16:14.180
off the scav before shiving him.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.180
Clutch move.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:21.220
It would have been easy to forget about it
when they were fighting for their lives.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:25.579
Hopefully those were just opportunists intercepting
travelers and not the ones broadcasting the

00:16:25.579 --> 00:16:26.579
signal.

00:16:26.579 --> 00:16:30.089
It’d be best to scout out the island before
beaching this time, especially since you lost

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:31.089
your guns.

00:16:31.089 --> 00:16:33.670
They stumble into a community cookout and
bonfire.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.939
Which can’t seem real after what they’d
been through.

00:16:35.939 --> 00:16:40.160
It’s pretty crazy to me that nobody on the
island was watching the coast or had any defensive

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.470
measures for unwanted visitors.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:42.999
There was a freaking raiding party just along
the docks which could have ransacked their

00:16:42.999 --> 00:16:44.160
precious island.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.139
Emmett hands the cochlear implant to the island
man and tells him that if they can broadcast

00:16:48.139 --> 00:16:52.310
it’s frequency, other survivors can tune
in with their radios and use it to fight the

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.310
monsters.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:56.079
Regan and Emmett finally get to sit down,
take a deep breath, and let all the grief

00:16:56.079 --> 00:16:58.689
and sadness of their loved ones crash into
them.

00:16:58.689 --> 00:17:00.389
It doesn’t last long though.

00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:03.889
When Emmett goes out for a walk on the beach,
he discovers the boat that the monster was

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:05.529
ripping into the night before.

00:17:05.529 --> 00:17:08.540
There was nothing that the islanders could
have done to stop something like this from

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.540
happening.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:15.209
Emmett does his best to warn everyone, but
it’s too late.

00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:21.420
Djimon, Regan, and Emmett hop into the caddy
and haul ass to the broadcasting studio while

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.420
honking.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.529
I question trying to bait the monster with
your car.

00:17:24.529 --> 00:17:28.820
It’s too risky and if you guys die, nobody
will be able to set up the sound interference

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.630
which means everyone is doomed anyways.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:38.730
Djimon gets too hung up on baiting the monster
out of town and gets himself killed.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:42.500
I guess that’s the danger of being in a
safe zone for too long.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.179
You relax and forget what you need to do to
survive.

00:17:45.179 --> 00:17:51.380
Regan and Emmett sneak past the alien and
just as it catches on to them, Regan turns

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.370
up the bass.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:59.029
Evelyn and Marcus are under siege as well,
but now that they are armed with a radio tuned

00:17:59.029 --> 00:18:05.060
to Regan’s implant’s frequency, they can
fight back.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:11.960
The movie ends with the tides of war changing
in the humans favor.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.909
While nobody of importance was killed this
time around, the Abbott’s were sloppy.

00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:19.440
Everything from splitting up for no reason
multiple times, to the deaf Regan running

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.940
off on her own, Emmett not scouting the docks
out first, Evelyn forgetting medication along

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.440
the way, Marcus leaving the baby to explore
the foundry with a injured leg by himself,

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.710
to the islanders being incredibly nonchalant
about watching the coast.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.679
It’s sheer luck that none of them died.

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:37.039
All said and done, I think we could or could
not have beat the DEATH ANGELS from A QUIET

00:18:37.039 --> 00:18:39.080
PLACE PART 2 with less risk taken.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:44.120
Thanks for watching, and remember, if sound-seeking
aliens are trying to kill you, avoid the urge

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.570
to loudly run from them.
