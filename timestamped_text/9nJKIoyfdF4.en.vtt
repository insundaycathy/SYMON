00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.570
The film opens with Michael Bryce arriving
at the Triple A Bodyguard Awards, something

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.420
he has been looking forward to for a long
time.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.119
As he accepts his award, he finds none other
than Darius Kincaid cackling at him.

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.170
Bryce realizes he is in a nightmare, as he
sees his doomed client Kurosawa talking to

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:34.440
him before Darius once again blows his brains
out before going for Bryce.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.460
Bryce is in therapy talking about this recurring
nightmare, still in despair over not being

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.700
a bodyguard anymore.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.860
The therapist (Rebecca Front) tries to convince
him that he doesn’t need to be a bodyguard

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.410
to feel fulfilled, and she encourages him
to take a sabbatical.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.530
Bryce reluctantly agrees.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.290
At a meeting of the European Nation, the head
of the EU announces that they will impose

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.780
more sanctions on Greece.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.150
The man’s bodyguards are killed, and he
is taken hostage to Athens, where riots are

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.270
already taking place in the streets.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.680
He is confronted by criminal boss Aristotle
Papadopolous.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.370
Aristotle announces his plans to bring all
of Europe down as soon as the sanctions go

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:32.310
into effect, and he has his men suffocate
the EU head with a plastic bag.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.049
Bryce is at a resort trying to take the sabbatical
seriously.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:48.130
This is 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:58.100
quickly ruined by Sonia Kincaid, who pulls
Bryce away as gunmen storm the resort.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.259
Sonia shoots some of them down as she explains
to Bryce that Kincaid has been taken by the

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:12.890
mob, and that he specifically requested Bryce’s
help.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:29.250
They get away on a motorcycle, shooting more
bad guys before finally making their getaway.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:45.390
Aristotle’s minions Magnusson and Veronika
meet with weapons dealers in Croatia as they

00:02:45.390 --> 00:03:00.540
present to them a device that Aristotle has
had his eye on.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.960
After activating it, the power grid in the
area is blown out, causing chaos across the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.870
city and causing multiple fatalities.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.950
Aristotle is impressed with the weapon and
then orders Magnusson and Veronika to kill

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.140
the dealers and take the weapon.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.100
The next day, the weapons dealers are found
by an Interpol team.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.720
American agent Bobby O’Neill is met by his
superior Crowley, and O’Neill informs her

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.230
that one of the victims is a known arms dealer.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.940
Crowley orders O’Neill to find the weapon
that the killers took, and O’Neill may return

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.000
home to Boston as he has been wanting.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.830
She also forces him to work with her translator,
Aislo, whom he mocks for her name and Scottish

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.140
accent.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.540
Bryce and Sonia find the mobsters that have
taken Kincaid.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.080
Despite Bryce trying to take a simple approach,
Sonia enters and kills some of the henchmen.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.260
Meanwhile, Kincaid is brought before mob boss
Carlo, who has a grudge against the hitman

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.880
for killing his men.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.010
Sonia soon comes in guns blazing as she kills
more of Carlo’s henchmen, leaving Kincaid

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.449
an opportunity to break free and kill the
remaining men, including Carlo.

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:29.120
Although Kincaid is elated to see Sonia, he
is none too pleased to see Bryce, as he apparently

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:38.590
told Sonia to get help from anybody BUT Bryce.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.800
The former bodyguard is likewise not the least
bit happy to see Kincaid either.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.020
When Kincaid and Sonia appear to prepare to
ditch Bryce, they are both captured, and Bryce

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.080
is tased before getting taken in too.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.050
The three are brought before O’Neill, who
knows who they all are and berates them for

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.439
killing Carlo, since he was an informant who
was going to get O’Neill close to getting

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.330
the mastermind behind the cyber attacks.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.620
O’Neill forces the trio to work for him
and get close to the target by having Sonia

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.759
pose as Carlo’s mistress, and Bryce as her
bodyguard.

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.340
Before going on their mission, Sonia becomes
suspicious about Kincaid since the reason

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.860
he was taken in the first place was because
he left on their honeymoon for what he claims

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.060
is a job he is on.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.849
Sonia attempts to hit Kincaid with their car
but ends up ramming into Bryce and flings

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:35.720
him up into the air.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.180
Kincaid then surprises Sonia with tickets
to see “Carmen” at the opera, and they

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.289
proceed to have a romantic afternoon with
some money given to them by O’Neill that

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.150
is supposed to be for emergencies.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:58.659
All the while, they keep Bryce locked up in
the trunk until he regains consciousness.

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:03.129
He starts to yell at Kincaid and Sonia until
she tells him that they are trying to start

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:08.909
a family.

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:12.319
Bryce lies and says she would make a great
mother.

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:17.229
The trio proceeds to the mission, where Bryce
and Sonia go into a club to meet with their

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:22.300
mark, a man named Vlad, while Kincaid is outside
on sniper duty.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.990
Vlad gives Sonia a briefcase to deliver to
Aristotle, with a bracelet that will explode

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.900
if separated from the briefcase.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.370
Their cover is blown when Bryce’s former
client Seifert shows up high off his ass and

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.590
refers to him by name.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:43.129
Vlad and his guys look Bryce up and mock him
for being a former bodyguard, while Vlad makes

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:53.069
the fatal mistake of calling Sonia old.

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:57.740
She goes ballistic, which leads to her and
Kincaid killing Vlad’s guys in the club

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:13.729
all while trying to keep the briefcase close
so Sonia doesn’t blow up.

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:18.970
After she kills Vlad, one gunman remains,
and Bryce pushes Sonia out of the way while

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.620
taking the buckshot himself.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.870
Sonia kills the gunman and drags Bryce out
to the boat where they escape.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:26.999
O’Neill and Aislo come across agents near
a crime scene.

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:28.699
He creates a diversion to swipe a paper that
details the superweapon that Aristotle has

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:30.509
gotten, which is a massive drill that will
be used to wipe out Europe’s whole power

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:31.509
grid.

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:35.490
Kincaid and Sonia believe Bryce is dead, so
they dump him in the water.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:47.409
He revives soon after and reveals he was wearing
Kevlar.

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:52.800
The three then take the briefcase and locate
Aristotle in Italy as he is making a public

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.129
appearance.

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:59.710
Bryce recognizes Magnusson as a top-ranking
bodyguard, while Kincaid notices Aristotle

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:05.199
has his own hitman, Zento, who has taken some
of Kincaid’s business.

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:10.090
Bryce complains about broken ribs sustained
from the buckshot, so Sonia gives him what

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:20.029
she says are painkillers.

00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:26.400
Magnusson spots the trio and gives Zento the
cue to shoot them.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.779
The trio flee the scene and are pursued by
Magnusson and other gunmen.

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:37.960
Bryce then starts to get woozy because the
pills Sonia gave him were actually lithium.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:43.130
He loses consciousness, so Kincaid and Sonia
drive maniacally through the streets before

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.880
managing to get rid of the gunmen, all while
Bryce is tossed around in the back and bangs

00:08:47.880 --> 00:09:35.310
around several items.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:40.050
After escaping the villains, Bryce snaps at
Kincaid and Sonia for getting him into so

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:44.550
much trouble.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:53.220
He even offends Sonia when he calls her crazy
and says she would be a terrible mother.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:10:09.550
Bryce then asks around for a sign, all of
which seem to convince him to head to Tuscany.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.810
The trio head there to meet his stepfather,
Bryce Senior (Morgan Freeman), who taught

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:19.360
Bryce everything he knows about being a bodyguard
and is a top notch bodyguard himself.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:28.339
Kincaid is surprised that Bryce has a black
father.

00:10:28.339 --> 00:10:36.300
Senior invites the trio to a meal, but things
go bad when he brings out gelato.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.949
After Bryce walks away feeling triggered,
Senior explains to Kincaid and Sonia that

00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:45.990
when Bryce was a child, he was close with
his mother, but while out at a carnival, he

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:51.120
went to get gelato when an obese man fell
from a ride and crashed into his mother, sending

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.910
her flying into a grisly death by hitting
another ride, leaving Bryce to blame himself

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.639
for what happened.

00:10:57.639 --> 00:11:03.120
Sonia goes to talk to Bryce and assumes that
his anger towards her and Kincaid was a parental

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.949
issue, and she forgives him.

00:11:05.949 --> 00:11:12.410
Senior then lets Bryce take his car to complete
their mission.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:17.990
The trio drive away to a safe location, where
they are unfortunately tranquilized and captured

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:27.240
by Aristotle’s minions.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.220
When he confronts them, it is revealed that
he has a history with Sonia, as she was apparently

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:37.100
his lover before she fell off his yacht and
developed amnesia, but really he was just

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:45.670
another man that she conned.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:50.490
Aristotle sends Bryce and Kincaid away to
get tortured while he re acquaint himself

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:56.110
with Sonia and promises to give her a family.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.819
He also takes the device from the briefcase
that will activate the superweapon, and he

00:12:00.819 --> 00:12:04.029
removes the bracelet from Sonia’s wrist.

00:12:04.029 --> 00:12:09.220
Aristotle then claims he knows why Kincaid
was really away during their honeymoon – he

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.360
was at a fertility clinic because Sonia is
apparently barren.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:19.089
Meanwhile, Bryce and Kincaid are interrogated,
but Bryce manages to create a distraction

00:12:19.089 --> 00:12:27.060
to allow them to escape and kill the torturers.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:38.079
After killing more henchmen, Bryce and Kincaid
try to get Sonia, but she appears to turn

00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:41.670
on them and declare that their time together
is over.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:47.509
The two flee from the gunmen and split up.

00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:53.370
Bryce returns to his dad’s home to ask for
help, only to learn that Senior is Aristotle’s

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.260
own bodyguard.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:00.220
Senior berates Bryce and calls him a stain
on his legacy.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:11.079
In retaliation, Bryce destroys his dad’s
car.

00:13:11.079 --> 00:13:16.370
He goes to a bar where Kincaid is drinking
after having started a bar brawl.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:21.379
The bartender then picks up the phone and
tells Kincaid that Sonia is calling, somehow

00:13:21.379 --> 00:13:23.410
having tracked him.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:28.130
She informs him that Aristotle has sent a
kill squad to go after them.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:14:03.879
Gunmen then fire upon the bar, which prompts
Bryce and Kincaid to drive away again.

00:14:03.879 --> 00:14:08.649
They kill and evade more gunmen but crash
their car, with Bryce getting knocked into

00:14:08.649 --> 00:14:27.420
the river by other thugs that Kincaid kills.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:32.060
In the morning, Kincaid brings Bryce to safety
and gets him pumped up enough to go for the

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.080
final showdown to rescue Sonia.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.490
Kincaid then also reveals to Bryce that the
reason that he and Sonia are having trouble

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:43.899
conceiving his because he was shot in the
balls a while back by none other than Bryce

00:14:43.899 --> 00:14:50.740
during a mission when Bryce was still a bodyguard.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.750
Interpol finds them moments later.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:15:07.170
They speak to Crowley and convince two agents
to join them in their mission.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:12.519
Bryce and Kincaid use the Interpol agents
as decoys since Senior’s security team is

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:20.350
after them.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:24.550
The two kill more bad guys until they make
it to the yacht above the spot in the ocean

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:31.800
where Aristotle plans to set off the drill
and wipe out the European power grid.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:37.790
Aristotle learns that Bryce and Kincaid are
nearby, so he sends Magnusson after Bryce,

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:41.720
and Zento after Kincaid.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:16:02.850
Bryce engages in a long fight with Magnusson
before smashing his head inside a jukebox,

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:07.420
while Kincaid kills Zento with a ricochet
bullet.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:13.209
Aristotle leaves Sonia to be killed by Veronika
while he fights Kincaid, and Senior comes

00:16:13.209 --> 00:16:47.830
to fight Bryce.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:53.319
Sonia kills Veronika before joining her husband
as they reconcile.

00:16:53.319 --> 00:16:58.949
They shoot Aristotle dead together while Bryce
sticks a pocketknife in Senior’s neck.

00:16:58.949 --> 00:17:03.999
He shows that he is impressed in Bryce, but
then lets him know that the device is almost

00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:06.150
done doing its job.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:11.630
If he wants to destroy it, the ship is rigged
to blow if the countdown is stopped.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:17.250
Bryce finds the manual override switch and
pulls it before he, Kincaid, and Sonia all

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:23.299
jump off the boat as it is destroyed.

00:17:23.299 --> 00:17:28.319
The trio are picked up by Interpol, with O’Neill
thanking them for their work even though he

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:31.240
still thinks they’re all idiots.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:36.390
He then hands Bryce some papers to sign, making
him think that he is getting his bodyguard

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.809
license reinstated.

00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:43.720
Sonia then takes the papers and reveals that
those were adoption papers, and Bryce is now

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.620
her and Kincaid’s son.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:18:13.660
Cue a big “WHAT?!” from Bryce and Kincaid.
