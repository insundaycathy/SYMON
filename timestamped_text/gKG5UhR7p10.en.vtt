00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.180
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.990
Today I will show you a Drama, Thriller film
from 2011, titled Contagion.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.890
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.289
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.329
Day 2
Beth is at an airport lounge talking on the

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:18.570
phone with John, whom she's having an affair
with, while waiting for her flight.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.750
She looks sick and is coughing, but brushes
it off as her being jet lagged.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.310
In Hong Kong a young man gets off a ferry
and takes the subway.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.460
By the time he gets home, he is sweating profusely.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.129
When he leaves his apartment, his vision gets
blurry, and he walks into traffic.

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.199
In London a model is feeling sick, so she
leaves work and goes back to her hotel room.

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.420
Later the hotel staff come into the room and
find her dead on the bathroom floor.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.819
A businessman flies to Tokyo and takes the
bus, but collapses on the floor.

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:50.269
An onlooker films him with his phone.

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.950
Beth arrives home to her son and her husband
Mitch.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.989
Day 3
In San Francisco a blogger- Alan is watching

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.460
the video of the businessman collapsing.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.800
He's guessing it might be mercury poisoning
from the fish and that there are probably

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.250
more people like him, that just weren't caught
on camera.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.940
Mitch picks his son up from school and is
informed that he's been coughing and has elevated

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.620
body temperature.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.390
Later as he is telling his wife about his
day, she drops her cup and when he comes to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.720
help, she collapses on the floor and starts
seizing.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.640
They are in the hospital and she starts seizing
again.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.200
A bit later the doctor informs Mitch that
she has passed away.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.750
He is in shock and can't accept it, saying
they just talked and she was just jetlagged.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.380
The doctor doesn't know what caused it so
he recommends an autopsy.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.140
As Mitch is driving home he gets a call from
the babysitter that informs him that his son

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.500
isn't breathing.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.390
He tells her to call 911 and rushes home to
find him dead as well.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.410
Day 5
2 medical examiners are doing an autopsy on

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.800
Beth's body.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.590
As they open her skull, they notice something
strange on her brain.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.130
One of them asks whether he should take a
sample, but the other instructs him to move

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.520
away from the table and call everyone.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.000
Day 6
Dr Erin Mears works for the CDC.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.720
She is briefed by Dr Cheever on her part of
containing the virus.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.630
She is tasked to travel to Minnesota where
she is to investigate and contain cases of

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.020
infection.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.250
Mitch is in quarantine at a hospital.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.520
He is visited by his daughter Jory from a
previous marriage.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.830
He says that he isn't sick and is only there
as a precaution.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.650
She says that she should've been there and
could have helped but he says she would've

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.110
gotten sick too.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.569
He tells her to go back to her mother but
seeing as she’s all he got left she decides

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.400
to stay with him.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.750
Dr Erin is briefing government officials on
the mysterious outbreak that has reached 47

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.810
confirmed cases and 8 deaths.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.530
She informs them that it's most likely transmitted
through air and maybe surfaces as well.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.600
The officials don't want to freak out the
public, because they don't even know what

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.600
they're dealing with.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.720
Erin says that to determine the potential
scale of the epidemic, it's crucial to figure

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.069
out the average number of people one person
can infect.

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.660
Two scientists (Ally and David) are working
with the brain sample from Beth in a secure

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.660
lab.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.240
They don't know what this virus is, so they
send the results to a scientist that might.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.690
Later as Ian is walking out of his lab, informing
the 2 scientists that the virus strain has

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.011
never been seen before and appears to come
from animals, he is ambushed by Alan, who

00:03:11.011 --> 00:03:15.490
tries to get some information for his blog,
while rambling that the virus is a biological

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.700
weapon, but the scientist doesn't tell him
anything.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.000
Day 7
Dr Erin is at Beth's workplace talking to

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.430
her coworkers.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.040
None of them directly interacted with Beth
after she came back from China so Erin reassures

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.040
them.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.480
They mention that another coworker took her
home from the airport, so she immediately

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.670
calls him.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.670
He is on the bus and she instructs him to
get off because he is highly contagious.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.090
He waits at the stop until Beth arrives with
a containment crew.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.490
Meanwhile, a doctor asks Mitch a bunch of
questions about Beth, trying to figure out

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.190
the virus origin and other people she may
have interacted with.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.830
The doctor mentions that she landed in Chicago
before flying to Minnesota 5 hours later,

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.099
and asks him if she left the airport or had
any meetings there.

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.670
He asks whether someone is sick in Chicago
and that before they got married she had a

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.650
relationship with John Neil, who lives there.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.300
Realization hits Mitch and he asks if John
is infected, the doctor doesn't answer, saying

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.900
that she can’t give out that information.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.820
Ally informs Cheever that the virus contains
Pig and Bat sequences and shows him how the

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.959
virus attaches to humans.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.690
She also says that the virus keeps mutating.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.360
The virus mortality rate is over 20%, and
there are no treatment protocols or vaccines

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.760
so Dr. Cheever orders that from now on only
highest security labs should work on it, in

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.470
fear of it leaking out.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.220
Ally calls Ian and tells him he isn't allowed
to work on the virus because his lab doesn't

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.680
have the right security certification.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.560
He thinks this is a mistake, because he is
making progress and thinks that only working

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.850
on it in government run labs will slow the
research.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.240
Day 8
Dr Cheever informs the public that the virus

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.889
is in Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston
and Salt lake and that the list is expected

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:53.970
to grow.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.660
The number of infected people worldwide is
estimated to be at 89 thousand.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.900
Cheever and Ally are at the CDC, discussing
the virus with scientists from all over the

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.949
world.

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.260
Nobody has managed to grow the virus in cells,
because it kills every animal cell they have

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.590
tried.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.600
Dr Leonora has been sent to Hong Kong to investigate
Beth's movements to find ground 0.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.540
She is met by Sun Feng.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.650
Using Beth's credit card records she learns
that she was at a casino, so Leonora orders

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.950
the casino's security tapes.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.970
Ian defies orders and keeps working on the
virus.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.500
He manages to grow the virus using a particular
bat's cells, which is the first step in making

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.770
a vaccine.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.410
He shares the research and Cheever is not
happy that he defied orders and asks what

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.540
he wants to gain from it, but instead of selling
the results to some drug company he just wants

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.410
acknowledgement for his work.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.070
Day 12
The worldwide infected estimate has reached

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.070
8 million.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.930
Alan is approached by a hedge fund guy, who
is looking for an opportunity to gain money

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.060
from this and thinks Alan might give him one,
seeing that he was the first to pay attention

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.301
to the bus video and has been talking about
it on his blog since, reaching over 2 million

00:05:58.301 --> 00:05:59.800
unique visitors.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.330
Alan tells him about Forsythia, he thinks
it's the cure.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.100
Leonora is watching the casino footage where
the first known infected can be seen interacting,

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.410
but the Chinese officials say that this isn't
proof that the virus originated here, stating

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.900
that you can't see a virus on camera.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:21.970
Erin is planning to make a makeshift hospital
at multiple stadiums in preparation for an

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:22.970
increase in infected.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.380
Day 14
Erin wakes up in the hotel room coughing.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.800
She takes her temperature and realizes she
has the virus so she informs the hotel staff

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.960
to get her the names of everyone who has serviced
the room.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.389
She calls Cheever and tells him the bad news
and later ends up in one of the stadiums.

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.990
Cheever tries to get her to a better facility
but is told that it's a waste of resources

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.900
for just one person.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.400
In China, Leonora has finished her research
and concluded that Beth is patient zero and

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.490
will send the data to Geneva.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.169
Sun Feng says he read on the internet that
the United States and France have a vaccine

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:54.990
but are hiding it from China.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.200
As she leaves he makes a phone call.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.300
While driving, the car is stopped and Leonora
is put in a van.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.110
Sun Feng takes her to his village and plans
on using her as collateral to get the vaccine

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.229
as early as possible.

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:10.540
Cheever is informed that there are plans to
quarantine chicago.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.250
The national guard is setting up roadblocks
and shutting down the border.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.120
The secret service is moving the president
underground and congress is figuring out how

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.690
to work online.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.729
He is also told that when word of this gets
out, there will be widespread panic, so it's

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:27.830
crucial to not tell anyone until they are
ready to announce it publicly.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.200
Alan has caught the virus and is making a
video for his blog of him taking Forsythia,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.800
saying that if he's alive tomorrow everyone
will know it works.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.370
Later that day Cheever calls his wife and
instructs her to leave Chicago and not tell

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.530
anyone.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.690
She picks up a ton of supplies and when a
friend inquires about the situation, she spills

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.160
the beans.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.560
Day 18
Apparently Alan's blog is gaining traction

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.590
and he's still alive, so a bunch of people
are waiting in line at a pharmacy and once

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:58.270
they are informed that only 50 doses of Forsythia
will be given out, a panic ensues and they

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.270
all scramble.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.940
Mitch and his daughter go to the store for
some food, but the city is in disarray, with

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.330
people looting and sick people walking around
without masks and coughing, so they get outta

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.330
there.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.430
They try to get to a neighboring state and
learn that the border is closed because they

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.150
are in quarantine.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.509
Erin is still at one of the stadiums.

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:20.820
When a man next to her complains about being
cold, Erin tries to give him her jacket, but

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.620
is too weak to do so.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.900
She dies not long after.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.430
Cheever is having a tv interview where alternative
unproven drugs are being talked about.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.580
He informs that they are being evaluated but
besides that, the best people can do is wash

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.810
their hands and social distance.

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:40.000
When Alan comes on, he is quoted saying that
the truth about the virus is being kept from

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.090
the world by the CDC and WHO to allow friends
of the current administration to benefit financially

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.090
and physically.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:51.089
Alan insists that the WHO is in bed with pharmaceutical
companies but Cheever denies these claims

00:08:51.089 --> 00:08:54.410
and reasons that there is no science to back
up Forsythia.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.450
Alan discredits him, because apparently his
wifes friend posted about the quarantine on

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.370
Facebook, hours before the official announcement.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.160
Later Cheever is told that he can't yet be
replaced, but there will be an investigation

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.830
and he is to keep out of the public eye for
now.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.700
Day 21
David and Ally find out that the virus has

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.810
mutated and the new strain is way more contagious.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:19.260
They've been testing potential vaccines on
monkeys but none have survived thus far.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:25.230
The mortality rate is between 25 and 30%,
depending on a person's health, diet and socioeconomic

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.230
status.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.330
It is expected that with this new strain each
person will infect 4 more whereas previously

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.530
it was 2, and without a vaccine it is anticipated
that approximately 8% of the world population

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:37.600
will contract the disease.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.100
Day 26
The death toll in the United States has reached

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.790
2.5 million.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:47.130
The president has issued a statement implementing
mandatory curfew in major metropolitan areas,

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.210
due to the riots.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:53.160
The military is distributing rations but runs
out while hundreds are still waiting in line

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.089
and people start fighting.

00:09:55.089 --> 00:09:58.880
Later Mitch hears shots in the neighbouring
house and tries to call 911 but all lines

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.970
are busy.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.480
Day 29
Mitch breaks into the neighbours empty house

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.010
and steals a gun.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.510
Jory is in the backyard with her boyfriend,
making snow angels.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.150
He gets on top of her and takes off his mask.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.550
She turns away but he reasons that if none
of them have the virus they can't give it

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.790
to each other.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.420
They are about to kiss but Mitch shows up
and pulls him off of her and orders for him

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.980
to go home.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:25.140
Back at the CDC Ally's vaccine finally works
and she injects herself.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.970
She goes to see her father at a hospital,
takes off her mask and tells him about the

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:29.970
news.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:34.830
He is concerned and says he doesn't want to
get her sick but she says she's testing the

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:35.830
vaccine.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:39.350
The vaccine starts being manufactured and
FDA is accelerating the approval.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:43.760
The first doses available for humans are expected
in around 90 days, but it could take a year

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.650
to get everyone vaccinated.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:50.440
The current death toll worldwide from the
virus is estimated to be 26 million.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.540
Day 131
Cheevers house is broken into by robbers,

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.380
who are looking for the vaccine.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.130
The robbers ask his wife where it is, thinking
that they would get it first because he works

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.300
for the government, but they don't.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.820
Cheever gets home and asks if they hurt her.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.970
Alan, who is still against the vaccine, is
talking to the hedge fund guy.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.860
He says that the studies show that there is
no proof that Forsythia works and asks if

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.930
he knew about them when they first met.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:19.110
Alan questions the integrity of the studies
implying that there is some conspiracy.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.680
He then notices a suspicious man and realizes
that he's wearing a wire so he tries to run

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.200
but is apprehended by the authorities, who
arrest him for securities fraud, conspiracy

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.080
and possible manslaughter.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.550
He insists That Forsythia cured him.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.730
Day 133
Since there is not enough vaccines for everyone

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:40.970
yet, a lottery is held using birthdays to
distribute it fairly.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:45.730
Back in China, Leonora has adjusted to her
captivity and is teaching the children.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.230
Sun Feng informs her that it's time to go,
because the government has agreed to their

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:53.480
demands and will give them 100 doses of the
vaccine in exchange for her.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.290
They make the exchange and Leonora is free.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:00.121
She's at the airport with the man who was
sent to do the exchange and he gives her a

00:12:00.121 --> 00:12:04.060
vaccine and reveals that the ones they exchanged
for her were placebos.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.579
Apparently there have been many kidnappings
of scientists and government officials, trying

00:12:07.579 --> 00:12:11.329
to extort vaccines so the government refuses
to give in to their demands.

00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:15.149
Leonora is horrified that they would condemn
a village of mostly children to death and

00:12:15.149 --> 00:12:16.670
runs off.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.660
Alan's blood results showed no antibodies
for the virus, which means he faked being

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:25.899
sick, to push Forsythia on his followers,
which made him 4.5 million dollars.

00:12:25.899 --> 00:12:29.840
Because of him, there are now millions of
people who don't trust the vaccine.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.019
One of his followers made bail for him so
he walks out.

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:37.740
Day 135
Alan is back on the street resuming his blog,

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.800
pushing the narrative that the US is responsible
for the virus and that vaccines are a scam

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.230
to his 12 million internet followers.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.769
Otherwise things are starting to go back to
normal with anarchy and looting subsiding.

00:12:47.769 --> 00:12:52.740
Ally and David put the virus in liquid nitrogen
storage with other deadly viruses from the

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.899
past.

00:12:53.899 --> 00:12:57.830
Mitch finally lets Jory see her boyfriend
since he is now vaccinated and gifts her a

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.720
dress for a makeshift prom he has organized.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.540
He gets the camera to take some pictures but
breaks down crying after seeing Beth's pictures.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.460
A final flashback occurs.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.730
A bat is seen dropping a piece of fruit in
a pig farm.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.589
One of the pigs eats it and gets infected.

00:13:12.589 --> 00:13:17.279
A chef is preparing the pig but is told that
someone wants to take a picture with him.

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:20.860
He goes out without washing his hands and
takes a picture with Beth.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.860
The End.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.780
Thank you for watching!
