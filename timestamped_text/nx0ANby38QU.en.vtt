00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.520
if you were caught up in a purge how would you get&nbsp;
through it this time we follow multiple characters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.560
highlight their mistakes and decide on better&nbsp;
tactics to survive and ultimately beat the purge

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.000
Eva her daughter Cali and grandfather rico boycott&nbsp;
themselves at home just like every other year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.440
during the purge now there are multiple things&nbsp;
here that are very wrong that i think should and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.760
could be avoided for instance to block the windows&nbsp;
with wood only is way too minimal and unprotective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.240
that would not let me be in peace during this&nbsp;
horrific event i'm impressed our two characters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.640
are so cool with it also having only one gun is a&nbsp;
terrible idea but later more to that to elaborate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.880
real quick on the wood wood is inexpensive but&nbsp;
so is metal in reasonable quantities therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.240
if i decided to stay at home during the purge i&nbsp;
would invest a lot into locking down my apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.000
as secure as possible and so instead of using&nbsp;
relatively thin wood just like our ladies do i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.520
would use mainly steel just like dr neville and i&nbsp;
am legend around each window i would furthermore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.880
fix it a metal frame onto which i can solder&nbsp;
additional metal bars for extra security the frame&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.760
can also be reused every year because i do want&nbsp;
to enjoy some sunlight during the rest of the year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.480
always remember the vitamin d guys so my point&nbsp;
here is using wood is not ideal as you can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.080
in the movie one can easily shoot through it with&nbsp;
common firearms you see the defense construction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.920
should be your top priority it must be prepared&nbsp;
ahead of time and additionally think of solutions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.000
if your defense should be broken&nbsp;
what do you do how do you re-secure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.480
there are multiple options for that and i will&nbsp;
tell you my ideas for this after we talk about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.560
guns in the movie our two ladies only use one gun&nbsp;
which they don't even bother to carry with them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.840
obviously a dumb and unnecessary mistake&nbsp;
you want to avoid plus having only one gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.440
is just not a good idea because most purgers&nbsp;
are seriously armed and often purge in groups&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.720
but perhaps you don't have sufficient funds for&nbsp;
better firearms and if that's the case then i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.760
can't blame you for that but what else could&nbsp;
you use to secure or re-secure your survival&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.920
well let me introduce you to this the budget&nbsp;
purge survival amazon buying list for those with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.560
limited resources aluminium baseball bats for the&nbsp;
swingers out there four gallons of petrol because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.680
fire never fails to impress tactical knives your&nbsp;
multi-purpose friends tasers for a shocking effect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.560
metal wire for all 007 fans out there and cheetos&nbsp;
because snacking is important so to sum up real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.080
quick the big lesson here is always carry your&nbsp;
weapons and hide others around the apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.800
you never know where someone is going to strike&nbsp;
from in addition to that carry close combat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.600
weapons in case you get disarmed our ladies&nbsp;
would have done well if they put in a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.240
more thought into their defense laying traps&nbsp;
is also a great idea because your apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.600
is your field of expertise you know it best and&nbsp;
that could be used as a tactical advantage the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.280
last tip before we move on and i think is worth&nbsp;
to mention is not to visibly defend your home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.240
days before the purge starts unless it's a common&nbsp;
thing in your neighborhood if it's not a common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.800
thing you might end up drawing the attention to&nbsp;
you and might get attacked just for the sake of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.680
proving that your defense is weak and there&nbsp;
you have it that is my strategy for defending

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.240
but what if you can't what if you are&nbsp;
forced into the middle of the purge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.520
just like our next characters let's go and see&nbsp;
what we could have done instead the second pair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.160
of characters we follow is shane and liz and&nbsp;
i can tell you right off the bat going on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.080
shopping spree two hours before the purge starts&nbsp;
is not a very smart idea and should be avoided&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.160
we all know stupid accidents happen&nbsp;
all the time and more often than not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.760
they happen in situations it is least desired we&nbsp;
all had to learn this the hard way so preparation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.800
is key in my opinion you should have completed&nbsp;
everything necessary by the evening before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.400
so when you wake up you can just relax and perhaps&nbsp;
go over your defense once again in the movie they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.200
are already getting targeted and their car&nbsp;
did get sabotaged they didn't make it home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.200
and thus were stranded in downtown l.a the worst&nbsp;
possible place during the purge unfortunately we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.280
don't get to see their home defense but&nbsp;
considering they went shopping so close&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.160
before the event makes me feel like they didn't&nbsp;
put much thought into that neither but anyway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.520
the question here is what do you do when you are&nbsp;
dropped into the middle of the purge with nowhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.040
to go and nothing to defend yourself i have never&nbsp;
been to la personally but i do know if you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.840
to hide yourself in a situation like this you&nbsp;
better hide well you don't want anyone to find you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.680
furthermore i think it's safe to assume that none&nbsp;
of your friends would come and pick you up it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.720
certainly worth a try but let's get not our hopes&nbsp;
up here friends especially when you're located&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.920
far off any residential neighborhoods so how&nbsp;
would we get out of this situation you might ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.040
well the first thought that i had was the kennel&nbsp;
system however having played the division more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.240
than is probably healthy the canal system kind of&nbsp;
loses its appeal who knows what's lurking in there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.760
after all also if you should be so unfortunate&nbsp;
and really encounter any purgers down there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.040
good luck escaping the second idea that comes&nbsp;
to my mind is a rooftop if you can get on one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.000
and block the entrance successfully you're going&nbsp;
to be very safe up there although you do need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.960
to consider snipers from the rooftops higher up&nbsp;
while i love the thought of hiding on a rooftop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.920
i think in the situation of shane and liz it is&nbsp;
more than just wishful thinking therefore i have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.760
to conclude this if you are not 100% sure that&nbsp;
the hideout of your choice is completely safe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.320
then you might be better off running i know that&nbsp;
running is a desperate attempt to beat the purge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.640
but it still seems to be the slightly better&nbsp;
option compared to hiding insufficiently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:56.400
and so the thing you really want to pay&nbsp;
attention to here is hide but if you can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:05.680
run our third protagonist is frank a regular cop&nbsp;
and ready for vengeance his goal kill his son's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.080
killer now if you do want to partake in the purge&nbsp;
you better be ready and what i mean is get guns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:19.440
lots of guns and have a plan while most hunting&nbsp;
teams franco is all terminator he has enough guns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.040
for a small death squad and his vehicle is armored&nbsp;
a must if you go for a night ride during the purge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.160
nevertheless he should and probably could have&nbsp;
placed stronger armory around the motor hub of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.600
the car because if that one fails it's hasta&nbsp;
la vista baby and it does fail in the movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.880
but before we get to this point all of our&nbsp;
protagonists have to meet and team up first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.760
frank drives spy when even liz get dragged out&nbsp;
of their home after what seemed to take hours&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.280
he finally decided to save them both meanwhile&nbsp;
shane and liz didn't find a good spot to hide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:58.160
and kept running good for them only to find&nbsp;
frank's car unlocked very nice but frank i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.360
mean seriously leaving your car unlocked in&nbsp;
the middle of the purge is where you're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:09.840
but whatever you just saved 4 innocent people in 6&nbsp;
minutes and 30 seconds so i can't blame you for it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.760
good job but really that's a big no-no for you&nbsp;
out there close your doors but leave the window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.200
slightly open if it's hot and leave a puppy&nbsp;
in it thank you let's continue as all of our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.320
protagonists finally meet they make their way into&nbsp;
the unknown the car breaks down like mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.600
before and they have to leave it behind frank is&nbsp;
nice enough to hand each of our other protagonists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.280
a gun and wishes them good luck now naturally&nbsp;
the others have no chance to survive this night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:43.840
without him after all he is the only one with real&nbsp;
combat experience eva comes up with a genius idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.040
thinks she must have read dale carnegie well she&nbsp;
tells frank that if he takes them to her friend's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:55.360
house not too far away he can have her car a&nbsp;
very smart move because always remember if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.680
want something from someone give them something&nbsp;
in return first and you will receive what you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.040
seek after frank agrees and our protagonists&nbsp;
make their way through the city to tonya's home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.440
six hours left until the end of this year's purge&nbsp;
all of our protagonists have still quite a long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.000
way in front of them but eventually arrive at an&nbsp;
abandoned truck where they are able to collect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.240
better weapons which is always a great idea inside&nbsp;
the truck they come across unusual high technology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.680
especially the access to the cctv system of&nbsp;
the city causes them to wonder who lies behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:33.280
all of this additionally they realized that the&nbsp;
death squad related to this truck was the same as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:39.520
the one that tried to kidnap eva and cali before&nbsp;
revealing a grand scale plan to purge and implying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.920
there are more such trucks around eventually&nbsp;
they get spotted and have to continue their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:49.360
journey to eva's friend but before we move on&nbsp;
there are multiple things here worthy to mention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.920
if you need to travel long distances while the&nbsp;
purge is taking place there are several things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.920 --> 00:09:00.640
you must pay attention to first be focused and&nbsp;
don't talk needlessly second always be ready&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:07.280
to shoot third cover each other if you travel&nbsp;
with people and finally don't be a burden to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:13.520
others all of these let's call them the golden&nbsp;
rules can and will save your life unfortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.320
all of our characters apart from frank neglect&nbsp;
them and almost cause all of them to get killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:24.400
over and over again like mentioned before hiding&nbsp;
in underground systems is suboptimal because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.840
once you're found you're dead besides it is safe&nbsp;
to assume that others would come up with the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:35.680
idea making it easy for purges to target those&nbsp;
areas in particular and in the movie we witnessed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.840
just that when our characters enter the metro they&nbsp;
encounter multiple people seemingly homeless folks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:48.320
hiding there and trying to escape death but it's&nbsp;
no help all of them get shot burned or driven over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:53.520
once the purges enter on their way through the&nbsp;
subway our characters escape some sickles on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.520 --> 00:10:01.440
beach buggy chasing them with malicious intent but&nbsp;
they do survive the attack with minor damage taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.960
shane gets shot and frank rips open his knee but&nbsp;
both are okay and all of our characters make it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:13.680
to eva's friend's apartment sheesh what a ride in&nbsp;
it everything is just perfect at tania's apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:19.120
full glasses stuffed plates just what you want&nbsp;
after escaping death so many times in just a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.640
few hours it's a great way for our characters to&nbsp;
unwind and enjoy the safe and cosy environment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.360
they use the time to treat their wounds and&nbsp;
have a chat which i think is a pretty good idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.560
when you can afford it take a break talk to&nbsp;
each other treat the wounded it lets you remain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.840
efficient and motivated which is very important&nbsp;
if your goal still lies ahead however it doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:45.200
take long until the peace breaks frank finds&nbsp;
out that eva has lied to him about the car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.720
and gets furious but seems to understand the&nbsp;
necessity behind her lie he packs his stuff and is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:56.320
about to leave when the madness of the purge also&nbsp;
arrives at this apartment lorraine tanya's sister&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:02.000
shoots tanya because she cheated on her husband&nbsp;
she also tries to kill her husband but fails as he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.480
takes liz as a shield coward move but it's life or&nbsp;
death i can't really blame him for it frank saves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:14.240
them once again and all of our characters flee&nbsp;
to the staircase where frank experiences a moral&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:20.000
dilemma i guess being a morally responsible dude&nbsp;
doesn't go well with the desire to kill someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.280
well that's his problem not mine he eventually&nbsp;
decides to assist our characters further which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.480
is great what is not so great is that all of&nbsp;
them get caught and eventually get sold off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.360
at an auction for rich people but let's go&nbsp;
back a little why not say tanya's apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.080
frank could have easily overpowered lorraine and&nbsp;
held her as a captive until the purge ended which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.640
wasn't too far away at this point i would have&nbsp;
certainly considered to stay there as the only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:50.400
other option would have been to go out again and&nbsp;
you really want to avoid being out there however&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.520
we can see that when all of our characters make&nbsp;
for their escape the same death squad from before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.240
is about to raid the place promising a sure&nbsp;
death if our protagonists were to stay there

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.960
let's move on though the next chapter is&nbsp;
fun although it doesn't start very well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.600
all of our characters find themselves on a&nbsp;
stage with their hands cuffed behind their back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.480
they get sold off to the highest bidder&nbsp;
subsequently all the hostages get released into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.200
what looks like a transformed factory hall&nbsp;
it's almost completely dark and those who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.480
bid highest seven people in this case hunt down&nbsp;
all the captives with weapons of their choice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.360
since they also use night vision glasses they&nbsp;
are at clear advantage so i would like to ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.720
you right now if you yourself are stuck with&nbsp;
nothing but your clothes in a dark hall while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.680
seven people hunt you down with military equipment&nbsp;
how would you get out of this situation if you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:47.200
come up with the creative idea share it with us&nbsp;
in the comments i think we can all agree that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.640
is a rather hopeless situation however the fact&nbsp;
that you're basically free of any restrictions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.760
gives rise to the opportunity to influence&nbsp;
the obvious outcome here what i mean is this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:03.600
you can use your legs freely and so your arms and&nbsp;
hands this is a typical flight or fight situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.800
so let's analyze the only chance i&nbsp;
see is to overpower one of the hunters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.600
rob him or her of his weapon wear the night&nbsp;
vision glasses and take out the others&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.800
i know it's easier said than done and if you have&nbsp;
played a lot of paintball sure do it like frank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.800
does if not here is my idea for those of you&nbsp;
who are more let's say a little less confident&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.800
team up with at least one other person position&nbsp;
yourself strategically and be quiet a great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.920
strategic position would be near a light source&nbsp;
for instance near the window front where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:41.360
spectators are watching from if you get a chance&nbsp;
attack one of the hunters in tag team fashion this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:47.280
is really the only chance here one must sacrifice&nbsp;
and is likely to die but once a weapon is secured&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:52.800
the chances rise from almost zero to actually&nbsp;
feasible now to lessen the chance of getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.320
killed you may consider using your clothes as&nbsp;
decoy or even as tools to attack if you normally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:03.680
wear a belt you just won and if it's a gucci belt&nbsp;
then jesus christ you just gotta swing it like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:09.760
sauron swung as flail and lord of the rings and&nbsp;
you smack those away so my conclusion is this if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:15.120
you can trust the people around you plus you can&nbsp;
keep relatively calm there is a chance to survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.760
this scenario although you will need a good&nbsp;
portion of luck in the movie everyone gets saved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:25.920
by the anti-nffa group however shane unfortunately&nbsp;
dies but then again he was chit-chatting in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:31.840
situation where you just shouldn't i mean shut&nbsp;
up and hold up your gun golden rules you remember

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.440
now in the final chapter frank drives off with&nbsp;
eva and callie for what reason they joined him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.120
is mysterious to me but then again staying with&nbsp;
him or the anti-nffa squad doesn't make a big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.800
difference this guy is a serious asset they arrive&nbsp;
at the targeted house and he enters to finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:56.240
kill the man who killed his son i have to mention&nbsp;
that i found it hilarious how he entered the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.560
there was like zero barrier he literally&nbsp;
just walked in it as if it was his house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.360
but afterwards when he steps out again there's&nbsp;
like this full electronic high-tech door opening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:11.440
it's like you can't have it both guys but then&nbsp;
again it seems like you can the rest of the movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.560
is history i thank you very much for watching if&nbsp;
you have any inputs leave them in your comments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.160
it's great to have you here and&nbsp;
i'll see you guys in the next one
