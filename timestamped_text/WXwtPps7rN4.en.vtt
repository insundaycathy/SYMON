00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.350
Hi, Scary Recap here.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.129
Today, I will explain a horror, mystery, thriller
movie called The Boy, released in 2016.

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:12.110
Watch out and spolers ahead!

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.120
Greta Evans, a foreigner, is on her way to
join the Heelshires to take care of their

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.500
Doll, Brahms.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.490
The driveway leading to the house is in the
midst of the forest, and it is secluded.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.380
Upon arrival at the home, the taxi driver
jolts her awake as she has fallen asleep during

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.610
the drive.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.100
Greta is open-mouthed when she sees the sprawling
house.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.559
The taxi driver informs her that her things
have been kept inside and asks her to wait

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.989
in the parlor till the Heelshires arrive.

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.379
After setting her shoes by the door, she enters
the house.

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.589
There is no one in the parlor, so she calls
out.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.250
After hearing a rustling sound upstairs, she
goes up the staircase, hesitant to see if

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.890
someone is there.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.049
On her way, she sees a vast family portrait
of the Heelshires.

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:02.680
With no sign of anyone, she enters a room
full of old-fashioned toys.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.140
She smiles after picking up one of those before
being completely startled by the voice of

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.829
someone from behind.

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.280
It's Malcolm- the grocery man standing at
the doorway.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.409
He is smitten by Greta and tells her that
he owns a grocery store nearby and delivers

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.009
weekly produce to the Heelshires.

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.890
He then asks her to help her pack the groceries.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.430
Greta says that she is from Montana.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.060
Malcolm says that his family has a history
of prognostication and believes he, too, has

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.549
got a touch of it.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.140
To prove this, he asks for her gum.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.250
He fails to read her past correctly the first
time, which doesn't impress her very much.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.970
Greta is surprised when Malcolm, on his second
try, says that she is running away from a

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.719
bad past.

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.799
Greta regrets it and asks about the Heelshires.

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.289
The Heelshires, Malcolm says, are charming
and generous people.

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.530
Before he could say anything about Brahms,
Mrs. Heelshire enters.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.719
Greta introduces herself to Mrs. Heelshire,
who notices her sock-clad feet.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.549
Greta runs to get her shoes which she left
by the front.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.920
However, her shoes are gone.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.730
Mrs. Heelshire says Brahms might have taken
it as he can be pretty playful.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.690
Mrs. Heelshire introduces her to Mr. Heelshire
and their child- Brahms.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.540
Greta sees that Brahms is a porcelain doll
and starts laughing, thinking it's a joke.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.450
An unimpressed Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire looks
very seriously at Greta.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.170
However, to Greta's relief, Malcolm enters
and eases the tension.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.620
Malcolm greets the Heelshires, takes the Doll's
hand, and shakes it, saying to Brahms that

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.670
he will meet him next week.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.330
Greta plays along, wears an uneasy smile,
and says to Brahms that she hopes they can

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.120
be friends.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.530
Mrs. Heelshire shows Greta around the house
and explains her responsibilities when it

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.120
comes to Brahms.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.460
She says that Brahms should be woken up at
7 am every day and dress up in the bedroom.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.370
She asks Greta to try it, but she is clumsy
because the entire situation is quite weird

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.130
for her.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.130
Mrs. Heelshire further asks her to read books
to Brahms in a loud, clear voice and lets

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.290
her know that music is significant to Brahms,
who prefers to hear it at a loud volume.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.020
Greta is also told how they had to battle
with "outside elements" like vermin, thereby

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.270
asking her not to throw away the leftovers.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.840
Mr. Heelshire shows her the vermin traps set
outside and tells her Mrs. Heelshire is worried

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.710
as Brahms is not very fond of animals.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.930
Rather seriously, he says to Greta that their
son lives through Brahms, however weird it

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.020
may appear outside.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.110
After putting Brahms to bed, Mrs. Heelshire
tells her that Brahms has chosen her!

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.540
Later, Greta talks to Sandy, who asks her
to stick with her new job, despite the creepiness

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.810
in the house, to get away from her destructive
past.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.800
The next day, Greta overhears Mrs. Heelshire
pleading with Brahms to be a good boy until

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.670
they return.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.270
Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire leave after an emotional
goodbye.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.170
Before leaving, they ask Greta to be good
with Brahms and give a slight warning that

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.040
they are not the other way around!

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.180
Mr. Heelshire handed over a paper containing
a set of rules to be followed strictly.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.640
However, she ignores it completely after they
leave.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.699
These rules include:
* No guests

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.460
* Never cover Brahms' face
* Always save meals in the freezer.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.040
* Never go in the attic.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.630
* Never leave him alone.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.040
* Clean the traps.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.770
* Never forget to feed him.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.280
* Read a bedtime story loud and clear.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.560
* And finally, a goodnight kiss.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.810
However, contrary to the rules mentioned in
the paper, she covers the Doll with a blanket.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.460
Later that night, she noticed that the blanket
had come off.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.260
Frustrated by it, Greta throws the Doll into
another room and locks it, so it doesn't freak

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.260
her.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.540
Soon, however, she wakes upon hearing the
sound of a child wailing downstairs.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.150
She takes a candle and checks out.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.930
On her way, she leans over at the family portrait
and focuses on Brahms' face.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.560
Suddenly, an arm shoots out and grabs her
neck.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.470
Greta wakes up from a nightmare!

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.480
She hears the wailing sound again.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.120
She peers in the bedroom where she left Brahms.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.690
She is freaked out as she notices Brahms'
cheeks are wet, like tear tracks.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.340
However, once again, she is relieved to find
that water was dripping from the ceiling leak.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.230
The next day, Malcolm comes to deliver weekly
produce and brings Greta's first week of pay.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.170
While taking a walk around the manor, Malcolm
stops near Brahms' actual grave.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.460
He says that Brahms' died 20 years ago in
a fire accident on his eighth birthday.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.190
Malcolm wants to show her the city's famous
nightlife to get away from the oppressive

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.250
manner, and they agree to meet up later.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.010
Later that night, she sets aside her coral
dress and necklace in the bathroom before

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.010
shower.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.500
Greta is shocked to find that one side of
her hair is cut and her necklace and dress

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.580
missing.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.890
Greta rushes to her bedroom to see that all
her things, including her dresses, are gone.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.820
She notices that a ladder is placed up the
attic.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.070
Clutching her towel, she climbs up to the
attic, and immediately the attic slams shut.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.090
Soon after, she hears Malcolm's car and tries
to get his attention.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.500
However, it was not enough, and Malcolm leaves.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.820
Greta knocks herself out when she falls after
being shocked when a figure popped up.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.820
This, however, was just a suit.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.820
She wakes up the following day and sees that
the ladder is down and the door is open.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.010
She invites Malcolm to the home to comb over
the house.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.940
He finds nothing abnormal in the place.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.160
They spend time together.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.440
When asked about the "real Brahms," Malcolm
says that once a drunk Mr. Heelshire described

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.910
the real Brahms as "Odd" when he asked the
same question.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.100
Later that night, she has another nightmare.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.990
She is petrified when she comes to know that
phone calls are cut off.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.920
But, the phone rings all of a sudden.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.340
When she answers it, a child-like voice asks
her to follow the rules.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.220
Moreover, she saw the rule paper placed near
the Doll, which is now in a completely different

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.550
position.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.831
She then finds her favorite peanut butter
and jelly sandwich placed outside, and Brahms

00:07:14.831 --> 00:07:17.139
promises that he'll be good.

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:22.160
Greta laughs hysterically and now believes
that Brahms' spirit indeed lives inside the

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.160
Doll.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.730
Greta decides to take the rules seriously
from now on.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:32.080
Elsewhere, Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire drowned
themselves after writing a letter to Brahms,

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.710
apologizing for leaving him.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:39.730
Over the next few days, Greta follows the
rules- reads him books, plays his music, and

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.210
so on.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.980
Malcolm asks her for another outing, but this
time Greta refuses, feeling she needs to be

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.820
with Brahms.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.800
Remembering that the Heelshires described
Brahms as shy, she realizes that Brahms is

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.139
alive!

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:58.090
She demonstrates this to Malcolm by showing
that the Doll only moves when they aren't

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.120
in the room.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.330
Greta and Malcolm take a walk.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.400
Malcolm advises her to leave the place.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.080
However, she says that her destiny has brought
her here and empathizes with the Heelshires

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.889
who lost their son.

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:15.389
She tells Malcolm that previously she suffered
a miscarriage after her boyfriend Cole left

00:08:15.389 --> 00:08:18.990
her, which is precisely why she should care
for Brahms.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.330
They go to her room after putting Brahms to
bed.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.120
Malcolm comforts her, and they start kissing,
intending to make love.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.430
But before things go far, they hear loud music.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.459
They find the Doll in the study and figure
out that Brahms is not happy.

00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:39.569
Malcolm, now seemingly unnerved, tells Greta
that a little girl- Emily Cribbs used to visit

00:08:39.569 --> 00:08:41.999
Brahms and play with him every week.

00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:45.999
She last came during her birthday, after which
she went missing.

00:08:45.999 --> 00:08:50.319
Just when the police were about to question
Brahms, the house burned up, and he died.

00:08:50.319 --> 00:08:54.870
Later, the police found the body of Emily
in the woods with her skull crushed.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:09:00.059
Now, Malcolm seriously doubts where the Doll
holds a good spirit if it holds one.

00:09:00.059 --> 00:09:05.230
However, Greta says that Brahms wouldn't hurt
her and decides to stay.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:10.350
The following day, Cole arrives to meet Greta,
intending to take her back home.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.610
He tries to convince her as he had found a
new job for her in the States.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.790
Cole also laughs as she is getting paid for
looking after a doll.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:23.899
Greta, committed to looking after Brahms,
doesn't intend to travel back home with Cole.

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:26.579
Later, Cole and Malcolm meet.

00:09:26.579 --> 00:09:31.220
Malcolm feels that Cole shouldn't be here,
is concerned about Greta's safety, and decides

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.189
to stay in his car.

00:09:33.189 --> 00:09:37.170
Cole aggressively asserts that Greta traveled
with him the next day.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.279
Greta asks for the Doll to help her.

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:44.570
Later in the night, Cole wakes up to see a
message written in blood to "get out."

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:45.990
Cole thinks Greta did it.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.149
Greta, however, says that it was the Doll.

00:09:49.149 --> 00:09:52.500
Refusing to believe it, Cole starts to yell
at Greta.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.199
Hearing the commotion, Malcolm turns up to
see what's going on.

00:09:56.199 --> 00:09:58.779
Cole grabs the Doll and starts waving it.

00:09:58.779 --> 00:10:03.429
Both Greta and Malcolm try to capture the
Doll away from Cole, who eventually smashes

00:10:03.429 --> 00:10:06.050
it- shattering it into pieces.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:11.730
The entire house began to shake, and rumbling
noises began hearing behind the walls.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.050
Cole puts his ear against the mirror as he
hears some noise from it.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:19.889
Suddenly, the mirror shatters, and a massive
figure with the same porcelain mask emerges

00:10:19.889 --> 00:10:21.330
from it.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.600
Malcolm concludes that this must be Brahms
himself now- an adult.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.110
He never died, as Greta says earlier.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.889
The masked man knocks down Cole and stabs
him in the neck with a shard.

00:10:32.889 --> 00:10:35.529
Surprisingly, Brahm drags Greta away.

00:10:35.529 --> 00:10:39.980
But Malcolm manages to knock him out just
in time, and they try to flee.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.800
The masked man blocks off every one of their
attempts to escape.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.670
As they are being pursued, Greta and Malcolm
reach a small room beside the attic.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:54.329
There, Greta finds her missing Coral dress
and her jewelry worn by a life-sized Doll.

00:10:54.329 --> 00:10:57.949
She now realized that her every movement was
being watched.

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:03.389
The room also has a fridge, meaning the masked
man was Brahms, and he never died!

00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:08.749
It is now clear that Brahms is psychotic and
has been living in the walls for 20 years.

00:11:08.749 --> 00:11:13.510
He is the one who killed the girl, as well
as all the nannies he rejected.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:18.100
Greta also discovers the letter the Heelshires
sent, saying that they will never come back

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.079
and she is all his.

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:23.449
Meanwhile, Malcolm tries to find a new escape
route.

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:25.439
He eventually finds one.

00:11:25.439 --> 00:11:29.850
Greta goes through the path first and puts
halts for the door to open, but before Malcolm

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.329
decides to hold Brahms so that she could escape.

00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:34.490
He asks her to move on.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.019
However, Brahms overpowers Malcolm and knocks
him out.

00:11:38.019 --> 00:11:40.860
By that time, Greta opens the door.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:46.269
Brahms threatens Greta that he will kill Malcolm
the way he did others, in the voice of a child.

00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:51.449
Greta manages to escape but turns back as
she realizes she needs to save Malcolm.

00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:54.699
She goes towards Cole's body, where Brahms
was waiting.

00:11:54.699 --> 00:11:58.249
On her way into the house, she had already
pocketed a letter opener.

00:11:58.249 --> 00:12:03.199
Now, after seeing Brahms, she assures her
that she won't leave him again.

00:12:03.199 --> 00:12:08.259
She uses her nanny's voice and says that it
is bedtime and he needs to follow the rules.

00:12:08.259 --> 00:12:10.579
Convinced by it, Brahms followed her obediently.

00:12:10.579 --> 00:12:13.929
But now, Brahms demands she kiss him.

00:12:13.929 --> 00:12:19.230
When she refuses to kiss him as punishment,
he grabs her and demands it more aggressively.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:23.839
While reluctantly kissing the porcelain mask,
she stabs him with her letter opener multiple

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:28.319
times despite Brahms reconciling and strangling
her for a while.

00:12:28.319 --> 00:12:32.819
Brahms collapses, and Greta runs past him
to see whether Malcolm is okay.

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:38.309
Greta eventually finds Malcolm alive, and
they drive their way out of the house to freedom.

00:12:38.309 --> 00:12:42.540
Sometime later, someone pieces the Doll together
once again.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.970
Yes, that's about it, guys.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.999
