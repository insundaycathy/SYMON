00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.390
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:04.910
Today, I'm going to explain a drama film called
"Fight Club."

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.180
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.549
Watch out and take care.

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.450
A man who works as an automobile recall specialist
has started to feel disenchanted with his

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.110
mundane life as the stress of his job keeps
building up.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.360
He spends his free time browsing through a
furniture catalog and buying anything that

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.080
he finds interesting, but nothing satisfies
him.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.449
Apart from the stress at the office, he also
has to deal with jet lag as the job requires

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.029
him to travel out of the city regularly.

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.210
Due to the constant pressure, he has been
unable to sleep for six months.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.539
His doctor tells him not to worry too much
because no one has ever died of insomnia.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.489
However, the Man says that he is also suffering
from narcolepsy, causing him to wake up in

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.269
strange places with no recollection of how
he got there.

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.710
He asks the doctor for medication, but the
doctor tells him that he only needs natural

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.710
sleep.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.589
When the Man tells him that he's in pain,
the doctor dismisses his concerns and tells

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.210
him to attend a testicular cancer support
group so he could see people in real pain.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.219
One day, the Man decides to go to a meeting
and listen to the people sharing their grievous

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:56.289
experiences.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.010
Near the end of the session, he meets Bob,
an ex-body builder who had his testicles removed

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.379
because of a disease that causes him to produce
too much testosterone.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.570
Bob opens up to him, telling him about his
steroid use, which has led to his divorce

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.820
and bankruptcy.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.770
Bob hugs the insomniac and tells him that
it's okay to cry.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.420
As Bob holds him on his chest, the Man decides
to set his emotions loose and cry his heart

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.420
out.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.490
The Man has since been sleeping well at night,
so he kept attending various support groups

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.840
for people with severe diseases despite being
in perfect health.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.149
The Man feels refreshed, and at peace every
time he comes out of each session, but that

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.710
feeling of tranquility is soon broken by a
woman named Marla Singer, who has been attending

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.460
the same support groups.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.140
Marla's presence in the same meetings that
he attends bothered him so much that he had

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.950
difficulty sleeping again.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.549
One night, the Man confronts Marla and threatens
to expose her, but she shrugs him off and

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.520
threatens to uncover his secret too.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.159
He tells Marla that he can't release his emotions
when another faker is present, so he asks

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.749
her to split the support groups between them.

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:53.049
After the negotiations, they decide to exchange
numbers in case that they want to switch places.

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.929
Marla notices that the Man, who had been using
different aliases in each support group, neglected

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.889
to put his name on the card he gave to her.

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:02.329
So she calls out to him from across the street,
but the Man disappears after a bus passes

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:03.329
between them.

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.310
Despite attending the meetings, the strain
of his job still weighs on him as he travels

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.689
to different cities.

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.409
On a flight back home, he meets Tyler Durden,
a soap salesman who grabs the Man's attention

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.489
by explaining his theory about the oxygen
masks on planes.

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.680
Tyler surmises that the masks are there to
make the passengers high during an emergency,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.640
so they will be docile and accept their fate.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.400
The Man says that Tyler has been the most
interesting person that he has met on a plane.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.480
After getting off the aircraft, he finds out
that his briefcase was confiscated due to

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.459
a mysterious vibration.

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.319
When he gets home, he finds that his apartment
has caught fire.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.900
With nowhere to go, he calls Tyler and invites
him to a bar for a drink.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.900
At the bar, he tells Tyler about the fire
and laments the loss of all his possessions.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.159
Tyler advises the Man to avoid pursuing material
things because they will end up owning him

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.010
instead of the other way around.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.580
Aside from being a soap salesman, the Man
learns that Tyler also works as a projectionist

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.190
at a theater and a banquet waiter at a luxurious
hotel.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.519
But instead of doing his job well, he slips
in a few frames of indecent clips into the

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.310
films and sabotages the food at the restaurant
by urinating on them.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.739
After the drinks, Tyler invites him to stay
at his place, but before they go, he asks

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.110
the Man to hit him in the face as hard as
he can.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.910
The Man hesitantly punches Tyler and hits
him in the ear.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.310
Tyler punches him back in the chest, causing
him to stagger to the ground.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.470
Despite being hurt, the Man feels exhilarated,
so they continue to fight each other.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.010
After another round of drinks, Tyler and the
Man head home.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.970
When they arrive, the Man instantly notices
the house's dilapidated condition, leading

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.310
him to speculate that Tyler is squatting.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.231
Tyler and the Man keep on fighting outside
the bar over the next few nights, and they

00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:28.510
have started to attract the attention of other
men.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.660
Spectators then turned into participants,
and their popularity grew to the point that

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.909
they could hold the fights in the bar's basement.

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.640
Each week, Tyler would lay down the rules
of the fight club to welcome the newcomers.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.700
The number one rule of fight club is to never
talk about fight club.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.260
Members, however, constantly break this code
as they continue to invite other people to

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.260
the fights.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.560
One day, the Man receives a call from Marla,
asking him why he hasn't attended the support

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.860
group meetings in weeks.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.099
He tells her that he has found a new group
that allows only male members.

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.980
Marla tells him that she emptied a bottle
of Xanax but insists that she is not trying

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.310
to kill herself.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.829
As Marla continues to talk, the Man gets annoyed
by her voice and decides to set the phone

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.780
down without hanging up.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.530
Later on, the Man dreams about Marla getting
intimate with someone.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.260
However, he finds out that it wasn't a dream
when he sees Marla walking around the kitchen.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.240
When the Man asks what Marla is doing inside
his house, she gets mad at him and leaves.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.890
Tyler then comes into the kitchen and tells
him that he had picked up the phone and talked

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.880
to Marla, so he decided to visit her to keep
her from overdosing.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.510
However, the police soon arrive at her apartment
after someone tipped them off about Marla's

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.590
condition.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.880
Tyler brings Marla over to his house and gets
intimate with her after treating her.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.720
He then tells the Man to avoid speaking to
Marla about him, but he doesn't tell him why.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.020
The Man becomes more annoyed with Marla, as
she starts visiting the house regularly to

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.570
be with Tyler.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.830
One morning, the Man receives a call from
the police, telling him that a stick of homemade

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.230
dynamite had been used to torch his apartment.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.470
That night, Tyler takes the Man to raid the
trash bin of a liposuction clinic to steal

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.130
the discarded fat and use it to make soap.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.600
When they get home, Tyler explains how soap
can be turned into dynamite by just adding

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.120
a few more chemicals.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.460
He then takes out a bottle of lye and demonstrates
its potency by pouring some of it on the back

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.830
of the Man's hand.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.620
As the Man's skin starts to burn, he tries
to shut out the pain by meditating, but Tyler

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.020
jolts him awake, forcing him to feel it.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.300
Finally, Tyler asks the Man to give up trying
to live his life the same way he had done

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.770
in the past and acknowledge that he will die
someday.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.930
He then shows the Man a similar burn mark
on his hand before pouring vinegar on the

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.340
Man's hand to wash away the chemical.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.450
At the office, the manager finds a copy of
the fight club's rules on the copier and confronts

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.450
the Man.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.560
He threatens the manager, suggesting that
he might bring an Armalite into the office

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.450
and shoot all the people working there.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.780
Their conversation gets interrupted when the
Man receives a call from Marla, who asks him

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.860
for help to check for lumps on her breasts.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.020
The Man goes to her apartment, wondering why
she chose to call him instead of Tyler.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.430
After leaving Marla, the Man runs into Bob,
who tells him that he's no longer attending

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.080
the support group meetings because he has
found something new.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.170
Bob tells the Man that he's not supposed to
talk about the new club that he's joined,

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.300
but the Man recognizes it as the first rule
of the fight club and tells Bob that he's

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.620
also a member.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.810
When the two face up against each other at
the club, Bob defeats the Man by forcing him

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.800
to tap out from his chokehold.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.990
The fight club soon comes under threat when
Lou, the bar owner, discovers its existence.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.350
While Tyler was reminding the members about
the club's rules, Lou and his bodyguard arrive

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.350
and tell them to leave.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.970
Lou starts beating Tyler, who just laughs
it off even as he lays down on the ground

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:06.970
bleeding.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.870
When Lou turns his back on him, Tyler grabs
him and pins him to the ground.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.220
Tyler proceeds to cough blood all over Lou
until he agrees to let the club use the basement.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.470
Tyler later gives the members an assignment,
ordering them to pick a fight with total strangers

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.690
and let them win.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.740
The Man goes to his manager and threatens
to expose the company's corruption unless

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.000
they pay him.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.300
After the boss fires him, the Man starts beating
himself up, while the manager watches him

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.370
in shock.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.440
As the Man keeps hitting himself, he recalls
the night when he first fought with Tyler.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.220
He tells the boss that he'll never set foot
in the office again if he agrees to write

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.660
him a regular paycheck.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.660
The Man later leaves the office with the manager's
promise to send him 52 weekly paychecks and

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.630
48 airline flight coupons, allowing the club
to hold fights every night.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.060
Members soon receive assignments from Tyler
telling them to vandalize buildings, shops,

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.190
and billboards.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.340
While smashing cars on the streets with Tyler,
the Man learns that there are now numerous

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.840
chapters of the fight club across the country.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.550
Later on, Tyler takes out a gun from the Man's
backpack and enters a convenience store.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.780
He exits through the back with the clerk and
asks him what he aspired to be before working

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.880
at the store.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.690
The clerk, named Raymond, said that he wanted
to be a veterinarian, but he couldn't finish

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:07.710
school.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.460
Tyler threatens to kill Raymond if he hasn't
done anything to work his way up to become

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.410
a veterinarian in six weeks.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.580
After Raymond runs away, Tyler tells the Man
that Raymond will learn to appreciate life

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.260
more when he wakes up the next day.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.890
One day, the Man discovers that Tyler had
built bunk beds in the basement of their house.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.150
He then learns that Tyler had also started
accepting applications for a secretive boot

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.460
camp that requires candidates to wait three
days in front of the house without food and

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.460
shelter.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.640
Applicants soon begin piling up in front of
the house, Bob being one of them.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.990
Once inside, they are subjected to manual
labor as Tyler lectures them about the evils

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.340
of consumerism.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.400
The Man is perplexed why Tyler started recruiting
for an army.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.020
He was shocked to learn later on that the
recruits had set several apartments on fire.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.160
The incident has caught the attention of the
city's police commissioner, who surmises that

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.920
the crime is somehow related to underground
fight clubs.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.990
When the Man asks why they would commit such
an act, the recruits tell him that it's part

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.750
of Project Mayhem, but the rule states that
no one is supposed to ask about it.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.020
In the next stage of the project, the group
poses as waiters to infiltrate an official

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.590
gathering at a hotel.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.270
When the commissioner goes to the bathroom,
the waiters follow him there and attack him.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.440
Tyler threatens to castrate the police chief
unless he calls off the investigation on the

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.440
fight club.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.020
He further reveals that the men involved in
the crime are the ones that people depend

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.340
on to cook their meals, drive their cars,
haul their trash, etc.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.970
The police chief agrees to stop the probe,
and they all leave the hotel.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.860
The Man has begun to feel excluded from the
club because of his lack of knowledge about

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.000
their plans regarding Project Mayhem.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.840
He lashes out by beating one of the recruits
to a pulp during a fight.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.720
On the way home after the fight, the Man starts
berating Tyler for not including him in Project

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.840
Mayhem from the beginning.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.569
Tyler, who is driving the car, tells the Man
that the project belongs to the whole club,

00:08:35.569 --> 00:08:37.079
not just the two of them.

00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:40.099
Tyler drives on the wrong side of the road,
and lets go of the steering wheel as he scolds

00:08:40.099 --> 00:08:43.579
the Man for refusing to forget about his past
life and his individuality.

00:08:43.579 --> 00:08:46.720
The Man tries to take the steering wheel,
but Tyler tells him to let go and stop trying

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.120
to control everything.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.180
When the Man capitulates, they soon crash
into another car.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.070
When they emerge from the vehicle, Tyler tells
him that they just went through a "near-life

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.439
experience."

00:08:55.439 --> 00:08:59.670
The following day, the Man looks for Tyler
in their house, but he is nowhere to be seen.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.050
Despite Tyler's absence, the recruits are
still busy planning their project.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.620
When the Man tries to inspect the plans, a
recruit stops him, assuring him that everything

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.140
is under control.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.540
Marla pays a visit to the house, hoping to
come inside, but when the Man says that Tyler

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.410
is not around, she decides to leave.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:18.160
Recruits soon arrive at the house in a panic,
saying someone has been shot during an assignment.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.350
They were tasked to destroy a large art display
outside a corporate building and destroy a

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.890
franchise coffee bar.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.980
The mission was running smoothly until the
police arrive and shoot at them, killing Bob

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.680
in the process.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.610
Feeling that the group has gone too far, the
Man starts looking for Tyler in the hopes

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.040
that he will put an end to the dangerous project.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.600
Using Tyler's used ticket stubs, the Man flies
to different cities and visits the bars and

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.000
other businesses where fight clubs were founded.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.430
After striking out at various establishments,
he comes across a joint where he hears employees

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.930
paying tribute to Bob.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:47.560
The bartender welcomes the Man back, even
though he isn't familiar with the place.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.779
The Man asks the bartender if he recognizes
him, prompting the bartender to wonder if

00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:52.580
he is being put to the test.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.800
After being assured that he's not being tested,
the bartender tells the Man that he's Tyler

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.800
Durden.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.560
In his confusion, the Man returns to his hotel
room and calls Marla to ask her if they've

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.959
ever been intimate.

00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:05.240
Marla confirms that they are in a relationship
and addresses him as Tyler.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.769
After Marla hangs up, Tyler appears in the
room, expressing his disappointment with the

00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:11.360
Man for breaking his promise to avoid mentioning
him to Marla.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.579
After questioning Tyler about his situation,
the Man soon recalls some of the things he's

00:10:14.579 --> 00:10:15.980
done since they met.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.100
He then realizes that he and Tyler are the
same person.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.839
Tyler explains that the Man has been looking
for ways to change his life, so he appeared.

00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:26.129
When the Man points out that Tyler has his
own jobs, Tyler tells him that the Man took

00:10:26.129 --> 00:10:28.560
on other jobs at night because he can't sleep.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.439
Tyler later tells the Man that Marla poses
a threat to their plans because she knows

00:10:31.439 --> 00:10:32.439
too much.

00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:35.800
The Man soon collapses from exhaustion while
they were arguing about Tyler's dangerous

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.800
plans.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.340
When he wakes up, he immediately runs out
of his room to fly back home.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.970
When he arrives at the house, he finds Project
Mayhem's plans, which are targeting several

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.540
buildings in the financial district.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.990
He tries warning the management of each facility,
but he soon learns that they have all been

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.339
infiltrated by the group.

00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:54.360
In his desperation, he grabs all the documents
he can carry and leaves the house.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.999
He then meets with Marla and convinces her
to leave the city for her own safety.

00:10:57.999 --> 00:11:01.360
After Marla gets on a bus out of the city,
the Man turns himself over to the police and

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.930
tells them about Project Mayhem.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.760
He reveals that Tyler wants to bomb key facilities
in the business district to erase the records

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.089
of credit card debts.

00:11:08.089 --> 00:11:11.269
The lead detective listens intently to the
details of the plans, but he soon leaves the

00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:13.750
room to verify some of the information.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.889
With the lead detective out of the way, the
three remaining officers in the room start

00:11:16.889 --> 00:11:18.930
commending the Man about Project Mayhem.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:22.079
However, they tell him that they have to castrate
him because he apparently ordered them to

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:25.899
take the testicles of anyone who interferes
with the group's plans, including him.

00:11:25.899 --> 00:11:29.100
As the officers prepare to cut him, the lead
detective knocks on the door and tells them

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.990
to pay a visit to Tyler's house.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.750
The Man manages to grab an officer's gun and
escape from the police station.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.899
He heads straight to one of the buildings
on Tyler's list to look for the bomb.

00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:40.770
He finds it in the parking garage and tries
to disarm it, thinking that he would also

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.850
know how to do it because Tyler knows.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.089
When he manages to deactivate the bomb, Tyler
starts beating him up.

00:11:46.089 --> 00:11:50.139
The surveillance camera monitors, however,
reveal that he's only fighting with himself.

00:11:50.139 --> 00:11:53.580
Tyler then throws the Man down the stairs,
rendering him unconscious.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.240
When the Man wakes up, he finds himself tied
up in a room with Tyler holding a gun to his

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.240
mouth.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.470
The Man begs Tyler to abandon his plan, but
Tyler insists that the project must be carried

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.699
out to free people from consumerism.

00:12:03.699 --> 00:12:07.540
Tyler assures him that no one will die from
the explosions because the buildings are empty.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.339
The Man soon realizes that the gun isn't really
in Tyler's hands but in his own.

00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:14.579
He then tells Tyler that his eyes have been
opened and puts the gun in his mouth.

00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:18.689
However, when he pulls the trigger, the bullet
exits to the side of his face, close to the

00:12:18.689 --> 00:12:19.689
ear.

00:12:19.689 --> 00:12:22.759
Tyler, who has a gaping wound on the back
of his head, falls to the ground and disappears.

00:12:22.759 --> 00:12:26.250
Members of the club soon arrive, bringing
Marla with them.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.560
The Man tells them to leave Marla with him
and wait for him downstairs.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.870
After they leave, Marla starts berating the
Man for sending a gang after her, but she

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.390
stops in shock when she sees the wound on
his head.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:39.009
As soon as the Man tells her that everything
will be fine, the bombs start exploding, sending

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:40.999
the buildings around them into freefall.

00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:44.180
As more buildings collapse, the Man tells
Marla that she met him at a strange time in

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:53.769
his life.
