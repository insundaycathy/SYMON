00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.760
Welcome to Slash Forward. Today we’re&nbsp;
going to ponder a scenario that is likely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.000
better left to the imagination. So, imagine&nbsp;
if you will, moving out to the country with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.560
dreams of becoming a small town physician&nbsp;
only to discover the market has evaporated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.800
you didn’t spend enough to get a good inspection&nbsp;
on your new home, and you’re living directly in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.560
the middle of a prime spider orgy melting pot that&nbsp;
consists of a highly aggressive and organized,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.480
previously undescribed Venezuelan murder spider&nbsp;
linking up with the most robust local variety.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.840
As pets begin to go missing and people around town&nbsp;
begin dying mysteriously, you find yourself unable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.800
to mount a solid investigation or elicit any&nbsp;
sort of cooperation due to your lack of social&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.080
currency. As a true arachnophobe, when things do&nbsp;
go well, the ultimate solution ends up being the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.640
worst possible scenario that could be created&nbsp;
for you. What options would be open to you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.440
when mother nature herself has decided to hit&nbsp;
the self-destruct button? Is there even enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.320
fire available, and would it burn at a sufficient&nbsp;
heat to rid the town of this scourge? In order to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.920
try to figure this all out, we’re going to&nbsp;
summon our courage and be brave and examine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.920
the 1990 creature-feature Arachnophobia. Yes, we&nbsp;
have to do it, I’ve already watched the movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.840
Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for any missed&nbsp;
opportunities and leave a comment with any tips&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.560
or tricks you have developed for managing spider&nbsp;
situations in your personal life. Let’s get to it.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.680
We open over a rainforest at dusk, and take a&nbsp;
trip down the lazy river. Deep in the heart of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.280
forest Mr. Manley is eventually delivered to Dr.&nbsp;
Atherton’s camp. Arriving late, he is immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.320
whisked off toward the wilderness. He’s tasked&nbsp;
with photographing their venture into a Tpui

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.960
On the way in, Manley is provided the helpful&nbsp;
warning that much of the fauna here would desire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.440
to digest his nutrient rich flesh (pink something,&nbsp;
but may have already put this elsewhere?) So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.520
it’s best to try not to touch or be touched by&nbsp;
anything...in the dense Venezuelan rainforest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.400
We get some big Jurassic Park vibes as they&nbsp;
touch down near a lush sinkhole. The equipment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.360
is lowered to the bottom as they prepare to hike&nbsp;
it - guideless, as the tribesman who has agreed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.200
assist them only promised to take them as far as&nbsp;
the trailhead, apparently. Well, thanks I guess.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.920
They reunite with their equipment and Manley&nbsp;
faceplants his way into a terrible discovery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.000
which is brushed off as they proceed deep&nbsp;
into the bellybutton of the wilderness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.520
They find a nice, big tree and&nbsp;
begin setting up. The plan?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.440
Smoke ‘em if you got ‘em! They don’t have&nbsp;
to wait long before untold quantities of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.800
specimens rain down on them, with about 10%&nbsp;
actually landing in the jars they set up.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.440
As they sift through, greedy for new discoveries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.560
they hear some louder thuds and find a collection&nbsp;
of big honkin’ spiders. They’re amazed to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.120
that they survived the smokeshow, so they&nbsp;
snag a couple of samples plus one stowaway.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.440
Back at camp it’s discovered that these are&nbsp;
soldier spiders - they have no reproductive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.240
organs, and likely serve a single General.&nbsp;
Fascinating as this all is, Manley needs to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.200
go try to nap off his fever. Unfortunately,&nbsp;
he has an unwelcome bedfellow which sinks its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.040
bite-things into him, exacerbating his already&nbsp;
present illness to a significant degree. When he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.920
is found, they presume he succumbed to his fever,&nbsp;
allowing them to proceed with a clean conscience.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.480
With no reverence for the empty shell, they&nbsp;
strip his belongings of any valuable filmstock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.440
and send his empty meat suit back stateside&nbsp;
in a shipping crate sans packing materials,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.400
but with one more spider&nbsp;
than is typically desirable.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.000
On the other side of the water we catch up&nbsp;
with the hearse as it delivers him to a simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.200
smalltown funeral home. Irv cracks the top and&nbsp;
then makes a quick call about the open casket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.040
situation. You see, big Roy’s taken advantage of&nbsp;
the long trip over to turn Manley into his own,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.040
personal Bento box. He then shuffles&nbsp;
out, scaring off the domestics,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.960
before being granted fast travel by&nbsp;
a passing crow. He manages to end the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.960
livery service right near an old barn right&nbsp;
as the Jennings roll up to their new home.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.800
Here we meet Ross, who has arrived in&nbsp;
Canaima with his family to raise his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.680
children in a nurturing environment, take over&nbsp;
the practice of the soon-to-retire town physician,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.320
and to find enough space to stretch out and&nbsp;
build a bitchin wine cellar. Tom rushes out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.880
to complain that there’s a spider on his stuff.&nbsp;
In this household, it's the wife's duty to handle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.600
these situations, so Molly gently removes the&nbsp;
spider and gives her a new home in the barn.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.000
That evening, the couple briefly discusses&nbsp;
their anxieties and expectations around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.680
their new life away from the city,&nbsp;
and provide each other carnal comfort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.640
while barnside a couple of new acquaintances&nbsp;
come together in similar, sensual pleasure.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.880
The next day we find Ross in dire straits&nbsp;
- old man Metcalf has thought it over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.960
and decided that he wants to postpone his&nbsp;
retirement. To add to this, Sheriff Parsons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.520
declines to show the reverence Ross feels&nbsp;
is owed to the new hot-shot young doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.240
Ms. Hollins comes to his rescue, helping him&nbsp;
navigate the town politics and, recognizing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.120
need for some fresh blood in the medical field,&nbsp;
offers to be his first patient. Sure enough,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.600
utilizing more recent medical information,&nbsp;
he is able to take her off her hypertension&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.560
medication as it’s not recommended based on her&nbsp;
results. Margaret then offers to throw Ross an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.120
open house to help him meet and network with&nbsp;
the townsfolk and build up his patient base.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.280
Meanwhile, bored at home, Molly decides&nbsp;
to scope out their fully-furnished barn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.280
to see if she can get any good shots.&nbsp;
Here she finds nature hard at work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.000
and becomes enamoured with its&nbsp;
boundless majesty - beautiful.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.040
That evening, Molly suggests Ross face down this&nbsp;
web as a form of acclimation therapy to get over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.080
his fear of spiders. On the way out we learn that&nbsp;
his crippling fear stems from his first memory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.680
as a baby. A disgusting, hairy spider invaded&nbsp;
his crib and crawled all over his helpless body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.920
instilling in him an instinct to freeze in&nbsp;
response to a spider’s threat. Regardless,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.360
he climbs the ladder and takes a&nbsp;
face shot from a dessicated rat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.120
and the couple runs off giggling&nbsp;
while a bubbling mass throbs nearby.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.840
The next day we see that there are party’s all&nbsp;
over town - Ross is busy trying to get between the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.400
bluehairs and their lust for deviled eggs so he&nbsp;
can talk medical conditions and their treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.560
While back at the barn, the broodlings are&nbsp;
absolutely popping off and venturing into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.080
surrounding areas. As the guests filter out, and&nbsp;
Margaret basks in the glow of a successful party,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.280
an unassuming arachnid lies in wait. It seeks&nbsp;
to grow fat on the housecat’s sweet juices.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.400
Unfortunately, after being put out, Ms. Hollins&nbsp;
is now the only animal left in the house.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.280
The next day, while working in the cellar, Ross&nbsp;
discovers why it’s worth spending a bit extra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.000
on an experienced home inspector. Molly offers&nbsp;
to call the exterminator if Ross goes to check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.640
on Margaret who she can’t reach. When he gets&nbsp;
there, the paper is uncollected and the cat is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.160
still outside. In the aftermath, Metcalf declares&nbsp;
her dead by heart attack, which they blame on Ross&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.280
taking her off her meds. With no authority&nbsp;
or influence, Ross is unable to compel them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.160
to conduct an autopsy to be sure. However,&nbsp;
in a positive turn of events, Mr. Beechwood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.720
takes pity on Ross and requests he come by the&nbsp;
gym later so he can throw him some business.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.960
We then get the pleasure of meeting Delbert, who&nbsp;
arrives at the Jennings residence to assess their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.960
termite problem. The main points to take&nbsp;
away here are that Delbert’s a goofball,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.440
as implied by his musical accompaniment .&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.720
And also that aside from the rotted wood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.640
he curiously doesn’t find any&nbsp;
actual presence of termites.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.040
While this is going down, Ross arrives at the&nbsp;
gym. He and Henry exchange pleasantries about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.640
rural life, but also note the recent, conspicuous&nbsp;
absence of crickets singing their evening song.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.520
Then Ross heads down the line, cupping some&nbsp;
sacks and making himself a quick 50 bucks.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.400
Afterward at practice, we see the brood has been&nbsp;
spreading through town, with one soldier even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:32.240
finding its way into Miller’s helmet. So, as the&nbsp;
boys run a play action nickel with an audible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.280
Miller ends up going down and declines to get&nbsp;
back up. Ross sets aside his notations of scrotal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.320
tenacity to rush out and provide aid. But after&nbsp;
missing the spider when it casually saunters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.240
out of the helmet, they’re left holding their&nbsp;
own scrotes wondering what the hell happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.200
We learn later that this series of events has&nbsp;
earned Ross the unfortunate moniker Dr. Death.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.960
Lamenting the recent misfortune&nbsp;
brought upon them by his upstart rival,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:01.040
Metcalf decides to relax by slipping his slender&nbsp;
hog into the comforting warmth of his loafers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.440
but gets bit. He is immediately thrown into&nbsp;
a sizeable seizure, providing the key bit of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.600
evidence he would need to try to crack&nbsp;
this thing wide open - except he’s DOA.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.120
However, with him now out of the way,&nbsp;
Ross is able to convince the county&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.600
coroner to perform an autopsy. Although&nbsp;
as the town’s new physician by default,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.560
Ross barely has a chance to follow up on it.&nbsp;
When complete, the coroner does confirm a minute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.200
amount of an unidentified toxin was found in&nbsp;
Metcalf’s system. With something to go on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.880
Ross calls for some exhumations&nbsp;
to gather additional evidence.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.440
In the meantime, he does warn the family to be&nbsp;
wary of the dangers of spiders and the importance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.160
of steering clear of those you see. He then does&nbsp;
research into the night, and falls victim to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.520
rabid cricket attack - a lone survivor of the&nbsp;
unseen spider-cricket war happening all around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.560
him. While he’s busy diddling that one, a couple&nbsp;
of boss spiders pull an egg sack into his cellar.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:56.240
His research leads him to Dr. Atherton - the&nbsp;
top man on the west coast whose curiosity is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.560
piqued when the town named Canaima holds some&nbsp;
vague recognition in the back of his mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.560
So he sends his assistant Collins to check&nbsp;
it out, and he is lucky to arrive just in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.120
time for them to start examining some rotting&nbsp;
corpses. Before he can step out for a quick puke,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.960
they find bite marks on each of the&nbsp;
bodies. The next step would be quarantine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:18.400
but this exceeds his authority, so he calls Dr.&nbsp;
Atherton to confirm his expertise is required.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.400
The next day a crack team of arthropod&nbsp;
enthusiasts enter Margaret’s home to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.600
search out the culprit. With evidence&nbsp;
that it’s set up shop in the backyard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.640
they know they’re closing in. As they ponder&nbsp;
this, Lloyd finds the prize in his cereal box.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.880
Since the preference would be to find a live&nbsp;
one, they continue on and do eventually end up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.040
in a staring contest with the harbinger of&nbsp;
their doom. Collins convinces Ross to run a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:45.200
distraction so he can nab it, as if it doesn’t&nbsp;
have an abundance of eyes. But it does work.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.520
Meanwhile, at the Beechwood residence,&nbsp;
the spiders are practically having a party&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:55.440
as one uses the playful tickling of the water to&nbsp;
blend in and descend Becky’s torso. The end result&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:01.200
is a post-puberty nightmare. They call in Delbert&nbsp;
for an emergency extraction of the pests and, upon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.080
running across one on the back deck, he finds this&nbsp;
breed to be remarkably impervious to the typical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:13.520
spray formula. But he always has the boot as a&nbsp;
back up. Del then saunters off like a true badass.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.160
Atherton finally shows up and learns that Ross has&nbsp;
connected the dots for him between the excursion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.640
in Venezuela and Manley the photographer,&nbsp;
who was a resident of their town. They then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.920
inspect the specimen’s triple sacks and test its&nbsp;
venom, which has an alarmingly immediate effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:33.040
Atherton then lays it all out - these dickless&nbsp;
soldiers are part of a highly organized colony,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.960
the likes of which have only been seen&nbsp;
in the Venezuelan sample. It’s an apex&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.760
species led by a general dickslanger that,&nbsp;
in this environment, is no longer bound by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.920
geography. If the queen is able to finish a&nbsp;
breeding cycle, the outcome will be a whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.800
host of child-bearing offspring that will look&nbsp;
to expand out to new territory, so game over.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.560
They presume the point of origin to be the&nbsp;
mortuary where the casket was received. And,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.760
since Irv has the phone off the hook, they posse&nbsp;
up. We find Irv in a social media blackout so he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.560
and his wife can enjoy Wheel of Fortune -&nbsp;
a tradition that severely dates this movie.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:12.640
Along the way, Collins discusses the ideal&nbsp;
nest location I like the cut of your jib,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:21.520
my friend Where do I sign up? But, by the time&nbsp;
they arrive, the Kendall's have been sucked dry.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.360
When Atherton goes to leave the office,&nbsp;
Molly’s photography sets him off in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.680
different direction. He and Lloyd roll up&nbsp;
to the barn and, luckily, he brought a jar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:35.120
so they should be all good. Atherton sends Lloyd&nbsp;
off to fetch the others. Except after failing to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.760
find the nest, they’ve already figured out the&nbsp;
correct location based on the radius of initial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:45.280
victims. As they drive in that direction, Delbert&nbsp;
points out that the barn is not ideal for a nest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.400
But he’s casting his pearls before swine&nbsp;
as they dismiss his valuable input.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:56.000
Back at the barn, Atherton bafflingly enters the&nbsp;
den and rings the dinner bell, ultimately reaping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.360
what he sows. Then the trio arrives and Delbert&nbsp;
uncorks his private stock of insecticide, made of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.640
his own formula that proves to be fairly caustic.&nbsp;
He employs it as the others go to check the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.200
Ross ventures in real slow and quiet like,&nbsp;
creeping out his family in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.440
Then they find a real good reason to be creeped&nbsp;
out, and are forced to take to the stairs to hide.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.080
Unfortunately, doors are essentially useless&nbsp;
in this scenario as their assailants file&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.200
in through every crack and crevice, looking to&nbsp;
find warmth in all of their cracks and crevices.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:30.000
As they exit, Ross delays too long, forcing&nbsp;
him back into the house. Delbert tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.280
work his way in from the outside&nbsp;
as Ross takes the elevator down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.640
Unfortunately he pressed the button&nbsp;
for the basement rather than the lobby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.800
Now every itch feels like spiders to&nbsp;
him, but the area is actually relatively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.520
arachnid-free - due to the presence of the&nbsp;
queen, of course. He attempts to excuse himself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.960
but is relentlessly pursued. Despite the size&nbsp;
differential, he can barely do more than flaccidly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:55.760
swat at her. But then she surprises him into&nbsp;
scream-tossing his shovel into the breaker box.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:01.440
He then searches for and finds the egg sack, which&nbsp;
is pulsating in a rhythmically seductive way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.760
He goes to innocently burn it to a crisp&nbsp;
when the General rears his ugly head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.400
Ross ends up stuck under what must be a&nbsp;
full ten to fifteen pounds of wine rack,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.120
but he manages to get out&nbsp;
somehow and chases him down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.200
with a makeshift flamethrower - and dammit&nbsp;
if he doesn’t start having some fun with it.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.600
He listens acutely for any movement, and&nbsp;
readies himself. But is not ready enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.680
In the ensuing struggle he ends up supine&nbsp;
with that hairy bitch crawling up his leg,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:31.120
reverting him to a baby-like state in which he&nbsp;
is frozen in fear. He uses a wayward stick to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.360
catapult the General across the room, and&nbsp;
then pulls off a lucky nail gun shot that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.640
sends him into the nest - annihilating&nbsp;
the entire species - a truly sad story.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.880
As we close the movie, we find this all to&nbsp;
have been an indictment of country living&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.960
as they happily settle back into their San&nbsp;
Francisco apartment, never addressing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:54.080
question of how they’re going to raise their kids&nbsp;
in the city. And then nature gets the last laugh.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.400
That was an effective and harrowing horror&nbsp;
movie, despite the attempts to lighten the tone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.520
I would love to know in the comments if&nbsp;
you can think of any horror movie that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.440
has since presented such a specific&nbsp;
and simple threat as effectively.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.640
As we now move to examine the most&nbsp;
practical strategies for survival,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.320
I think it’s important to first acknowledge&nbsp;
the ways in which different types of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.160
may respond to this type of scenario in very&nbsp;
different ways. To do that, we’re going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.440
take a moment to review the impact evolution has&nbsp;
on some of our responses to specific dangers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.080
Deep down somewhere in the depths of our&nbsp;
brains, possibly in the pre-primate portions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:31.280
lurks a natural instinct to avoid sudden and&nbsp;
unexpected dangers. It’s what helps animals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:36.240
survive in the wilderness and, in certain cases,&nbsp;
it is most effectively employed in the avoidance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.200
of very specific hazards. As an illustrative&nbsp;
example, let's take a moment to enjoy the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.160
feline involuntary response to an unexpected&nbsp;
cucumber. The sudden appearance invokes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.880
deeply ingrained response cats have learned to&nbsp;
exhibit when presented with serpentine threats.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.600
I have my own anecdotal experience of a similar&nbsp;
type. Once, after returning home from a road trip,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.400
I was walking by my rental car when some slender&nbsp;
little finger-like legs started reaching out from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.960
the wheel well. I caught this only out of the&nbsp;
corner of my eye and instantly jumped sideways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:09.760
away from the car. When I looked over, I saw that&nbsp;
a praying mantis had hitched a ride from somewhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.080
and was now checking out its new environment.&nbsp;
The thing is, as soon as I saw what it was,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.800
all the adrenaline and anxiety that had&nbsp;
instantaneously gripped me had washed away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.360
There was something instinctual, specifically&nbsp;
about the spider possibility, that prompted an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.240
automatic response from my body. This is something&nbsp;
to consider as we discuss our options, but is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:33.200
important to acknowledge in that it’s exhibited&nbsp;
behaviorally in the movie. One of the lovers of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:38.880
high school football practice had an instinctual&nbsp;
response to spider presence without ever even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.120
seeing it. Collins does point out, when he’s&nbsp;
trying to convince Ross to help him, that we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:48.080
a particular neural transmitter designed to help&nbsp;
us move past the fear, but it also seems a healthy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.880
dose of fear is a benefit in terms of survival.&nbsp;
This is somewhat confirmed by Ross defeating the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.600
queen by way of an impulsive fear response. In&nbsp;
addition, it should be noted that the converse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.720
could get you in more trouble as those among us&nbsp;
who are disinclined to fear spiders also seem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.840
more likely to want to give them a hug and cuddle&nbsp;
instead, which is not recommended in this case.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.200
Considering that, let’s take a look at&nbsp;
a few key points of interest here. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.960
the obvious first step is to decline&nbsp;
to go where one doesn’t belong or bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:19.120
things that don’t belong back to other&nbsp;
areas. The problem is that Dr. Atherton,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.280
as is likely the case with many scholars looking&nbsp;
to make a name for themselves in their field,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:28.080
is just too thirsty for knowledge and the prestige&nbsp;
that comes with novel discovery. This is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.720
balanced sufficiently with a similarly robust&nbsp;
reverence for the destructive power of nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.520
As an example, as you go to seek out your tpui,&nbsp;
if the locals are unwilling to go to a place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.160
you should probably avoid those places. Or, at&nbsp;
the very least, you could inquire as to what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.240
legends or folklore have caused them to take&nbsp;
their current position to get a better idea of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.480
what you’re walking into. Because, it’s certainly&nbsp;
not the butterflies that are the problem here.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.200
This is further compounded with the method by&nbsp;
which they gather their samples. The departure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:56.320
of their guide is accentuated when Manley sticks&nbsp;
his face in a web of a sufficient size to require&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.800
taking a pause and a consult before moving&nbsp;
forward. Despite this they do what they came&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.520
for and greedily collect their precious samples&nbsp;
in a way that demonstrates a wanton disregard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.680
for the sanctity of nature. You really&nbsp;
are asking for it when you drop a fat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.400
deuce on mother earth...figuratively,&nbsp;
it’s pretty much impossible to avoid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.000
literally deucing on the earth, and in&nbsp;
many ways is actually, very helpful.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.080
But that’s just a cautionary tale. Most of us&nbsp;
are not going to the Venezuelan rainforest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.800
nor are we returning with unregistered biological&nbsp;
material. So, we should really be focusing our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.760
energies on what to do in a domestic situation&nbsp;
in which a threat currently exists. The first,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.400
obvious answer, if you live in the sort of area&nbsp;
with sizable spiders, is to keep your eyes open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:41.040
at all times. Sometimes the upper corners of&nbsp;
rooms do surprise us, because we’re used to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:46.560
having a central focus at eye level or below. But&nbsp;
it’s always a good idea to take a glance about to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.040
verify what’s lurking just outside your field&nbsp;
of view. This would have been of great benefit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:56.160
in the shower especially where the water source&nbsp;
itself was engulfed in webbing. As paranoid as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.960
checking everywhere for spiders all the time may&nbsp;
seem, it’s doubly important in this scenario,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.160
because you’re going to be removing your clothes.&nbsp;
Aside from the easy access to biteable areas,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.760
having a large insect on your naked body only&nbsp;
ensures some deep, emotional scars to go along&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.720
with any physical injuries you may sustain. There&nbsp;
are also a variety of simple, daily preparations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.200
like shaking out your clothes before putting&nbsp;
them on, and storing your shoes upside down.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.760
But then, if an engagement is unavoidable, you&nbsp;
have to engage in the correct way. It doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.040
actually bother me at all that insecticides don’t&nbsp;
work, because I don’t really abide by poisons. If&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.520
you put out some rat poison, or spray a cockroach&nbsp;
with some severe chemical that doesn’t work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.400
then you just have a chemical coated, angry&nbsp;
insect residing with you in some hidden location,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.960
tracking it’s nasty chemicals all over&nbsp;
or, especially bad in the case of the rat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.080
dying later in a hidden location you can’t get to.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.560
Now you’re living in filth. No, once&nbsp;
you go in, it’s time to go all in.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:56.560
Of course, the goal is still to minimize&nbsp;
the risk of physical contact. Because it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.720
equally awkward to injure but not kill&nbsp;
some large crawly thing that then runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:06.000
off somewhere hidden to plot its revenge. Who&nbsp;
hasn’t ended a standoff with an encyclopedia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.520
only to return sometime later to clean up and&nbsp;
find no bug carcass underneath. That’s terrifying.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.520
As an example we’ll review the strategy Ross&nbsp;
used against the coat hook shadow in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.560
bedroom at night. This is a safe one, because it&nbsp;
wasn’t actually a giant spider, so we don’t have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.600
to worry. Now, if you even suspect a spider of&nbsp;
anywhere near this size, why do you have a rolled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:30.960
up magazine? The primary goal should be to kill it&nbsp;
in a way that pins it to its location to ensure it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.360
doesn’t skitter away or circle back on you, but&nbsp;
from a sufficient distance that you have time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.400
for a second chance should you fail in the first.&nbsp;
There is a proportional relationship between the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.520
size and danger of the insect in question and&nbsp;
how long your device should be. In this case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.000
I’m thinking a closet rod...possibly the&nbsp;
backside of an emptied drawer from your dresser.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.200
The key is to be creative, and few things promote&nbsp;
innovative problem solving like fear of death.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.200
Using a shorter melee weapon&nbsp;
could be okay in some scenarios,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.320
like using the towel against the&nbsp;
horde at the end. In this case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.800
you’re alive through sheer luck anyway.&nbsp;
You’re not facing down an individual enemy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.320
lying in wait and intending to kill it, you’re&nbsp;
just trying to keep them away from your skin.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.320
Although, this rule would still apply if&nbsp;
you intend to capture rather than kill,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.320
like during the face off. This bitch&nbsp;
is staring directly into your face and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.240
matching your movement. A wine glass is&nbsp;
insufficient in that it requires you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.520
get too close to realistically&nbsp;
secure a successful capture.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.000
Really we’re establishing the importance of&nbsp;
keeping an appropriate distance. Your enemy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.240
is smaller and quicker. You are going to want to&nbsp;
leave yourself some lead time to get out of its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.800
way and avoid it. For instance, after all Ross&nbsp;
had been through, was he so full of himself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.120
so confident in his own abilities, that he would&nbsp;
search for the General by putting his face up to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:48.320
the various places he thought it might be hiding?&nbsp;
Who among us, when tracking a large, bug surprise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:53.120
would get their face this close to where you&nbsp;
suspect the bug may be? This is ludicrous.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.240
Moving one level higher, there&nbsp;
are broader concerns at play here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.720
Aside from managing the 1v1, you still have to&nbsp;
come up with viable strategies for taking down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.800
the brood as a whole. Luckily, due to the&nbsp;
short life span of the sexless soldiers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.200
this mostly revolves around finding the nest and&nbsp;
ensuring the queen doesn’t get a chance to mate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.760
which happens to be one of my specialties.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.320
The first step is to not enter the barn.&nbsp;
If you do, certainly don’t go into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.720
midst of their feeding den. The threat&nbsp;
is somewhat known, but somewhat unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.360
Why prompt it to come to you rather than&nbsp;
pursue it after ascertaining its location?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:30.560
What was the plan here? He knows the soldiers are&nbsp;
fast and quick to bite, and I’ve rarely seen a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.120
man more pink and delicious than Atherton&nbsp;
here. You stay back and stick together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.920
Approach the house quickly if there are no signs&nbsp;
of danger and make your intent known to the family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:45.000
immediately. Call them to you and usher them&nbsp;
away. Be wary, but don’t hesitate, and there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.760
is no reason to seek out individual spiders&nbsp;
here. The main goal is safety and containment.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.560
This is why the most obvious final solution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.317
is fire. If you’ve ever seen the clock spider&nbsp;
picture, my initial instinct when confronted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:53.316 --> 00:21:54.400
with that is to deliver a hatchet to the thorax,&nbsp;
then douse the place and light a match. You simply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.240
can’t live there anymore. I know it’s hard&nbsp;
when you’re talking about all your earthly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.960
possessions, but the situation really&nbsp;
does call for fire applied liberally and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.320
indiscriminately. If you want to be&nbsp;
ready to repel your spider overlords,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.960
you have to be prepared to walk away at a&nbsp;
moment’s notice. It’s like Heat, except if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.000
Bobby De Niro were referring to a real-life&nbsp;
prepared response to a spider infestation.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.280
If you do happen to find yourself&nbsp;
in the depths and going toe-to-toe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:23.680
this may be the one point where having an&nbsp;
unreasonable affinity toward spiders could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.880
become beneficial. Because this point&nbsp;
is exactly where you would want to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.040
the courage to begin hugging. Hugging&nbsp;
aggressively for the sake of salvation.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:39.840
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;
my donors, memorialized in the hall of headshots.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.640
I have a website set up where you can&nbsp;
support the channel through donations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:55.680
or merch. Any donation unlocks uncensored&nbsp;
movie reviews of Lifeforce and Under the Skin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.640
with others to be added over&nbsp;
time. If you enjoyed the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.840
I’d love for you to become a part of the&nbsp;
channel by subscribing. Thanks for watching.
