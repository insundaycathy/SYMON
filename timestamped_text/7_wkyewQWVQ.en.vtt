00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:08.080
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going to&nbsp;
explain a Japanese post-apocalyptic action film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.920
called “Attack on Titan,” Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.680
Over a hundred years ago, gigantic monstrous&nbsp;
humanoids called the Titans suddenly appeared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.800
on the earth. They fed on any humans they could&nbsp;
get their hand on. Humans were not at the top&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.400
of the food chain anymore, and soon, their&nbsp;
population started to decrease. Even after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.400
many civilizations were wiped out, mankind hadn’t&nbsp;
found a way to fight the Titans. So instead, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.480
settled on limiting their freedom to be safe. The&nbsp;
surviving humans built massive concentric walls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.480
taller than the Titans, around an area to prevent&nbsp;
invasion. Two circular walls were constructed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.000
one inside the other, to ensure double protection.&nbsp;
The outer space was called the outer district,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.960
and the inner was called the inner district.&nbsp;
Inside those walls, they could live a peaceful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.560
life. However, the walls didn’t guarantee&nbsp;
protection. And even after a hundred years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.760
people live in fear of the Titans. 
The protagonist of the movie is a young man named&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.120
Eren Yeager, who lives in the outer district.&nbsp;
He dreams of going beyond the walls someday to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.800
explore the world. He frequently boasts about the&nbsp;
seas and oceans of the outer world to his friends,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.240
Armin and Mikasa. One day, they decide to go to&nbsp;
the border and try climbing the wall to jump to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.880
the other side. When they reach closer to the&nbsp;
border, the group is shocked to see the size&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.640
of the wall. Armin and Mikasa are skeptical of&nbsp;
the idea claiming that the Titans can still be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.600
outside. But Eren insists that it has been&nbsp;
a hundred years since anyone has seen them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.800
and with no humans to feed on, they have probably&nbsp;
died. Their conversation is cut short when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.080
border patrol comes to arrest the group for&nbsp;
being too close to the wall. Eren, infuriated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.400
by the police trying to capture his friends,&nbsp;
starts fighting them, completely ignoring the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.480
fact that he can be executed for the crime. 
Just then, captain Souda approaches them and asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.560
the soldiers to back down. He promises to punish&nbsp;
the group personally and sends the soldiers away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.320
Souda understands Eren’s desire for freedom&nbsp;
but criticizes his actions as childish.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.600
He then informs the group of a military approach&nbsp;
to explore beyond the walls. He explains that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.560
the government has sent some soldiers outside&nbsp;
to inspect the situation so Eren doesn’t have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.800
to put his life in danger. All of a sudden, a&nbsp;
loud explosion startles everyone. An earthquake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.480
follows it, and the ground begins to shake. The&nbsp;
group retreats as the wall moves aggressively.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.680
Then, a view of a massive Titan on the other side&nbsp;
is seen. He lets out a loud screech and begins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.960
kicking the wall. The patrol officers watch in&nbsp;
fear, unable to do anything to stop the creature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.840
The Titan finally breaks the&nbsp;
wall and disappears into smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.080
Everything goes silent for a few seconds. Then,&nbsp;
the people see many such creatures enter the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.200
The soldiers attack the monsters with cannonballs&nbsp;
which do them little to no harm. They seem to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.720
powerful regeneration properties as the wounds&nbsp;
caused by the cannons heal at a great speed. 
&nbsp;

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.480
Soon, the Titans reach the soldiers and start&nbsp;
devouring them one by one. A soldier even commits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.520
suicide, claiming that it is better than dying at&nbsp;
the hands of the monsters. Everyone starts to run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.200
for their lives as the Titans destroy houses and&nbsp;
grab as many people as they can. Armin gets lost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.400
in the crowd while Eren and Mikasa run towards&nbsp;
the town church where people are going to hide.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.200
Mikasa notices a little child on the ground&nbsp;
about to be stepped on by the running crowd.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.000
She goes to save the child, but gets separated&nbsp;
from Eren in the process. Eren gets dragged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.240
inside the church, but the people close its&nbsp;
entrance right after, not letting anyone else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.680
get in. Eren watches his dearest friend from the&nbsp;
church’s window as she is approached by a female&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.000
Titan with terrifying teeth. Mikasa knows that&nbsp;
nothing can save her now, so she lowers her head,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.600
accepting her fate. Just then, a loud explosion&nbsp;
sends everyone inside the church backward.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.040
When Eren looks outside again, Mikasa and the&nbsp;
Titan are nowhere to be seen. He runs outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.560
looking for Mikasa, only to come across the ruins&nbsp;
of the city that once used to be his home. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.080
Eren turns around, he sees the monsters ripping&nbsp;
the church apart and devouring everyone inside. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.760
wanders into the destroyed city hopelessly. 
Cut to two years later. All survivors from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.160
previous Titan attack have moved to the inner&nbsp;
district. The military is now planning to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.880
the outer district back. After the hoard of&nbsp;
refugees moving into the inner district and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.240
abandonment of the fertile farmland of the outer&nbsp;
one, the scarcity of food started killing people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.840
If this continues, everyone will eventually die&nbsp;
of starvation. Their only option for survival&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.120
is to take over the outer district and repair the&nbsp;
broken wall. The director of the military forces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.040
is named Kubal. He gives the soldiers a heartfelt&nbsp;
speech and calls a girl named Hans on the stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.200
She is the head of the weapon of the troop. Hans&nbsp;
demonstrates a new omnidirectional mobility gear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.840
that she claims will help them fight the Titans.&nbsp;
But she attacks her own people by accident. 
&nbsp;

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.440
Then, we see Eren and Armin in the military&nbsp;
crowd. It turns out that both of them survived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.560
the attack two years ago and now have joined&nbsp;
the military. Eren wants to avenge the Titans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.560
for killing the woman he loved, Mikasa. Captain&nbsp;
Souda also survived the attack but has lost his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.840
will to live. He is now a food distributor in&nbsp;
the army and an alcoholic. The soldiers plan to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.640
invade the outer district at night when the Titans&nbsp;
will be asleep. They want to close the way that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.760
the Titan invaded the city from, so no new Titans&nbsp;
can enter. Then, they can kill the remaining ones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.120
and get their district back. Hans asks everyone&nbsp;
to move forward slowly and not make any noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.600
as the monsters are sensitive to sounds.&nbsp;
The entrance to the outside district opens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.720
and the army drives out in military vans. As they&nbsp;
move forward, the captain abruptly orders them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.960
to stop the vehicles, sensing a movement forward.&nbsp;
The soldiers slowly look around only to find cows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.720
roaming in the city. One of them, named Hiana,&nbsp;
hears a baby crying and decides to investigate it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.080
putting her life in danger. Eren follows the girl,&nbsp;
and the two end up inside a destroyed building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.840
The cry becomes clearer as they go further&nbsp;
in. Suddenly a slimy liquid falls onto Hiana.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.040
The two look up and are terrified to see&nbsp;
a massive baby Titan eating a human. 
&nbsp;

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.560
The baby falls in front of the two and starts to&nbsp;
cry. They run away outside in fear. The soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.400
start to panic because of the noise, but the&nbsp;
captain orders them to keep quiet and not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.080
attract any Titans. Suddenly, a massive hand&nbsp;
emerges out of nowhere and grabs the captain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.600
The Titans have awoken, now the soldiers are in&nbsp;
great danger. Eren and Hiana run towards the group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.480
as a massive monster follows them. They start&nbsp;
running back to the vehicles, but commander Kubal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.760
senses the danger and runs away with the vehicle&nbsp;
and the weapons. Hans from inside the vehicle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.240
asks the group to come to an abandoned building&nbsp;
nearby. The soldiers run towards the building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.360
but are surrounded by the Titans before they can&nbsp;
escape. They lose all hope when all of a sudden,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:13.520
a Titan killer and captain of the Scout Regiment,&nbsp;
Shikishima, appears. He uses a swinging device&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.880
to kill the Titans mid-air by striking the weak&nbsp;
zone behind their neck. Shikishima has a female&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.080
partner as skilled as him. The killed Titans&nbsp;
fall to the ground and evaporate. Eren finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.120
gets a glimpse of Shikishima’s friend and is&nbsp;
beyond surprised to see that she is Mikasa. 
&nbsp;

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.000
Mikasa, however, pays no attention to her old&nbsp;
friend and looks at Shikishima smiling at her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.720
The two then go to the building, followed by the&nbsp;
soldiers. It turns out that commander Kubal has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.720
appointed Shikishima to help him with the mission.&nbsp;
Shikishima saved Mikasa’s life that day and even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.440
taught her how to fight the Titans. Since then,&nbsp;
they have been working as partners living in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.480
world of Titans. Mikasa has learned the harsh&nbsp;
reality of life and doesn’t want to associate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.760
with people from her old life anymore. Later,&nbsp;
one of the soldiers blames Eren for attracting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.560
the Titans earlier and putting everyone’s life&nbsp;
in danger. The two get into a fight but are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:10.720
soon stopped by Mikasa. Shikishima asks Eren his&nbsp;
name and showcases his superiority by bringing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.120
Eren to have a chat with him in private. 
Eren tells Shikishima that he wants to learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.320
to kill the Titans and blames the monsters for&nbsp;
trapping them. Shikishima laughs at him, claiming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.880
that humans trapped themselves in, not the&nbsp;
Titans. They were too scared to fight, and their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.840
cowardness brought them where they are. He then&nbsp;
provokes Eren by calling him a coward. When Eren&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.440
denies being one, Shikishima asks him to let go&nbsp;
of his fears and fight the Titans for his freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.480
Eren then goes looking for Mikasa and finds her&nbsp;
playing a broken piano. He tries reuniting with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.920
her, but Mikasa seems nonchalant to his efforts.&nbsp;
She says that she turned into a different person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.560
when the baby she was looking after died.&nbsp;
Mikasa then reveals a bite mark on her body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.320
showing what the Titan attack had done to&nbsp;
her. They are interrupted by Shikishima,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:00.000
who feeds Mikasa an apple with his hand, showing&nbsp;
his affection towards her. A heartbroken Eren runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.280
outside and screams in agony. His only love,&nbsp;
for whom he wanted to avenge the Titans, is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.760
no longer the person she used to be.
Just then, Hiana approaches Eren and comforts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.560
him. The two return inside the building and are&nbsp;
talking as another couple beside them makes out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.880
Hiana gets emotional telling Eren about her&nbsp;
daughter, who is back in the inner district.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:24.000
She then tries to seduce Eren and forces herself&nbsp;
on him. But they are interrupted when a giant eye&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.160
stares at them through a window. It&nbsp;
suddenly drags Hiana with his mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:34.160
not giving them much time to think. Eren watches&nbsp;
as his friend is eaten by the monster. Many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.520
other Titans approach the building. Shikishima,&nbsp;
Mikasa, and other soldiers put on their gears and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.640
fight the Titans. Shikishima kills most of them&nbsp;
along with Mikasa, but many others are injured&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.800
because this is their first time fighting. The&nbsp;
explosives are the only asset that will help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.840
them get rid of the Titans in the long run, so&nbsp;
commander Kubal asks everyone to protect them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.560
Meanwhile, the couple who were making out earlier&nbsp;
are attacked, and the man dies in the encounter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.840
The woman is devastated by her lover’s death and&nbsp;
vows to avenge the creature who killed him. 
&nbsp;

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.120
Then, we see a person getting into the vehicle&nbsp;
with the explosive and driving away. The woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.760
who had just lost her lover plans to sacrifice&nbsp;
herself and jumps on the vehicle to light the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.640
explosives. She takes over the steering wheel and&nbsp;
drives towards the Titan who killed her lover.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.920
As she crashes onto the Titan, the explosion&nbsp;
blows up his legs. However, the attack doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.400
work because the Titan’s legs grow back quickly.&nbsp;
The only way to kill them is to strike on their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.640
weak spot. Eren is still on the top of the&nbsp;
building and hasn’t helped others defeat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:38.080
the Titans yet. He remembers Shikishima’s words&nbsp;
from earlier and uses the springs to attack them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:43.200
He struggles at first but manages to make his&nbsp;
first kill with a little guidance from Shikishima.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.240
However, he loses his balance right after and&nbsp;
flies directly into another Titan’s mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.880
The Titan bits off one of his legs, but Eren&nbsp;
manages to save himself by jumping onto the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.240
rooftop. Suddenly, a Titan gets hold of Armin as&nbsp;
he is trying to run away. The others try to save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.120
him as the Titan is about to eat the guy. Eren&nbsp;
whimpers in pain but doesn’t stop trying to help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.840
his friend. He drags himself towards the edge of&nbsp;
the building and leaps into the monster’s mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.800
holding it open. Armin is about to slide&nbsp;
into the monster’s throat but is saved. 
&nbsp;

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:18.320
However, Eren drops into the Titan’s stomach in&nbsp;
the process. There he lies in between several dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:24.000
bodies, one of them being Hiana. Meanwhile, Mikasa&nbsp;
and the others are on a rooftop where Armin tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.960
her about Eren’s death. Mikasa fails to hide&nbsp;
her emotions and is visibly sad to have heard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:34.560
the news. Furious, she launches at the Titans&nbsp;
and kills every single one of them. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:40.240
her fuel runs out midway, making her fall to the&nbsp;
ground. The Titan who ate Eren earlier approaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.840
Mikasa and is ready to kill her. But suddenly,&nbsp;
a hand emerges out of the creature’s mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.880
Soon, his body blows up, revealing another&nbsp;
Titan inside him. The newly formed Titan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.160
fights his own kind and kills them one by one.&nbsp;
The surviving soldiers watch in awe as they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:01.200
realize the new Titan is actually Eren. 
After killing everyone, the Titan approaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.760
the building aggressively. Eren seems to have&nbsp;
forgotten who he is and is killing everyone in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.720
sight. The soldiers retreat in fear except&nbsp;
for Mikasa, who calls Eren’s name. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:16.400
he doesn’t stop and grabs her. While looking at&nbsp;
her, he slowly gains his memory back and begins to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:22.560
recognize Mikasa. He then falls dead to the ground&nbsp;
and starts to evaporate like the other Titans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.760
Mikasa slices his weak spot open, and the human&nbsp;
Eren emerges from the creature. To everyone’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.400
surprise, he has grown his leg back with the&nbsp;
help of the creature’s regeneration powers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.920
The last Titan finally evaporates, and&nbsp;
Eren slowly gains consciousness.
