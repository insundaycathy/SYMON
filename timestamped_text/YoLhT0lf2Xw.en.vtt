00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.709
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:07.060
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of
the 2014 English-language science fiction

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.420
action film called 'Autómata'.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.820
The film was directed by Gabe Ibáñez.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.900
There will be Spoilers ahead, so please proceed
with caution.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.340
Solar flares irradiate the Earth around 20
years before the storyline takes place, killing

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.420
almost 99 percent of the world's inhabitants.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.850
The survivors congregate in a network of safe
towns and construct crude humanoid robots

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.730
known as Pilgrims to assist in the reconstruction
and operation of the hostile environment.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.969
These robots must follow two unalterable protocols:
they must not damage any form of life, and

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.180
they must not repair, modify, or alter themselves
or other robots in any manner.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.489
Initially viewed as mankind's saviour, they
are condemned to physical work after they

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.559
fail to halt desertification from progressing.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.499
Apart from the Pilgrims, society has deteriorated
owing to a lack of technology, as a lack of

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:58.640
working planes or other modes of transportation
hinders movement, automobiles are a rare commodity,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.780
and mankind is on the verge of extinction.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.610
In 2044, Jacq Vaucan, an insurance investigator
for ROC, the Pilgrims' manufacturer, examines

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.060
a report from Wallace, a police officer who
claims to have shot a robot that was altering

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.130
itself.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.430
As Jacq searches for a robot suspected of
stealing parts, he finds himself outside of

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.650
the city.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.740
It sets itself on fire when he discovers it
inside a cargo container.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.030
As he and his crew dismantle the burnt robot
to examine what was inside, they uncover a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.040
rare nuclear battery capable of powering a
robot eternally.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.040
They are able to re-power the robot, but it
burns out again when he asks why it set itself

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.570
on fire.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.670
Jacq recovers the remains and informs his
employer, Robert, that the second protocol

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.000
may be overridden by a "clocksmith," a person
who illegally alters robots.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.700
Robert, who is sceptical, dismisses this idea
but promises Jacq a move out of the city if

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.630
he can uncover proof.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.320
Jacq's pregnant wife first opposes his ideas,
but gradually changes her mind.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.840
When Jacq and Wallace go to a brothel, they
come upon Cleo, a modified robot that Wallace

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.430
shoots in the leg.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.251
When Jacq disagrees, Wallace claims that Cleo's
owner would take them to the clocksmith; Wallace

00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:11.060
also threatens to murder Jacq if he does not
divide the battery's black market earnings

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.379
with him.

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.810
Cleo's owner leads Jacq to a clocksmith named
Dr. Dupré, who swears he has no idea who

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.030
tampered with Cleo, a move that would destroy
Cleo's CPU.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.129
Jacq takes the burned robot's CPU and promises
to give her the battery if she can find out

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.159
more about the clocksmith.

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.989
Cleo begins self-repairing when Dupré instals
the updated CPU.

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.340
ROC intercepts Jacq's communication and sends
a team of assassins to Dupré's lab; nevertheless,

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.689
ROC intercepts Jacq's message and sends a
team of assassins to Dupré's lab.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.819
Dupré is slain, but Jacq manages to flee
in Cleo's car.

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.469
When Cleo leads them into a tangle of stanchions,
both cars collide, killing the assassins and

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:46.190
injuring Jacq.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.849
Cleo leads Jacq into the desert with her,
where they are joined by three other robots

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.359
who refuse to follow Jacq's commands.

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.499
The first procedure, on the other hand, requires
them to keep him alive.

00:02:56.499 --> 00:03:00.389
Jacq contacts Robert, who dispatches Wallace
to bring him back to the city so he may be

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.400
with his pregnant wife.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.829
Wallace threatens Jacq's life and murders
two of the robots who protest to his conduct;

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.810
Jacq kills Wallace with a flare pistol before
he can also kill Cleo.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.459
After stealing a battery from one of the robots,
Wallace's companion departs.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.279
Robert's boss reveals that the first Pilgrim's
precursor was a quantum mind built without

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:23.840
any security procedures or artificial limits
on its processing capability.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.799
Its creators entrusted it with developing
the security procedures that control Pilgrims

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.700
before deactivating it.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.150
No one has been able to breach the Pilgrim
security measures, according to Robert's employer,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.389
since they were established by the unfettered
quantum mind, and ROC intentionally limited

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.730
the computing capabilities of every future
AI.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.690
Before the robots grow beyond human comprehension,
ROC orders Robert to join a team intended

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.859
to murder Jacq and the mysterious clocksmith.

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.879
Conway, the commander, kills Robert and leaves
him for dead after he protests to their kidnapping

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.909
Jacq's wife and young girl.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.879
Meanwhile, Jacq encounters the robot that
is responsible for the others' modifications.

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.150
The robot claims that he and the other robots
intend to travel to a radioactive location

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.200
where humans are forbidden to travel.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.540
Jacq, who was initially suspicious, finally
believes that the robot, like mankind, developed

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.150
spontaneously.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.030
Jacq offers them his batteries after a series
of philosophical arguments, which they use

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.539
to finish a new creation, a dog/insect robot.

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.620
Jacq's car is repaired by the robots, and
he departs towards the city.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.850
Conway smashes two of the four robots when
he arrives to the robot base.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.160
Conway wounds Cleo and kills the advanced
robot as Jacq discovers the dying Robert and

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.080
returns to the outpost.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.930
All ROC assassins are killed save Conway,
who is further injured in the struggle.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.930
Conway is about to murder Jacq when the new
robot saves his life by shoving him down a

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:45.970
cliff.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.950
When Jacq is reunited with his family, he
overcomes his mistrust of the uncontrolled

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.099
robot and joins them on their journey to the
shore, while Cleo and the new robot travel

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.150
further into the radioactive desert, where
no humans can follow them.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.300
When they get to the coast, they witness the
water and learn that the Earth is healing

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.620
and that humanity still has hope.
