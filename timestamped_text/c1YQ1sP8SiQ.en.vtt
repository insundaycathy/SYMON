00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.880
Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here. Before&nbsp;
we start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.000
I’m going to recap a 2016 Korean Thriller&nbsp;
movie called Pandora. An earthquake strikes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.040
the small town where Jae lives and causes&nbsp;
explosions at the nearby nuclear power plant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.000
The situation quickly spirals out of&nbsp;
control, leading the entire nation to panic.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.040
Jae and his friends grew up in a&nbsp;
slow town near a nuclear power plant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.320
He lives with his mother, sister-in-law, and&nbsp;
nephew. The town was promised a better future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.800
by the construction of the nuclear plant as it&nbsp;
offers them jobs and stable living conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.120
But it has also taken away other&nbsp;
livelihoods such as tourism and fishery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.080
This makes people in his town don't have&nbsp;
other choices besides working at the plant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.400
He hates his job and desperately wants out,&nbsp;
but feels duty-bound to stay with his family.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.240
One day, he tells his girlfriend, Yeon, that&nbsp;
he is planning to leave the town and go abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.280
This makes her angry at him as she doesn’t have&nbsp;
anyone else to rely on in the town besides him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.040
His mother also opposes his plan despite her&nbsp;
resenting the plant too. Jae's father and brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.840
were also workers at the nuclear plant, they both&nbsp;
died as a result of a working accident at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.680
plant. She sees Jae as an incapable and lazy man&nbsp;
because he lost his father's accident compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.040
money when he opened a business with the money, so&nbsp;
she can’t let him go by himself. Feeling annoyed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.080
Jae continues working at the plant. During a&nbsp;
working shift, he decides to ditch the town&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.800
and disappears. But it's already too late,&nbsp;
a disaster is waiting for him at the plant.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.560
Meanwhile in Seoul, a youthful and idealistic&nbsp;
President Kang reads a report by Park,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.600
a chief engineer at Hanbyul nuclear plant, about&nbsp;
safety concerns and maintenance corners being cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.880
at Hanbyul. The report is given directly by his&nbsp;
wife because many officials are trying to bury the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.320
report, including the prime minister and his team.&nbsp;
Knowing this, he summons the prime minister to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.280
confront him about the report. The prime minister&nbsp;
tells him that he rushed the nuclear power plant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.080
bill to revive the national economy and insists&nbsp;
to not waste government resources to quarrel about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.960
it. Park gets transferred to another place because&nbsp;
he blew the whistle about the plant situation.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.400
The disaster starts when a 6.1 magnitude&nbsp;
earthquake shakes the town and damages the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.920
power plant. Jae calls his family to make sure&nbsp;
they are okay. One of the valves is damaged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.960
and needs immediate repair. Worried about the&nbsp;
plant, Park goes back to assess the situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.160
but the other chief engineer there underestimates&nbsp;
the situation. The engineers repair the valve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.760
hastily but the pressure inside the pipe rapidly&nbsp;
increases, making the nuclear coolant pipe burst,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.280
injuring the engineer, and leaking radiation.&nbsp;
Jae sees the engineers being carried away which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.080
makes him remember what happened to his father and&nbsp;
brother. He wants to leave the plant immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.880
but his friend refuses to follow him, he gives&nbsp;
up the idea and helps the other repair the plant.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.560
Outside, the town is damaged by the earthquake&nbsp;
but all of the people survive with only minor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.600
injuries. The prime minister tries to hide the&nbsp;
plant incident but President Kang finds out about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.240
it and becomes furious. The prime minister&nbsp;
wants to cover up the accident and make the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.200
evacuation operation as small as possible&nbsp;
to prevent national panic and mass chaos.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.600
The prime minister's team convinces him that the&nbsp;
plant is equipped with control units and will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.920
soon overcome the problem. President Kang&nbsp;
doesn’t have any other choice and agrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.000
So they only notify nearby towns&nbsp;
and evacuate them silently.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.040
Jae’s family and girlfriend get into a bus and&nbsp;
evacuate with the other people from their town.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.880
In the control unit room, the engineer is&nbsp;
in panic. The nuclear containment internal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.840
pressure keeps rising and will explode if they&nbsp;
can’t figure out the solution soon. They need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.080
vent out the air inside the containment but it&nbsp;
will leak radiation into the surrounding area.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.360
The president decides to hold the venting&nbsp;
process and finish the evacuation process first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.680
Knowing about this, the workers inside&nbsp;
the plant panic and ditch their work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.800
One of the chief engineers seals the exit&nbsp;
and forces them to go back to their station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.080
The workers ignore him and try to&nbsp;
bypass the sealed door but fail.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.760
Because of the situation, Park decides to&nbsp;
vent the nuclear reactor against the order.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.240
But the system malfunctioned, forcing&nbsp;
the engineer to open the vent manually.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.080
The plant is having a nuclear meltdown and&nbsp;
when the pressure hits the limit point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.200
all hell breaks loose. The nuclear plant explodes.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.840
The explosion kills most of the workers&nbsp;
inside the plant, but Jae survives with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.120
a minor injury and helps his wounded friend to&nbsp;
get outside. On the way outside, he meets Park&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.000
and tries to get out together. The rescue team&nbsp;
arrives at the plant but the situation is bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.760
They can’t go near the plant because the radiation&nbsp;
level is too high. The prime minister insists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.560
on covering the explosion, his team denies all&nbsp;
rumors about the plant explosion to the media.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.840
At the shelter, people start questioning about&nbsp;
the situation, whether they need to go further&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.960
or not. Yeon goes back to the plant to see&nbsp;
the real situation. She is shocked after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.840
seeing that the plant has already exploded but&nbsp;
relieved when she meets Jae outside the plant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.640
But instead of going with them, Jae decides to go&nbsp;
back inside to help the others despite the high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.880
radiation level. Yeon and the others try to stop&nbsp;
him but he insists. Park also goes back inside and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.240
tells the rescue team to go closer. They finally&nbsp;
decide to go closer to the plant and spray the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.960
area with water to help bring down the radiation&nbsp;
level and pump coolant to the nuclear fuel road.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.360
Jae's friend gets treated at the medical&nbsp;
tent with the rest of the victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.200
The medical team decontaminates them with&nbsp;
water before treating them to minimize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.240
the radiation poisoning. Despite their&nbsp;
effort, the situation doesn’t look good.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.160
Yeon goes back to the shelter to&nbsp;
notify Jae’s family that he is okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.280
but she lied about his whereabouts. She also&nbsp;
tells the real situation to the other people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.120
which makes them immediately pack things&nbsp;
up and go outside the shelter to move away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.760
further. But the authorities lock them&nbsp;
inside and jam the area phone signal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.880
Preventing them to share the real&nbsp;
situation with the rest of the nation.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.040
Jae keeps helping trapped workers until nightfall.&nbsp;
He accidentally gets splashed by radiated water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.320
while helping inside. His body can’t keep&nbsp;
up with the radiation and he collapses. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.440
immediately rushed to the medical tent to receive&nbsp;
treatment. The rescue team has run out of water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.040
so they retreat to get some more. Park wonders why&nbsp;
they don’t use the seawater. He finds out that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.440
head office has forbidden them to use seawater to&nbsp;
prevent the decommissioning of the power plant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.840
This makes him angry because the higher&nbsp;
politician still thinks about the plant's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.640
functionality despite the situation. The&nbsp;
radiation level is starting to take a toll to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.000
the rescue team’s health. They are now exhausted&nbsp;
and starting to show radiation poisoning symptoms.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.200
The International Atomic Energy Agency finds&nbsp;
out about the accident and alerts the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.440
international agencies about it. Foreign&nbsp;
countries are starting to evacuate their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.720
citizens from Korea. The media started to cover&nbsp;
the explosion incident resulting in national&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.840
panic and mass chaos. The whole nation starts&nbsp;
to panic and moves away from the explosion area.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.160
Yeon notices that the authorities&nbsp;
guarding them have abandoned the shelter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.120
Together they bust down the locked gate and get&nbsp;
on the bus. A high amount of radiation has leaked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.800
outside of the plant. So they need to move further&nbsp;
away. The medical team at the medical tent also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.600
starts abandoning the victims. Only a few brave&nbsp;
ones stay there to keep treating the victims.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.480
Jae wakes up and immediately tries to&nbsp;
find his phone. He calls Yeon to tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.480
her to bring his family as far as possible&nbsp;
and promises that he will follow them soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.200
The road is way too jammed, making Yeon&nbsp;
doesn’t have any other choice than to drive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.560
on the opposite lane. But eventually, they&nbsp;
face another road jam, forcing them to walk.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.200
Park is frustrated by the situation when&nbsp;
suddenly he gets a call from the president.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.720
They start to communicate and&nbsp;
discuss the situation directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.160
President Kang takes over the control and&nbsp;
declares a state of emergency. He decides to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.360
decommission the plant and start to use seawater&nbsp;
to spray the site. Furthermore, he orders the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.160
shutdown of all remaining nuclear power plants&nbsp;
in Korea until the situation has been assessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.680
The rescue team starts to flood the nuclear core&nbsp;
with seawater, making the radiation level drop.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.120
They have one more problem. The coolant&nbsp;
level at the fuel rod tank is dropping.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.080
The earthquake cracked the floor, making the&nbsp;
coolant leak underneath. If the fuel road is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.280
in contact with the air, it will cause a bigger&nbsp;
explosion and more radiation will leak outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.800
They must seal the crack but the room&nbsp;
underneath is full of radiated water.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.400
Making it a suicide mission for&nbsp;
anyone trying to seal the crack.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.960
The president shows up on the TV to&nbsp;
announce the situation to the whole nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.040
He also begging for anyone who is willing&nbsp;
to help them with the suicide mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.080
Jae’s friend sees it and proposes to his&nbsp;
coworkers to volunteer for the mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.480
At first, they oppose the idea, but&nbsp;
because of the radiation poisoning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.120
they don’t have much longer to live anyway. So&nbsp;
they decide to do it for the sake of their family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.240
Jae-hyok calls Yeon to tell her about their&nbsp;
plan. She makes him promise to her to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.200
out alive no matter what happens. But again,&nbsp;
she lies to his family about his whereabouts.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.840
The team is getting ready for the&nbsp;
mission. It will be led by Park.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.600
They are provided with painkillers to&nbsp;
ease their pain as the room is full of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.920
radiated water. They only have 5 to 10&nbsp;
minutes each before their body gives up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.480
On the way, they see their destroyed town&nbsp;
and reminisce about their past life there.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.080
Once they are inside the plant, they gather up&nbsp;
at the room entrance. They split the team into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:31.200
several smaller teams and go inside in shifts&nbsp;
of 5 to 10 minutes. Once they can’t endure the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:37.200
radiation, the next team will continue the sealing&nbsp;
process. But unexpectedly, the crack grows bigger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.800
and is about to burst. Their plan has failed. They&nbsp;
are about to leave the plan when Jae proposes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.400
radical idea. They don’t have to seal the crack,&nbsp;
instead, they need to block the entrance and break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.720
the ceiling so the fuel road will fall down&nbsp;
and the room will become another tank itself.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.800
They start to execute the new plan, but it&nbsp;
has one flaw. One of them must sacrifice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.560
themselves and detonate the bomb inside&nbsp;
after they finish sealing up the entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.440
Jae is the only candidate as he is the only&nbsp;
one who has the skill to handle explosives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.520
He agrees to sacrifice himself and goes into the&nbsp;
room. As he waits until the sealing is done, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:19.040
radiation is taking a toll on his body. He takes&nbsp;
the whole bottle of the painkiller. He wants to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:24.320
call Yeon but his phone gets no service. He tells&nbsp;
Park to ask the president to broadcast him to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:30.080
TV so he can say goodbye to his family. Yeon gets&nbsp;
the news that Jae is on the TV so they go inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:35.440
a nearby bus and watch him from there. He says&nbsp;
his final goodbye to his family and apologizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.400
to Yeon because he can’t keep his promise.&nbsp;
After the sealing is done, the remaining team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.160
goes outside and Yae-hyeok detonates the bomb. His&nbsp;
sacrifice is not in vain as his plan is working.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.280
On the following days, the remaining team&nbsp;
dies one by one from radiation poisoning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:57.360
President Kang declares them as national heroes.&nbsp;
In the end, the nuclear power they once relied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.240
on has brought disaster upon them. They only&nbsp;
think that nuclear power plants are convenient&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.560
for people’s lives and the nation's economy, but&nbsp;
they forget about the risk hiding underneath.
