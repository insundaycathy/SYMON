00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.359
If Jigsaw asked you to join his sadistic gang
of mutilators, what would you do?

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.660
In this highly requested How to Beat video,
we’ll follow Jigsaw’s 4th round of deplorables,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.320
see if we can make better decisions, and ultimately
attempt to beat the traps in Saw 4.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.730
Think you can do better, let us know in the
comments!

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:27.579
Enjoy these How to Beat videos, like and subscribe!

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:50.120
Have a movie you’d like 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:01:02.760
me 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:20.470
to cover, reply to 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:52.700
this comment!

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.540
We start out following 2 men in a mausoleum.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.230
One has his eyes sewn shut, the other has
his mouth sewn shut.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.880
Both are wearing collars that are chained
to a machine in the middle of the room.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.250
On those collars are padlocks and keys.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.610
Each person’s key unlocks the other person’s
padlock.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.650
Naturally, the man that can’t see is aping
out because he can’t really assess what’s

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.620
going on, and the man with his mouth sewn
shut can’t communicate their situation effectively,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.590
so the blinded man tries to yank out some
slack on the chain, which pulls a pin and

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:30.930
fires up the winch.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.910
They both start getting slowly pulled into
the jaws of the winch, which, I can only surmise,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.690
ends with the collar severing their spinal
chords.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.290
The blind man doesn’t know anything other
than a machine started up and the slack on

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.900
his chain is getting pulled out.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.239
He can’t know the actual mechanism in which
he will be destroyed.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.930
I’m closing my eyes and trying to put myself
in his shoes, and I'm coming up with not much.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.099
I think his fate is more in the muted man’s
hands.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.710
What can the muted bro do?

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.680
What I wouldn’t do is try to pull against
the winch or try to hold onto something.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.540
Unless you’re Dwayne Johnson, you aren’t
stopping it, especially with those 12 inch

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.560
biceps.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.319
Probably the most effective thing to do is
pull the electrical wires and cut the power

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.570
cord with the mini axe the blind man threw
at him.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.190
Nobody in these movies understands that machines
require power to operate.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.140
The next best thing to do is jam the cogs
with either a belt or one of the other tools,

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.370
also a concept that nobody in Saw seems to
understand.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.370
He could also try looping his chain around
an object like the crowbar or one of the pillars

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.959
which would obstruct the winches mouth, but
it’s not as reliable as jamming the cogs.

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.090
The tools would likely break or bend.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.670
I don’t know how sharp that axe was, probably
not sharp, but he could try using it to cut

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.349
his mouth open so he can tell the blind man
to fucking chill so they can unlock each others

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:46.349
collars.

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.220
Now, I still wouldn’t trust the blind man
to not choke me out when I went for his key,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.040
so you’d want to keep a shiv on deck just
in case.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.560
The muted man goes straight for what would
be my last ditch move, bashing the blind man

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.440
over the head with a hammer to get the key.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.130
The mute snags the key, unlocks the padlock,
then rips his mouth-stitches out screaming.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.709
Wait, you’re telling me you could have physically
rage-ripped out your stitches this whole time,

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.280
and you only decided to do it now, after killing
the other guy, and not when your neck was

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.900
on the line and you could have saved another
person?

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.299
Wow, okay.

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.479
Across from him is another cassette and folder
that says ‘Keys to your freedom’.

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.540
Don’t ya hate it when that happens.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.440
You win the game only to be thrust into another.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.680
After Kerry’s disappearance, two FBI agents
received a key, a message which reads, “open

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.889
the door and you will find me”, and the
late Kerry’s location.

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.000
The SWAT team led by Rigg immediately raid’s
the building.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.910
Upon entry, they come across a door rigged
with some kind of device, so they cut a hole

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.830
in the door and send in the iRobot to check
it out.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.479
Rigg catches a glimpse of Kerry’s face on
the drone’s camera feed and runs through

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.220
the rigged door to try to save her.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.650
He’s a bit late though.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.520
Kerry’s chest was opened up and is now serving
a full course meal to the local rat population.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.650
It’s a bad day to be the new guy.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.060
Perez looks over Kerry’s trap and says that
Kerry had gotten the key but the padlock it

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.910
unlocked didn’t stop the trap from activating.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.800
Both Troy and Kerry’s trap’s were executions,
leading them to believe that someone besides

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.470
Jigsaw is constructing these.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.940
Hoffman thinks this was Amanda’s doing.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.410
Strahm disagrees, saying that Amanda was 110
pounds soaking wet and Jigsaw was a bedridden

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.410
cancer patient.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.040
I’m with Strahm, someone else is involved.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.040
But who..

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.320
I should point out that Saw 4 picks up after
Kerry’s abduction in Saw 3.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.710
Jeff’s game is just starting, and Amanda
and Jigsaw are still alive right now.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.400
The reason they suspect Amanda, is because
Daniel, Eric’s son, told the police that

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.300
Amanda put him in the safe.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.361
Another detective on the scene finds a bullet
casing lodged between Kerry’s body and the

00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:49.361
contraption.

00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:51.380
Hoffman tells him to run it for prints.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.860
This bullet case doesn’t fit with the crime
scene.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.330
There was no gun involved, no gunshot wound,
and no plausible way a bullet casing would

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.350
find its way into that crevice.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.229
This reeks of planted evidence, which Jigsaw’s
no stranger to.

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.449
Rigg is back at the station reviewing evidence,
obsessed with finding a way to stop Jigsaw

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:10.270
from murdering everyone around him.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.419
Hoffman tells him to go home and chill out.

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.310
That he should rest easy knowing that Eric’s
probably dead.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.960
Perez and Strahm show up and tell Hoffman
to fuck off somewhere else while they work

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.350
their FBI magic.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.240
Perez argues with Strahm about the other thing
they heard in Kerry’s message.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.509
That two other officers were in danger.

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:29.940
Strahm tells her to keep it on the DL so as
to not spread panic.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.820
Ah, the classic, don’t tell other people
they are in grave danger to ‘protect them’,

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.820
trope.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.820
Nice.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.800
Hoffman leaves with his teddy bear, and gets
abducted by pigmask while he’s filing some

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.690
paperwork.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.460
Or so the good guys are led to believe.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.960
Hoffman is actually Jigsaw’s other apprentice,
and was leaving to go abduct Jeff for their

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.960
next game.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.590
There’s no reason for the police to have
suspected Hoffman yet.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.210
Detective Fisk hits Perez and Strahm with
the news that they got a match on the bullet

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.449
casing, it’s Rigg.

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:04.870
Oh my god, Rigg was Jigsaw all along.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.699
Well boys, looks like this case is closed.

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:11.389
Sadly, Strahm is actually semi-convinced that
Rigg is involved.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.130
Apparently the FBI didn’t send their brightest.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.360
What they should be wondering is why are they
being baited towards Rigg.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.400
When Rigg gets home, he finds his wife packing
her bags.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.030
She begs him to come with her and leave all
this behind, but Rigg just can’t let go.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.419
Later that night after Tracy leaves, Rigg
hears a door open.

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:31.960
Thinking it might be Tracy, he calls out her
name and starts wandering the house trying

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.960
to find her.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.419
The silence would be worrying.

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:36.970
Tracy wouldn’t be sneaking into the house
like that.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.580
Rigg needs to grab his pistol, retreat into
his room, lock the door, and dial 911.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.100
As a SWAT team commander, he should know not
to be taking unnecessary risks, especially

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.990
when multiple detectives have been abducted
and murdered recently.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.590
If Strahm had called up Rigg and let him know
that he might be in danger, Rigg might be

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.970
a little more tactical about this situation.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.360
But no, we wouldn’t want to risk Rigg getting
anxious.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:05.639
I’m not sure tackling a jacked SWAT commando
through tarp while obstructing your own vision

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:08.020
with a pig mask was the best idea.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:13.270
We later find out that Rigg’s abductor was
Art Blank, the man who won the Mausoleum trap.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.940
He was a former business partner of John’s
that’s now being forced to orchestrate Rigg’s

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.569
game like Zep in Saw 1.

00:08:19.569 --> 00:08:24.110
If he refuses, the spine cutter he’s wearing
will cut his spine..

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.669
Art Blank had weeks of freedom to prepare
all these games, and his spine cutter is fairly

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:29.669
rudimentary.

00:08:29.669 --> 00:08:34.139
It would be pretty easy for Art to foil the
spine cutter by jamming the pincers.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:38.519
Then he could take his game’s instructions
to the police, the Gideon Meat Packing plant

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:41.789
would be raided, and the events in Saw 3 would
have been prevented.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:45.970
Hoffman would likely have been found as Jigsaw’s
rat when the teddy bear he was holding was

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.959
connected with Jeff’s traps.

00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:52.149
Maybe team Jigsaw captured and threatened
his family, but if that was the case why would

00:08:52.149 --> 00:08:53.360
they need the spine cutter.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.459
Alas, Art’s a good little boy and carries
out his orders without thoroughly assessing

00:08:57.459 --> 00:08:58.670
his options.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.329
Rigg wakes up in the tub with a question mark
on the bathroom door, and when he opens it

00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:07.899
a pin get’s pulled and the tv turns on with
Jigsaw’s message.

00:09:07.899 --> 00:09:11.139
Oh now you grab your gun.

00:09:11.139 --> 00:09:14.980
Not when you heard mysterious noises in your
empty home after your colleagues started dropping

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.230
like flies.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:20.769
Rigg is undoubtedly going to hard charge right
into this trap, but I think he has reason

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:21.769
not to.

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:25.949
He witnessed first-hand the simplicity of
Eric’s game, and how all Eric had to do

00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:27.040
was sit tight.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.019
Eric and Rigg’s games are actually very
similar in nature.

00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:34.319
He also witnessed what happened to Kerry,
and how it was her obsession that attracted

00:09:34.319 --> 00:09:35.399
Jigsaw’s attention.

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:39.339
He should know that Jigsaw’s wording is
chosen carefully, and that a correction in

00:09:39.339 --> 00:09:41.519
typical behavior is necessary.

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:46.120
Rigg just needs to hit Tracy up and have a
romantic evening with her.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.269
Rigg walks down his hallway filled with random
pictures of Eric and some broad.

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:54.489
The picture trail leads him to a room with
a stranger in a pigmask tied to a torture

00:09:54.489 --> 00:10:08.290
chair, and Jigsaw pops up on 

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:20.119
the tele again.

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:21.790
Just walk away bro.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.800
You have the unique position of knowing how
Jigsaw operates these games, and actually

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.869
being in a winnable trap.

00:10:26.869 --> 00:10:31.550
Don’t be an unreflective dumbass like Eric.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.899
Sigh.

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:38.600
God damnit.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.050
People really need to start checking for pin
triggers.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.959
Rigg has tripped like three of them now.

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:46.239
Looks like she has 60 seconds until this machine
scalps her.

00:10:46.239 --> 00:10:50.120
Easy enough, checking the cupboard for knives
that could be used to cut her hair free is

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.759
the obvious first move.

00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:54.079
Jigsaw removed all the knives though.

00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:56.519
Okay, stuff some shit into the cogs.

00:10:56.519 --> 00:10:57.519
Done.

00:10:57.519 --> 00:11:02.230
Rigg seems thoroughly overwhelmed by all the
crude machinery, so he falls back on his special

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:06.629
weapons and tactics training.

00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:11.749
Unfortunately, this only temporarily halts
it.

00:11:11.749 --> 00:11:15.649
My next suggestion was going to be to put
a bullet through her hair braid, but since

00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:20.519
you expended all your ammo unsuccessfully
shooting at the most robust areas of the machine,

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:23.540
throwing a stick in the cogs is your next
best option.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.860
Brenda cries out that the combination to the
lock is in the gears.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:31.470
Who the fuck cares or has time to communicate
and figure out a combination.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.800
And why didn’t you mention this earlier
before half your face was getting ripped off.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.050
Rigg stupidly thinks that trying to put together
the numbers in the circulating gears is a

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.050
good idea.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:45.759
Wow, you got the number 6, just a few more
rounds to get the other numbers and you can

00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:47.910
screw with the combination lock.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:54.690
Because you have time for that.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.100
All things considered, she got off pretty
lightly.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.799
I’m sure they can stitch her scalp back
on and do some plastic surgery.

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:04.449
Of course, she’d be way more fine if Rigg
wasn’t an idiot.

00:12:04.449 --> 00:12:08.350
When Rigg isn’t looking Brenda grabs a knife
under the tv and attacks him.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.839
After Rigg beats the shit out of her he plays
the cassette taped to her hand.

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:13.040
It’s for Brenda.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.829
It tells her that a cop will try to save her,
and if he is successful, then her game begins.

00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:21.949
It tells her that the cop will use the incriminating
photos all over the walls to sentence her

00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:27.430
for her pimping crimes, and that the only
way to stop him is taped underneath the T.V.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:32.170
Realistically, Brenda didn’t know that Rigg
trying to help her would start up the scalper.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.839
Warning him wasn’t possible.

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:37.929
She also didn’t know it was a knife under
the T.V. until she checked, so telling Rigg

00:12:37.929 --> 00:12:39.779
about it wasn’t possible either.

00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:43.980
Brenda also had no way of knowing that Rigg
was too preoccupied to arrest her.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.720
Still, pimping doesn’t carry that steep
of a sentence.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.220
A few years or so.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.199
Attempting to murder Rigg easily could have
led to her death, and a far worse prison sentence.

00:12:52.199 --> 00:12:58.879
She shouldn’t have attacked him and forced
him to deal the final blow.

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:05.350
Riggs runs down the hallways because he has
pressing matters.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:06.350
Eric and all.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:10.959
He finds a box with 2 keys and a note saying
‘one saves a life, one takes it away’.

00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:14.720
One of the keys is for Alexander motel room
number 261.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.389
With the scene secure, now would be a good
time to call for some police backup and let

00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:19.470
them know what's up.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:23.230
There’s literally a phone right at the end
of the hallway next to the hotel room door

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.600
your next test is in.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.160
I see no reason why he can’t make a call.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.149
While Rigg is off making bad decisions, the
FBI is hot on his tail.

00:13:31.149 --> 00:13:34.709
They got reports of shots fired at his apartment
and went to investigate.

00:13:34.709 --> 00:13:38.040
Rigg is long gone, but Brenda’s lifeless
body is still there.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.139
I don’t think scalping someone would kill
them.

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:41.779
Rigg must have a mean right hook.

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:46.189
The evidence is pointing towards Rigg being
involved in a game to save Hoffman and Eric,

00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:47.959
but they don’t have much to go off of.

00:13:47.959 --> 00:13:52.059
Rigg took the apartment key, which was the
only clue for where his next test was.

00:13:52.059 --> 00:13:56.720
Strahm notices the pictures of John’s hot
ass ex, Jill Tuck, and decides to have a chat

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.290
with her to see if she knows anything.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.519
For as smart as Strahm thinks he is, this
was a dumb move.

00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:05.179
You’re just being led around by Jigsaw,
which has never worked out well.

00:14:05.179 --> 00:14:10.399
Jill’s interrogation reveals some irrelevant
backstory about why Jigsaw is the way he is.

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:14.449
Back when John and Jill were having a baby,
a drug addict at her clinic mugged her and

00:14:14.449 --> 00:14:16.389
caused her to have a miscarriage.

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:20.850
After which John became depressed, was diagnosed
with cancer, and tried to kill himself.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.639
It was a bad month for John.

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:24.480
None of this is really helping though.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.019
Rigg shows up to the Alexander motel and checks
in.

00:14:27.019 --> 00:14:31.759
Inside his room is a box with some hair sticking
out and a picture of his wife on it saying,

00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:32.839
‘she needed you’.

00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:35.239
Looks like Tracy didn’t make it to her mom’s
house.

00:14:35.239 --> 00:14:38.550
Oh, thank god, it’s just a pigmask with
a cassette player.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.829
How many cassette players does Jigsaw have,
god damn.

00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:58.949
The cops just need to stake out a radio shack
and tail whoever is bulk buying.

00:14:58.949 --> 00:15:12.790
I’m gonna go ahead and say ignore this one.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:16.809
Rigg could open the adjacent door, find the
next clue, and avoid this whole mess.

00:15:16.809 --> 00:15:18.239
Rigg hasn’t learned his lesson.

00:15:18.239 --> 00:15:22.720
He calls Ivan up for room service and forces
him into the trap room at gunpoint.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.430
Inside there’s substantial photo and video
proof of the man’s ill deeds.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:30.369
On the drink stand is a note for Rigg and
yet another cassette player.

00:15:30.369 --> 00:15:54.139
Seriously, can we start monitoring who's buying
all these in 

00:15:54.139 --> 00:16:08.970
the year 2007.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.619
I don’t think it really matters if he kills
this man or not.

00:16:12.619 --> 00:16:17.489
Rigg decides to assume the role of Jigsaw
just this once, and forces the sick fuck to

00:16:17.489 --> 00:16:19.290
strap in to the bed’s shackles.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:23.889
On the nightstand there is a note for Rigg,
something about the school where it all began,

00:16:23.889 --> 00:16:26.069
as well as another recorder for Ivan.

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:30.479
Basically, he either sickles his eyes or has
his limbs ripped off in 60 seconds.

00:16:30.479 --> 00:16:35.600
Wouldn’t it make more sense for him to have
to choose between his Johnson or his eyes?

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.919
Maybe that would be too much..

00:16:36.919 --> 00:16:40.179
Without Rigg in the room, Ivan can cheat the
trap if possible.

00:16:40.179 --> 00:16:42.859
The sickles will drop on a fixed path to his
eyes.

00:16:42.859 --> 00:16:47.009
His head is in a horizontal vice, but he should
still be able to tilt his head up or down

00:16:47.009 --> 00:16:49.939
the inch he needs to have the sickle hit his
skull instead.

00:16:49.939 --> 00:16:53.999
The head tilt is an advanced move that Ivan
can’t seem to comprehend, so he drops the

00:16:53.999 --> 00:17:00.730
first sickle straight into his eyeball.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.079
Now it’s too late to perform the head-tilt.

00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:07.459
The sickle embedded in his facial orifice
kind of fixes his head in place.

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:12.010
He’s too much of a bitch to drop the second
sickle in time, and get’s de-limbed.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:16.409
Or I should say, dis-armed.

00:17:16.409 --> 00:17:19.939
Rigg takes a second look at that note and
has a flashback to when he beat the hell out

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:22.610
of a student's dad for abusing her at home.

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:27.079
The father’s lawyer, Art Blank, tried to
sue them, but Hoffman helped get Rigg off

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.079
the hook.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:30.200
Art was pretty pissed about it, and threatened
them.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.909
Clearly the number one suspect.

00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:34.580
I still don’t know why Rigg isn’t calling
this in.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:39.050
Rigg goes back to the school and finds that
same kid’s abusive parents nailed together.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:42.340
I also want to point out that it is flower
power week.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:47.299
I think Rigg needs to take a moment to celebrate
peace, passive resistance, and nonviolence

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:51.200
before he condemns more lives in his hasty
pursuit of justice.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.799
While Rigg is clocking in for his next Jigsaw
lesson, Strahm and Perez get called to the

00:17:55.799 --> 00:17:58.190
bloodbath he left in the apartment room.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.610
Again, Rigg took the only clue as to the next
location.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:06.889
Strahm and Perez ascertain that the room was
rented by Art Blank for the past 6 days, a

00:18:06.889 --> 00:18:11.490
criminal defense lawyer and Jigsaw’s former
business partner who went missing two weeks

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:12.490
ago.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:16.210
Art Blank owned several properties, one of
them a couple blocks away.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:21.299
Sweet, let's check it out because Jigsaw wouldn’t
anticipate that 4D chess move.

00:18:21.299 --> 00:18:25.370
In the basement of the property they find
two files left for them on a table.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:29.350
Written on the first one was the message "Open
the door and you will find me", while the

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:33.980
second message warned them: "You are in danger
of getting too close... step back."

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.309
This should be your cue to turn your badge
in.

00:18:36.309 --> 00:18:41.380
Jigsaw legitimately planned this moment 10
moves out, and you both walked his path to

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:46.759
the T. When someone is exercising that level
of omnipotence over you, continuing to assault

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:48.630
them is going to get you hurt.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.780
Back at the school Rigg is checking out the
couple's situation.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:56.240
The woman wakes up screaming that she had
won, and has a PTSD flashback to when the

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:15.980
game started and she hit play on the cassette.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:21.059
So the rods that shish kebab them together
are puncturing vital areas in her husband's

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:24.100
body, and non-vital areas in hers.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.070
Technically, she won’t bleed out if she
leaves the rods in.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.299
Pulling them out will cause her to bleed out.

00:19:29.299 --> 00:19:33.830
Knowing how her husband is a selfish, abusive
piece of shit who will try to kill her to

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.710
save himself, she needs to get yanking asap.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:41.590
The trick is to pull out the most vital rods
first so he quickly loses consciousness from

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:42.600
blood loss.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.720
This would be the ones in the neck areas,
leg area, and torso area.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.580
As for the husband, well, he heard the message
too.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.370
Preventing her from pulling the rods out is
a futile game of whack a mole.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:57.809
She can select any of the rods and start tugging,
and he has to react.

00:19:57.809 --> 00:20:00.080
Eventually she will pull them out, little
by little.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.379
What he needs to do is reach back and choke
her out.

00:20:02.379 --> 00:20:06.179
If he isn’t flexible enough for this, then
he should pull the rod out from his arm and

00:20:06.179 --> 00:20:08.230
use it to stab her through the neck.

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:09.549
Like reverse spearing.

00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:11.840
The husband doesn’t react quickly enough.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.490
The second rod the wife pulled out was the
one through his neck, which was pretty much

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:21.259
game over for him.

00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:23.830
She pulls most of the rods, but not all.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:34.530
That’s when Rigg finds her and the cassette
player next to her.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:45.710
Again, like with Ivan, it doesn’t really
matter what he does right now.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.559
These are merely lessons, not tests for him.

00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:50.669
There is no consequence for these lessons.

00:20:50.669 --> 00:20:54.130
He could shoot her in the head or unbuckle
her, wouldn’t make a difference.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.039
What will make a difference, is if he learns
to stop obsessing about saving everyone at

00:20:58.039 --> 00:20:59.140
all costs.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.549
Rigg pretty much ignores everything but the
last part about the location of his next test.

00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:05.620
This dude is really confused right now.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:10.909
He leaves Morgan to sort out her own shit,
as Jigsaw wanted, then froths over the location

00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:16.269
of the next test so he can swoop in to rescue
Eric, which is completely missing the point.

00:21:16.269 --> 00:21:18.759
If anything, Rigg should have done the opposite.

00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:23.860
He should have helped Morgan get free since
there was no consequence for it, then realized

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.080
that Jigsaw wanted him to let go of Eric.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.280
I mean shit, Rigg gave her the key to her
padlock, put his coat around her, and pulled

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.450
the fire alarm so help would be on the way.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:36.129
He literally helped her in every way except
yanking the last rod.

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:40.019
With how confused Rigg is, it’s not looking
good for Eric.

00:21:40.019 --> 00:21:44.890
The clue Rigg finds is a picture of his wife
that says, ‘Go Home’, with the G discolored.

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:50.130
Rigg somehow puts together the G from this
picture, the G on Brenda’s knife, the G

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:54.120
on Ivan’s shackle, and the G in the name
of John Kramer’s former business.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.909
And that all this means that Eric must be
at that factory.

00:21:57.909 --> 00:21:58.909
Wait wait wait.

00:21:58.909 --> 00:22:02.400
You’re telling me the whole time they knew
about Jigsaw, they never once thought that

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.870
maybe they should monitor the properties he
owns and his business associates.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:11.809
Art Blank literally set up shop in Jigsaw’s
factory without anyone noticing.

00:22:11.809 --> 00:22:14.230
The incompetence is staggering.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:19.590
Rigg leaves for his final test, while Strahm
and Perez play catch up in his wake, because

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.519
phone’s are difficult to use apparently.

00:22:21.519 --> 00:22:25.350
They get called to the school after the firefighters
showed up and saw the massacre.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:29.330
The forensics team can’t discern what is
a weapon and what isn't and dusts the trigger

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:36.649
on a pneumatic bolt gun a bit too hard.

00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:38.020
That was just dumb.

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:42.299
There is no reason why this weapon shouldn’t
have been secured before 20 detectives started

00:22:42.299 --> 00:22:43.570
investigating the room.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.460
And is that really how the spike trap was
prepared?

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.519
Seems awfully difficult to line up the shots
so the rod went through in the exact right

00:22:50.519 --> 00:22:51.519
spot.

00:22:51.519 --> 00:22:52.629
Perez get’s a call.

00:22:52.629 --> 00:22:57.129
Apparently Brenda, Ivan, and this couple were
all represented by the same Art Blank that

00:22:57.129 --> 00:23:00.610
rented the hotel room and owned the building
they found their folders in.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:04.490
He was the criminal defense lawyer that got
them all off the hook for their crimes.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:09.240
And as a bonus, they also learn that he was
Jill Tuck’s lawyer and John Kramer’s former

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.429
business partner.

00:23:10.429 --> 00:23:12.080
This man is connected.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.659
They get the location of the other property
Art owns, and it’s co-owned by Jill Tuck.

00:23:16.659 --> 00:23:18.789
Funny thing is, it’s this school.

00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:22.659
Why were all Jill Tuck’s properties not
being monitored already.

00:23:22.659 --> 00:23:26.740
Why weren’t all John Kramer’s properties
being monitored in addition to the abandoned

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.830
buildings and properties that he built.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.610
Strahm and Perez decide to check out the rest
of the building, and come across a room with

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:36.299
Jigsaw’s ventriloquist doll in the middle
surrounded by candles.

00:23:36.299 --> 00:23:39.679
The candles look recently lit with minimal
wax drippage.

00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:41.320
Someone was here very recently.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.470
I think they should break out the iRobot again.

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:45.950
Who knows what Jigsaw has in store for them.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.259
Jill, just walks up to it and hit’s play.

00:23:48.259 --> 00:23:52.659
It says that Strahm will soon take the life
of an innocent man, and warns Perez that her

00:23:52.659 --> 00:23:54.120
next move is critical.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:24:03.580
The voice gets muffled, like the battery was
dying, so Perez puts her ear up to it.

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:07.410
I think Jigsaw wants you to fuck off and let
Rigg play his game.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.600
I gotta say, the candles were a pretty sly
way of making her stand right in front of

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.600
the blast zone.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.940
Perez get’s ushered to a hospital and Strahm
heads back to interrogate Jill to get clues

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.710
as to where Rigg’s final game is taking
place.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.960
Jill takes him on another time wasting trip
down memory lane.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.710
Cecil, the man responsible for Jill’s miscarriage,
was John’s first victim.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:32.870
John tracked him through a festival crowd,
donned the OG pig mask, and chloroformed him.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:37.420
Chloroforming someone with a soaked rag actually
takes a few minutes to render them unconscious.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:42.370
Jigsaw obviously learned from his ways and
started doing tranquilizer injections instead.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.419
Cecil wakes up strapped to a chair.

00:24:44.419 --> 00:24:51.140
When he sees John he pleads for mercy.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.860
Whenever you find yourself in a situation
and say, give me time to explain, and your

00:24:55.860 --> 00:25:01.049
captor responds saying, ‘time is an illusion’,
you’re fucked.

00:25:01.049 --> 00:25:04.690
Especially when they place a box of knives
over your face and tell you it’s a tool

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:05.970
to free your soul.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:10.090
John tell’s Cecil that in order to stay
alive, his face has to match the ugliness

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.090
of his soul.

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:15.110
He has to lean forward into the knives in
order to hit the lever in front of him which

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.270
will release his arm and leg restraints.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:22.559
His arms and legs are bound with blades jutting
up into his wrists and feet, so any movement

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:25.210
of his limbs will cause massive blood loss.

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:29.730
There’s honestly not much Cecil can do here
since John is standing over him watching.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.570
He’s not going to let Cecil foil his contraption.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:36.010
So the question now is, do you go slow or
fast?

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:38.850
I’d say slow, shit, I don’t know.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:46.970
Cecil does what is required and puts face
to blades.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:51.440
Cecil gets free and understandably wants to
attack John, but he doesn’t realize that

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:58.399
he’s the dumb bull and John is the bull
fighter.

00:25:58.399 --> 00:26:02.870
All this is basically pointless banter, and
Strahm eventually decides to check out one

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:07.720
of John’s first buildings, the Gideon Meat
Packing Plant, which was named after Jill’s

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.370
prematurely terminated baby.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.990
Again, why was this building not already being
monitored.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:17.879
Jigsaw’s whole operation could have easily
been compromised before anyone died in Saw

00:26:17.879 --> 00:26:19.419
3 and 4.

00:26:19.419 --> 00:26:20.460
Jesus Christ.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.200
Like an idiot, Strahm rolls on the factory
by himself.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.690
He did call backup, so he did better than
Eric, but you’d think by now the cops would

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:31.230
have learned to not carelessly assault Jigsaw’s
locations.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:35.549
While all this has been going down, Eric has
been hanging out with Hoffman in a warehouse.

00:26:35.549 --> 00:26:40.240
Eric is hog-chained from the ceiling and ground,
and in his weakened and delirious state from

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:50.490
being held captive for 6 months, pulling a
Riddick level escape is out of the question.

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.419
Hoffman can’t do much either, not that he’d
want to.

00:26:53.419 --> 00:26:55.519
He orchestrated all this after all.

00:26:55.519 --> 00:27:00.110
While Art was out prepping Rigg’s traps,
Hoffman sedated and strung up Eric, then hit

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:04.090
himself in the face and tied himself to the
chair which wasn’t actually hooked up to

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:05.120
the electricity.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.659
Art Blank arrives and stops Eric from trying
to hang himself and prematurely ending Rigg’s

00:27:09.659 --> 00:27:10.880
game before he gets there.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.010
I’m surmising that Art needs to keep both
of them alive until Rigg shows or no-shows,

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:19.559
at which point he can press the button on
a device, which will deactivate all of their

00:27:19.559 --> 00:27:20.559
traps.

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:23.650
I still think Art can disarm his spine cutter
and foil the game pretty easily.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:28.169
Art’s next instructed move is to hand Eric
the gun with a single bullet in it.

00:27:28.169 --> 00:27:30.600
Live or die, he makes the choice.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:35.460
They all look up and see the giant ice blocks
held captive above Eric by a wire attached

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.559
to the main entrance.

00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:40.990
Doesn’t take a genius to realize that if
the door is opened by Rigg, Eric will get

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.990
iced.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:46.490
Besides disarming his device, Art can’t
alter the trap because his spine will be remotely

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:47.730
sliced in half.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.389
As far as what Eric should do?

00:27:49.389 --> 00:27:50.940
Brace for impact baby.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.909
But in all seriousness, he should shoot at
whoever tries to enter that door.

00:27:54.909 --> 00:27:57.179
Shooting the chain he’s strung up by won’t
work.

00:27:57.179 --> 00:27:58.999
Demolition Ranch proved this.

00:27:58.999 --> 00:28:03.460
Rigg arrives at the factory and finds a note
saying, ‘Patience, remember who you are

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.460
saving.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.460
Time is on your side.’

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:11.539
Rigg, last chance, remember what Eric did
wrong, don’t repeat the same mistake.

00:28:11.539 --> 00:28:24.860
Just before the timer runs out, Rigg busts
the door open.

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.210
Art tried to yell at him to stop, and couldn’t
have known Rigg had a gun.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:32.679
He tries to tell Rigg that Jigsaw was testing
him, and his final move as Jigsaw instructed,

00:28:32.679 --> 00:28:34.830
was to hand Rigg his final cassette tape.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:39.029
He could have been a bit more overt and open
about what he was reaching for.

00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:46.299
Rigg thought he was going for a gun and dome
shotted him.

00:28:46.299 --> 00:28:50.830
While Rigg plays the message basically telling
him how he fucked up, Hoffman releases himself

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.570
from his restraints and starts walking out
the door.

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:58.029
Rigg turns around, realizing that Hoffman
was Jigsaw’s rat, shoots him in the back.

00:28:58.029 --> 00:29:02.399
That actually didn’t happen, because Hoffman
somehow knew that Rigg was out of ammo and

00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:05.259
would pass out within seconds of him saying,
‘game over’.

00:29:05.259 --> 00:29:10.179
Hoffman also somehow knew that Eric wouldn’t
off himself earlier instead of shooting Rigg,

00:29:10.179 --> 00:29:14.529
in which case Rigg would be in full health
and Hoffman would be caught in his lie.

00:29:14.529 --> 00:29:18.649
Strahm somehow doesn’t enter the same way
that Rigg did, and get’s led down a different

00:29:18.649 --> 00:29:19.649
path.

00:29:19.649 --> 00:29:23.289
He hears the gunshots of Amanda killing Lynn,
and Jeff killing Amanda, and the noise of

00:29:23.289 --> 00:29:25.390
Jeff sawing off Jigsaw’s head.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:29.470
When Strahm enters the sick room and see’s
Jeff, Jeff tries to kill him, thinking that

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:30.762
Strahm was also in on his game.

00:29:30.762 --> 00:29:36.759
Strahm is the quicker draw though.

00:29:36.759 --> 00:29:39.950
Hoffman slams the door shut behind Strahm
and locks him inside.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.850
I guess that’s game over for Strahm, at
least for now.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:47.970
Hoffman locking Strahm up is entirely hinged
on him not having Perez or SWAT team backup,

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:49.030
which seems unlikely.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:53.139
It’s also hinged upon Jeff losing his game
and getting killed by Strahm.

00:29:53.139 --> 00:29:57.110
If Strahm brought police backup, which would
have been easy because he came from the school

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:00.690
where tons of cops were with him, then they
would have been able to secure the scene and

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:03.730
Hoffman would be forced to continue acting
like a victim.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:07.330
This wouldn’t really work well, because
based on the tapes and the traps setup, the

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:11.520
police would uncover that Hoffman was never
in any danger and had managed to get out of

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.629
his restraints when everyone else was dead,
which is incredibly suspicious.

00:30:15.629 --> 00:30:20.419
Likewise, if Rigg was a few seconds late,
Art, Rigg, and Eric wouldn’t have died,

00:30:20.419 --> 00:30:24.940
and Hoffman would be ousted as the accomplice
after figuring out his trap was fake.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.909
Now that I think of it, Strahm might have
actually been intended to trip Eric’s trap

00:30:28.909 --> 00:30:30.360
or kill Rigg in the process.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.519
Hence, ‘Killing an innocent man’.

00:30:32.519 --> 00:30:36.480
Why have Strahm interfere with Jeff’s secondary
game of finding his daughter?

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:54.850
Far after these events, John Kramer’s body
was recovered by police and an autopsy performed.

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:59.750
Inside his stomach is the wax coated cassette
tape that Jigsaw swallowed before Jeff executed

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:00.750
him.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:04.130
The medical examiner calls Detective Hoffman
to take a look, and the movie ends with him

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:14.809
playing Jigsaw’s final message.

00:31:14.809 --> 00:31:21.820
Let’s recap the pivotal points where different
decisions could have altered who lived and

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:22.820
died.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.470
The abandoned Gideon Meat Packing plant was
Jigsaw’s first property he built and was

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:27.919
in the news.

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:31.480
Monitoring all of Jigsaw’s owned or built
properties that were abandoned pretty much

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:36.669
saves all the victims and leads to the death
or incarceration of Jigsaw, Amanda, and Hoffman.

00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:40.540
Art Blank could have disarmed his spine cutter
and brought the police in on Jigsaw’s game

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:41.840
before it even started.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:45.889
Art was a criminal defense lawyer and had
originally gotten all of his victims off the

00:31:45.889 --> 00:31:46.889
hook.

00:31:46.889 --> 00:31:50.080
There’s no reason to suspect he’d want
to be involved in their deaths.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.029
Rigg intimately witnessed the mistakes that
Eric and Kerry made, which had led to their

00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:55.029
downfall.

00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:57.070
He should have known that repeating them was
foolish.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:00.989
But he wouldn’t have even been in this position
had the cops monitored Jigsaw’s properties

00:32:00.989 --> 00:32:02.429
or if Art disarmed his trap.

00:32:02.429 --> 00:32:05.799
All said and done, I think we could have beat
the traps from Saw 4.

00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:10.279
Thanks for watching, and remember, if you’re
dealing with a Jigsaw trap, carefully check

00:32:10.279 --> 00:32:12.809
everything for pin triggers.
