00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.800
As a young woman leaves the gym, she is stalked&nbsp;
by a stranger. The man then confronts her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.560
places a bag over her head and attacks her.&nbsp;
What happens next? Who is this kidnapper? This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.160
is Movie Shortens. Follow us today to a movie&nbsp;
titled: 10x10. Be aware: there are spoilers!
 
&nbsp;

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.000
As the movie begins, we see a stern-faced&nbsp;
man named Lewis sitting in a cafe across from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.880
Cathy’s shop. Cathy opens her business serving&nbsp;
some customers before coming to the eatery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.520
She gives the waiter some flowers, in a familiar&nbsp;
and friendly kind of way. She takes a seat and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.080
Lewis leaves walking right past her. She is&nbsp;
completely oblivious to his presence. 
 
&nbsp;

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.080
Later, Lewis follows Cathy’s SUV to&nbsp;
the parking lot of a Fitness centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.960
Cathy heads in to join a yoga class. During the&nbsp;
class she appears to be in a meditative state,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.120
not present and needs to be stirred by&nbsp;
the teacher, bringing her back to reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.560
Meanwhile, Lewis peers into her vehicle, clearly&nbsp;
preparing himself for some kind of action. A gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.040
is seen resting on the passenger’s seat. 
 
As Cathy leaves the gym, he follows her to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.240
SUV, places a bag over her head and attacks her&nbsp;
from behind. She struggles but he threatens to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.040
kill her if she screams. She attempts to alert&nbsp;
someone nearby, but music is playing too loud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.320
so her attempts are thwarted. To suppress her&nbsp;
cries, Lewis places gaffer tape over her mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.760
He then binds her hands and feet. She is left on&nbsp;
the floor between her car and another vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.400
A man approaches his car but enters from the&nbsp;
opposite side. He doesn’t see Cathy lying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.480
there on the ground. As the car drives&nbsp;
away, vacating its space, Lewis pulls up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.200
alongside her and dumps her into his trunk. 
 
When they arrive at Lewis’ remote countryside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.720
house, he props up his garage door using a broom.&nbsp;
He carries her into a pre-built soundproofed room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.400
her new dwelling. He tells her that no&nbsp;
one will be able to hear her screams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.920
and asks her name. Upon removing the tape from her&nbsp;
mouth, she proceeds to cry out. Lewis leaves her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.960
there and leaves the room. He conceals the room&nbsp;
by pulling across a false wall and placing a vase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.640
on a table just outside of the room. 
 
Once in his living room, he is able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.600
access the audio from Cathy’s room. He begins&nbsp;
loading a handgun the heads back to elicit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.680
more information from his new prisoner. He&nbsp;
becomes frustrated as she is unwilling to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.520
provide any additional information. 
 
He begins mopping up the blood left from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.320
dragging Cathy into the room. In the room,&nbsp;
Cathy is struggling to free her hands and feet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.800
which remain bound. Lewis begins preparing&nbsp;
a meal by chopping a bell pepper.
 
&nbsp;

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.440
Eventually Cathy is able to release herself,&nbsp;
passing her hands under her legs. When he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.080
returns she surprises Lewis, striking him&nbsp;
and then attempting to escape. Just outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.720
she finds the vase hitting him over the head with&nbsp;
it, but her plan to leave is short lived. 
 
&nbsp;

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.360
Soon after, Cathy makes it to the living area&nbsp;
attempting to call the police but Lewis shoots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.160
at the phone, stopping her efforts. She is able to&nbsp;
grab a knife cutting the bind around her ankles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.320
She also finds her smartphone which has&nbsp;
no signal but she keeps it just in case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.520
Next, she begins to inch her way towards Lewis&nbsp;
holding the knife but Lewis seems unfazed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.840
He continues calmly eating, telling her that&nbsp;
a gun is more powerful than a knife. 
 
&nbsp;

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.400
He invites her to take a seat. Once again,&nbsp;
he asks her name. Angered by her answer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.840
he smashes a plate of food in her face. A struggle&nbsp;
ensues, during which he is cut on his forearm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.240
He is still able to get her back to her cell&nbsp;
despite his injury. Just then, we see a car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.840
pull up in the driveway. Just seconds after he has&nbsp;
locked her inside, Alondra, Lewis’ cleaner enters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.880
the house. She seems clearly concerned about the&nbsp;
broken plate, signs of a struggle and the cut on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.760
Lewis’s arm. He tells her that he is having a bad&nbsp;
day and that she should leave, which she does.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.720
She tells him that she’ll be coming back&nbsp;
the following day with his daughter. 
 
&nbsp;

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.760
In the next significant scene, Lewis is&nbsp;
interrogating Cathy within the confines of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.400
her sound proofed prison. Unsatisfied with her&nbsp;
answers, he continues pressing her to tell the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.120
truth. Eventually we find out she is from Green&nbsp;
Bay, rather than Orange County as she had been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.920
claiming. She was raised by a church as Lewis had&nbsp;
earlier suggested. Her sister, Cathy, committed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.400
suicide and she had assumed her identity. The&nbsp;
suicide had been in response to an affair that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.600
her father had, he was a football coach and&nbsp;
traveled a lot. Her real name is Nathalie. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.200
came from Charleston, leavins as she was one of a&nbsp;
few nurses implicated in 3 suspicious deaths. 
 
&nbsp;

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.600
Back in the living room, Lewis watches old&nbsp;
videos documenting the deaths he suspects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.920
Nathalie of having been involved in. Each time&nbsp;
Lewis leaves her alone, Nathalie attempts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.120
reach the outside world using her smartphone. Tip&nbsp;
toeing she holds it as close to a vent as she can.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.080
Eventually she gets through to 911. Although we&nbsp;
can hear both she and the operator, there is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.960
lot of interference in the phone, so it is unclear&nbsp;
as to whether they have heard her pleas for help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.800
She attempts to notify them of her kidnapping&nbsp;
by mentioning Lewis’ vehicle.  
 
&nbsp;

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.680
Lewis soon realizes she still has her smartphone,&nbsp;
so he runs in to retrieve it. Finding it in her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.720
pocket, he smashes it to pieces using the butt&nbsp;
of his pistol. He then continuously accuses her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.680
of the deaths at the Charleston hospital. She&nbsp;
continues to deny any involvement. Nathalie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.640
maintains that she, along with the other nurses,&nbsp;
were acquitted. She asks him which one had been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.080
his wife. He says it was Alana, and more light is&nbsp;
now shed on the circumstances around her death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.560
Her wedding ring was missing and her blood&nbsp;
was full of GHB, the date rape drug. One&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.120
of the other patients died of organ failure&nbsp;
despite having recently been medically cleared.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.240
Lewis tells Cathy he knows she murdered his wife.&nbsp;
He says if she can’t give a reasonable explanation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.560
as to why, she too will die. 
 
Lewis returns to the living room and watches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.080
some home videos. One of which is him cradling his&nbsp;
daughter. Another is of the whole family playing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.640
in the snow and wishing their parents a happy&nbsp;
Thanksgiving. Inspired by the footage, he storms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.240
back to Nathalie accusing her once more. She first&nbsp;
explains one of the victims had had two wives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.760
She says another jumped from a window&nbsp;
trying to get her husband imprisoned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.800
for attempted murder. It seems that Nathalie is&nbsp;
now committed to revealing the truth. She had,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.960
indeed, killed these three people believing&nbsp;
they deserved their fate. She claims his wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.320
had been cheating on him with a tall, handsome&nbsp;
man. This undoubtedly made her a sinner. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.280
believes it was Alana who was in the wrong. 
 
Lewis clearly struggles to accept this. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.000
he replays footage of his wife sitting on their&nbsp;
sofa. He notices her look at her phone, which was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.360
faced down, and then sees her canceling a call.&nbsp;
He repeatedly rewinds and replays the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.560
pausing it on her expression after she looks at&nbsp;
the phone. He clearly now suspects it was a call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.120
from a lover. Had she been cheating on him?
 
Lewis, struggling to deal with the emotions of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.360
day, goes for a drive. He takes his car to a lake&nbsp;
and gazes out. A police car pulls up alongside him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.880
as two officers emerge. They ask for his license&nbsp;
and to look inside his trunk, they see Nathalie’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.760
shoes but nothing else of suspicion. He claims&nbsp;
they belong to his wife, which they believe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.240
leaving him alone. It seems that Nathalie’s&nbsp;
call to the police had indeed been heard.
 
&nbsp;

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.320
During this time Nathalie has been using&nbsp;
a part of her phone’s casing, to scrape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.880
away at the grouting in the floor. She is then&nbsp;
able to remove a triangular piece of the tile.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.480
Upon his return, as Lewis is kneeling down&nbsp;
next to her, she uses this shard to stab him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.720
in the shoulder. She again attempts to escape.&nbsp;
Their struggle continues in the living room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.440
during which Nathalie is able to grab the gun,&nbsp;
pointing it at Lewis. As she does this, Alondra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.640
and his daughter, Summer, enter the house. Without&nbsp;
a second’s hesitation Nathalie shoots Alondra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.040
then takes Summer as a hostage. During the&nbsp;
standoff, she tells Lewis that Summer is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.080
his biological daughter but is the product of&nbsp;
his wife’s affair. Lewis warns Nathalie that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.240
everything she has said has been recorded. 
 
Soon Summer is able to free herself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.720
biting Nathalie’s arm and fleeing towards&nbsp;
the cell. Lewis and Nathalie fight once more,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.240
and Nathalie is left unconscious. Lewis quickly&nbsp;
grabs a hard drive containing the recordings. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.440
grabs Summer and they attempt to make their exit.&nbsp;
Just then, Summer notices that Nathalie is gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.240
Nathalie confronts the two in the garage stabbing&nbsp;
Lewis in the leg. At one point, she is able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.720
pin him to the ground and she stands over him&nbsp;
with a pitchfork. He appears to be trapped, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.840
he forces the tool upwards, causing it to smash&nbsp;
Nathalie in the face, freeing himself. Eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.480
she is captured once again as the garage door&nbsp;
suddenly falls down trapping her beneath it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.960
In the final sequence, Lewis embraces Summer and&nbsp;
we hear the sound of sirens approaching.
