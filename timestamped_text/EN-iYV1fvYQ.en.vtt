to contaminated fish, and soon it will take
the entire planet, he tries to convince his

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:37.189
boss to write on this, but she is not buying
it and he leaves.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:43.619
Later, we see Mitch Emhoff, husband of Beth,
he is there to pick up his son, who is coughing

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.639
and has a fever.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:51.200

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:08.830
Mitch cannot process this, and he says can
I talk to her now, Doctor tries to explain,

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.030
he says she only had a fever, doctor says
they don’t know the cause of death, and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.490
they wish to do autopsy.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.470
Soon, Mitch yells at him to do something.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.550
Later, in car Mitch gets a call from their
babysitter, he gets to home and rushes to

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.090
room of his son, unfortunately he finds his

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.410
Day 5, In Geneva Switzerland, we see Dr. Leonora,
going to the headquarters of W.H.O.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.070
In China, a lady is found dead in a bus.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.250
The virus has infected the highly populated
area in Kowloon Hong Kong, the health experts

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.430
talk about how it can spread like wildfire
if not contained properly withing few days.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.560
They also have 5 people dead in London.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.401
In Chicago, A man named Neo is taken to hospital,
doctors start doing autopsy of Beth, they

00:02:57.401 --> 00:03:02.730
open her skull, then they stop, a doctor says
if he should call someone, the doctor says

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.090
call everyone.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.330
Day 6, Dr. Ellis, and Dr. Erin Mears are trying
to track down every person who might be exposed

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.280
to the virus and they think it might be a
bioweapon.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.870
Later, Erin goes to Minnesota from Atlanta
to get some samples and meet a team of experts.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.200
In Minnesota, Mitch is quarantined in a closed
room doctors find him naturally immune, and

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.180
he talks to his daughter, Jory, on a phone,
he assures her that he is fine, and nothing

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.190
will happen to him.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.650
He’s glad that his daughter wasn’t at
home to be exposed to it.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.100
Erin meets Department of Homeland Security
representatives, Erin speculates this virus

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.770
might be spreading through fomites, a transmission
through surfaces like, elevator buttons, doorknobs,

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:50.770
and those things.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.300
A representative says that people will freak
out if they release this news and she is against

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.970
releasing the information to people.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.680
Then Erin tries to explain them by giving
examples of similar diseases, she says Flu

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.930
can transmit the disease to 1 person, Smallpox
multiplies it to 3 people, and Polio without

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.250
vaccine multiplies and infect 4 to 6 people,
but this new virus is way ahead of that transmission

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.150
rate, and she’s afraid sometimes healthy
people can transmit it without getting infected

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.900
as well.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.909
In a CDC Lab, Ian and Ally are examining the
virus as they speak to each other that 60

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:27.780
people are dead and around 600 people are
infected.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.479
She tries to understand it that it has characteristics
of a novel virus and appears to be primary

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.070
in origin and it mutates as well.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:43.029
Alan tries to ask some questions like is it
a Bioweapon to the head of CDC, Dr. Ian.

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:47.460
Day 7, Dr. Ellis is stopped by Dennis from
Homeland Security, they want him to go with

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.940
him.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.789
The group of Intelligence officers see the
pictures and they think there might be a connection

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.979
of it not being a natural virus.

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.650
They think it might be an attack, they are
closing down the schools by saying they’re

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.600
closing them for few days only.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.669
Later, Erin goes to Beth’s workplace, and
she talk to them to see if anyone was also

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.779
exposed to the virus, none of them interacted
directly with Beth after she came back from

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:18.080
China, but they mention that one co-worker
Barnes picked her form the airport, she rushes

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.580
and she asks him to get off the bus immediately,
that he might be infected.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.819
He seems to be coughing and he looks sick,
sooner, the crew of doctors arrives there.

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:34.479
Later, a doctor goes to Mitch to ask some
questions about Beth, the doctor reveals she

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.930
spent five hours in Chicago, and they want
to know if she met anyone when she left the

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.009
airport, Mitch seems to be shocked, and he
realizes she only knew one person in Chicago

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:46.499
which is her ex-boyfriend, John.

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:54.300
Later, a lab scientist explains to Dr. Ellis
that the virus infects humans, and the virus

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.499
has protein that is from a Bat and a Pig,
they’re confused, and she speculates that

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:03.169
this kind of hybrid virus might have been
developed in a Lab.

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.750
The virus has 20% mortality rate, and the
virus is mutating drastically.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.169
Dr. Ellis orders that only their group will
work on it, since they don’t want the virus

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.719
to leak outside the lab.

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:20.229
Then Ally calls Ian, who is working on the
virus himself to find a cure to stop his research

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.020
immediately.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.960
Day 8, Dr. Ellis makes a news conference and
announces the virus infecting people in California,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.189
Illinois, and other states.

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:35.789
As of now the infected people worldwide are
89 thousand and expected to be 287,000 in

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.129
1 week.

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:41.789
They decide to send Dr. Leonora to Hong Kong,
so they can investigate the origin of the

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:46.909
virus, upon arrival, she is met by Sun Feng.

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:50.970
They track down the credit card statements
of Beth and go to a casino and make a list

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.900
of people she might have interacted with.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.081
In the conference, they estimate the virus
to grow 2 times in 14 days, reporters ask

00:06:59.081 --> 00:07:02.969
them if they found any cure, but they say
no.

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:06.879
In Hong Kong, they find traces of virus on
many surfaces.

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:13.749
Later, Ian is in a restaurant he says people
coughing, so goes against the order of Dr.

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:19.289
Ally and keeps working on it, fortunately
he grew the virus in a particular bat cell,

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:21.740
which is the first step of making a vaccine.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.770
Dr. Ellis tracks it down from their system.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:30.129
Day 12, the news spread everywhere that Dr.
Ian found a way that might lead in discovering

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:31.860
a vaccine.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.110
As of Today, the virus has infected 8 million
people worldwide.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.939
Alan the blogger is in a park with a guy from
pharmaceutical company, where Alan claims

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:46.930
that he knows what the cure is, and it is
Forsythia, and he wants 2 million for it.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:52.839
Later, Dr. Erin tells Mitch that he is immune
to the virus, he asks then why they don’t

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:58.059
make vaccine from his blood cells, the doctors
say it can take very long that way.

00:07:58.059 --> 00:08:04.509
Later, Dr. Erin goes with her co-worker to
convert stadium into an emergency care hospital.

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:09.369
Dr. Ellis calls Erin, they talk a bit and
Erin feels bad that they haven’t told Mitch

00:08:09.369 --> 00:08:15.379
that his wife was cheating on him before she
died, he suggests her to take some rest.

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:20.659
The next day, Andrew, boyfriend of Jory, is
there to give some flowers but Mitch sends

00:08:20.659 --> 00:08:24.330
him away and he suggests that they shouldn't
meet each other.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:29.969
Later Leonora is watching the casino footage
again and Beth is seen enjoying her time,

00:08:29.969 --> 00:08:33.770
she also sees her first interaction with the
casino chips.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:38.960
Leonora speculates that virus was originated
from the casino not from Russia, but the Hong

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.520
Kong officials make fun of her that she can’t
see a virus through a footage.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:50.530
Day 14, Erin wakes up coughing, sooner she
realizes that she has the virus, so she asks

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:55.630
the hotel staff to give her the list of everyone
who served room, since they might be infected

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.070
as well.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:02.871
She then calls Dr. Ellis and unfortunately,
she tells him that she is infected too, he

00:09:02.871 --> 00:09:06.900
assures her nothing will happen to her and
to Hang in there.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:12.710
Later, Mitch meets a guy from funeral services
and Mitch wants to bury his wife and his son,

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.940
but the guy denies him by saying he can no
longer get their bodies.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:21.570
Later, in casino tapes we see, Beth calling
John that she can take early flight so she

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:26.590
can meet him for 5 hours if he is ready to
spend some time, and then she takes cocktails

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:31.760
but forgets her phone so the Ukrainian lady
gives it to her, and they speculate she might

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.850
have infected her, or she might be infected
from her, after she leaves, we see a waiter

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:41.550
grabbing her glass, and the waiter is the
same guy who passed away earlier and had symptoms

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.020
in him.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:47.910
Sooner, Sun Feng claims he read on the internet
that Americans and French Governments have

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.620
found the cure but they’re hiding it.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:56.270
She then leaves and he makes a phone call.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:01.011
The car stops suddenly and few people from
van come out and they abduct her, Sun feng

00:10:01.011 --> 00:10:06.460
says this is the only way, then they take
her to an isolated village, he shows them

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.270
his villagers, and he says he is going to
use her as a leverage to get vaccines for

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.710
his people.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:16.890
Later, Erin is coughing on a bed in the same
stadium she planned to use as emergency ward.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:21.710
Later that night, Dr. Ellis tries to convince
the authorities to move her from there to

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:27.440
a better hospital room, but the homeland security
guy says its waste of resources.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.950
We see Alan making a video and he claims that
he is infected, and he is taking Forsythia,

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.770
claiming again that it is the cure.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:39.600
Dr. Ellis sees this video, he then calls his
wife and tells her that the government is

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.800
planning to quarantine the city and abandon
It from other cities to stop the spread of

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.350
virus, so he asks her to immediately leave
Chicago and drive by herself to Atlanta city

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.470
to his place and do not say it to anyone.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:56.840
We see the janitor from earlier, he says he
got family in Chicago and leaves.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:02.910
Later, wife of Ellis is picking up supplies,
and she gets a call from her friend, and she

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.310
spills the beans.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.280
The military prepares to lockdown the city.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:14.420
Day 18, after the viral blog of Alan, there
is a huge lineup outside Pharmacy to get Forsythia,

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.960
they inform that they will only distribute
50 doses and people start panicking and attacking

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.960
the facility.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.970
Mitch and his daughter go to a convenient
store, but the city is in chaos and sick people

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.990
walking and coughing.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.820
He then tries to go to another city but finds
out that the border is sealed so they move

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.450
back..

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.750
The next day, Alan is distributing flyers
that government is lying to people and Forsythia

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.320
is the cure.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.220
He notices his boss sitting outside a house,
earlier we saw him convincing her that the

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:50.500
virus is a bioweapon, and she didn’t believe
him, she then asks him if he has any Forsythia

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.400
and she is pregnant and dying, she offers
him money, but he says he will bring it to

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.310
her when he gets it.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:02.421
In the stadium, Erin sees a man shivering
from cold and they ran out of blankets, so

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:06.150
she tries to help him, but she is too weak,
and she dies.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:12.120
Dr. Ellis goes to a news channel, the reporter
asks him what he thinks about Forsythia, he

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.240
suggests that the drugs are being evaluated
and the best thing people can do is wash their

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.570
hands and social distance.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.590
Alan works for the same channel, he says that
the cure is being taken from the world by

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:27.950
C.D.C and W.H.O, to allow friends and family
of authorities to benefit financially from

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:29.060
it.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.940
Ellis insists that they are working on with
pharmaceutical companies to find a vaccine,

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.560
and there is no science to backup Forsythia.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.820
Alan claims that on Facebook wife of Ellis
posted that the city will be under full lockdown

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.720
few hours before the government announcing
it.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.131
The homeland security officials are disappointed
about the leak of news, but they don’t have

00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:50.200
anyone to replace him with.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:56.990
Day 21, Ally discovers that the virus is mutating,
and the new strain is more deadly, and it

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.830
spreads 4 times more faster.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:03.740
They’ve been testing on monkeys, but they
haven’t found any new achievement yet.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:08.720
The mortality rate is 25 to 30% and without
the vaccine approximately 1 in 10 people will

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.240
contract the disease.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:15.510
Alan comes across the picture of his boss,
she died due to the virus, and he walks away

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:16.550
from there.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:22.560
Day 26, the military is distributing rations
and Mitch is there too, they announce they

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.430
ran out of supplies and people start attacking
and panicking and they take over military

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.230
truck.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:33.660
Later that night, Mitch hears gun shots in
their neighbour’s house he decides to call

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.610
911 but the line is busy due to the chaos.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:41.590
Day 29, Mitch decides to break into their
neighbour’s house, he goes to the garage

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.410
and takes a gun and comes back.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.200
He sees that Jory is in the backyard with
Andrew, he gets up on her and leans for a

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.210
kiss, but Mitch comes there and throws him
away, and orders him to go home.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:59.420
Back in CDC, Ally calls Ellis and updates
him on the status of vaccine that it still

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:04.550
needs many trials and monkeys keep dying,
Ellis suggests that when found they should

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:09.110
mix it in water supplies of the city so they
can cure everyone at once, she wishes him

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.280
merry Christmas and hangs up.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.540
Later, she looks at a scared monkey and she
opens the box, and she decides to inject herself

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.120
with it.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:23.150
She then goes to a hospital, and she meets
her father, she removes the masks, he doesn’t

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:26.560
want her to get infected, but she assures
him that she is just following her dad’s

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.760
path who found a vaccine to a disease and
tested it on himself.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:36.600
Later, we see FDA approving it and producing
it in mass quantity, but the first dose will

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:41.040
take 90 days and it will take one year for
everyone in world to get it.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:47.690
Day 131, We see a group of people broke into
house of Ellis and his wife is tied up, they’re

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.820
looking for the vaccine there since he works
for CDC.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:56.250
Later, Ellis comes back to home, and he asks
her if they harmed her.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:01.400
The next day, Alan is talking to the pharmaceutical
guy, and he claims that when Spanish flu came

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.810
millions of people got rich from it, and he
is doing the same, and he does not care if

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.090
Forsythia works or not.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:13.280
He asks him if he did it on purpose, he says
he did it to get rich like the bigger companies.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.240
He then notices a suspicious man and realizes
he’s been watched; they arrest him for security

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.460
fraud and for possible manslaughter.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:26.190
Day 133, In a news conference, the Officer
from Homeland security announces that there

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:30.960
not enough vaccines available for everyone
yet, so they are having a lottery to distribute

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:36.080
it fairy, and they choose a date of birth,
March 10, and it will be distributed to people

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.080
born on that day, Jory and Mitch watches it
from their home and Jory thinks she might

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.580
be immune like her dad.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.090
She then texts Andrew from Nostalgic iPhone.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:51.110
In Hong Kong, is teaching the village kids
and she seems like she got adjusted to the

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:52.110
captivity.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:56.430
Sun Fend informs her that the government has
agreed to give them 100 doses of vaccine in

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:58.190
exchange of her.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.190
They take her to the site and meet a man from
the embassy.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.590
They make the exchange and Leonora is free
now.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.860
When they’re at the airport the man from
embassy reveals that they gave the villagers

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:12.890
poison instead of the real one and they can’t
afford to negotiate with kidnappers.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.630
Leonora is in shock, and she runs from there
knowing that the children in village will

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:17.880
take it.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.180
Later, we see a person scanning the barcode
on Mitch’s hand as a new rule to see who

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.560
is immune and vaccinated.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.470
Later, an officer tells Alan that his blood
result shows that he was never infected, which

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:34.470
means he faked being sick and pushed everyone
to take Forsythia, which made him over 4.5

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:38.820
million dollars and that now people don’t
trust on government, one of his followers

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.780
bails him out.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:45.990
Later we see that finally, Dr. Ellis is given
two doses one for his wife and one for him,

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.680
but he gracefully gives it to the son the
Janitor that works with him.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.670
Later that night, he gives another shot to
his wife, and gives her that bracelet.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:17:00.860
Day 135, Alan resumed is daily activities
to spread conspiracy theories.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.670
In the lab, Dr. Ally puts the virus in a box
in liquid nitrogen storage with other deadly

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:09.610
viruses as a part of history now and they
leave.

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:14.260
Mitch turns on the camera of Beth that he
found and looks at the pictures she took there,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:19.030
Jory is dressed for prom and her father lets
her meet Andrew that he is vaccinated now,

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.569
in the room Mitch breaks down.

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:26.220
Then the movies goes back to Day 1, where
it is shown that in a pig farm, a but dropped

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:31.470
its poo and one of the pig ate it, and got
infected, then that pig was touched by a chef

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:35.280
and Beth wanted to take picture with him,
and it infected her from there.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.260
