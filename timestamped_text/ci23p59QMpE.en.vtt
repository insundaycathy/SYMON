00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.880
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going to&nbsp;
explain a comic science fiction action film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.600
called “Iron sky.” Spoilers ahead!&nbsp;
Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.120
In 2018, an American spacecraft named “Liberty”&nbsp;
lands on the moon’s surface. After landing, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.320
ship unveils the election campaign poster of the&nbsp;
current U.S. president. It has been sponsored by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.840
the president to promote her re-election campaign.&nbsp;
The spacecraft carries two astronauts named&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.840
Sanders and James Washinton. Sanders’s mission is&nbsp;
to inspect the surface of the moon for chemicals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.200
As he does, he reports back the presence of&nbsp;
Helium-3 on the surface. He then wanders off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.320
a bit further from their ship and loses connection&nbsp;
with the mission control. Sander is surprised when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.920
he comes across a gigantic Helium-3 mine with&nbsp;
several people working on it. Astronaut James&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.800
is near their spaceship, waiting for Sanders.&nbsp;
Sanders turns around to call him to come to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.160
check the mine, but a person wearing a Nazi&nbsp;
armband sneaks up behind him and shoots him dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.800
A shocked James tries to run to his ship,&nbsp;
but the person blows up the whole ship,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.840
leaving him no way to return home. He falls on&nbsp;
the ground and is surrounded by people wearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.520
Nazi armbands. He is then taken somewhere through&nbsp;
the well-built roads inside the mining base. 
&nbsp;

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.680
The camera zooms out, showing us&nbsp;
the swastika-shaped Nazi base.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.800
Somewhere else on the moon, a German teacher named&nbsp;
Renate Richter teaches a bunch of school children.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.640
As they study, we know that the children&nbsp;
were born on the moon and have never been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.520
to the earth. Renate teaches the kids to speak&nbsp;
in English, claiming that the language will help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.080
when they return to the Earth to help humanity.&nbsp;
As it turns out when the Nazis were defeated at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.520
the end of world war two, some of them escaped to&nbsp;
the “dark side” of the moon to avoid being killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.440
The soldiers have since created a colony&nbsp;
and have been living on the moon's surface&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.400
for generations in complete secrecy. 
The Nazi soldiers bring astronaut James to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.920
the Nazi commander, Klaus Adler, at their base.&nbsp;
Adler presents James in front of their leader,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.240
Wolfgang Kortzfleisch, referred&nbsp;
to as Führer by his people. 
&nbsp;

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.760
Meanwhile, on Earth, the US President talks about&nbsp;
the campaign’s failure to her campaign manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.600
She had chosen James for the mission because&nbsp;
he is an African-American so that she can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.720
gather more African-American&nbsp;
votes in the coming election.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.040
The president demands her manager to do&nbsp;
whatever she can to cover up the mishap. 
&nbsp;

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.400
Back on the moon, Adler fetches Renate to come&nbsp;
and speak to James in English. Adler and Renate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.440
seem to be in a relationship. James manages to&nbsp;
attack the German soldiers and frees himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.240
from captivity but is stuck in the base as he&nbsp;
doesn’t know the way out. He mistakenly knocks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.840
out Adler and comes across a surprised Renate near&nbsp;
the airlock. Before the woman can say anything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.880
James pulls down a lever thinking it will open&nbsp;
the exit, but instead, it opens the airlock.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.080
Both he and Renate are pulled by air pressure.&nbsp;
They somehow manage to get inside and close the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.600
airlock quickly. By then, Adler has caught up&nbsp;
with James and is furious. He points his gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.320
at the man and is about to shoot him, but stops&nbsp;
when James mentions he knows the US President.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.240
Adler wants to extract information from James,&nbsp;
so he sends him to Dr. Richter’s laboratory. 
&nbsp;

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.600
Adler and Dr. Richter are intrigued by James’s&nbsp;
cell phone and ask him what it is. James answers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.101
it is a phone, similar to their computers, Dr.&nbsp;
Richter laughs in disbelief. Apparently, the Nazis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:22.720
are still behind in technological advancements.&nbsp;
Dr. Richter shows James a huge machine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.240
claiming that it is a computer and his cell phone&nbsp;
is too tiny to be one. Dr. Richter suggests they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.280
cut James’s brain open to inspect its size, but&nbsp;
Adler wants to get information out of him. 
&nbsp;

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.840
Back at the United Nations headquarters, an&nbsp;
American UN representative gives a detailed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.040
explanation of the failed lunar mission. The US&nbsp;
president’s campaign manager is frustrated because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.400
of the campaign failing and scolds her employees&nbsp;
for presenting her with terrible PR ideas. 
 
&nbsp;

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.560
At the moon base, Adler visits Renate in&nbsp;
her room to propose to her for marriage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.360
which on the moon is called the “legal union.”&nbsp;
He presents her with a confirmation certificate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.960
that their DNA matches 97 percent and reveals&nbsp;
his wish to produce perfect offspring with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.280
He wants to be the most powerful in&nbsp;
their base and rule the earth someday.
&nbsp;

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.280
Somewhere else in the base, we get&nbsp;
to see the Lunar Nazi’s project:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.480
the battleship Götterdämmerung, which has been&nbsp;
under development for 40 years. It is the dream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.520
of the führer Wolfgang Kortzfleisch to complete&nbsp;
the battleship. They plan to use the battleship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.960
to go back to earth and conquer it. Dr. Richter&nbsp;
finally realizes that the cell phone brought by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.160
James has a thousand times more computing power&nbsp;
than all their computers. Dr. Richter connects the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.360
phone to the battleship and demonstrates its power&nbsp;
to the führer. Everyone is surprised and impressed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.840
when the small cell phone starts the battleship.&nbsp;
But, soon it stops because the phone is out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.760
battery. Adler asks führer for permission to visit&nbsp;
the Earth and fetch more such cell phones. 
&nbsp;

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.360
He believes that someday, the earth will&nbsp;
attack them, and they will need the power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.560
of cell phones on their side. Führer claims that&nbsp;
no one who went to the Earth has ever returned,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.200
but Adler is adamant that he will. 
In the following scene, we see James being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.120
kept in a room with speakers near him that blast&nbsp;
nazi propaganda at all times. Renate sneaks in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.360
and introduces herself to him. She asks him&nbsp;
about his skin color as she has never met a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.720
dark-skinned person before. She also reveals that&nbsp;
Dr. Richter is her father. He has been injecting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.160
James's face with a drug to make him look more&nbsp;
“Aryan.” Renate advises James to pretend to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.520
a nazi or else he will be eliminated soon.
Adler then gets ready to leave for the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.400
Before he departs, Dr. Richter presents&nbsp;
a now ‘aryanised’ James to him. His skin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.320
and hair have turned white because of the&nbsp;
drugs, and he is now in the Nazi uniform.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.800
He, with Adler, Renate, and a guard, leave for the&nbsp;
Earth. Their spaceship lands on someone’s farm in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.760
New York. The owner of the farm shoots one of the&nbsp;
guards dead, making the other three flee from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.080
place. Adler steals a vehicle from some men and&nbsp;
asks James to take him to the US president. James,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.960
with no way out, takes them to the president’s&nbsp;
campaign manager, Vivian. Adler abducts the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.640
manager and throws James out of the vehicle, since&nbsp;
he is of no use to him any longer. Adler then asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.040
Vivian the whereabouts of the President.
Renate realizes that Adler’s mission is to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.920
attack the earth, which doesn’t align with what&nbsp;
they had been told. She tries to retaliate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.600
but Adler asks her to recite what&nbsp;
she always does to her students.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.640
Renate starts saying a monologue about their aim&nbsp;
to bring peace and prosperity to the world. 
&nbsp;

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.240
Vivian is impressed by Renate’s oratory skills&nbsp;
and devises a plan to use her to help energize the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.280
President’s re-election. She then takes the duo&nbsp;
to meet the president, who approves of the plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.400
They start a campaign of Nazi-style propaganda to&nbsp;
get the president re-elected and are successful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.040
in it. Adler and Renate enjoy themselves on the&nbsp;
Earth so much that they forget their mission. 
&nbsp;

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.840
Meanwhile, James has been protesting alone on&nbsp;
the streets about the Nazis on the moon.
&nbsp;

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.320
Several days pass, and Renate has been&nbsp;
working for the president ever since.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.800
One day, she meets James, and the two go to&nbsp;
a theater to watch a Charlie Chaplin movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.960
When she comes out of the theater, she realizes&nbsp;
that Nazis were actually horrible people.
&nbsp;

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.880
Meanwhile, Vivian has started to gather feelings&nbsp;
for Adler as she finds him charismatic. Vivian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.320
starts making out with Adler as the two walk into&nbsp;
Adler’s office. As they make out, Adler tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.920
of his plan to invade earth after eliminating&nbsp;
führer, who is on the moon. When Adler looks up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.920
he sees the moon-Nazi führer and his men in his&nbsp;
office. He has come to earth to find out why Adler&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.520
is taking so long to retrieve the computers. 
Führer, knowing Adler’s plan, takes the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.800
hostages. Just then, Renate barges into the&nbsp;
room and confronts Adler about his mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.360
She denounces nazi propaganda, finally&nbsp;
realizing Adler was wrong the whole time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.880
Führer has decided to kill all of them, but&nbsp;
Vivian manages to get her hands on a gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.840
She kills Führer and all of his men.
Adler realizes that Renate has grown to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:55.200
like the earthlings, so, claiming that she has&nbsp;
betrayed the Nazis, he is now about to kill her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.720
But James comes to her aid and&nbsp;
the two manage to run away. 
&nbsp;

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.240
Adler steals Vivian’s iPad and announces himself&nbsp;
as the new führer. He then takes the former&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.840
führer’s spacecraft to the earth's orbit, leaving&nbsp;
Vivian behind. Adler launches the invasion of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:16.240
Earth using a fleet of space-Zeppelins and flying&nbsp;
saucers. They destroy the statue of liberty and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.600
ultimately, the entire city of New York. 
Renate watches the Nazis destroy the US&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.240
and devises a plan. She wants to go back to&nbsp;
the base on the moon to bring the battleship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.760
Götterdämmerung and fight the Nazis. The United&nbsp;
Nations assembles to discuss the attacks. 
&nbsp;

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.520
The American president appoints an&nbsp;
American Mars exploration spacecraft,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.800
the USS GWB to fight the Nazis. She appoints&nbsp;
Vivian as the commander of the spacecraft. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.920
they soon get overpowered and ask for help from&nbsp;
other nations. The spaceships of other countries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.800
come to the rescue. Adler returns to the moon&nbsp;
after ordering the ships to fight till their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:54.000
last breath. He has brought Vivian’s tablet to&nbsp;
activate the battleship Götterdämmerung. 
&nbsp;

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.120
After all the countries assemble their military,&nbsp;
they manage to wipe out the Nazi spaceships. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.160
the spaceships make their way towards the moon’s&nbsp;
base. Adler boards the battleship and gets ready&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.920
to fight the space coalition. Meanwhile, Renate&nbsp;
and James sneak into the battleship as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.960
Renate heads towards the bridge, looking for&nbsp;
Adler while James goes to meet Dr. Richter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.440
The human’s spacecraft arrives at the moon&nbsp;
and attacks everyone in the Nazi base. 
&nbsp;

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.560
Adler panics as the moon starts to fall and&nbsp;
orders his men to start the Helium-3 engines.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.600
The battleship ventures into the air. Adler then&nbsp;
orders for the cannons to be fired, but Earth is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.800
on the other side of the moon, out of the firing&nbsp;
line. To make the earth stand in the line of fire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.280
Adler bombs parts of the moon. 
Meanwhile, Renate plays the Nazi anthem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.160
making the nazi officers perform a salute&nbsp;
as she walks towards Fuhrer. James finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.440
manages to disconnect Vivian's tablet, while&nbsp;
Renate kills Adler by electrocuting him before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:55.440
he can fire at Earth. Renate and James narrowly&nbsp;
escape as the battleship crashes into the Moon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.720
The US president congratulates Commander Vivian on&nbsp;
their victory, but Vivian mistakenly discloses the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.760
presence of large tanks of helium-3 on the moon,&nbsp;
and all the UN representatives from different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.640
countries hear it. All of them want to claim the&nbsp;
tanks as their own, as such a large quantity of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.760
Helium-3 can supply energy for several years. 
The UN members get into an argument,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.520
and the fleet of spaceships that were&nbsp;
working together, turn against each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.600
They begin to launch missiles at each&nbsp;
other’s spaceships and chaos ensues again.
&nbsp;

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.240
On the moon’s base, Renate walks into her&nbsp;
old classroom, where the survivors of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.640
base wait for her. She tells them that&nbsp;
they can rehabilitate on earth in peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.240
She then reunites with Washington,&nbsp;
who has gained his complexion back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:42.080
The two finally kiss. The movie ends as the camera&nbsp;
zooms out, showing us the half-broken moon.
