00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.280
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.720
Today, I'm going to explain a French horror-thriller
film called "Evolution."

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.170
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.870
Watch out and take care!

00:00:13.292 --> 00:00:17.119
Nicolas is a sickly young boy living by the
sea with his mother.

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.910
One day while swimming in the sea, Nicolas
glimpses what appears to be a dead boy with

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.310
a red starfish on his belly.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.390
Nicolas quickly picks his way across the striking
dark rocks of his town's shoreline to report

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.320
his discovery to his mother.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.149
Mum immediately goes diving and brings back
the starfish, but she tells him there is no

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.559
dead body there.

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.840
At home, Nicolas is given slimy meals for
supper, and his mother gives him a dose of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.840
medication.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.100
Nicolas asks his mother what sickness he is
having.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.840
His mother explains that all boys on this
island require treatments because their bodies

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.340
will change and weaken as they get older.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.980
Later that night, all mothers on the island
are seen gathering somewhere.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.449
They are going to the shoreline.

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.989
Then, Nicolas' mother brings back the dead
body Nicholas saw before, and the other mothers

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.440
gather around it.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.800
The following day, Nicolas plays with his
starfish.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.130
After another boy mocks him for being afraid
of it, he grows angry and attacks the boy.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.070
He later hacks off one of the starfish's arms.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.470
After his outburst, his mother takes him to
a hospital for regular observation.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.620
At the hospital, a doctor injects a yellow
liquid into Nicolas' stomach.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.600
He is then told to stay one night in the hospital.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.290
Nicolas later finds himself in a ward with
other boys who have been similarly operated on.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.660
They begin to question what sickness they
are having.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.280
At night, the scene shows nurses who are watching
videos of cesarean sections being performed.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.620
The following day, Nicolas is released from
the hospital.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.430
He begins to suspect his mother and the nurses
of having lied to him.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.020
He visits his friend's house, Victor, and
they sneak out in the middle of the night

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.030
to observe what the mothers are doing.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.660
However, on their way, Victor gets scared,
so he runs back home.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.510
Nicolas continues his way in order to discover
the truth.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.870
When he arrives, he's very surprised at what
he sees.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.150
He sees the women lying together completely
nude, writhing around in the mud, and passing

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.140
an object from one to another.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.430
He immediately runs back home.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.060
A few hours later, at home, he sneaks a peek
at his mother as she is showering off the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.060
mud.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.670
He observes that she has what appears to be
suckers on her back.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.760
Back at the hospital, Nicolas is given an
ultrasound.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.000
To his mother's apparent joy, they hear the
heartbeat of a fetus.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.780
Nicholas is then taken into a room to stay
another night in the hospital while waiting

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.500
for the final surgery.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.879
In that room, he meets other children, including
his best friend, Victor.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.659
Later that night, Victor is operated on.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.730
After the operation, a creature is taken out
of his stomach and put in a jar.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.129
Victor dies during the operation.

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.250
In the morning, Nicholas asks the nurse about
Victor's whereabouts.The nurse lies ,and tells

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.770
Nicolas that Victor is recovering.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.703
A nurse brings a conch shell into the ward,
saying that Victor has sent it to them.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.939
Nicolas's mother visits him, and she brings
food for him.

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.069
However, he refuses to eat what she feeds
him.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.780
When she becomes upset and begins to look
through his sketchbook, he accuses her of

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.290
not being his mother.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.040
They then sedate him and take away his drawing
book.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.660
In the hospital, Nicolas develops a friendship
with one of the nurses, Stella, who seems

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.860
to have taken a liking to Nicolas.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.590
Stella sneaks Nicolas crayons and draws with
him.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.019
Nicolas' drawings include a dead boy and starfish
but also a bicycle, a car, a building, and

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.290
a giraffe.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.139
Stella then tells him a secret; She shows
Nicolas a file with pictures of women with

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.370
suckers on their backs, including one of a
young girl.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.219
That night, she takes him down to the sea,
shows him the suckers on her back, and allows

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:37.739
him to touch them before taking him into the
water.

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.049
However, due to being in the water for too
long, Nicolas passes out.

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.379
Stella immediately revives him using CPR.

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:46.769
Nicholas goes back to the hospital.

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.310
At night, he sneaks into another room, where
he finds one of the boys.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.250
When Nicolas approaches, the boy lays Nicolas's
hand on his own stomach, and he feels movement

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.879
in the boy's body.

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.790
After forcing Nicolas to press on his stomach,
he begins to vomit.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.599
Nicolas runs away in fear and enters a different
room.

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.980
In that room, he sees one of the boys floating
in a tank.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.730
Not long after, he is caught by a nurse.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.079
And he is taken for the final surgery.

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.909
After the surgery, Nicolas awakens in a tank.

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.110
He is in restraints and sees what appears
to be two babies inside the tank with him.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.830
He is shocked to see this, and he faints.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.030
Nicolas wakes up and again finds himself by
the sea with Stella.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.720
They again enter the water, but this time
she presses her mouth to his as she swims

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.530
with him, giving him air to breathe underwater.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.580
She pushes him to the surface, and the two
end up in a small rowboat floating away from

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.920
the island.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.720
After making sure Nicolas has a drink of freshwater,
Stella slips back into the sea, presumably

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.720
to go back to the island.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.660
Nicolas stays on the boat and, by nightfall,
finds himself approaching the harbor of a

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.050
major city.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.560
And thatâ€™s the ending of the movie.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.870
Now, for the explanation.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.860
The story is happening in a place by the sea
where we see a group of humanoids living their lives

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.880
This place, as you can see, has only young
boys and female adults.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.850
No young girls or male adults.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.090
As shown later in the movie, the female adults
have suckers on their backs, indicating that

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.120
they are humanoid water-based lifeforms; they
breathe underwater too.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.270
These humanoids are the result of the evolution
of the starfish.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.110
The only way the adults of this species can
reproduce is asexual as there are no adult men

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.950
It looks like the only way to make babies
is by externally creating a zygote and placing

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.980
them in the bellies of young boys.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.140
The bodies of these boys seem to be able to
host the fetus up until one point.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.380
After that, the fetuses need to be surgically
removed and grown externally.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.320
Sometimes, if the boy's body is able to survive,
they place the boy in a tank where the fetus

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.770
grows externally in the water while still
connected to the boy.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.870
As we can see in the movie, Nicolas is being
given medication every day.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.520
This is to prepare his body to host the fetus.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.640
When it is time, he's admitted, and the zygote
is injected into him.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.540
Other boys on the island are being given the
same treatment.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.450
We can assume that all those young boys are
stolen continuously from cities and taken

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.340
to this seaside place.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.640
In the movie, we can see Nicolas draws not only a dead
boy and starfishes but also a bicycle, a car,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.550
a building, and a giraffe.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.170
Nicolas is drawing these from memory, as they
cannot be found in the village.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.280
This suggests that he was kidnapped as a baby
and brought there.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.160
However, the boys grow remembering very little
where they came from.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.300
At the beginning of the film, Nicholas saw
a dead body.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.900
We can assume that he died while trying to
escape, and those women chose to keep it a

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.900
secret.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.310
In the film, we also see the women lying together,
writhing around in the mud, and passing an

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.300
object from one to another.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.040
This is a kind of birth reproduction ritual.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.020
Having a baby among them drives those women
into a maternal frenzy and they produce zygotes

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.640
which is then gathered and injected into boys
to impregnate them.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.380
In another scene, we're shown a glimpse of
the humanoids watching a video of a cesarian operation

00:06:51.966 --> 00:06:56.090
This is how they have been figuring how to
cut the abdomens without hurting the fetuses.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.750
It appears that the humanoids usually get
the cesarean cut wrong and end up killing

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.780
the host kid.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.550
We can see this happens to Victor, who dies
after the operation.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.552
However, sometimes they are able to cut just
right and transfer the host into the incubation tank

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.600
This happens to Nicolas, who survives the
operation.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.470
Once inside, the fetuses grow pretty quick,
and the host stays alive, perhaps to be implanted

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.470
with another zygote afterward.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.631
At the end of the movie, Stella, who genuinely
loves Nicolas, decides to save him from his misery

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.330
She then sneaks Nicolas out and takes him
to a boat.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.210
This appears to be the way the humanoids travel
and enter into human cities to abduct kids.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.540
As it becomes night, Nicolas sees that he's
approaching the shore of a human city.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.400
We can assume that he will be rescued and
unite with his original parents.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.690
And that's my explanation for the movie.
