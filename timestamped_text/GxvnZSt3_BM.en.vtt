00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.509
Welcome To Movie Recall. In Today's video,
we will be going through the 2018 science

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.380
fiction movie : Ready Player One.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.840
It's Time To Recall.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.940
Let's Get Started.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.300
Spoilers Ahead!

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.610

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.530
In 2045, in a place called "The Stacks" in
Columbus, Ohio, Wade resides with his aunt,

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.230
Alice, and her boyfriend, Rick, in a low-income
community filled with precariously stacked

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.130
trailers and vehicles. As he heads out from
their house, his neighborhood seems drawn

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.120
into their own world using virtual simulation.
Like millions of others, Wade finds himself

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.311
escaping into The Oasis, a virtual world where
everything is possible. He accesses the Oasis

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:51.070
via a visor and haptic gloves as he hides
in a scrap van. In this virtual reality world,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.440
people can enter as avatars to play video
games, entertain themselves, and seek pleasures

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.290
they can't find in the real world. It is a
world where imagination is the limit. People

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.339
can design their own look however they want,
either they want to look like their favorite

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.409
cartoon or their ideal self. They can do whatever
they want and go as far as they can. The Oasis

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.549
serves as both a massively multiplayer online
role-playing game and a virtual society, and

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.311
its currency is the world's most stable currency.
Once people accumulate items in the Oasis

00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:29.921
and their avatar dies, they will lose everything.
Wade's avatar in this world is Parzival. Despite

00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:34.439
never meeting them in person, he frequently
interacts with his best friend Aech, a massive

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.350
muscular mechanic, and samurai Daito and fighter
Sho.&nbsp;

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.860
James Halliday and Ogden Morrow created The
Oasis in 2025. Unfortunately, Halliday died

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.720
in 2040 and has left a contest in which whoever
finds his Easter egg will gain ownership of

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.130
the Oasis and its parent company. Since the
company is worth billions of dollars, many

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.270
users have been trying to figure out the clues
that lead to Halliday's Easter egg for years.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.140
Wade enjoys deciphering the contest that James
Halliday created before he passed away.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.140
After his death, Halliday's company releases
his video detailing how he had hidden an Easter

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.560
egg within the Oasis. In the video, Halliday
uses an avatar named, Anorak the All-Knowing,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.250
explaining the contest's mechanics where there
would be three challenges to complete.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.681
Upon winning the challenges, they will get
a key and a clue for the next challenge. Whoever

00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:25.410
obtains all three keys, and the egg first
will inherit Halliday's personal fortune of

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.920
500 billion dollars as well as complete control
of the Oasis.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.700
Wade primarily searches on his own, even though
many egg hunters, also known as gunters, have

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.159
teamed up such as the "Sixers" under Innovative
Online Industries, or, I.O.I. for short. Though

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.300
the company's C.E.O. Nolan Sorrento makes
most of his money from products and other

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.739
gear that allow people to have the advantage
inside the Oasis, he wants to find the egg

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.790
primarily to increase money's influence from
the virtual world.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.950
The company even has Halliday's Scholars,
who spend all their time studying pop culture

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.090
that Halliday's obsessed with, hoping to find
clues. The hunt has been going on for five

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.900
years, yet no one has been able to locate
the first key. The only thing found was the

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.340
first challenge, which is a racing game set
in a simulated City of New York.Wade and Aech

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.730
attempt to race through the event once more.
While most competitors are riding their well-equipped

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.110
race cars, Wade rides the one-of-a-kind Delorean
from Back to the Future. While waiting for

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.840
the race to start, Wade sees a female racer
on a bike, and she captivates him. The race

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.110
begins and immediately players are eliminated.
Since Aech happens to be a mechanic, he uses

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.750
his knowledge to upgrade his truck, crushing
all other cars along with the race. However,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.440
when Kong arrives, it destroys the road, leading
to his failure to end the race.&nbsp;Still, he

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.930
cheers for his best friend, Wade, who takes
another route. During the race, Wade takes

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.840
advantage of getting the coins from those
who didn't make it, but when Kong appears,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.550
he suffers the same fate.&nbsp;On the other hand,
the female biker, named Artemis, is still

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.879
on her way and planning to jump over the broken
road. Wade realizes that Kong hides beneath

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:15.079
the destroyed road as a trap, causing him
to grab Artemis. They stumble upon each other

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:20.070
while Kong crushes Artemis' bike. Near the
end of the challenge, no one can get past

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.260
King Kong.&nbsp;Afterward, Wade persuades Aech
to assist Artemis in repairing her bike for

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.580
the following race. While Aech is repairing
her bike, Wade and Artemis talk about Halliday

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.890
and the race. While conversing, Artemis reveals
that she's willing to risk everything to save

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:42.510
Oasis from I.O.I. She argues that a real gunter
wonâ€™t just do it for the money.&nbsp;

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.130
In the real world, Wade is lying on his bed
and remembers Artemis' words earlier about

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.560
how Halliday hates making rules. Using the
visor, he goes to the Halliday Journals, a

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.880
place in the Oasis that serves as a personal
shrine to Halliday. With the help of the mechanical

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.690
Curator, Wade observes a memory in which Halliday
and Morrow discuss the future of their creation.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.280
While watching, Wade seems to know what the
video is about as he recites Halliday's lines.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.720
When he is about to leave, he hears Halliday
claim he despises rules and wishes they could

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.780
be reversed.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.310
The following day, Wade returns to the first
challenge. While the rest of the cars move

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.910
forward, he reverses his Delorean, revealing
an underground roadway that leads him beneath

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.620
the race track, past obstacles, and even Kong.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.530
Finally, he arrives at the finish line at
Central Park, where he encounters Anorak,

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.110
who bestows the Copper Key, a hundred thousand
coins, and a clue. Upon getting the prize,

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.880
his avatar name, Parzival, appears first on
the scoreboard.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.380
At I.O.I., several board members express their
concern to Sorrento now that Parzival's name

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.090
has been added to the scoreboard. Sorrento,
on the other hand, is reasonably sure there

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.060
is nothing to be concerned about.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.500
Despite this, he enters the Oasis, where he
meets I-Rok, a bounty hunter, obtaining a

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.590
powerful item known as the Orb of Osuvox.
Sorrento also hires him to keep an eye on

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.380
Parzival and kill him in the Oasis.&nbsp;

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.850
At the same time, Wade spends his newly acquired
wealth on a shopping spree, impulsively buying

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:19.150
the Zemeckis cube, grenade, and finally the
X1 suit, where he can wear it in the real

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.380
world while playing the Oasis. It allows the
player to feel everything in the simulation.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.710
He then informs about the secret passage in
the race with Aech, who tells Daito and shares

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.400
it with Sho. Artemis also makes it upon seeing
Wade race backward during the race, making

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.450
them the top 5.&nbsp;

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:42.150
Meanwhile, Wade spends his free time pondering
the clues about the next challenge, leading

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.050
to a woman named Kira.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:49.640
To confirm his theory, he visits the Halliday
Journals with a swarm of fans until Artemis

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.920
arrives and helps him disguise himself. They
head into Halliday's journals and watch a

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.780
recording of a meeting between Halliday and
Morrow.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.060
Halliday recalls taking a woman named Kira
out on a date, but instead of going dancing,

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.900
he took her to see a movie. Kira eventually
married Morrow, but Wade notes that despite

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.550
her apparent importance in both of their lives,
this is the only time they mention her name

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:12.960
in the Journals.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.770
The Curator mulls it over but concludes that
Wade's analysis is correct. Wade then receives

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.910
a quarter from the Curator and a dance invitation
from Artemis at the Distracted Globe, a unique

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:29.670
club designed by Halliday. That night, while
Wade is ecstatic to meet Artemis, Aech warns

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:34.340
him that she could be using him or that Artemis
could be a dude, warning Wade to limit his

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.990
expectations and focus on their goal.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.900
Despite Aech's protests, Wade decides to dress
up as Buckaroo Banzai, an outfit from his

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:48.050
favorite movie.&nbsp;When Wade arrives at the
Distracted Globe, fans greet and take a picture

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.810
of him until Artemis approaches him from behind.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.150
Later that night, Artemis leads Wade into
a zero-gravity dance floor located at the

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:02.800
center of Distracted Globe.The pair get their
grove on and dance to 70s disco music. Since

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.730
Wade is wearing the X1 suit, he can feel Artemis
from the simulation and finally confesses

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.540
his feelings to her and asks to meet her in
real life.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:17.780
Artemis dismisses his idea, for he might be
disappointed. Still, Wade doesn't seem to

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:24.380
bother, eventually telling her his real name.
Unbeknownst to them, I-Rok is listening intently.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:29.020
Upon revealing his identity, the I.O.I. crashes
the party, attempting to assassinate Wade

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:35.340
before the bounty hunter can strike. Fortunately,
he and Artemis manage to flee using the Zemericks

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.700
cube, bringing back time 60 seconds.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.050
Once safe, Artemis reveals to Wade that her
father died in the I.O.I. loyalty center while

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:47.690
paying off his debt. She can't afford to get
distracted from her mission to find the egg

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:52.780
and potentially prevent further harm to others,
so she dismisses Wade's confession and leaves.&nbsp;

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:59.030
Meanwhile, i-Rok conducts additional research
and quickly provides Sorrento, Wade's complete

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:04.700
profile. Sorrento then informs Finale Zandor,
one of his associates, about Wade, hiring

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:10.970
her to eliminate Wade in real life. The following
day, Sorrento offers Wade many incentives,

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:15.880
including a $25 million bonus to help the
company find the egg.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:21.640
Wade is unimpressed and sees through Sorrentoâ€™s
facade. Wade declines, but not before Sorrento

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.530
admits that he knows where Wade resides in
the real world and tells him he plans to destroy

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:31.240
it. Wade rushes out of his secret hiding spot
in the real world to warn his aunt and her

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.070
boyfriend, but it's too late.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:38.990
The stack on which their home is built explodes
and crashes to the ground. Wade then tries

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.600
to contact his friends, but an unidentified
man with a tattoo on his face knocks him out

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:50.151
and kidnaps him. The following day, Wade wakes
up while still hand-tied. Artemis, whose real

00:09:50.151 --> 00:09:55.270
name is Samantha Cook, confronts him, which
he suddenly knows that she's Artemis in the

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:59.790
Oasis.It turns out that she and a few others
have a base of operations near The Stacks

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.190
and I.O.I.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:07.220
Samantha then takes her to a rooftop and tellsher
about their operation. While a large birthmark

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.400
on her face bothers Samantha, Wade assures
her that he is not disappointed with how she

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.060
turns out to be in real life. When they are
about to kiss, Samantha thinks she may have

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.470
figured out what the first challenge's clue
meant.&nbsp;

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:23.780
Artemis realizes that the clue, "the leap
not taken," was Halliday referring to not

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:29.150
taking the step to be with Kira. The group
gathers in the Oasis and heads to Halliday's

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:33.510
Journals to test her theory and inquires about
the films that Halliday may have taken Kira

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.400
to on their date.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.650
Among the movies that Halliday watched in
that time frame, the next clue leads to "The

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:45.620
Shining." The Curator then directs the group
at the Overlook Hotel. They aim to find the

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.841
key somewhere in the Hotel. While inside,
Aech, who hasn't watched "The Shining" has

00:10:50.841 --> 00:10:53.610
no idea what is in store for them.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:58.760
He gets separated and encounters the twin
children and the naked lady from the movie.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.710
Despite his ignorance, he overcomes several
terrifying situations. Still, when they hear

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:08.140
music coming from one of the rooms, they begin
to doubt their initial assumption of a specific

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.500
key in the film set.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.930
Artemis discovers that Halliday's biggest
fear is not the movie or any books, but his

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:20.060
greatest fear is to kiss a girl, which is
the leap not taken. They enter a ballroom

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:25.630
where they come across Kira, who dances with
a group of zombies over a large pit. Artemis

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:30.540
takes the leap by jumping into the hole, making
the rest of the group dragged out of the film.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:35.850
Artemis eventually makes it past the zombies
and invites Kira to dance, then suddenly Anorak

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:41.380
appears and offers her the Jade Key to the
next clue.&nbsp;The rest of the group soon receive

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.880
their own Jade Key, only to be followed in
by a swarm of Sixers, who are then attacked

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.120
by the horrors of "The Shining."

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.230
Sorrento now knows that Wade is still alive,
and he immediately informs Zandor about an

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:58.540
unidentified, tattooed man who took Wade from
the stacks. She eventually tracks down one

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.230
of Samantha's associates. She follows him
to her hidden location.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:08.630
I.O.I. personnel storm their secret cooperation,
and Wade tries to persuade Samantha to accompany

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:15.029
him on his escape, but she sacrifices herself
so that he can escape. Zandor then confronts

00:12:15.029 --> 00:12:20.029
Samantha, claiming that I.O.I. now owes her
outstanding debts and is taken to I.O.I. 's

00:12:20.029 --> 00:12:25.470
Loyalty Center. As Wade makes his escape,
he runs into a woman, Helen, who reveals herself

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.740
to be Aech in the Oasis.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:34.180
They hide in a van where Wade meets Toshiro
and 11-year-old Shoto, who is Daito and Sho,

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:39.300
respectively. Meanwhile, at the I.O.I., they
already hacked the third challenge and discovered

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:45.460
that it leads to Castle Anorak on Planet Doom,
the most dangerous place in the Oasis. The

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:50.440
final challenge is revealed as an Atari 2600
with all the console's games, but only one

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:56.380
will unlock the last key. Sorrento activates
the Orb of Osuvox, preventing anyone from

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:02.630
entering the castle. At the same time, Sorrento
orders many Loyalty Center employees, including

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:06.250
Samantha, to plant explosive charges outside
the front door.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:11.650
On the other hand, Wade tells Aech what he
remembers of Sorrento's office to save Samantha.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:16.850
The two of them create a digital parallel
of the location, hijacking Sorrento's online

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:21.710
feed before he can return to the real world.
Sorrento falls into their trap and eventually

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.880
reveals Samantha's cellar, leading her to
break free.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.530
Knowing I.O.I. plans, she decides to remain
in the facility and disguises herself as an

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:36.290
I.O.I. soldier to deactivate the Orb of Osuvox.
Meanwhile, Wade and his friends then send

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:41.630
out a live message across the Oasis, informing
everyone of Sorrento's actions and requesting

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:47.050
that anyone who believes in justice come to
Planet Doom to assist them. As a result, many

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:52.050
people arrive, ready to fight against I.O.I.
forces, while Samantha manages to bring the

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.930
orb's protection down.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:59.320
A massive mob of video game characters, as
well as people from sci-fi movies and iconic

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:04.400
films, appear ready to help Wade. A little
while later, she makes it outside the castle

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:10.010
and finds Wade, but not before Sorrento unleashes
his Mecha-Godzilla armored suit on them.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:15.420
Aech activates the Iron Giant hoping it could
defeat Mecha-Godzilla, and Daito transforms

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:20.740
into a Gundam to battle the massive mech,
but both fail. Samantha manages to take down

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:25.610
Sorrento by launching a Madball bomb into
Mecha-Godzillaâ€™s head.&nbsp;Sorrento then goes

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:30.440
on a maniacal rampage through his real-world
facility, convinced that Samantha is still

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.980
inside his company.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.040
Realizing the consequences of killing Sorrento's
avatar, Wade kills Samantha's character in

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.900
the Oasis to save her, and she flees I.O.I.
and meets up with the rest of the group in

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.900
Aech's truck. Once Mecha-Godzilla is taken
down, Sorrento orders to release the explosives

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.900
planted in the castle's front gate, causing
the passage to be destroyed.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.900
However, the Aech's Iron Giant sacrifices
himself as a bridge to allow Wade and Sho

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:45.930
to pass through the broken way.&nbsp;Finally,
Wade and Sho return to the game and make it

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:50.740
to the final challenge. They watch one of
the Sixers plays "Adventure," which he wins

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:56.100
but still fails to get the price. Upon further
observation, Wade realizes how to get the

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:02.270
final key. Sorrento and i-Rok arrive, offering
one last deal to Wade, but not before threatening

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:08.620
to unleash "The Cataclysm," a weapon that
will wipe out every avatar on Planet Doom.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:13.410
Wade tries to stop the madman, but Sorrento
activates the device, killing all the avatars

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:19.120
inside the Oasis.&nbsp;To everyone's surprise,
Wade is still alive in the aftermath of the

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:23.260
explosion. It turns out that the quarter the
Curator gave him at the Halliday's Journal

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:29.180
was apparently an Extra Life Token. Wade then
starts playing adventure, and the Oasis starts

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.130
broadcasting what he's doing.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:36.050
The goal of the final challenge, according
to Wade, is to find the game's hidden Easter

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:41.279
egg, which some consider being one of the
first in video game history.&nbsp;As a result,

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:46.620
the ice crystals shatter, forming Anorak holding
the final Crystal Key. Anorak hands him the

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:51.630
crystal key, and Wade heads into a massive
vault with three keyholes.&nbsp;

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:56.120
On the other hand, I.O.I. and their forces
have located Aech and his truck in the real

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.970
world, causing Wade to invite anyone in the
vicinity to help them since the I.O.I. associates

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:05.780
are trying to get rid of them.&nbsp;After the
long attempts of unlocking the vault, he finally

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:11.750
opens it leading to a castle filled with gold.
His spectators seem delighted, including the

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:17.710
scholars, to finally see the end game of the
contest. Anorak then offers papers to sign.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:21.560
When he is about to sign the contract, Wade
remembers when Halliday forced Morrow to sign

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.800
over his company shares, telling him that
it is the biggest mistake in his life and

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:31.520
that he doesn't want to make the same mistake.
Upon passing the test, Anorak's avatar transforms

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:36.890
into Halliday, and the chamber transforms
into Halliday's childhood room. Inside the

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:42.670
room, Halliday shows Wade a particular button,
which can erase the entire Oasis. Halliday's

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:47.000
younger self appears to be inside the room
playing a video game.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.490
Halliday then heads into his drawer to search
for the Golden Egg. Halliday then gives Wade

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:55.750
the Easter egg, telling him that while the
virtual world can be entertaining, the actual

00:16:55.750 --> 00:17:00.980
world and interacting with real people are
more important. When Halliday is about to

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:05.400
leave, together with his younger self, Wade
asks if he's really dead, but he doesnâ€™t

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.020
answer and simply bids goodbye and leaves.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:13.620
Later on, the group makes it to The Stacks,
but not without being thrown off balance by

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:18.230
Sorrento. He almost kills them, but when he
notices that Wade is holding the Easter egg,

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:23.860
heâ€™s startled and surrenders. The police
suddenly arrive and arrest Sorrento and Finale.

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:29.290
Shortly after, Ogden Morrow arrives at the
truck, congratulating Wade and talking about

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.760
the Oasis.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.430
However, Wade excuses himself as he confesses
his love for Samantha and wants to take a

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:40.410
leap with her. They kiss inside the truck
while the rest of their friends are watching.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:45.650
When suddenly, Morrow and some of the company's
lawyers arrive, demanding Wade's signature.

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:49.380
He claims, however, that he wants to share
the prize with his friends, to which Morrow

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.771
agrees.&nbsp;A little while later, the group,
named High Five, heads out of the bus as the

00:17:54.771 --> 00:17:56.220
people praise and cheer.&nbsp;

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:01.680
Meanwhile, while Morrow and Wade talk about
Halliday, Morrow hands him a coin, revealing

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:07.210
that he was the Curator, praising Wade's detective
work for finding out about Kira. Though he

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:11.550
was instructed not to give players any direct
hints, Wade's insight into their relationship

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:15.530
impressed Morrow and decided to give him a
little boost.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:20.600
Wade even tells Morrow that Halliday's greatest
fear is not to kiss Kira but to lose his only

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:25.720
friend, Morrow. Delighted about the new owners
of the Oasis, Morrow willingly joins them

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:30.930
as the consultant. The new owners prohibit
any Loyalty Centers from operating in the

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.230
Oasis, forcing I.O.I. to shut down.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:37.970
They also turn off the Oasis on Tuesdays and
Thursdays, following Halliday's advice to

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.799
get out and experience the real world.&nbsp; This
story shows an escapism allegory that uses

00:18:39.799 --> 00:18:40.799
technology to engage all the senses, giving
the impression that this fictional world is

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:41.799
real. The Oasis presents itself as a possible
alternative to the miserable and depleted

00:18:41.799 --> 00:18:42.799
world that humanity has created in 2045.

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:43.799
At the same time, it also represents a dream
world, where people could envision what could

00:18:43.799 --> 00:18:44.799
be accomplished if people focused their efforts
on the actual world rather than wasting their

00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:45.799
time in the Oasis.

00:18:45.799 --> 00:18:46.799
It is a world of heroic quests, zero-gravity
nightclubs, and a stable society with excellent

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:47.799
education systems and delimited combat zones.
It achieves a level of safety while also providing

00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:48.799
access to jobs and education that the real
world cannot offer.

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:49.799
&nbsp;
The story also shows the importance of focusing

00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:50.799
our attention on the real world, where everything
really matters. Halliday has to spend a long

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:51.799
time looking for the Easter Egg on his desk
and his drawers towards the ending. However,

00:18:51.799 --> 00:18:52.799
when it's time to hand it over to Wade, he
gives it to him as if it was never essential.

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:53.799
That is because it isn't. What matters most
to Halliday is that Wade understands his regrets

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:54.799
about his life. Halliday has always felt more
at ease in video games than in real life.

00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:55.799
He always felt more at ease in the past than
in the present. After losing his chance at

00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:56.799
love and his friendship with his best friend
near the end of his life, Halliday realized

00:18:56.799 --> 00:18:57.799
the importance of reality, which he described
as "the only thing that's real."

00:18:57.799 --> 00:18:58.799
He gave Wade a greater price than anything
else in the game when he taught him that lesson

00:18:58.799 --> 00:18:59.799
of realization that he can't spend his entire
life escaping. The button's existence suggests

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:00.299
that the world would be a better place without
systems like the Oasis.
