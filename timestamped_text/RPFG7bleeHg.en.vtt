00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.960
Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here. Before we&nbsp;
start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today, I’m going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.320
to recap the second part of the Squid Game series.&nbsp;
In this part, players compete against one another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.880
unlike the games in the first part. They have to&nbsp;
betray their closest friends in order to live.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.880
So, what kind of betrayal will they commit?&nbsp;
Who will survive in the end? Let’s find it out.&nbsp;

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.040
After surviving the game, Seong’s team gathers in&nbsp;
the hall. They enjoy some snacks distributed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.640
the masked men. Unsatisfied with the portion, the&nbsp;
Mafia’s team cuts the queue for a second serving.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.960
Unexpectedly, the snack portion has been&nbsp;
accustomed to the number of players.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.600
So, some of the players don’t get their&nbsp;
rightful serving and a fight breaks out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.720
An angry player is killed by the Mafia in the&nbsp;
fight. Turns out, the masked men do not care&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.240
about the accident and continue their procedures.&nbsp;
100 million won is added to the prize pool and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.920
body is put in a gift-wrapped casket. Knowing the&nbsp;
unspoken rules, the Mafia's team decides to kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.280
other players outside the arena in order to raise&nbsp;
the prize pool and reduce the competition. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.240
players start to make teams in order to defend&nbsp;
themselves against the other teams. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.520
a mysterious player is taken by a masked man to a&nbsp;
hidden room, with the help of a masked supervisor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.880
Turns out, the player is a Doctor who helps the&nbsp;
corrupt masked men to harvest and sell organs of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.920
the near-dead players. In return, the masked&nbsp;
men will inform the Doctor of the next game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.640
so he will have a better chance of surviving.&nbsp;
When the night comes, the lights in the hall are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.960
turned off. However, unlike the other nights, the&nbsp;
players are ready for a war this time. The Mafia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.400
starts by killing a player, and fights break out&nbsp;
on every corner of the room. Seong’s team invites&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.960
the Thief to their team and saves her from the&nbsp;
Mafia. They also try to save the Old Man but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.640
cannot find him in his bed. Turns out, the Old Man&nbsp;
has saved himself by climbing the beds-barricade.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.480
He shouts and asks the players to stop their&nbsp;
crime. Seeing the Old Man’s action, The Front&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.120
Man decides to end the war. The masked men who&nbsp;
have been ready to stop the fight come in and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.400
bring the dead bodies out. Then, the cadavers are&nbsp;
brought to the crematorium room to be cremated.&nbsp;

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.840
On the next day, the remaining players are&nbsp;
gathered to start the third game, with a team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.040
of 10 players. After last night’s war, players&nbsp;
are looking for strong male as their teammates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.720
Seong’s team ends up with 3 women and the Old&nbsp;
Man in their team. Knowing about the next game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.000
the Doctor decides to join the Mafia’s team with&nbsp;
the information as a bargaining chip. Turns out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.520
the next game is Tug of War. The game is held on a&nbsp;
tall platform, where the losing team will fall and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.720
die from the height. With overwhelming strength,&nbsp;
Mafia’s team succeeds in winning the game easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.480
Seong’s team is matched up with an all-male team&nbsp;
which is stronger. Before the game, the Old Man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.600
shares a strategy to win the game. In the early&nbsp;
game, they lock the rope in their armpits and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.760
their feet lock to the ground. They use their&nbsp;
body weight to tire the enemy and make them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.280
feel hopeless. However, due to the difference in&nbsp;
the teams’ strength, they are pushed to the edge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.640
At the last seconds, Cho commands the team to step&nbsp;
forward 3 steps to destroy the opposing team’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.440
momentum and fights back. With this strategy,&nbsp;
they are able to win the game and survive.&nbsp;

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.840
Out of 80 players, 40 players survive and are&nbsp;
gathered once more in the hall. The Doctor is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.040
called once more to harvest the players’ organs&nbsp;
for the corrupt masked men. Turns out, masked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.880
man number 29 is supposedly complicit in the&nbsp;
misconduct and the Policeman participates instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.000
He is asked to deliver the harvested organs to&nbsp;
a buyer with another masked man. The Policeman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.440
witnesses their wrongdoings and is almost found&nbsp;
out due to his reactions. After the operation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.480
the Doctor asks the corrupt masked men about the&nbsp;
next game. However, they claim that they still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.920
don’t know about it and will inform him as soon as&nbsp;
possible. Unsatisfied with the reply, the Doctor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.200
enrages and kills a masked man with his scalpel.&nbsp;
He tries to run away but is chased by the masked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.240
man to the second game’s arena. The masked man&nbsp;
tries to calm him down to keep their secret safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.160
Suddenly, the Front Man shows up and kills both&nbsp;
of them. The Front Man actually doesn’t care about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.880
their wrongdoings, but he hates that the Doctor is&nbsp;
given game information that makes the game unfair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.960
Meanwhile, the Policeman and another masked man&nbsp;
try to meet a buyer. They use a secret passage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.520
to get out of the building. Before meeting&nbsp;
the buyer, the Policeman’s cover is blown-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.560
The Policeman shoots the masked man and&nbsp;
infiltrates the Front Man’s room. Hearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.760
the gunshot, the Front Man rushes to the passage&nbsp;
to find the traitor. He identifies the bullet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.960
as a standard Korean police bullet. He asks his&nbsp;
subordinates to find the infiltrator immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.440
On the other hand, the Policeman continues&nbsp;
to look for information on his brother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.400
In the archive room, he finds out that his&nbsp;
brother is actually a winner of the previous game.&nbsp;

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.400
The next day, the players are prepared&nbsp;
for the fourth game. Unbeknownst to them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.440
the cadavers of the traitors are already hanged on&nbsp;
the ceiling. The masked men ask for the players’&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.680
forgiveness for letting the game’s fairness be&nbsp;
tainted, and remind them of the consequences&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.640
should they do something similar. For the fourth&nbsp;
game, the players are teamed up in a pair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.840
The Old Man is left without a team, but Seong&nbsp;
pities him and invites him to play. Due to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.400
odd number of survivors, Woman is left without&nbsp;
a teammate and is forbidden to enter the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.160
Meanwhile, the rest of the players team up based&nbsp;
on their compatibility. Unbeknownst to them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.880
their team member is actually the one they will&nbsp;
fight against. In the game arena, each of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.000
players are given a pouch containing 10 marbles.&nbsp;
They will play any agreed game with their pair,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.600
using the marbles as the wager. Within 30 minutes,&nbsp;
a player has to win their pair’s 10 marbles in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.880
order to survive. The Old Man is having amnesia&nbsp;
due to his brain tumor and refuses to play.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.120
Seong shouts at the Old Man due to his panic. They&nbsp;
end up playing odds and evens, where they have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.240
guess the opponent’s number of marbles hidden&nbsp;
in the opponent’s palm. As the game goes, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.680
Old Man is prevailing and Seong is left with one&nbsp;
last marble. In the last round, he is still wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.720
in guessing the Old Man’s marble. Even though&nbsp;
Seong is supposedly eliminated at this point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.080
he exploits the Old Man’s amnesia to change his&nbsp;
guess and win the round. He continues to do so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.240
until he has 19 marbles. With only 1 marble left,&nbsp;
the Old Man wanders the arena to recall his past.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.760
Seong forces him to play once more, and the Old&nbsp;
Man proposes to wager all of their marbles in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.920
last game. Upon hearing the proposal, Seong is&nbsp;
enraged since he has 19 marbles in possession.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:51.200
The Old Man reveals that he wasn’t having amnesia&nbsp;
and was aware of Seong’s deception. When Seong is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.840
swallowed in guilt, the Old Man hands him his last&nbsp;
marble and thanks him for being his partner in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.120
playing his last game. After that, the Old Man&nbsp;
is eliminated with Seong mourning his friend’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:07.200
sacrifice. Meanwhile, Cho and Ali decide to play&nbsp;
the same game. With Ali prevailing in most of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.200
rounds, Cho is left with only 1 marble. Due to his&nbsp;
kindness, Ali feels guilty and trusts Cho’s lie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.600
Cho asks Ali to entrust him with his&nbsp;
marbles, and he swaps it with rocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.960
After having 20 marbles in his hand,&nbsp;
Cho survives and Ali is shot to death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.240
On the other hand, the Thief pairs up with&nbsp;
another Girl. They decide to share about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.440
themselves instead of playing. Upon sharing&nbsp;
their past, the Girl realizes that the Thief&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.080
is more worthy of surviving since she has her&nbsp;
brother to take care of. They play a game to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.640
throw their marble the farthest with all the&nbsp;
10 marbles as the wager. The Girl backs down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.440
and loses intentionally. In the end, the&nbsp;
Girl is shot with a big smile on her face.&nbsp;
