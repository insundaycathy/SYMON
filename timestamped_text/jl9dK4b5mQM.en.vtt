00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.240
Welcome to Movies Explained, today&nbsp;
we're looking at the movie 7500.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.160
The story starts at Berlin airport,&nbsp;
where people are moving around,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.320
waiting to board their planes.&nbsp;
The camera zooms in to Vedat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.160
who the officers are searching before boarding the&nbsp;
plane. His various shots play where he buys sodas,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.190
sits next to a strange man, and walks around&nbsp;
the hallways. The screen goes black, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.200
name of the movie, 7500, appears.
The next scene is in the plane,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.080
where flight attendants and pilots are entering&nbsp;
the plane. Michael Lutzmann takes the pilot seat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.160
while Tobias Ellis sits next to him. They&nbsp;
are discussing the details of the airplane.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.120
Michael says, “The plane is technically okay;&nbsp;
only a tire has a small crack which you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.320
change tonight.” He stands up and goes out for&nbsp;
a while. One of the flight attendants, Gokce,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.560
comes into the cockpit and closes the door&nbsp;
behind. She tells Tobias, “My mother called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.120
and said we didn't get in the kindergarten next&nbsp;
door.” Tobias says, “We will find a solution; you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.680
don't have to worry.” He further says, “There is&nbsp;
another kindergarten which is also good but it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.800
far away.” Gokce says, “I want Deniz to have some&nbsp;
German kids around.” They talk for a while and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.120
Gokce leaves when Michael comes back in. He says&nbsp;
to Tobias, “You guys seem to know each other”,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.200
to which he says, “We try to keep our professional&nbsp;
and personal lives separate but can't.” Michael&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.200
assumes that they are married, but Tobias tells&nbsp;
him that they have a kid, Deniz, together who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.480
is currently staying at Gokce's mother, but they&nbsp;
are not married. Mario comes in and brief Michael&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.560
on the details. He leaves and says, “I will be&nbsp;
down if you need me.” Gokce comes in and gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.640
something to Tobias. She then asks the pilots,&nbsp;
“Are you ready to board the plane?” Michael&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.360
replies, “We are born ready.” He asks Gokce,&nbsp;
“Where your name comes from?” She tells him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.080
“It comes from Turkey and my father was a Turk.”&nbsp;
She leaves, and Michael starts giving a departure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.360
briefing. The flight attendants are welcoming&nbsp;
people while Michael and Tobias talk. Tobias&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.480
tells Michael upon asking that he has been for&nbsp;
ten years and is 31. While they are talking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.000
Mario comes in again and says, “I have bad news.&nbsp;
Two passengers are missing, and both have luggage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.360
on the plane. We tried finding them but couldn't.”&nbsp;
Michael says, “We are not going to wait for them;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.663
you can unload their luggage.” Tobias says, “We&nbsp;
can wait if them of you want”, but Michael says,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.663 --> 00:02:01.920
“I hate waiting”. Tobias is checking his phone&nbsp;
when Michael points out two people coming towards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.920
the plane. They are the missing passengers which&nbsp;
the pilots recognize. Mario contacts the cockpit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.080
and says two people are coming your way. He also&nbsp;
informs Michael that he didn't unload the luggage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.000
yet. He signs off by saying that I will come&nbsp;
up to you with the loading papers in a while.&nbsp;

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.600
Michael speaks with the passengers and&nbsp;
welcomes them to the flight to Paris. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.600
tells them that the boarding is complete and&nbsp;
the plane will leave on time. He explains that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.040
Tobias Ellis will fly them today, and they will&nbsp;
contact the passengers with more information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.440
during the flight. Tobias says, “We are ready&nbsp;
for the flight.” They go over the pre-flight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.840
checks when Nathalia comes in and asks the&nbsp;
pilots, “What you want to have in your meals.”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.160
Tobias chooses sandwich and water while&nbsp;
Michael asks for only non-carbonates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.640
water. She leaves, and after completing all the&nbsp;
checks, they take off. They contact European 162&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.360
and go over the details of the track and weather&nbsp;
etc. Michael informs people about the turbulence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.080
and asks them to fasten their seatbelts for their&nbsp;
safety. Michael tells him that tomorrow's weather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.680
doesn't look so bad, to which Tobias replies,&nbsp;
“I haven't checked it out yet.” Nathalia comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.960
in with the food in the cockpit when several men&nbsp;
attack from behind, trying to control the cockpit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.600
Both the pilots are shot and are wounded.&nbsp;
Tobias makes an effort to keep one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.400
attackers out and closes the door to the cockpit&nbsp;
while Michael struggles with the other attacker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.360
While trying to get the hijacker named Kinan off&nbsp;
him, he sets the plane off the trajectory. Tobias&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.160
gets up and renders Kinan unconscious with a fire&nbsp;
extinguisher. Michael tells him to press the nose,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.693
which he does and keeps the plane on track.&nbsp;
Various noises are coming into the cockpit of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.693 --> 00:03:22.080
hijackers trying to spread chaos in the people.&nbsp;
Tobias contacts European 162 and tells them they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.928
have an emergency. European 162 asks, “What is&nbsp;
the problem?”, and he says, “7500.” Tobias tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.928 --> 00:03:34.160
the man on the radio that the plane is hijacked&nbsp;
and the pilot is injured. The attackers tried to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.800
storm into the cockpit, but they have stopped them&nbsp;
for now and have complete control of the plane.&nbsp;

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.640
The man on the radio asks about the status of&nbsp;
the flight attendants, to which Tobias says,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.240
“I am not aware.” He goes into the details when&nbsp;
Kinan starts to gain consciousness. Tobias leaves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.240
his seat and beats him with his feet, and ties&nbsp;
his hands with tape. He tells Michael to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.960
the pressure on the wound and talk to him while&nbsp;
Tobias ties Kinan with a belt. Tobias comes back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.840
to his seat and asks Michael how Michael is doing.&nbsp;
He comes in contact with European 162 and says,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.760
“I want to make a landing in Berlin”, to which&nbsp;
the man replies, “It will take 30 minutes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.800
so you have to make your landing to Hanover, which&nbsp;
is the nearest.” Tobias confirms the location,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.120
and the man tells him, “We have informed&nbsp;
Hanover of an emergency landing and are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.794
making the necessary preparations.” Upon further&nbsp;
asking, Tobias tells the European 162 that one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.794 --> 00:04:18.320
of the flight attendants is dead while he hopes&nbsp;
others are safe. The man on the radio asks, “How&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.160
many hijackers are there and how they are armed?”&nbsp;
Tobias says, “I have seen the four of them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.600
but there may be more at the back of the plane.&nbsp;
I didn't see any weapons except broken glass,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.560
which they are using as knives.” Tobias signs&nbsp;
off from the radio to take care of his wound.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.480
He wraps a bandage around his wounded arm to&nbsp;
stop the bleeding and comes back to his seat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.880
Tobias asks Michael how he is doing, but&nbsp;
this time gets no reply. He tries to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.880
him off the seat and at last succeeds. Ellis&nbsp;
tries giving him compressions and breathe but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.480
receives no response. He comes back to the seat&nbsp;
and tells European 162 that the captain is dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.640
The man informs him that landing at Hanover is&nbsp;
ready, and two Eurofighter are heading your way.&nbsp;

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.360
He takes the phone and starts talking to the&nbsp;
people. He says, “We have complete control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.440
of the plane. Several men tried to storm in the&nbsp;
cockpit, but we prevented it. We will be making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.360
an emergency landing in 20 minutes in Hanover.&nbsp;
Stay calm and fasten your seat belts.” He looks at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.920
the screen and sees the attackers threatening to&nbsp;
kill one of the hostages. He connects to European&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.880
162 and tells them that hijackers threaten to&nbsp;
kill a hostage if they don't open the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.280
The man says, “You know you can’t do it.” He&nbsp;
takes the phone and talks to the hijackers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.740
They start talking to him in German,&nbsp;
to which he says, “I am American so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.840
please say whatever you are saying in English.”&nbsp;
Vedat asks Tobias where Kinan is. He shouts and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.680
yells and says that you can't land the plane. If&nbsp;
you land it, we will kill the boy. Tobias replies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.160
“I can't open the door you have to get away from&nbsp;
the boy.” The hijacker's named Vedat and Daniel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:52.080
keep saying that you have to open the door or&nbsp;
kill the boy. The hijackers start counting from 10&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.840
and say, you have 10 seconds, or the boy will&nbsp;
die—Tobias answers I cannot do anything. I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.600
sorry and turns off the screen. The banging&nbsp;
continues on the door while Tobias goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.920
over the landing details. He turns the&nbsp;
screen on and finds the hostage dead.&nbsp;

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.720
The man from European 162 comes on the radio with&nbsp;
the updates of the landing. Tobias tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.040
he didn’t open the door, and the hijackers killed&nbsp;
the boy. The man tells him that the fighter jets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.280
will be around him in two minutes. Tobias takes&nbsp;
the phone and says to the hijackers, “I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.480
talked to the authorities, and they are saying&nbsp;
when we land and refuel, you can go anywhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.120
you like and negotiate your terms. We don’t have&nbsp;
enough fuel, so we have to land.” Vedat and Daniel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.600
keep saying that we don’t want to land; you will&nbsp;
see all these people die if you do. Daniel goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.720
into the cabin and brings Gokce with him. Tobias&nbsp;
becomes overwhelmed and begs the hijackers to let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.000
the woman go. He says, “I will kill Kinan if&nbsp;
you do not let her go.” Left with no choice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.120
Tobias picks up the phone and addresses the&nbsp;
people. He says, “The hijackers will kill a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.760
young woman in front of the plane. You can&nbsp;
stop them. The hijackers don’t have any guns;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.014
they have broken glass. They are going&nbsp;
to kill her. If you work together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.014 --> 00:06:55.840
you can overpower the hijackers and kill them.”
He begs them to come forward and save Gokce.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.640
Vedat asks Tobias over the phone, that why are&nbsp;
you not opening the door? Daniel is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.440
kill everyone. Tobias tries to talk to Vedat&nbsp;
when Daniel leaves. Tobias says to Vedat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.560
“I know you are not like him; you can stop him.&nbsp;
You are better than him.” Vedat says, “I can’t”,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.960
but Tobias keeps on telling him that he can and&nbsp;
he should. He begs him and cries for his help.&nbsp;

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.640
Daniel brings Gokce in front of the camera&nbsp;
while she begs him not to kill her. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.760
keeps on repeating that she has a son, let me go.&nbsp;
Tobias tells the people to fasten their seatbelts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.000
Vedat tries to fight Daniel, but he fails. After&nbsp;
going through all the possibilities, Tobias agrees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.280
to open the door to the cockpit, but Gokce says,&nbsp;
“You don’t have to listen to them.” The hijackers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.280
keep on threatening her while she says her&nbsp;
last words to Tobias. She tells Tobias to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.080
take care of their son Deniz. Daniel kills&nbsp;
Gokce at last. Tobias is devastated by this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.840
and he screams and shouts while hitting&nbsp;
different things in the cockpit. The radio&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.240
calls Tobias many times, and so he comes&nbsp;
in and reports to European 162. The German&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.160
defense department speaks with him and tells him&nbsp;
that we will escort him to Hanover, follow us.&nbsp;

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.280
Meanwhile, Kinan wakes up and sets himself free.&nbsp;
Kinan hits Tobias, and he becomes unconscious.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.840
Kinan opens the cockpit door and lets Vedat in&nbsp;
while the passengers attack the other hijackers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:08.400
Kinan clears his intentions of crashing the plane,&nbsp;
which makes Vedat scared. The fear of death makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.840
Vedat strike Kinan with the broken glass, which&nbsp;
kills him after a brief fight. Tobias says Vedat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.040
to set him free and let him take control of the&nbsp;
plane. Vedat helps Tobias stabilize the plan.&nbsp;

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.000
Tobias connects with European 162 and updates&nbsp;
them on the situation. He says, I have gained&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.800
control of the plane. One of the hijackers is dead&nbsp;
while the other one is here with me.” The man on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.040
the radio says, "I want to confirm that you are&nbsp;
ready for the emergency landing.” Tobias says,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.280
“Yes, of course, I am.” Vedat panics and says,&nbsp;
“You can't land; you have to drop me somewhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.800
else.” Tobias repeats what he said before, “We are&nbsp;
out of fuel. Once we refuel, you can go anywhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.200
you like.” Tobias confirms the landing to the&nbsp;
man on the radio. He says Vedat to sit down and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.080
fasten his seat belt as the landing will not be&nbsp;
smooth. He says to Vedat, “I am going to inform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.520
the passengers if that is okay with you.” Vedat&nbsp;
permits him, and Tobias speaks to the passengers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.600
He says, “The hijackers have taken control of&nbsp;
the plane, but they have agreed to an emergency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.120
landing. Stay calm and tighten your belts because&nbsp;
the landing will not be a smooth one.” Vedat looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.280
around and finds the jets and asks Tobias what&nbsp;
that, to which he replies it is just the standard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.760
protocol is. Tobias gives some instructions to&nbsp;
Vedat to follow as they make the landing. Vedat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.520
helps him to coordinate the landing, and finally,&nbsp;
the plane lands. The police are surrounding the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.680
parameter. The man from the radio says, “The&nbsp;
police will talk to you on this frequency.”&nbsp;

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.760
Vedat becomes scared and starts crying. He&nbsp;
questions Tobias about what he is doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.800
Tobias tells him that I have opened the emergency&nbsp;
exit if you want to go. Vedat tells him to come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.440
and sit on the floor next to Kinan’s body. Vedat&nbsp;
points to the radio and says, “How can I talk to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.280
the man speaking.” Tobias tells him to use the&nbsp;
microphone on the left side and push the button.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.600
Vedat talks to the negotiator and asks him for&nbsp;
fuel. He becomes aggressive and emotionally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.960
unstable, realizing what he has just done. Vedat&nbsp;
sits close to Tobias and starts talking to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.920
He asks his name, where does he lives, and talks&nbsp;
about the part in Wilhelmstrasse. Tobias tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.760
him that I go there often with my son&nbsp;
Deniz. Vedat asks Tobias about the unique&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.217
name of his son, to which Tobias replies,&nbsp;
“It is Turkish and he got it from her mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.217 --> 00:09:58.640
who is from Turkey.” Vedat asks, “What&nbsp;
happened to his mother”, and Tobias thinks of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.600
striking him with the hidden glass but he stops.
Vedat loses control once again and starts yelling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.040
at Tobias. Tobias tries to talk to him and asks&nbsp;
him his age. Vedat says, “I am just 18.” Vedat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.000
checks the news and finds everyone talking&nbsp;
about the hijacking. He becomes angry at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.320
Tobias and says, “What did you do?”. The&nbsp;
negotiator on the outside tells him not to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:22.320
move. Finally, the police take a shot at Vedat&nbsp;
and strike him down. They rescue Tobias while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.560
he keeps on asking for a doctor for Vedat.&nbsp;
The officer enters and takes people out. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.840
story ends with Tobias moving past Gokce's&nbsp;
body while Vedat’s phone rings on the floor.
