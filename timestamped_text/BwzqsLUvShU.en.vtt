This is a spoiler content video, Enjoy the video and let’s start the story,

00:00:42.614 --> 00:00:47.700
The film begins in 1946, New York City,
in a luxury house,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.543
there is a woman named Barbara who is holding a baby,

00:00:50.543 --> 00:00:54.112
this little newborn baby is named Antony Baekeland,

00:00:54.112 --> 00:00:57.926
and the film Savage Grace is, starting.

00:00:57.926 --> 00:01:01.326
The scene continues when Barbara is on the phone with her friend.

00:01:01.326 --> 00:01:07.653
Not long after, her husband arrives and they talk about the socialite party they are going to attend tonight.

00:01:07.653 --> 00:01:12.125
Barbara’s husband, Brooks Baekeland is the heir and grandson of Leo Baekeland,

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:14.292
the inventor of bakelite plastic,

00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:15.972
so he's been rich since birth.

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:20.686
That night, they come to a socialite dinner at a luxury restaurant,

00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:27.538
While their son Anthony is entrusted to his grandmother named Nini, Barbara's mother.

00:01:27.538 --> 00:01:34.636
After dinner, it seems that the two of them are quarreling,
even when they want to go to sleep, they still spit out words,

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:37.904
so this is a sign that their relationship isn't going well.

00:01:39.195 --> 00:01:42.213
Then the scene moves to 1959 in Paris,

00:01:42.213 --> 00:01:44.449
Now Antony is 12 years old,

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:48.993
he grows into a good and intelligent boy who is proficient in French.

00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:55.205
Then when his father has a guest, Barbara, who feels herself and her child being harassed by this guest,

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:58.429
finally she gets angry and immediately kicks the guest out.

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.142
Her husband, who is disappointed with Barbara,
finally he goes to rent a hotel to sleep alone,

00:02:04.142 --> 00:02:08.465
but apparently Barbara follows her husband,
so that her husband will forgive her,

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:12.423
in the end, Barbara gives her bottom cave to enjoy by her husband,

00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:14.668
So they are making love and get back together.

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:22.305
After they are satisfied, they go home, both of them are surprised to find a boy sleeping in Antony's room,

00:02:22.305 --> 00:02:24.787
his father says,
who is the boy ?

00:02:24.787 --> 00:02:31.639
Antony who is bathing in a relaxed manner replies, "that's my friend, I don't want to be alone when you guys are not home.

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.977
so I invite my friend to talk and play together in my room."

00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:42.524
Antony's father looks annoyed with that answer and immediately tells Antony to kick his friend away, while Barbara only smiles and smiles.

00:02:43.488 --> 00:02:46.946
Then the scene moves to 1967,

00:02:46.946 --> 00:02:48.988
Antony is already 20 years old now,

00:02:48.988 --> 00:02:51.131
his family has moved to Spain,

00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:53.777
there Antony starts spending time with his friends,

00:02:53.777 --> 00:02:57.736
he even gets acquainted with a Spanish girl named Blanca.

00:02:57.736 --> 00:03:00.830
His father thinks that Antony had found the girl he liked,

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.925
so He and Barbara welcome her happily and even invite Blanca to go on vacation with their family.

00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:07.673
When they are on vacation,

00:03:07.673 --> 00:03:10.897
it is seen that Antony's father is more interested in Blanca,

00:03:10.897 --> 00:03:12.757
the two of them are chatting like that,

00:03:12.757 --> 00:03:16.609
so that Barbara,
who feels neglected, she becomes annoyed.

00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:20.713
then the scene moves to 1968,

00:03:20.713 --> 00:03:22.281
a year later at an airport,

00:03:22.281 --> 00:03:24.694
Barbara wants to pick up her new secretary,

00:03:24.694 --> 00:03:27.562
but suddenly she sees her husband is with a young woman,

00:03:27.562 --> 00:03:29.047
who else if not Blanca,

00:03:29.047 --> 00:03:32.333
when they look at each other,
they both immediately avoids her,

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:34.844
but Barbara follows them until she gets them.

00:03:34.844 --> 00:03:36.314
In front of everyone,

00:03:36.314 --> 00:03:39.302
Barbara gets angry and curses her husband and Blanca,

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:43.791
Barbara is very disappointed and does not expect her husband to have an affair behind her,

00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:47.836
because their affair not only hurt Barbara's heart but also Antony's heart.

00:03:47.836 --> 00:03:53.073
Barbara who is still sad, Now become even sadder, because when she gets home,

00:03:53.073 --> 00:03:56.503
she sees Antony and her boyfriend are doing a samurai sword fight.

00:03:56.503 --> 00:04:02.773
Antony says to his mother that he really doesn't love Blanca, because he only likes this guy, his boyfriend.

00:04:02.773 --> 00:04:07.886
Barbara who just found out about it, can't say any more words and can only just give up.

00:04:07.886 --> 00:04:12.846
Barbara who has just hired a new secretary, is finally able to treat her pain a little,

00:04:12.846 --> 00:04:14.491
this gay man named Sam,

00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:17.448
he is usually in charge of escorting wealthy women,

00:04:17.448 --> 00:04:21.656
and now he is tasked with accompanying Barbara's days while giving her a bit of advice,

00:04:21.656 --> 00:04:23.767
so that she can get out of her slump,

00:04:23.767 --> 00:04:26.790
one of the advice is by suggesting her to return to painting.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.142
On the other hand, Antony who is also disappointed with his father's treatment,

00:04:32.142 --> 00:04:34.234
finally becomes close to Sam,

00:04:34.234 --> 00:04:37.612
the two of them even sleep together and do a samurai sword fight.

00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:42.611
without them knowing, it turns out that Barbara knows it.

00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:47.969
At breakfast, Barbara scolds Sam because he had done a samurai sword fight with her son.

00:04:48.109 --> 00:04:54.861
Antony who sees his mother's increasingly sensitive attitude, finally sends a letter to his father telling him to go back with his mother,

00:04:55.188 --> 00:04:58.812
besides that Antony also tells a little about his disturbed mind.

00:04:58.812 --> 00:05:03.151
Then it looks like Barbara is starting to follow Sam's advice by going back to painting,

00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:09.055
but before the painting is finished, Barbara can't hold back her sadness so she throws her brush away.

00:05:09.055 --> 00:05:12.513
Sam who sees her from afar then goes to calm her down,

00:05:12.513 --> 00:05:15.514
because barbara hasn't made love in a very long time,

00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:20.094
finally she orders Sam to explore her bottom cave until she feels satisfied.

00:05:20.094 --> 00:05:23.392
even though Sam is gay but they are still making love together.

00:05:23.392 --> 00:05:28.572
After being satisfied, Unexpectedly Antony sees his mother who is sleeping with Sam,

00:05:28.572 --> 00:05:30.674
so He decides to go to bed with them.

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:32.945
when Barbara wakes up,

00:05:32.945 --> 00:05:36.162
She is very surprised that Antony is beside Sam,

00:05:36.162 --> 00:05:43.015
Surprisingly, Barbara laughs until they all wake up and laugh too, when they fell silent again their desire came back,

00:05:43.015 --> 00:05:46.607
and finally the mother, son and secretary do a making love scene,

00:05:46.607 --> 00:05:48.851
wow that's really amazing.

00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:55.580
After that, Barbara starts to be cheerful again but the happiness she feels doesn't last long because Sam has to leave them

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.551
Finally Barbara is being stressed again and decides to suicide.

00:05:59.551 --> 00:06:07.915
It turns out that this reckless thing was actually also influenced by an incident in her past where his father and grandfather also died by suicide.

00:06:07.915 --> 00:06:10.278
Fortunately Barbara can still be saved,

00:06:10.278 --> 00:06:13.817
Barbara and Antony are back struggling for their days.

00:06:13.817 --> 00:06:20.257
As a son, Antony tries to protect and help his mother,
including treating the wound on his mother's hand.

00:06:20.257 --> 00:06:26.603
Besides that, Antony also often writes letters to his father even though his father never replies to his letters.

00:06:26.603 --> 00:06:32.427
in his letter Antony tells about his habit of writing in reverse,
so no one could read what he was thinking.

00:06:32.427 --> 00:06:37.277
He also tells him about his pet's leashes that were lost and he can't sleep because of that.

00:06:37.277 --> 00:06:41.713
From this, it can be concluded that Antony's mental health is being disturbed.

00:06:41.713 --> 00:06:46.977
then the scene moves to 1972, Antony and Barbara have moved to London now.

00:06:46.977 --> 00:06:49.905
there Barbara resumes her life as a socialite.

00:06:49.905 --> 00:06:55.480
When Barbara comes home, Antony asks her about the whereabouts of the dog collar he had been looking for.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.435
but Barbara says she doesn't know about the dog collar.

00:06:58.435 --> 00:07:03.863
Then Barbara changes the topic by discussing Antony's disorder who likes the same sex or gay.

00:07:03.863 --> 00:07:07.867
Barbara is thinking about healing her son here by touching her son's carrot,

00:07:07.867 --> 00:07:09.624
in the hope that his carrot will get up.

00:07:11.381 --> 00:07:17.325
After getting up a little, Barbara puts the carrot into her bottom cave and sways on her son's lap,

00:07:17.325 --> 00:07:19.688
but unfortunately because there is no desire,

00:07:19.688 --> 00:07:22.305
Antony's carrot returns to being sluggish,

00:07:22.305 --> 00:07:25.927
so everything seems in vain because Barbara is not satisfied.

00:07:25.927 --> 00:07:28.232
Barbara's treatment didn't cure Antony,

00:07:28.232 --> 00:07:30.648
but instead worsened Antony's mental health.

00:07:32.576 --> 00:07:35.129
then Antony asks again about the dog collar.

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:40.124
Now Barbara can’t take it anymore, so she decides to help him to find the dog collar,

00:07:40.124 --> 00:07:43.059
but Antony finds it first in the kitchen,

00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:45.701
After that, Antony starts crying,

00:07:45.701 --> 00:07:50.256
Barbara sees it then scolds Antony who is crying while sucking his thumb.

00:07:50.256 --> 00:07:53.225
Antony accuses his mother of hiding the dog collar,

00:07:53.225 --> 00:07:56.963
Antony also accuses his mother of writing backwards in his book.

00:07:56.963 --> 00:08:00.944
Barbara is clearly confused because she doesn't know what Antony is saying.

00:08:00.944 --> 00:08:03.242
It turns out that in his true story,

00:08:03.242 --> 00:08:05.413
Antony suffers from Schizophrenia,

00:08:05.413 --> 00:08:11.931
which is a mental disorder with Major symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and disorganized thinking.

00:08:12.817 --> 00:08:14.801
Because the debate continues,

00:08:14.801 --> 00:08:18.836
At the end, suddenly Antony stabs a knife into his mother's stomach.

00:08:19.834 --> 00:08:26.849
Strangely, in this situation, Antony still has time to order food and eats quietly beside his mother's corpse.

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:29.479
Because he is proven to have stabbed his mother,

00:08:29.479 --> 00:08:31.439
finally Antony is arrested.

00:08:32.801 --> 00:08:34.319
At the end of the film,

00:08:34.319 --> 00:08:38.548
It appears a black screen with writings that tell about Antony's life after.

00:08:38.548 --> 00:08:45.327
because he had a mental illness, Antony did not serve his sentence in prison but he was sent to a mental hospital for treatment,

00:08:45.327 --> 00:08:47.691
after being considered cured in 1980,

00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:51.297
He was released and lived with Nini, his grandmother in America.

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:54.908
but only a week later he stabbed a knife into his grandmother's body,

00:08:54.908 --> 00:08:57.462
luckily his grandmother was still alive.

00:08:57.462 --> 00:09:00.137
finally Antony was actually thrown in jail.

00:09:00.137 --> 00:09:06.256
but in 1981 he committed suicide by covering his head with a plastic bag until he ran out of breath

00:09:06.256 --> 00:09:08.522
