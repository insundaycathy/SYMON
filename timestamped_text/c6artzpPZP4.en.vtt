00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.280
Welcome to Movie Shortens. Follow&nbsp;
us today to a movie titled: Exist. 
&nbsp;

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.080
Be aware, there are spoilers!
Traveling into the woods, a group of five&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.960
record their adventures on their way to their&nbsp;
destination. Brian and Matt who are brothers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.680
Matt's girlfriend Dora and their friends Todd&nbsp;
and Elizabeth. The ultimate goal is to get to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.800
a cabin which belongs to Brian and Matt’s&nbsp;
uncle. They stop in and make a purchase at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.200
a firework stand. The journey continues as&nbsp;
they enter the woods taking in the scenery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.240
Later that night, as they are driving through the&nbsp;
woods their car strikes an unknown creature. 
&nbsp;

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.280
The guys go out to inspect the damage, thinking&nbsp;
they’ve hit a deer. Then the sound of a wailing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.800
animal is heard echoing in the forest. The boys&nbsp;
go out with night vision goggles to investigate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.920
what is making the sound. Something passes through&nbsp;
the bush. Before they can determine what it is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.880
Elizabeth honks the horn, telling&nbsp;
them it is time to go. 
&nbsp;

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.160
While Matt continues driving, Brian takes a&nbsp;
look at the footage that they captured prior&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.120
to the accident. At first, he was annoyed&nbsp;
as his friends had lit his beard on fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.320
Continuing to look through the footage, he gets&nbsp;
a glimpse of the animal. However, he discovers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.120
that whatever creature it was, it was walking&nbsp;
upright. Just then Matt informs the car that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.960
they have arrived. As they drive up a dirt road,&nbsp;
they come across a fallen tree blocking their car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.480
from driving further. They decide to walk the rest&nbsp;
of the way. Eventually they make it to the cabin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.520
but they find that the door has been left open.
Looking around the cabin, it is apparent that no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.360
one has lived here for quite some time, as leaves&nbsp;
are scattered everywhere. Brian jumps on one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.200
the beds, making dust fly up around the cabin.&nbsp;
As he is being rambunctious, they hear a strange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.800
sound. Matt investigates, leading him to a&nbsp;
partially closed room. He opens the door as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.560
squealing and screaming ensue. It turns out that&nbsp;
there is a pig in the cabin. The discovery of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.640
pig is the last straw, they agree to leave&nbsp;
the cabin and sleep in the car instead.
&nbsp;

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.160
While his friends are asleep, Brian takes&nbsp;
video but soon hears a low howling coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.720
from the woods. Matt is awakened, and&nbsp;
both question what is making the noise.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.400
Matt turns on the headlights so that they can see,&nbsp;
yet nothing is visible. Brian lowers his window,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.600
and claims he can hear something crying, so Matt&nbsp;
tells him to raise the window back up. Brian then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.200
asks Matt if the unusual sound might be the thing&nbsp;
that Uncle Bob saw. Matt is dismissive, telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.360
Brian not to talk about it. When morning comes,&nbsp;
they are better able to see the damage to the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.640
They find blood on the lights and on the bumper,&nbsp;
a small bit of hair is stuck in the radiator. 
&nbsp;

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.680
A bit later, Brian is readying his camera for&nbsp;
the bike jump into the lake a while later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.760
They’re laughing and flipping into the&nbsp;
water, followed by some skinny dipping.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.600
Brian follows Elizabeth and Todd who appear to be&nbsp;
doing some exploring, when Brian sees something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.320
run across the ridge in the woods. Brian then&nbsp;
goes back to the spot he initially recorded the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.440
sighting. He begins speaking to the camera about&nbsp;
an encounter his uncle had in these same woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.960
Something that scared him terribly. Brian then&nbsp;
finds a footprint, a big-foot print. Then the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.600
sounds of leaves rustling and a creature are&nbsp;
heard, enough to get Brian to leave the area. 
&nbsp;

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.760
Night has come, and Brian is out in the woods,&nbsp;
making bad attempts at mimicking animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.720
Dora comes out asking him what he’s doing, and he&nbsp;
assures her it’s to become famous. He falls asleep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.840
on the hammock, then hears some noises in the&nbsp;
woods yet again. Thinking he’s heard Sasquatch;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.640
he slowly approaches a tree where he&nbsp;
thinks it's hiding. To his surprise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.280
it's just Todd and Matt, armed with paintball&nbsp;
guns, who proceed to unload on him. 
&nbsp;

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.080
As they mock Brian for being scared of Sasquatch,&nbsp;
it begins howling. The three then run inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.200
close the doors, and turn off all the lights.&nbsp;
From the darkness, the silhouette of Sasquatch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.880
walks up to the door. Brian goes to the window,&nbsp;
and gets to see Bigfoot firsthand, it roars and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.080
runs away. Just a few moments later everyone&nbsp;
hears the sound of metal and glass being broken.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.680
The next morning, as the group begin to leave,&nbsp;
they find that the car has been smashed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.880
impaled by a branch, and will no longer start. 
Back in the cabin, the group debate their coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.320
plans. Dora suggests waiting for uncle Bob.&nbsp;
Brian tells them that they’ve stolen his key,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.800
and that nobody knows that they are out&nbsp;
there. Matt volunteers to ride a bike back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.520
to civilization to get cell reception to call&nbsp;
for help. He stops periodically checking for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.480
cell reception. In the meantime, the rest of&nbsp;
the group start to barricade inside the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.200
As they move things around, they find a cellar&nbsp;
underneath a rug. Todd explores the cellar and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.880
finds a gun, loaded, and with ammunition. Brian&nbsp;
finally gets a cell signal and dials 9-11,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.360
but the reception is not strong enough.&nbsp;
He then calls Uncle Bob, just then he sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.600
Sasquatch approaching from behind. 
Matt frantically takes off, alerting his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.680
uncle that he and his friends are at his cabin.&nbsp;
Sasquatch roars and gives chase. After doing his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.080
best to outpace it, the Sasquatch catches up to&nbsp;
him, making him miss his turn back to the cabin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.760
He tumbles off his bike and finds that his right&nbsp;
is broken and the bone is exposed. With all his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.200
might, he tries to hobble away from the Sasquatch,&nbsp;
but it eventually grabs him and tosses him. 
&nbsp;

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.560
Back at the cabin, Brian lets the rest of the&nbsp;
group know that the dangers were known but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.600
didn’t believe in it. Just as Todd tries to&nbsp;
reassure them that Matt will pull through,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.880
the bike Matt had been riding, sails through the&nbsp;
air and lands on the porch. The group realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.720
that Sasquatch is nearby, and barricade themselves&nbsp;
further inside. As night finally comes, Sasquatch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.320
returns, taking out the generator. Sasquatch&nbsp;
then tries to get through the door, but he can’t,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.600
so he instead comes through the window. Todd&nbsp;
shoots at it as the rest retreat into a nearby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.720
room. Sasquatch then tries to get in, only&nbsp;
stopping when Todd shoots at the door. 
&nbsp;

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.080
Just when they think it has left, Sasquatch’s arm&nbsp;
reaches through the window and grabs Elizabeth by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.640
the neck. Violently smashing her against&nbsp;
the wall, picking her up, and strangling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.160
her. Sasquatch throws Elizabeth, as the group&nbsp;
retreat to the cellar, Todd carrying Elizabeth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.440
Sasquatch disassembles the upper floor searching&nbsp;
for them. Elizabeth then regains consciousness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.400
which alerts Sasquatch as to where they&nbsp;
are. It then proceeds to kick in the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.720
but Todd shoots and is finally able&nbsp;
to hit it. Finally, it runs off. 
&nbsp;

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.000
The next morning, they find that the&nbsp;
upstairs has been completely wrecked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.120
Brian gives them the ok to come back up, but&nbsp;
Elizabeth has not made it through the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.080
They decide that they must leave immediately,&nbsp;
they will come back for Elizabeth’s body later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.360
Brian suggests taking a trail through the woods,&nbsp;
enabling them to get to safety faster. They then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.880
come across Matt’s backpack, and then find Matt’s&nbsp;
helmet. Dora erupts in sadness thinking Matt must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.280
have been killed. The three continue through&nbsp;
the woods, and find shelter for the night.
&nbsp;

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:58.080
As they rest, they hear something out in the woods&nbsp;
again. Sasquatch isn’t far away. Todd goes into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.640
fit of rage, shooting erratically into the woods.&nbsp;
Sasquatch keeps distance, and instead hurls rocks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.480
at them. Todd then finds out that the shell in&nbsp;
the gun isn’t ejecting. Todd tells both Brian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.080
and Dora they need to run for it. Just as they&nbsp;
get a reasonable distance, they find an abandoned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.520
camper. However, optimism turns into horror when&nbsp;
they hear the screams of Matt tearing through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.560
woods. They follow the screams to a tunnel. Brian&nbsp;
takes the gun and begins looking for him. 
&nbsp;

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.000
Crawling his way through the tunnel, Brian finds&nbsp;
Matt curled up in pain. Matt’s legs have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.080
smashed. Sasquatch is still in the area. Brian&nbsp;
is then able to take a shot at it, scaring it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.960
away temporarily, dragging his brother through&nbsp;
the tunnel back towards the rest of the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.960
Once reunited, they head back to the camper&nbsp;
for shelter. They get a bit of a signal, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.400
Uncle Bob confirms that he is at the cabin. Todd&nbsp;
then comes up with a plan to use the fireworks to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:00.480
make some noise, so that Uncle Bob can find their&nbsp;
location. After Todd launches off the fireworks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.600
Sasquatch appears through the smoke. He&nbsp;
begins chasing Todd all the way to the camper.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.000
It eventually catches up with him, dragging&nbsp;
him back into the woods and killing him. 
&nbsp;

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.360
As the rest tremble in fear about what just&nbsp;
happened, they are startled as Todd’s body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.720
is thrown into the camper. Sasquatch then&nbsp;
comes close but does not enter. Instead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:26.560
it pushes the camper off a cliff. The three tumble&nbsp;
a good distance as Brian finds that he is injured,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.920
Matt has died, and Dora is about to die. To&nbsp;
make things worse, Sasquatch leaps off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:38.320
cliff and onto the camper, it now chases Brian,&nbsp;
and tears through the camper. Brian runs for his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:44.080
life rolling down a hill. He is not dead but&nbsp;
decides to play dead as Sasquatch gets close.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:50.320
It roars in his face, and shakes him, but Brian&nbsp;
continues faking his demise, till finally it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.960
starts dragging him through the woods. 
Sasquatch drags Brian to an open area of the woods&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:00.720
and leaves. Brian opens his eyes and sees that&nbsp;
Sasquatch has dragged him and all of his friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:07.200
to the same area, lining their bodies up right&nbsp;
next to one another. Panicking, he sees a smaller&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.800
Sasquatch. It has been placed in a hole, and has&nbsp;
been decorated with branches sticking out of its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:18.560
body. Sasquatch returns and shoves Brian towards&nbsp;
the baby. It continues pushing Brian towards it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:24.160
as to show Brian what he and his friends have&nbsp;
done. It's at this moment, the sound of a gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.760
breaks the interaction, and Sasquatch runs off. 
Uncle Bob has come to the rescue leading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.000
him through some more woods. As Brian&nbsp;
cries out about the mistake he’s made,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.680
Sasquatch tackles Uncle Bob. Brian grabs the gun&nbsp;
and runs for it, but eventually stops and points&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.600
it at Sasquatch. He tells it he is sorry, and&nbsp;
it was an accident what happened to his baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.640
Brian gets a good look at Sasquatch and can&nbsp;
see that he has been shot and is bleeding.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.840
After staring each other down, Brian decides&nbsp;
to stop the escalation and places the gun down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.920
Brian turns to the camera saying this is his last&nbsp;
video, he then turns his back to Sasquatch, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:08.160
prepares for death. However, Sasquatch walks the&nbsp;
other way, leaving Brian as the sole survivor.
