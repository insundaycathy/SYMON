00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.230
Welcome back to Movie Recaps Today I will
show you a drama, mystery, thriller film from

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.990
2014, titled Before I go to sleep.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.039
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:10.690
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.000
Christine wakes up in bed next to someone.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.370
She gets up and grabs some clothes, then walks
into the bathroom.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.860
One of the bathroom walls is covered in photographs
of her and the man.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.210
She sees the weeding band on her hand, then
walks outside.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.980
Ben is waiting for her on the bed.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.940
He tells her that they got married 14 years
ago and that she's 40 years old.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.510
As she gets dressed, he explains that she
had a car accident 14 years ago, because of

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.750
which she gained some injuries which made
it impossible for her to remember everything.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.880
She stores up information for a day, then
when she goes to bed it all disappears and

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.300
when she wakes up she thinks she's in her
twenties.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.820
He asks her to trust him, but she's scared.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.010
While making breakfast, he keeps telling her
about their life together and their wedding.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.920
Before he leaves for work, Ben shows her a
list of things she might need and where to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.920
find them.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.670
She sees a note which says that she needs
to pack a bag.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.600
Ben tells her that he'll be taking her away
for their anniversary.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.150
Christine is alone, trying to wrap her head
around everything when the telephone rings.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.640
The voice on the other side is Doctor Nasch,
who's been working with her on getting her

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.040
memory restored.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.030
He tells her that Ben might not know about
her seeing a doctor.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.750
Then, he tells her to go look for a shoebox
in the back of her closet.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.580
Christine opens the box and finds a camera
inside.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.330
Nasch tells her to switch it on.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.299
A recording of her plays, where she talks
about the problem with her memory.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.659
Two weeks earlier, Christine is in a car with
Dr. Nasch, who admits that their professional

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.860
relationship is a little bit out of the ordinary
- with him picking her up from home and seeing

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.659
her without her husbands knowledge.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.729
Christine is scared and confused.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.740
They drive into a parking lot and he tells
her how he found her 6 months before.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.540
He explains that he's a neuropsychologist
and that he's preparing a paper on the type

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.310
of amnesia she has, so he was willing to do
the work for free.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.960
As they start walking to his office, Doctor
Nasch tells her that even though she didn't

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.009
remember who he was when he called the next
day, she still agreed to work with him.

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.200
Christine has mentioned working with a psychologist
to her husband, but he was adamantly against

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.520
it because she had therapy in the past and
it had only upset her.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.680
In his office, he gives her the camera and
tells her to keep a visual diary.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.989
Doctor Nasch tells her that her injuries were
sustained in a vicious attack 10 years before.

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.170
They came from repeated blows to the head.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.980
She's confused because Ben had told her another
story.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.620
The doctor shows her news articles about the
attack and she wonders why someone would try

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.720
to kill her.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.500
He explains that no one really knows part
from her.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.620
As they leave, he tells her not to tell Ben
about the camera so she doesn't feel constrained

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.540
to share her thoughts and feelings.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.200
He tells her where to hide it and that he'll
call her in the morning to remind her.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.590
She agrees to the plan.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.820
That night, while Ben prepares cocoa for them,
Christine goes to the bathroom to record the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.010
first entry in her video diary.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.840
She explains about her memory and when she
hears Ben coming up, she scrambles to hide

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.250
the camera and goes to bed, pretending she's
already asleep.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.700
Christine wakes up the next morning next to
Ben.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.560
He pretends that he's still asleep.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.510
They have the same conversation about her
memory, their life and her life.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.599
She doesn't understand what she does all day
and looks disappointed.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.459
Later, she's in the car with the doctor again,
watching the video.

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.849
Christine says that without the recordings
she would believe everything that Ben tells

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.530
her, like the car accident.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.099
She wonders what else he lies to her about.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.069
Doctor Nasch says that he can't risk calling
her on the house phone.

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.440
Christine tells him that she doesn't want
to be afraid all the time and asks if the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.830
treatment he's planning for her will work.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.599
Doctor Nasch explains that in rare cases,
going back to the scene of the attack helps

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.920
kick off the memory, but his reason behind
going there is building trust with her.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.280
When they arrive at the industrial complex
they meet with the caretaker.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.740
He takes them to the place where he found
her and tells them that she was naked, with

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.100
only a bed sheet around her and that she was
covered in blood.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.220
She couldn't remember anything even then.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.730
Back in the car, she asks Nasch what she was
doing by the airport.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.290
He tells her that there are a lot of hotels
in the area and suggests that she might have

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.700
been having an affair.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.459
The medical report indicated recent intercourse.

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.140
She asks him if she was raped, but the doctor
tells her that the report has suggested otherwise.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.690
Christine can't believe she could be a cheater.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.320
Later, she's in her bathroom saying that she
needs to remember what happened, no matter

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.890
what she has done.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.370
She hears the sounds of children playing and
goes to check, but there's no one outside.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.920
That night, she walks in to take a shower,
when Ben joins her and begins kissing her.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.279
As they begin making love, she has a memory
of someone with a scar on his jaw.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:24.770
They fall asleep together and Christine has
a dream about a hotel room and her attack.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.689
The next day, tests are being performed on
Christine by doctor Nasch.

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:31.349
He shows her pictures that she needs to identify.

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.590
She looks at the pictures and gets upset so
she rings the panic button in the MRI.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.879
Later, they talk in a waiting room and he
tells her that some of the pictures were random

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.629
and others were in her file.

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:45.110
The photo he shows her had produced a distinct
reaction in her brain.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.819
Christine doesnâ€™t know who the woman in
the photo is, even with the name Claire written

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:49.819
on it.

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:53.259
While having dinner with Ben that night, she
asks him if about Claire.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.059
Ben says that he doesn't know her, then asks
why Christine is brining it up.

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:01.289
When she tells him that she had a memory,
he gets invested in the amount she remembers.

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.009
She mentions a few things, mostly from the
photo, and he tells her that it wasn't the

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.210
first time she had remembered Claire.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.770
Ben says that they were friends once, but
that she moved away and that it doesn't matter

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:11.770
anymore.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.699
Christine insists that it does matter.

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.580
Ben brings a box of photos he keeps in his
study.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.020
They are of her and Claire.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.569
She asks why he hides them from her and Ben
explains that he does that to protect her

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:24.460
from the fact that her friend couldn't handle
her situation.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.309
Christine asks him how she could trust him
if he hides things from her, but Ben tells

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:30.699
her that he can't always handle dealing with
everything.

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.529
Later, she makes a new recording saying that
Ben is hiding Claire from her and that she

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:35.860
can't trust him.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.830
After that, he sees that she has taped the
photos of Claire in the bathroom.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.620
Doctor Nasch calls Christine and explains
everything to her all over again.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.050
She watches the recording from the previous
day, the one saying not to trust Ben.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.669
Then she zooms in, seeing that the photos
that were there the previous day are gone

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:52.669
now.

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.259
She gets angry and starts looking through
Ben's study to find something.

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:58.880
She finds a key which takes her to the photos.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.029
Flipping through them she has a memory about
Claire and her telling her that she's pregnant.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:06.729
She rushes to check the pictures in the bathroom
and the pictures in the albums, but there

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.229
is no evidence of a child she might have had.

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.229
Christine checks her stomach and sees her
stretch marks, the remembers a conversation

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:14.560
with her son.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.719
She calls Ben to ask about their child and
he comes home instantly.

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:20.680
Christine is upset and wants to know where
their child is.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.300
Ben embraces her and tells her that their
son died.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.919
Once inside, he tells her that the child died
from meningitis before his ninth birthday.

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.300
He gets another box that he's hiding from
her so that she doesn't stumble upon them

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.879
by herself and shows her a photo of their
son Adam as a baby.

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:39.110
Christine cries, but she doesn't remember
him as she goes through the photos.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.449
She sees his birth certificate and a note
in his handwriting.

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.240
Ben takes back the photos and later Christine
makes another video in which she says that

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.400
while the grief might not be new for Ben,
it is for her.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.259
And it will be new every other day for the
rest of her life.

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:56.189
Christine has another nightmare about the
man with the scar and her attack.

00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:00.159
She wakes up terrified, then watches her recordings
about Adam and cries.

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:03.710
Christine begins taking apart the wall of
photos in the bathroom.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.379
When she talks to Nasch again she asks if
he knew about her son and he tells her that

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:09.429
they have spoken about him before.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:13.240
She has begun thinking that maybe it's better
if she doesn't learn about everything.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.110
Christine asks the doctor if they can just
sit there for a while, then asks if she should

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.849
tell Ben about the therapy.

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:21.289
That night, her and Ben talk about Adam again.

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:24.249
She asks if she was a good mother before the
accident.

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:27.959
Ben says that she loved him very much and
she has a memory about him for a moment.

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:31.849
Christine says that she understands how difficult
it must be for Ben to go though all of it

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:35.379
over and over, but tells him not to hide her
son from her again.

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:36.940
He apologizes to her.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.240
That night Christine has another nightmare.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.569
She's in a hotel and she can see her son there.

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:45.089
She finds a note that has the name Mike on
it and then remembers the man with the scar

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:46.089
again.

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:48.339
Lastly, she remembers parts of the attack.

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:50.699
Christine awakens and forgets everything again.

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:53.569
Christine is in the car with Doctor Nasch
going somewhere.

00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:57.279
When they stop she tells him the name Mike,
saying that he's the man that hurt her.

00:07:57.279 --> 00:08:01.199
The doctor comforts her and leans in to kiss
her when she sees that his name is Mike.

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:05.189
She remembers him as striking her in the hotel
room so she runs from the car.

00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:09.090
He gets a syringe from his trunk and runs
after her on the long pier, eventually catching

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.090
up to her.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.619
Later, Christine is on her couch, when her
phone rings.

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:17.219
She answers the call from Doctor Nasch and
he explains that he gave her a sedative to

00:08:17.219 --> 00:08:19.430
calm her, not put her to sleep.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.550
She remembers.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.649
He tells her that she was confused and suffering
from fabulation about him, placing all her

00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:26.259
fears and suspicions on him.

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:30.080
Before he hangs up, he says that he had found
out something about Ben that he will have

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.060
to explain to her in person.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.520
Ben arrives at the house and they have dinner
together.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.949
He asks her who she was talking to on the
phone when he tried to call her and she lies

00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:39.700
saying she was calling him.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.149
The next day, Christine is listening to Dr.
Nasch explain how vulnerable patients like

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:47.009
her can develop feelings for their psychiatrists.

00:08:47.009 --> 00:08:50.850
What is less common is for the psychiatrists
to develop feelings for their patients.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.740
He says that's unprofessional.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.019
She thinks that he's her only hope and that
they're making progress, when he tells her

00:08:56.019 --> 00:08:58.000
that he will refer her to a colleague.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.129
Doctor Nasch thinks that treating her further
would be unethical.

00:09:01.129 --> 00:09:04.959
But he thinks that her progress is noticeable
because she had remembered to watch the recording

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:07.089
even before he had called her that morning.

00:09:07.089 --> 00:09:10.920
Next, he tells her that he found out that
Ben had her transferred from an asylum to

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.220
a nursing home.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.879
The doctor managed to talk to the administrator
who told him that her friend Claire had been

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:17.529
trying to get in touch with her.

00:09:17.529 --> 00:09:19.019
He gives her Clair's number.

00:09:19.019 --> 00:09:22.980
The administrator also told Nasch that Ben
had divorced her 4 years prior.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.870
Later, Christine calls Claire and leaves her
a message saying that she really needs to

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:27.959
talk to her.

00:09:27.959 --> 00:09:29.790
She goes to see Ben at his work.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:34.079
When she asks if they're divorced, he gets
angry, but she pushes for the truth.

00:09:34.079 --> 00:09:36.810
Ben tells her that it's because of the death
of their son.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.800
First he walked away from her, but he had
come back and he will never leave her again.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.350
That same day, Claire calls Christine back.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.980
She remembers bits and pieces about her, as
Claire tells her that she had kept ringing

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.399
the nursing home where Christine was placed.

00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:51.720
She tells her that she misses her and want
to see her.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.440
They arrange a meeting at an observatory in
an hour.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.319
Christine goes to see Claire and waits for
her on a bench.

00:09:57.319 --> 00:10:00.070
When, Claire shows up, Christine remembers
her.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.790
They've missed each other very much.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.000
Christine asks Claire if she was a good mother
and she replies that she was great.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.699
Ben was also a good father.

00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:09.689
She asks her friend who did that to her.

00:10:09.689 --> 00:10:13.449
They grab a drink and Claire tells her that
she was probably having an affair.

00:10:13.449 --> 00:10:17.709
She confessed it to her eventually, but never
gave her any details about the man.

00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:21.579
Claire apologizes to her for telling Ben,
but she had to do it since she had already

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:22.720
told the police.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.810
Christine thinks that that's the reason why
Ben never talks to her about anything, including

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:27.810
her.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.860
Claire tells her that after her accident she
tried to help Ben out and the two of them

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.279
spent a lot of time together, eventually sleeping
together.

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:37.080
She decided to stay away from them because
of that.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.770
Before Christine leaves, she gives her a note
that Ben left for her with Claire if she was

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.970
ever good enough to read and understand it.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.310
The letter explains the reasons why he left
her.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:49.110
In it Ben says that the main reason was the
happiness and wellbeing of their son, who

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.480
couldn't bare seeing her like that anymore.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.550
Christine finishes the letter as Ben arrives
at the house.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.650
She records a video in which she is talking
to Ben, telling him that by the time he sees

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:03.269
the video he will know everything, including
that the only thing she feels for him is love.

00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:07.890
Later, Christine shows Ben the video she recorded
for him and starts telling him about everything

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.330
that has been happening in the previous weeks.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.029
She tells him about Doctor Nasch and he's
angry that she kept that from him.

00:11:14.029 --> 00:11:17.500
When she tells him that she forgives him and
that she loves him, he hits her.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.649
Christine calls Claire and tells her what
has happened with Ben.

00:11:20.649 --> 00:11:23.269
She says that she'll call him and call Christine
right back.

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:27.079
In the meantime, she records a video in which
she says that he hit her.

00:11:27.079 --> 00:11:30.370
Claire calls her back and tells her that Ben
has been living alone and hasn't seen her

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.880
in 4 years.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.930
She asks her to describe Ben to her.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.839
Their descriptions don't match.

00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:40.199
Claire tells her that Ben has a scar on the
side of his face and Christine has a flashback.

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:43.760
The Ben she knows comes back and she runs
to the bathroom to check the photos if he

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.110
has a scar.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.390
When she doesn't see one, Claire tells her
that the man she's living with is not Ben.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.459
Suddenly, Christine notices that all of the
photographs on the wall are doctored.

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:57.249
She begins to remember the attack and begs
Claire to help her, but she can't remember

00:11:57.249 --> 00:11:58.249
her address.

00:11:58.249 --> 00:12:01.470
Clare tells her to finds out, as Ben tries
to come inside.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.649
She has another flashback to the attack, then
opens the door.

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:05.649
Ben isn't there.

00:12:05.649 --> 00:12:09.209
Christine walks down the stairs and tries
to walk out of the main entrance, only to

00:12:09.209 --> 00:12:10.410
find it locked.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.700
She finds the key to the back door and exits
the house, when Ben suddenly grabs her.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.760
Christine wakes up the following morning in
her bed with Ben.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.519
She walks inside the bathroom and sees the
photos, then walks out to find him sitting

00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:23.550
on the bed telling her who he is.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.089
When he leaves, the doctor calls her and tells
her to find the camera.

00:12:27.089 --> 00:12:30.620
She only sees the recording where she says
that she loves Ben.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.660
After that she notices the bruise on her cheek.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:36.829
The phone rings and it's Ben this time, asking
if everything is ok.

00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:39.720
He has her cell phone which Claire is trying
to reach.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.199
Ben reminds her to pack for their anniversary.

00:12:42.199 --> 00:12:43.910
She tells him that she loves him.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:48.660
Later, Nasch is trying to phone Christine,
when he gets called to the main reception.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.209
Ben runs into him and introduces himself.

00:12:51.209 --> 00:12:55.199
Nasch asks how Christine is and Ben tells
him to stay away from her.

00:12:55.199 --> 00:12:59.490
That night, Ben and Christine take a drive
down to a hotel near the airport.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.889
She asks if it's really their anniversary
and he tells her that it's not their wedding

00:13:02.889 --> 00:13:05.389
anniversary, but one of a different kind.

00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:08.240
Christine doesn't understand why he brought
her there.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.570
He gives her a glass of champagne and tells
her that he wants her to remember her attack.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.279
Suddenly, she remembers that he is actually
Mike.

00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:19.680
Christine asks where Ben is and Mike tells
her that her husband left her, when he stayed.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.420
He took her out of the nursing home with fake
documents, with the intention to take care

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.420
of her.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.130
But now he's tired of lying and wants her
to remember everything.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.940
Christine remembers the day of the attack
and him threatening her that he'll call her

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.529
husband, then hitting her.

00:13:32.529 --> 00:13:34.740
She realizes that he was the one that attacked
her.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.210
He tells her that he hates himself for what
happened and begs her not to leave.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:42.510
Christine is scared because she remembers
details about the night when he attacked her.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:46.449
Mike keeps begging her not to leave, but then
steps aside to see if she will and when she

00:13:46.449 --> 00:13:47.980
does he hits her again.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.370
He tells her that they will either leave together
or they won't leave at all.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:56.259
Then, he begins to delete all of her recordings
from the camera and tells her that she's free.

00:13:56.259 --> 00:13:59.070
Mike tells her to kiss him and she does it
out of fear.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:02.600
He tells her that she has to forget Ben and
Adam because they have forgotten her.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.760
Christine realizes that Adam isn't dead and
he starts beating her up again.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.069
She fights back, but he overpowers her and
begins to strangle her.

00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:14.360
Christine stabs him and tries to escape, though
he just grabs her again.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:18.149
Eventually she incapacitates him and escapes
the room, then activates the fire alarm.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:21.230
Ambulances and the police have circled the
hotel.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.380
Christine is at the back of an ambulance,
recording a new video explaining what happened

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.380
to her.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:31.100
Later, Dr. Nasch walks into her hospital room
and wakes her up telling her who he is.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.339
He tells her that he is there as her friend
and not her doctor.

00:14:34.339 --> 00:14:37.339
Because she needs someone to take care of
her, Claire will pick her up and take her

00:14:37.339 --> 00:14:38.339
home with her.

00:14:38.339 --> 00:14:40.220
He asks her if she remembers Clair.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.050
Christine says that she does.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.930
Nasch continues talking to her, saying that
Mike will be in prison for a long time for

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.029
what he did to her.

00:14:47.029 --> 00:14:50.499
Then, he tells her that he has a visitor for
her that might become the breakthrough in

00:14:50.499 --> 00:14:51.499
her treatment.

00:14:51.499 --> 00:14:55.110
Nasch turns around and Ben, her real ex-husband
is at he door.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.920
Doctor Nasch lets him inside the room.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.290
He approaches her and tells her that he's
her Ben, that he never would have stayed away

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.040
if he knew she was in danger.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.190
He sits down and tells her about Adam.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.490
Ben says that both of them love her very much.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.839
He goes out to get Adam.

00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:10.050
The boy walks in and approaches his mother.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:13.680
He introduces himself to her and she starts
remembering something that she used to say

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.050
to him when he was little.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.850
Christine remembers him finally.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:22.970
They embrace as she says that he's her Adam.
