00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
she also seems to be hiding out of view
 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.030 align:start position:0%
she also seems to be hiding out of view

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
and as we've mentioned
 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.830 align:start position:0%
and as we've mentioned
she's<00:03:09.440><c> actually</c><00:03:09.920><c> a</c><00:03:10.080><c> big</c><00:03:10.319><c> ally</c><00:03:10.800><c> of</c><00:03:10.879><c> the</c><00:03:11.040><c> rebels</c>

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
she's actually a big ally of the rebels
 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.229 align:start position:0%
she's actually a big ally of the rebels
so

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.229 align:start position:0%
so
this<00:03:12.480><c> doesn't</c><00:03:12.720><c> make</c><00:03:12.959><c> much</c><00:03:13.280><c> sense</c><00:03:13.920><c> at</c><00:03:14.080><c> this</c>

this doesn't make much sense at this
 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.910 align:start position:0%
this doesn't make much sense at this

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
point in the saga the rebels were
 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.670 align:start position:0%
point in the saga the rebels were

actually at the height of their power
 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.309 align:start position:0%
actually at the height of their power
so<00:03:17.920><c> her</c><00:03:18.239><c> hiding</c><00:03:18.560><c> away</c><00:03:18.879><c> suspiciously</c><00:03:19.840><c> seems</c><00:03:20.159><c> to</c>

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
so her hiding away suspiciously seems to
 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.670 align:start position:0%
