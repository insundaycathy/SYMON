Hello, everybody. Welcome to my channel. Please

rate is just zero point two percent. Today
I am going to explain an interesting British

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:16.299
horror film called "The Power". To understand
this film, first we need to know the background

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.600
of British society in the year 1974. As this
film is set in that year. In that year an

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.869
agitation was going on between coal miners
and the British Empire which was reduced to

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.800
a union called the united kingdom. The situation
was so severe that the government started

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.180
power cuts after sundown. The entire London
city was under a pitch-black darkness, people

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.270
were forced to use candles and lamps at night.
It was that era where women used to work mainly

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.070
in nursing and teaching fields. The opportunities
for women in other fields were not much. The

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.579
society was male dominant. This film’s story
is about one such nurse, Valerie, who has

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.969
shortened her name to Val.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.629
The film starts with a nurse named Val who
was suffering from a trauma. She had a condition

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.860
called Nyctophobia, meaning the fear of darkness.
She was afraid of the darkness, a childhood

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.030
trauma caused her condition. In darkness she
used to breathe heavily, her BP used to rise,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.140
and she used to sweat a lot. That’s why
she always worked in the day light.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.740
We see Val joining the east London hospital
one morning. The blackouts in the city were

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.410
supposed to start starting from today. Hospital
staff were preparing for that. Val meets with

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.640
a matron nurse and joins the hospital. Matron
was a strict lady. She dictates all the rules

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.750
like, following all the orders from doctors,
no chit-chat, no makeup, no short skirts etc.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.520
Here we also come to know that Val is an orphan,
she had no family. She grew up in our lady

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.280
of grace children home and was a devoted Catholic.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.800
Matron places Val in a gynecology ward. Some
time later Val found a Bangladeshi immigrant,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.990
Saba, in the nurse’s washroom. She brought
her to the second floor where she was the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.040
patient of Dr Franklyn. Saba was suffering
from liver-related issues. Saba too had no

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.619
family as she came from a refuge camp. After
the 1971 Bangladesh genocide, many refugees

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.739
arrived in England for refuge. They were stuffed
in a make-shift camp.

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.959
Dr Franklyn was fed up with Saba as she was
not taking her medicine on time, she was roaming

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.620
around. Val talks nicely with her, she gives
her medicine. Later she does some medical

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.670
chit-chat with doctor Franklyn which impresses
him. Doctor Franklyn now requests the matron

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.920
to place Val on his ward. Matron agreed, but
she was not impressed, she stared at Val and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.400
said, I have been working here for many years,
I know the in and out of this hospital, following

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.530
the superior’s order blindly will only make
you safe and comfortable. Otherwise, the consequence

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.219
may be fatal. Matron punishes Val for her
disobedience by placing her at a night shift.

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:54.620
Val knew her condition, but she said nothing
as this could place her job at risk.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.650
The blackouts were happening in the evening,
hospital staff was sending patients, kids

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.900
to another hospital where power was there.
In this hospital only the ICU ward was getting

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.549
the power. Later, the kids from the children
ward were shifted too. We see Saba moving

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.150
as well. Val was cleaning the walls of this
ward as this was her punishment as well. I

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.829
guess at that time there was no concept of
ward boys, hence nurses might be doing the

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:25.159
cleaning job as well. I am not sure, but Val
was doing this job here. We see a poster outside

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.870
this ward which was for the reportage of any
sexual harassment at this hospital.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.540
Val was cleaning one vent which had a thick
black mold. It had a foul order. Right then

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.349
the door of the store room opened on its own,
and Val heard a cracking sound. When she entered

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.170
the room for checking, some unknown force
expelled her. Val was scared here and a little

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.049
bit confused too.

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.580
In the evening Val was getting ready for the
blackouts. Suddenly, the blackout happened

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.359
before due time. Only three other nurses were
working night shifts in this hospital. Val

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.099
was supposed to be on the forth floor, but
she ended up at the second floor’s maternity

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.810
ward. Two other nurses, Comfort and Terry,
were there. Here Terry was reading Stephen

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.210
King’s famous horror book Carrie. To me,
this nurse seemed like a daring one. Reading

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.519
a horror book in a dark, empty hospital at
night!

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:21.780
Anyway, Comfort takes Val to the third floor.
There a senior nurse, Barb, was working. Barb

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.460
was surprised seeing Val here as she knew
her from childhood. She too grew up in that

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.670
orphanage where Val grew up. Barb knew Val’s
history. Barb was totally different from Val,

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.620
she was bold, mean, ambitious and wanted to
settle in life by marrying a rich guy. She

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.570
chose nursing as working ladies used to get
good marriage proposals. It was sad but true.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.620
For ICU patients there was a generator at
the hospital which was providing the electricity.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.810
When Val and Barb were talking, this generator
broke down. The total darkness spreads everywhere.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.310
Barb grabs Val’s lamp to get emergence battery
backups. Val was alone in this darkness, and

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.130
she was scared like hell due to her condition.
She goes out to grab a candle, just then she

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.070
hears someone’s voice, someone was calling
her name in darkness. Someone grabs her from

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.700
behind, which makes her fall onto the ground.
Just then the power comes back where we see

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.980
Barb with security in-charge Neville. Neville
introduces himself to Val where Val understood

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:25.140
his loose character with his way of talking.
Now we see Neville harassing Barb sexually,

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.551
Barb was co-operating here. But by the looks
of her, it seemed she was in anguish. Later

00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:34.390
Barb explains to Val that it's all common
here, to move up on the ladder one has to

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.730
obey all the orders without thinking anything.
She warns Val about these things and asks

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.110
her to be strong from day one.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.540
After some time, Barb sends Val to the first
floor to collect a few files. Due to her condition,

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.910
Val was moving very slowly, Naville was locking
the doors to prevent criminals from looting

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.000
the hospital. Val visits Naville’s chamber
where lots of adult posters were hanging.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.250
Naville had a collection of nurse photos which
he called a treasure collection. Basically,

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.430
for favors the hospital’s doctors were indulging
in sexual harassment of nurses. Neville was

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.340
helping them. Val gets scared seeing all this,
she runs from Neville’s chamber.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:17.050
On her way back, some unknown force again
attacked Val. It's Stats to lift her skirt.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.430
Val was visibly in panic mode, she ran from
there in darkness and ended up in the basement.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.450
There she saw a dog doll from which lots of
noise was coming. As soon as she touches it,

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.390
something grabs her from behind, it forcefully
drags her out. In a few quick scenes we see

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.570
that Neville was burning in his chamber, someone
was notching Barb’s eyes. Later we see Val

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.720
at the maternity ward where she was in shock,
her hair was off, her clothes were dirty.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.340
Val had no memory of what happened to her
or who did that to her. Terry gives Val a

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.100
new set of clothes as she was looking horrific.
Just then these three heard some noise in

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.350
this ward as well, upon checking it was Saba.
She was supposed to move to the other hospital,

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.960
but for some strange reason she ended up here.
She angrily explained everything to Terry

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.790
and Comfort, but they understood nothing as
Saba was speaking in the Bangla language.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.850
The national language of Bangladesh. Here
Val gives a cookie to Saba and calms her down

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:17.020
again. She checks Saba’s sketch book where
she made some creepy drawings. Which makes

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.290
Val believe that she might be scared of something.
Suddenly, that unknown force possess Val,

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:27.900
it was agonizing her. She fell in front of
Terry and Comfort, Terry was spooked. After

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.580
a few minutes, Val became normal, but she
had no memory of what just happened to her.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.640
Terry thinks of this as a demonic possession,
she starts to flee this hospital through a

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.070
window. There was a pipe beside that window
through which she was planning to tickle down.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:46.710
Meaning this nurse was not daring after all.
I guess she was smart, by reading many horror

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:52.360
books she understood possession. Comfort tries
to stop her but fails. Somebody was needed

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.470
to look after the babies in this ward, so
she decided to continue her job. She has never

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:03.850
believed in possession anyway. She now asked
Val to go to her ward. As Val starts to leave,

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:08.090
she sees an image of a little girl in the
glass. This whole time this little girl’s

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:13.620
ghost was possessing her. Her name was Gail.
The hospital staff used to call her the dirty

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:20.210
Gail. Dirty Gail makes Val stab herself, Val’s
hand involuntarily stabs her with a scissor.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:25.580
Val starts to bleed heavily. Comfort rushes
in disbelief and stops her bleeding. She does

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:31.580
her bandage. Val was knocked out. Later Val
had a dream where dirty Gail was chasing her

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:37.789
and Saba. Val wakes up in shock. Saba was
beside her this whole time, she gave her Gail’s

00:08:37.789 --> 00:09:15.050
photo and said in broken English: she is forcing
me to do things.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:19.240
Now Gail directly says to Comfort, you never
listened to me, I tried many times, but you

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.600
never listened to me. Comfort was horrified
as she was witnessing the possession for the

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.519
first time. She tries to insert another round
of sedative into Val’s body, but Gail who

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:33.300
was possessing Val stops her. She attacks
Comfort and inserts that injection back on

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:38.749
her. Comfort stops it at the midway. In a
hurry she grabbed Saba’s hand and ran toward

00:09:38.749 --> 00:09:44.440
that window. Saba refuses to trickle down
as it was deep for her. Comfort goes ahead

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.399
any way, but by this time the sedative has
started its work. While on the pipe, Comfort

00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:52.170
loses her balance, she falls down.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.930
In the maternity ward Gail was now haunting
Barb as she knew everything but still did

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:00.770
nothing. Barb here accepts her mistake, she
promises to tell everything to everyone, but

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:06.000
Gail was in no mood to listen to anything.
She attacks her and kills her.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.709
After some time Val came out of the possession,
she had no memory of what happened. She asks

00:10:10.709 --> 00:10:16.589
Saba to go away from her. She starts to move
out from this hospital. On her way out, she

00:10:16.589 --> 00:10:21.259
sees Barb’s dead body and then Naville’s
burned body. Here she gets a few visions where

00:10:21.259 --> 00:10:26.019
Naville was doing sexual assault on Gail.
Later he killed her and placed her body with

00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:31.830
her dog doll into the furnace. Barb saw it,
but she didn’t say anything to anyone. Sexual

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:36.499
harassment was common at this hospital, and
everyone knew it, everyone did it.

00:10:36.499 --> 00:10:41.231
Next morning Val wakes up at one bed where
Saba arrives there with an interpreter. This

00:10:41.231 --> 00:10:45.470
guy was a trainee doctor who was from the
Indian state of West Bengal, he could speak

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:51.559
Hindi, Bangla and English. Bangla was also
the state language of west Bengal. Saba says

00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:56.620
Gail is not bad, she is like us, she hid me
till morning. Saba was telling some nasty

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:01.420
stuff about the doctors here which this Indian
guy angrily stopped her. He scolds her in

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:06.879
Hindi and drags her from there without translating
anything. Next hospital’s CEO, department

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:11.920
head, Dr Franklyn, and matron check on Val.
They knew about Val’s ghost theory through

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:17.149
Comfort. Val says Gail took revenge on Neville
as he killed her, and Barb knew it as well,

00:11:17.149 --> 00:11:21.819
so she too paid the price. The department
head dismisses this accusation and quotes

00:11:21.819 --> 00:11:52.600
one incident from Val’s childhood.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.600
After some time we see Val getting possessed
again, this time Gail draws the picture of

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:02.709
Dr Franklyn. Val was shocked, she rushed from
her bed to find Saba. She found her with Dr

00:12:02.709 --> 00:12:07.930
Franklyn who was taking her to the other hospital.
Dr Franklyn was annoyed to see Val there,

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:13.310
and he started to walk to her room with her.
Val signals Saba to run from here. On their

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:18.420
way, Val asks Dr Franklyn if he also goes
to the basement. Dr Franklyn takes this as

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:23.149
a signal, and he drags Val to the basement.
He had an alternate key to the basement as

00:12:23.149 --> 00:12:26.360
many doctors here had that. Neville was the
middle man.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.360
During Val’s childhood, her headmaster sexually
assaulted her at Our Ladies children's home.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.360
Val told this to everyone, but nobody believed
her. The nurses, teachers and police silenced

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.360
her voice. They even accused Val of lying
for attention. Now Val here sticks to her

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.360
theory. She says Gail was real. Hospital CEO
categorically denies having any child by the

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.360
name Gail, which makes the matron uncomfortable.
As she knew about Gail.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.490
After arriving at the basement, Val starts
calling Gail. Dr Franklyn laughs at it and

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:37.210
says, here The Power lies with us, we can
do anything we want. We can do whatever we

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:42.089
please. He was talking about men at large,
men were controlling everything at that hospital

00:12:42.089 --> 00:12:47.680
and the society at large. He was not afraid
of anything. He starts to forcefully assault

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:53.040
Val. Just then Saba arrives there, which makes
him angry. Gail was possessing her, now she

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.819
possesses Val and starts to attack Dr Franklyn.
She emits powerful lights from Val’s body,

00:12:58.819 --> 00:13:02.990
which ultimately kills him. How a child's
ghost can do this, I don’t know, but she

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:07.709
did it. This is a ghost movie, so anything
is possible. L O L.

00:13:07.709 --> 00:13:13.709
Later, Val, Saba and Gail leave this hospital
where the matron helps them. She appreciates

00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:18.720
Val’s courage of speaking the truth, which
she lacked. Hospital’s CEO gets a call from

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.619
Gail where she warns him of more killings
if he does not change the culture. She makes

00:13:23.619 --> 00:13:25.240
him responsible.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.769
This is a powerful film on a sensitive topic
like woman harassment. The seventies were

00:13:29.769 --> 00:13:34.459
the time when the woman rights movement was
picking its pace. Till then, the patriarchy

00:13:34.459 --> 00:13:40.459
saw women as a property. The power was with
them. Due to the heroic efforts of some woman,

00:13:40.459 --> 00:13:46.040
there is some sort of gender equality in the
21st century. But it is not complete. In the

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:51.410
film Gail was not haunting Saba, rather she
was saving her. Saba and Val were victims,

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:56.360
hence Gail was able to possess them as she
was too. Saba tried to explain this fact to

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:01.399
Val, but the Indian guy stopped her.
Talking about one big mistake, Stephan King’s

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:08.480
horror book Carrie was released on April 5,
1974. This film took place in January 1974,

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:13.110
way before the book got released. Even though
the book was about woman power, but this type

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:19.430
of homage is logically wrong. I guess its
not a big deal. Any way, I enjoyed this film.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:25.639
