00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.600
today i'm going to explain a science&nbsp;
fiction film called downsizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.640
spoilers ahead watch out and take care

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.080
the movie begins in edvardson institute&nbsp;
norway a group of scientists are researching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.760
a procedure of some sort we see dr jurgen and&nbsp;
his colleague andreas excitedly talk about an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.600
experiment that has been successful the two&nbsp;
hugging excitement cut to five years later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.800
andreas is presenting their study to an auditorium&nbsp;
full of people in a convention center in italy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.360
he has a box with himself that he carefully&nbsp;
sits on the podium he then gives the audience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.320
a speech about the negative effects of global&nbsp;
warming and scarcity of food and water it causes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.880
he goes on to explain that their project will&nbsp;
not just reduce global warming but also solve the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.480
problem of scarcity of natural supplies he says&nbsp;
that this is the only practical and humane remedy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.400
to mankind's gravest problem he then proceeds to&nbsp;
reveal what is inside the box the audience gasps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.080
when they see a tiny dr jurgen in the box he looks&nbsp;
like any normal human being but smaller in size&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.080
no one can believe their eyes they stand up&nbsp;
to get a better view of dr jurgen dr jurgen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.280
asks everyone to take a seat a tiny microphone&nbsp;
stands in front of him and he starts speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.160
he says that five years ago he and his team&nbsp;
developed a procedure that reduces all organic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.080
material to cellular level by a ratio of seven&nbsp;
hundred forty four to one using this process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.840
dr jurgen had turned minuscule the procedure was&nbsp;
tested on a large number of plants and animals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.840
and they have found out that the procedure is&nbsp;
irreversible but has no side effects at all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.200
thirty-six volunteers joined dr jurgens team and&nbsp;
they have been living life as a small person ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.880
since the procedure only requires the removal&nbsp;
of dental and other prosthetics the person fully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.320
recovers after an hour or two after being turned&nbsp;
small they then bring out the 36 volunteers of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.040
the project who are now small people they have&nbsp;
lived in the world's first small colony for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.560
the past four years they have also birthed a&nbsp;
little baby the audience clapped in admiration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.640
this is the biggest discovery in history the&nbsp;
concept of downsizing is now introduced people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.200
from around the world watch the television in&nbsp;
shock as they broadcast attractive advertisements&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.160
about the discovery they encourage everyone to go&nbsp;
minuscule to save the planet and for a better life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.640
paul saffernick is one of the viewers&nbsp;
he watches the advertisement in awe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.160
he goes home to his sick mother she is the only&nbsp;
person in paul's life she complains about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.800
downsizing program saying that the same energy&nbsp;
must be put into finding the cure for illness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.880
it is now 10 years later paul's mother has long&nbsp;
passed on paul now works as an occupational&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.160
therapist and is married to his wife audrey&nbsp;
safranick the couple is struggling financially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.320
the two have to relocate to a new home&nbsp;
because of their financial problems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.560
meanwhile the downsizing program has become&nbsp;
more and more popular through the years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.000
several minuscule colonies have been&nbsp;
established throughout the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.480
three percent of the world has gone through&nbsp;
downsizing and currently lives in those colonies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.880
one day the safranex go to their high school&nbsp;
reunion there they meet their old friends dave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.920
and carol johnson who have downsized after the&nbsp;
reunion they gather at a friend's house where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.000
the johnsons boast about it being the best&nbsp;
decision they have ever made in their life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.960
they now live in a minuscule colony in new&nbsp;
mexico called the leisureland when paul praises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.840
dave for doing so much for the environment dave&nbsp;
reveals that he only did it for the money after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.240
downsizing expenses dropped by 90 dave used to&nbsp;
be broke in vegas before they decided to downsize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.360
now the two are going on a six-month trip to&nbsp;
italy and living their best life in a huge mansion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.800
interested in the miniature life the following&nbsp;
day paul and audrey go to a leisureland convention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.600
there a downsized man explains to&nbsp;
them the benefits of being downsized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.920
he shows them the house of his dreams right&nbsp;
in front of him the miniature house opens to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.880
reveal a luxurious interior a woman is inside&nbsp;
the house who boasts about her diamond jewelry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.120
that cost her only 83 dollars paul and audrey are&nbsp;
fascinated by the luxurious life of the miniatures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.920
they then go to a viewing area where they look&nbsp;
over the leisureland the colony is covered with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.520
nets to keep away mosquitoes and harmful uv rays&nbsp;
the couple watch in awe and decide that they too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.680
will downsize they meet an agent who tells them&nbsp;
that in leisureland their 152 thousand dollars is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.440
12 million dollars to live on paul and audrey are&nbsp;
stunned later we see them selling their belongings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.320
in a yard sale so that they can sell everything&nbsp;
and live as miniatures later that day they meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.280
at a pub where their friends and family wish them&nbsp;
goodbye later that night the two keep their rings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.560
in a box to be brought to their miniature house&nbsp;
when they relocate the following day they drive to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.920
the leisureland convention where they will undergo&nbsp;
downsizing however audrey seems to be doubtful of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.240
the decision the two are separated in the waiting&nbsp;
room paul is taken for the procedure before audrey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.880
they are told that they will meet after the&nbsp;
procedure when they are already downsized at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.160
the beginning of the procedure they shave paul's&nbsp;
head and eyebrows off as those cannot be downsized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.800
then they change him into hospital gowns and&nbsp;
sedate him to trim all the hair on his body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.000
they do the same to several other men beside paul&nbsp;
since downsizing cannot be performed with dental&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.640
prosthetics they perform a dental surgery&nbsp;
on everyone and remove the prosthetic teeth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.280
they are then taken to the incubation hall where&nbsp;
the downsizers are kept naked the doors to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.480
hall close after some time it opens and&nbsp;
we see everyone inside has been downsized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.160
now they are scooped up gently with a spatula&nbsp;
and put into miniature beds then they are handed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.040
down to small nurses from the leisureland their&nbsp;
dental prosthetics are put back into their cavity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.120
finally the procedure is done and the newly&nbsp;
downsized people are sent to rest when paul wakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.960
up he is alone in the waiting room a nurse greets&nbsp;
him she also gives him a huge cracker as a gift&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.760
he asks for audrey's whereabouts so the&nbsp;
nurse goes to look for her she comes in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.960
with a phone sometime later audrey speaks from&nbsp;
the other end she frantically tells paul that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.840
they shaved her head and eyebrows then we see a&nbsp;
bald audrey with only one eyebrow at the airport&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.280
paul is shocked as it turns out that audrey ran&nbsp;
away as they started shaving her eyebrows she has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.800
decided to not downsize at the very last moment&nbsp;
the two yell at each other through the phone paul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.920
is now alone in the new city of miniatures he is&nbsp;
guided to his luxury mansion but he now has to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:28.320
live there alone it is now a year later paul has&nbsp;
divorced audrey and settled into a new apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.200
he had anticipated an easy life but the&nbsp;
divorce settlement took away half of his assets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.840
he currently works in a call center and is&nbsp;
dating a girl named kristen one night they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.560
are in paul's room having dinner when paul's&nbsp;
upstairs neighbor doosan comes in to inform him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.160
that he is holding a party later kristen and paul&nbsp;
break up prompting him to attend doosan's party&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.680
paul has the time of his life he kisses&nbsp;
a random girl and accepts a pill from her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.520
the drug starts to take paul over&nbsp;
and he enjoys himself the whole night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.720
the following morning he wakes up under a table&nbsp;
at dooson's apartment the cleaning workers arrive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.440
one of the workers who limps catches paul's&nbsp;
eyes since he is an occupational therapist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.200
he asks her to sit down and helps her with her&nbsp;
prosthetic legs paul recognizes the worker is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.920
not glenn tran a vietnamese political activist&nbsp;
who was jailed and downsized against her will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.480
not land story was broadcasted worldwide then&nbsp;
but eventually it died down knockland takes paul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.960
to her neighborhood to check on people there even&nbsp;
though he is a physical therapist and not a doctor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.760
paul sees that the place she lives is in&nbsp;
extreme poverty even though they are miniatures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.400
there paul helps knock lane with her&nbsp;
prosthetic leg but accidentally breaks it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.360
as a result of his screw-up knock lan makes him&nbsp;
do her cleaning job until her new prosthetic legs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.760
arrive paul goes to work with knock lin&nbsp;
every day and does the cleaning for her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.840
they collect the leftover food from the people&nbsp;
they work for and bring it back to knock lands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.880
community to distribute it between the poors&nbsp;
paul sees the good in knocklan even though she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.480
suffering herself she doesn't forget to help other&nbsp;
people in her community one day knock lan gets a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:08.240
cleaning job at doosan's doosan is surprised to&nbsp;
see paul working as a cleaner and makes fun of him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.800
paul informs him that he has to do this for&nbsp;
next six weeks to a month seeing his friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:18.320
suffer duesson decides to help him he offers paul&nbsp;
a chance to get away by joining him and his friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:24.880
yours conrad and going to norway where the first&nbsp;
small community was created however noclan insists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.080
that she wants to go to because she was called&nbsp;
by the doctor who started this all dr jurgen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.000
the doctor too lives in the same colony and&nbsp;
wanted to meet knock land because of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.840
heroic protests in vietnam the boys almost do not&nbsp;
believe her but they eventually leave for norway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.760
cut to a few days later all of them are traveling&nbsp;
in a fjord in dussensyart they suddenly encounter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.440
dr jurgen and his wife in their own yacht going to&nbsp;
the colony as well naklan finally meets dr jurgen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:57.040
who apologizes to her because his procedure was&nbsp;
used wrongfully on her there the group is informed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.920
about the methane release in antarctica that&nbsp;
will increase global warming by a vast percentage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.640
this cannot be stopped and because of mass&nbsp;
overpopulation the human race will eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:12.240
become extinct in 100 years the downsizing was&nbsp;
made to reduce the possibility to some extent but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.600
only three percent of the whole world is downsized&nbsp;
dr jurgen is devastated that his creation was too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:24.000
late to save the world the damage is irreversible&nbsp;
later knock lan and paul are together in her cabin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.800
paul checks her legs one thing leads&nbsp;
to another and they end up having sex&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.640
the following morning they finally reach the&nbsp;
first colony it is a tiny village where people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.160
live in harmony they are welcomed wholeheartedly&nbsp;
there the villagers have created a large vault&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.800
inside a mountain to insulate the colony and&nbsp;
preserve humanity in the event of an extinction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.960
the whole village along with dr jurgen and&nbsp;
his wife planned to go inside the vault the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:54.960
following day inspired by dr jurgen's words halto&nbsp;
wants to go with the colony he feels as though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.800
he was brought there for a reason so when knock&nbsp;
asks him to come back with her he denies doosan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:06.240
and yours too are returning back to their home&nbsp;
it is now the following day a few hours before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:11.360
everyone migrates to the vault knock asked paul&nbsp;
if he had sex with her because he pities her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.920
paul replies that he really cares about her&nbsp;
but the wolf gives his life a purpose the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.960
time finally comes paul says his farewell and goes&nbsp;
into the vault while the other three stand outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:27.280
however paul changes his mind midway he likes not&nbsp;
too much to leave for the vault he comes back and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:33.680
hugs her soon a vault's door closes forever the&nbsp;
four of them return to leisureland back there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.920
noc and paul live their lives together while&nbsp;
helping the people of knox community living in&nbsp;&nbsp;
