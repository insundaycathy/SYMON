00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.560
In a windowless cell, a woman looks up&nbsp;
the vent and whistles. Shortly after that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.600
a stream of marbles flee out. They build up&nbsp;
a pyramid outside the cell and blast it open.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.000
The woman seems to pleased with the result.&nbsp;
She then breaks out from the prison.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.640
What happens next? This is Movie Shortens. Follow&nbsp;
us through a movie titled: Aeon Flux. Be aware:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.600
There are spoilers. Now, let’s begin!
Aeon Flux lives in the year 2415, centuries after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.920
the plague that killed 90% of humanity in 2011.&nbsp;
Only five million people survive in a utopian city&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.240
called Bregna, led by Trevor. Each one is a clone&nbsp;
from DNA that has been recycled for generations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.840
In the Trevor dynasty, people disappear never to&nbsp;
be seen again with no explanations. The Monicans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.160
is founded as a secret rebel organisation&nbsp;
and Aeon is one of their warriors. 
&nbsp;

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.080
The Monicans communicate by a telepathy&nbsp;
device in the shape of a pill.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.280
Their leader is Handler. Aeon is given a mission&nbsp;
to destroy one of Trevor’s surveillance stations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.120
At night, Aeon quickly defeats the guards one by&nbsp;
one. She enters the control center pool where she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.640
finds most of the citizen’s daily activities are&nbsp;
monitored, even the conversation between her and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.240
the sister, Una earlier. Aeon drops a device that&nbsp;
will blind the Trevor's observation. Then Aeon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.680
goes back up the rope and gets out of there.
Meanwhile, Una is preparing dinner for Aeon. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.720
she hears a knock on the door, a gun points&nbsp;
and someone triggers it. On the way home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.680
Aeon learns that the government has killed&nbsp;
Una, thinking her as a Monican. Una’s husband,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.800
Claudius, is also arrested. Aeon becomes more&nbsp;
and more angry at the Bregna’s government.
&nbsp;

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.800
One year later, Aeon receives a call&nbsp;
from Handler. She tells Aeon that ​​it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.840
is the right time for the elimination of Trevor&nbsp;
Goodchild, who Aeon blames for her sister's death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.120
Handler implants a map on Aeon’s arm, showing her&nbsp;
the way to find and kill Trevor at the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.640
zone called Citadel. A moment later, Sithandra,&nbsp;
who has two hands where her feet would be,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.960
appears to join Aeon in the mission.
At the frontier garden, Aeon and Sith&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.320
rapidly avoid the poisonous plant weapons. On&nbsp;
the next challenge, Sith gets hurt in her hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.920
due to the sharp grass. Aeon manages to avoid it&nbsp;
with help from Sith. Aeon enters the zone by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.120
air ventilator door while Sith watches outside.&nbsp;
Aeon then activates the map and throws something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.160
against the wall when she’s in the pipe. 
Meanwhile, Trevor and his brother Oren are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.040
in a tense meeting with other Bregna’s&nbsp;
heads. Oren shouts at a guy named Giroux,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.320
and Trevor has to calm him down. Later, the&nbsp;
two brothers meet again outside. Trevor tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.040
Oren that he has to stay level-headed.&nbsp;
Oren reluctantly agrees to do so. 
&nbsp;

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.320
Back with Aeon, she moves to the theatre where&nbsp;
Trevor is currently working on his speech.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.160
She appears and holds her gun on him. Trevor&nbsp;
stares at her for a moment and then asks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.560
"Catherine? It’s you!". Before things&nbsp;
can progress, she gets knocked out.
 
&nbsp;

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.160
When Aeon wakes up, she finds herself in a while&nbsp;
cell. One of the walls becomes transparent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.920
Trevor appears. Aeon asks why Trevor called&nbsp;
her that name. Trevor just says he’ll not let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.600
her go and leaves after that. Aeon recalls some&nbsp;
random memories when Trevor seems very close to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.480
but still she couldn’t define what it is. 
A moment later, some water and food are served&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.560
in the cell. Aeon tilts her head back,&nbsp;
revealing a black eye that can inspect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.840
objects. She notices something in the water and&nbsp;
decides to take a little of it to exam later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.120
She then whistles into the vent above her, causing&nbsp;
the items she was throwing down earlier to flee.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.880
Outside her cell, the marbles&nbsp;
build a pyramid and blast it open.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.640
Aeon escapes out of the cell and decides&nbsp;
to carry on the mission differently.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.080
Sith calls her and confronts why Trevor is still&nbsp;
alive. Handler is displeased at the mission. Aeon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.400
tells Sith that there is something more about&nbsp;
Trevor and she’ll find out in the meantime.
&nbsp;

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.760
Meanwhile, Oren and a woman review Aeon’s&nbsp;
breakout earlier. It turns out Oren has a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.560
connection to the Monicans. He secretly used&nbsp;
the Monicans to get rid of his brother so he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.000
could take control over the dynasty. However, the&nbsp;
two can’t understand why Aeon let him live. 
&nbsp;

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.040
Somewhere else, Aeon meets Claudius again. She&nbsp;
asked him why he worked for his girlfriend's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.400
killer. Claudius reveals that Trevor is actually&nbsp;
working on a project to help people in Bregna.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.360
Although he hates the fact that Una got killed&nbsp;
due to Aeon, he still helps her to examine the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.120
water from the cell. Claudius tells her she has&nbsp;
a message and only by drinking it she’ll know.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.520
After drinking it, Aeon realizes it’s&nbsp;
Trevor and he wants her to come back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.800
Somehow, the water shows her the way to Trevor’s&nbsp;
quarters. He tells her that there is a connection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.160
between the two of them, and that they knew each&nbsp;
other before. In a moment of weakness, the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.160
kiss and it leads to a longer passionate night.
The following day, Aeon gets up in Trevor’s bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.680
She quickly gets dressed up and notices his ring&nbsp;
on the floor. As she picks it up, a staircase in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.680
the floor opens. Aeon goes down and finds herself&nbsp;
in Trevor's secret library. There are pictures of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.520
his ancestors over generations. When she touches&nbsp;
one of the starfish-shaped objects, it moves and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.440
wraps itself around her. Next, she finds herself&nbsp;
in a lab. She checks around and sees a picture of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.880
her with long hair. Suddenly, Aeon encounters&nbsp;
Freya, one of Trevor’s chief security guards.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.080
The two fight, and Aeon manages to escape from&nbsp;
a door before Freya shoots needles at her. Freya&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.680
rushes to inform Trevor that she tried to kill&nbsp;
Aeon but failed, Trevor seems pissed at her. 
&nbsp;

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.120
Elsewhere, Oren and other heads watch Aeon and&nbsp;
Trevor have fun and decide Trevor is a betrayal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.160
Oren becomes the new chairman. His very first&nbsp;
order is to kill and eliminate Trevor and Aeon.
&nbsp;

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.120
At night, Sith shows up and confronts&nbsp;
Aeon for failing their mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.920
Sith considers Aeon’s action against the&nbsp;
Monicans. Aeon tells Sith that they must be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.440
wrong about Trevor and the organization is hiding&nbsp;
something. Sith seems to reluctantly disagree but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.040
later she fights with Aeon. Aeon eventually&nbsp;
wins. Sith is tied up and Aeon leaves her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.880
under a pool with a breathing straw. Sith manages&nbsp;
to inform Handler that Aeon betrayed the Monicans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.480
The new mission is to find and eliminate Aeon.
After that, Aeon finds the way to approach the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:12.320
floating Ralical, an airship that stores all the&nbsp;
DNA samples. She gets to meet Keeper, a hologram&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.160
older man. He welcomes her back and leaves after.&nbsp;
Aeon looks for Una on the system and learns that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.240
Una has successfully been reborn as Sasha Pirillo.&nbsp;
Aeon asks the address of Sasha then. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.400
Keeper also lets Trevor know where Aeon heads&nbsp;
to. He learns that Oren commanded to kill Una. 
&nbsp;

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.480
At that time, Aeon finds Sasha and&nbsp;
realizes the baby has Una’s eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.480
Trevor suddenly appears behind her and explains&nbsp;
that his ongoing experiments were attempts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:44.320
reverse the infertility. Una is a part of the&nbsp;
test in search of the cure. After examining her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.120
Una became one of Trevor's most successful&nbsp;
experiments as she is naturally pregnant with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.120
no scientific help. However, Oren ordered to kill&nbsp;
her as he believes the natural fertility would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:01.120
a danger to the dynasty. Oren wants to be immortal&nbsp;
and maintains the power in Bregna. Elsewhere,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.480
Cladius gets killed by Oren for helping Aeon.&nbsp;
He never regrets for being a part of Trevor’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.160
experiment and for the future of humankind.
Back to Aeon, she gives Sasha back to her parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.360
A bombing device is dropped from the ceiling and&nbsp;
explodes the house. Then a group of Bregna forces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.040
attack the two of them. As Trevor gets shot, Aeon&nbsp;
rushes in to back up him. They eventually flee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.880
into a subway. However, the guards open fire into&nbsp;
their car which injures a lot of people inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.680
A moment later, the train is forced to&nbsp;
stop. The two immediately break out. 
&nbsp;

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.960
Inside a secret pipe, Aeon helps Trevor to take&nbsp;
the bullets out. Then she puts some skin patches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.480
on him to help them heal. They understand that&nbsp;
there is nowhere safe now in Bregna. Trevor tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.760
her that they need to get to his lab and find the&nbsp;
notes for Una's test group. That would be the set&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.520
with a cure inside. They return to the labs and&nbsp;
sneak into a security room at the top of a tower.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.760
Trevor uses his influence to persuade&nbsp;
the commander of the guards. Trevor and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.720
Aeon make it to "borrow" some weapons. 
On the way, Aeon asks Trevor the truth about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.720
her and the photo in the lab. Trevor reveals Aeon&nbsp;
used to be his wife Katherine. He still keeps her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:16.720
in memory over the clone generations. As entering&nbsp;
the lab, Trevor realizes his lad was burnt down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.440
All the notes were destroyed and Freya got&nbsp;
killed. Trevor tells Aeon to leave this kingdom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:27.040
and get out of the wall. They probably find the&nbsp;
chance to live out there. However, Aeon decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:33.520
to get rid of the Radical. She aims to finish the&nbsp;
recycled DNA in Bregna. To Aeon, it's maybe better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:39.360
without a cure, and people are meant to die.
Right at that time, Oren storms in with his armed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:45.040
force. In other directions, Sith and her team&nbsp;
decide to snipe at Aeon and Trevor. While Trevor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.400
and Oren are talking, Aeon can spot Sith from a&nbsp;
distance. She attempts to contact Sith and tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:56.160
her the truth of everything. Sith is convinced&nbsp;
and changes her mind. She shoots at Oren instead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.840
and orders her team to cover Trevor and Aeon. The&nbsp;
two take this chance to escape from the security.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.960
However, Trevor gets shot. Aeon tries to&nbsp;
steal the weapons from the guards. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.480
some of Sith’s buddies get killed while trying&nbsp;
to help Aeon. Sith and Aeon both open fire at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:18.560
remaining guards around. Unfortunately, Oren fires&nbsp;
his weapon to Sith, blowing her off the tower.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.760
Next, Oren targets Aeon, but Trevor pushes him&nbsp;
away. The new chairman ends up getting killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:29.520
by Aeon. Trevor retrieves his dynasty.
Meanwhile, Aeon has one last mission to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.640
She sets the bombs and finally destroys the&nbsp;
Radical. The airship hits the wall, revealing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:41.040
the whole outside world after centuries.
