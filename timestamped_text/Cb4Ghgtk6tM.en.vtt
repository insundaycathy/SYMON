00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.440
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to explain a&nbsp;
horror and thriller film called “The Collection."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.440
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.480
During a car ride, Mr. Peters comforts his&nbsp;
young daughter, Elena, over her mother’s death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.480
He reassures her by saying that he will&nbsp;
always be with her every step of the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.480
Suddenly, another vehicle crashes into their car.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.480
In multiple television broadcasts, the serial&nbsp;
killer with the alias “The Collector” has been the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.600
central focus of a massive manhunt. His signature&nbsp;
scheme is to kill all his victims and spare one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.160
whom he kidnaps. Arkin, his latest victim, is&nbsp;
still on a missing list, as authorities extract&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.720
all resources they have to retrieve him.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.440
Years after the accident, Elena is now a&nbsp;
teenager with hearing problems due to the crash,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.000
so she wears a hearing aid to assist her&nbsp;
daily. That night, she receives a call from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
her boyfriend, Brian, who cancels plans with&nbsp;
her because of his “work.” Not long after,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.880
she receives a call from Missy and Josh, who&nbsp;
invite her to an entry-by-password-only party&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.240
in an undisclosed location. She gets ready and&nbsp;
kisses her father before she leaves for the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.760
They arrive at an empty alley, where&nbsp;
a guy opens a door just behind them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.600
Elena says the word “nevermore,” and they&nbsp;
instantly gain access to the lively scene. Inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.800
they start to party the night away. Suddenly,&nbsp;
Elena sees Brian making out with another woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.320
among the crowd. She punches him in the face as&nbsp;
payback before walking away from the dance floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.400
Unbeknownst to the partygoers, the notorious&nbsp;
“Collector” is watching all of them from above&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.440
the club and picking his new victims. Elena gets&nbsp;
out of Missy’s sight to have a moment, ending up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.640
in an isolated room where she finds a big red&nbsp;
box. After looking intently, it starts moving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.320
as if someone is inside. She unlocks it out of&nbsp;
curiosity only to find a seriously injured Arkin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.480
He grabs Elena out of desperation for freedom,&nbsp;
and they dodge a spear shot from the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.160
It prompts a deadly trap back in the dance floor&nbsp;
orchestrated by The Collector. A big rotating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.600
blade starts plunging into the pool of people, and&nbsp;
Brian spots it right away, giving him time to run.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.000
The machine starts shredding hundreds of people&nbsp;
inside the club in just a matter of seconds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.600
resulting in a blood bath. Back in the room, Elena&nbsp;
gets frightened and runs outside, where she steps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.960
on a very thin wire which initiates swords to&nbsp;
fling out, hitting people fatally. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.520
Missy and a group of people get trapped as&nbsp;
two steel barriers drop in a small section.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.320
The Collector stands on a shaft from above which&nbsp;
lowers gradually, crushing the victims to death as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.040
Elena watches her best friend in complete horror.&nbsp;
As she opens her eyes, she sees The Collector&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.240
directly looking at her, causing her to run for&nbsp;
her life. However, he captures her while Arkin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.680
escapes using Brian’s body as a protective shield.&nbsp;
Arkin jumps out of a window, landing on a parked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.560
car. Enduring the pain, he gets as far away as he&nbsp;
can from the building after seeing the Collector&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.840
looking at him.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.320
Arkin is brought to the hospital, disoriented&nbsp;
and traumatized by flashbacks of torture.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.080
Despite this, the police officers arrest him&nbsp;
because of his criminal records. As Arkin gains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.320
consciousness, his wife sits asks about what&nbsp;
happened, but he isn’t ready to talk about what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.360
he has gone through just yet. He notices flowers&nbsp;
by the desk and realizes that The Collector is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.840
sender. He grows worried and advises his wife&nbsp;
to stay at her mom’s home for the time being.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.880
Just then, a man named Lucello enters the room&nbsp;
and introduces himself as a hired investigator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.880
He was hired by Mr. Peters, Elena’s father.&nbsp;
Lucello shows Elena’s picture and asks if she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.480
has been at the party, which Arkin immediately&nbsp;
confirms. According to Lucello, he has 48 hours&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.440
to retrieve the girl before The Collector takes&nbsp;
her life. He then asks for Arkin’s participation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.800
in the search.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.840
Lucello makes a call to Mr. Peters to inform him&nbsp;
that Arkin has agreed to participate. All the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.320
while, Elena gets a flashback of the accident’s&nbsp;
aftermath where a strange-looking man appears to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.440
break the window and save her life. She then wakes&nbsp;
up inside a box and sees a man being tortured from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.000
a small hole. Peeking through it, The Collector&nbsp;
senses her fear and gives her taunting looks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.520
&nbsp;
A team of mercenaries composed of Lucello, Lin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:15.840
Dre, Wally, and Paz are brought together to hunt&nbsp;
The Collector, including Arkin. Arkin reveals how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.400
the killer captured him and how he took note of&nbsp;
the journey by cutting his arms during every turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.360
He retraces the location, depending on his&nbsp;
memories and his scars, and successfully leads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.160
the group to The Collector’s base. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
Elena utilizes her bra to grip the latch and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.520
unlock the box from inside. She then sees a room&nbsp;
filled with torture weapons and another box.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.920
In an attempt to free a fellow victim,&nbsp;
she opens it only to find a man’s corpse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.920
In a matter of seconds, The Collector&nbsp;
re-enters, noticing Elena’s escape,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.880
so he frees several spiders to reveal where&nbsp;
she hides. As the small creatures creep on her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.920
she remains still as the situation holds a thin&nbsp;
line between life and death. When the mercenary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.840
group triggers the alarms, The Collector&nbsp;
immediately runs out of the room to check,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.840
giving Elena a chance to escape. Outside, Arkin&nbsp;
refuses to enter the hotel, but Lucello holds him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.000
at gunpoint, leaving him no choice but to show&nbsp;
them the contents of the abandoned building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.080
The Collector watches the group invade his space&nbsp;
from the surveillance before putting on his black&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.880
leather mask, which is his signature look.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.840
While The Collector is preoccupied, Elena manages&nbsp;
to find an alternative exit and crawls toward the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.400
narrow space. She makes her way to the exit&nbsp;
through the vents above, which Lin notices.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.000
Unfortunately, Lin, who is outside the hotel, gets&nbsp;
stabbed to death by none other than The Collector&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.240
himself. Inside, Arkin fights off a half-masked&nbsp;
person. Fortunately, Paz comes to his rescue and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.440
shoots him. They examine the body and realize that&nbsp;
The Collector performs experiments on his victims,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.960
almost turning them into wild animals. Shortly&nbsp;
after, they find a pile of disassembled bodies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.080
turning the place into a brutal slaughterhouse.&nbsp;
As they speak, The Collector unlocks a cage that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.280
frees more victims who have turned zombie-like,&nbsp;
attacking Lucello’s group. As a defense, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.080
shoot at the half-masked subjects, who are too&nbsp;
drugged and far gone into their creature minds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.840
They manage to reach a safe room where they&nbsp;
continue to carry out their mission of finding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.200
Elena. Unbeknownst to her, Elena tries to find a&nbsp;
way out on her own and ends up in a room full of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.960
cosmetic products. She hears a woman crying for&nbsp;
help and opens another box. A prisoner named Abby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.400
comes out of the box but is reluctant to leave out&nbsp;
of fear that The Collector might catch her again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.040
&nbsp;
Discovering more about the hotel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.920
the group encounters a shirtless man desperately&nbsp;
asking for help. He cries while saying that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.960
didn’t make it to the collection. Just then,&nbsp;
a bomb explodes from his neck. The explosion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.920
triggers a trap where three sharp bars impale&nbsp;
Dre, causing his death. Arkin sees this as an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.400
opportunity to get out of the group’s sight and&nbsp;
finds an escape through a narrow trap. He ends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.120
up in a room with flickering lights, where The&nbsp;
Collector comes from behind him. However, Arkin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.320
luckily escapes his captor unharmed once again.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.120
Meanwhile, Abby and Elena team up to escape,&nbsp;
going through the deadly hallways together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.160
Abby reveals that she is The Collector’s favorite&nbsp;
victim and is also very familiar with his traps.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.400
When she notices Elena’s hearing aid, she&nbsp;
panics and claims that Elena is not strong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.440
enough for the collection. Just as she is about to&nbsp;
return to her box, The Collector blocks her way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.480
making her sink into the floor out of fear. The&nbsp;
sight of him terrifies Elena, so she runs away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.520
from him, also leaving the poor Abby behind.&nbsp;
The Collector chases Elena around the place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.080
but she manages to hide just above him.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.840
On the other hand, Arkin, deeply traumatized by&nbsp;
his experiences, escapes both the mercenary group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.560
and The Collector. Being inside the hotel brings&nbsp;
back unpleasant memories of when The Collector&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.600
kept him captive, so he desperately tries to&nbsp;
flee. Along the way, he encounters several traps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.520
that almost kill him, but he luckily dodges them.&nbsp;
However, upon hiding from Wally, he falls into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.880
pile of corpses and other dismembered body parts.&nbsp;
After getting out of there, Arkin sets foot in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.120
room full of preserved animals.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.440
In the meantime, Elena is still on her&nbsp;
quest to find an exit, and in the process,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.000
she drops her hearing aid in a bear trap. She&nbsp;
slowly tries to grab it to retrieve it, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.880
the intense sensitivity of her aid makes it much&nbsp;
harder. She finally gets it back without hurting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.920
herself and continues to make her way through&nbsp;
the small alley. Arkin, who is still in the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.120
sees more preserved beings locked in capsules.&nbsp;
Out of nowhere, he hears a voice asking for help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.560
On the wall, she sees a woman in such a hopeless&nbsp;
state as she is nailed. Despite feeling sorry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.920
for her, Arkin does not rescue her as it will&nbsp;
risk his safety. Not long after, The Collector&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.920
enters the room to check if Arkin is in there and&nbsp;
slits the nailed woman’s throat in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.320
&nbsp;
Still determined to be free,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.720
Elena stumbles into an empty room where she&nbsp;
finds people outside through the torn wallpapers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.280
She screams for help but to no avail as&nbsp;
the people outside are too preoccupied.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.560
Ending up in an art room, Arkin gets knocked out&nbsp;
by Wally and is captured by the mercenary group.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.200
Far from their knowledge, The Collector&nbsp;
lets down a big hook and catches Wally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.000
who gets dragged up as the killer faces&nbsp;
Arkin, Paz, and Lucello. The Collector&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
comes face to face with them and successfully&nbsp;
pushes Paz out of the scene with a zipline.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.760
He then uses Wally’s weight to lift himself again,&nbsp;
leaving the bloody mercenary dead on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.720
Arkin persuades Lucello to leave Elena behind,&nbsp;
but he refuses to do so as he was the one who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.280
took care of her ever since she was young.&nbsp;
While they talk, Abby comes from behind to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.440
ask if she could also escape with them in&nbsp;
exchange for tracking Elena down. The three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.720
of them advance but get distracted when they hear&nbsp;
Paz’s cries for help. In an attempt to rescue her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.280
they get trapped inside a room full of mannequins,&nbsp;
where Lucello looks for her by listening to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.640
screams. Noticing wires along the way, Arkin calls&nbsp;
out to Lucello to warn him that it is just a trap.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.400
Lucello finds out that the screams only come from&nbsp;
a speaker and not Paz herself, so he runs back as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.800
the mannequins explode one by one.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:50.000
Simultaneously, Elena has tracked Paz down and&nbsp;
unties her from a net after hearing her screams as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.920
well. After Abby leads the way, they safely&nbsp;
reunite, but Elena warns them not to trust Abby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.360
Contrary to this, Lucello calms her down as&nbsp;
they both embrace, assuring her safety. Elena&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.600
leads all of them into the room where they could&nbsp;
have contact outside, but the two men are unable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.800
to hear them. To get their attention, Arkin shoots&nbsp;
one of the men and leads police officers to gather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.680
around outside the building.&nbsp; Arkin fires a second&nbsp;
shot, causing the officers to call for backup.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.240
&nbsp;
After a slight moment of relief,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.480
Abby locks the door from the inside before she&nbsp;
betrays the group and gives up their location.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.760
However, she dies after stepping on a board&nbsp;
of nails and falling back into an iron trap,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.480
folding her inside. In a fit of rage, The&nbsp;
Collector attacks the group with a gun and a pair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:38.800
of dogs who advance at them. While Paz, Arkin, and&nbsp;
Lucello are combating the wild dogs, The Collector&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.920
kidnaps Elena and brings her to his lair. As they&nbsp;
get up, they find Lucello pinned to the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.880
with nails and with a bigger trap just above him.&nbsp;
He commands Paz and Arkin to leave him behind and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:54.400
save Elena quickly. Both of them find her strapped&nbsp;
to a bed and untie her just as a metal cage falls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.560
trapping all of them inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01.680
Enraged, Arkin repeatedly insults The Collector,&nbsp;
calling him names as he calmly observes the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.400
At that moment, he brings out a lighter and makes&nbsp;
it apparent that he is going to burn the building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.600
down before setting a thread in flames. Paz tries&nbsp;
to unlock the cage with a knife but drops it in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.560
the process, leaving Arkin no choice but to&nbsp;
sacrifice himself. By having Elena break his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.120
arm again, he reaches the latch and unlocks&nbsp;
the cage, leaving himself severely injured.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.760
While The Collector drenches the place in&nbsp;
gas, the three find an exit door to the safer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.800
part of the building. Sadly, The Collector&nbsp;
tracks them down and stabs Paz from behind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.440
immediately killing her. He also manages&nbsp;
to throw Elena and Arkin across the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.320
but Lucello enters just as The Collector&nbsp;
plants another kill. In an intense knife fight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.440
Lucello and The Collector combat each other, but&nbsp;
the latter wins. Arkin gets into a fistfight with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.880
The Collector, releasing all his anger and rage&nbsp;
at the merciless criminal. As his final act, Arkin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.600
brutally beats the Collector and throws his body&nbsp;
down a chute and onto a pile of corpses covered in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.080
gasoline before lighting it on fire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:03.120
As the building gets eaten by fire, firefighters&nbsp;
hear Elena’s screams, so they tear the door from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:08.400
outside to rescue the remaining ones. Elena sees&nbsp;
Arkin trapped in a massive circle of fire, who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.520
has seemingly given up. He just sits still in the&nbsp;
middle of the flames, accepting his tragic fate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.720
but Elena breaks one of the capsules, causing the&nbsp;
fire to go off. It gives way for Arkin and her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.360
come out safely as the doors collapse.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.360
Finally, Elena reunites with her father who&nbsp;
has been greatly worried about her safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.080
Meanwhile, Arkin finds The Collector’s&nbsp;
burned mask without a corpse inside a box,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.920
making him worry. After some time,&nbsp;
Arkin tracks down The Collector’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.400
house by searching for every entomologist&nbsp;
around the area. In The Collector’s home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.280
Arkin confronts him about his identity and says he&nbsp;
will torture him as he tortured Arkin. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.000
The Collector attacks Arkin but is forced into&nbsp;
a red box that Arkin brought. He desperately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.400
clings onto the sides of the red box as Arkin&nbsp;
shuts the box, getting his ultimate revenge.
