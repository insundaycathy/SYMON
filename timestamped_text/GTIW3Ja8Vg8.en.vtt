00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:46.800
about adam she's musing about how everything&nbsp;
she knows about him either came from a book a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:53.680
newspaper or even shred of information from other&nbsp;

answers that it was at the hilton though he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:08.480
remains unconvinced adam apologizes to her for&nbsp;
being noisy he then shows alice her necklace and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:16.640
asked where she got it from and alice says deborah&nbsp;
gave it to her for a moment there's a trace of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:23.920
disbelief and uneasiness on adam's face but it&nbsp;
disappears quickly as he smiles saying devorah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:30.800
has a good taste as adam reads the newspaper alice&nbsp;
tells him about michael stores note and accusation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:37.600
adam is going to deny it saying it never happened&nbsp;
and that he is not surprised that michael&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:44.640
contacted her adam then apologizes to alice for&nbsp;
having to hear that story and before she could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:53.200
reply klaus shows up to take adam to a talk show&nbsp;
once they are gone alice goes through adam's dryer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.200 --> 00:18:00.240
again to find the key to the closet but it isn't&nbsp;
there suddenly she hears the sound of the wind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:07.200
chime from the front door and she immediately&nbsp;
checks to see if adam is back and she immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:13.120
checks to see if adam is back when she opens&nbsp;
the door alice finds the package on the door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:21.760
containing a letter that asks her how far she&nbsp;
will let adam go and a long piece of silk with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:28.880
blood strings similar to the one adam used on her&nbsp;
during their honeymoon alice then quickly calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:36.960
the directory inquiries and asks if they have a&nbsp;
listing for adley blanchard on march mott road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:43.360
posing as joanna again alice goes to atlas house&nbsp;
where atlas mother's greets her alice learns from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:50.240

and after adl's mother invites her inside she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:57.360
tells alice that atleast hasn't even contacted her&nbsp;
husband michael then she shows her at this photo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:05.360
album where she finds adam in one of atl's wedding&nbsp;
pictures adl's mother says her daughter used to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:13.200
climb with adam all the time but that stopped&nbsp;
two years after she got married she says michael&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:21.440
got fed up with atlas mountain climbing so in the&nbsp;
end adli choose to stop to her horror alice also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:28.480
sees a naked photo of adley standing beside an&nbsp;
angel statue at the place where they got married&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:34.320
then adley's mother mentioned that adam called her&nbsp;
asking for updates on the investigation when atlas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:40.880
mother tells alice that adam is also coming&nbsp;
alice immediately excuses herself and leaves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:48.080
secretly leaving two photos of adley she throwed&nbsp;
away her package before boarding the train while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:55.920
repeatedly looking behind her that evening alice&nbsp;
is started when she suddenly sees adam in the dark&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:01.920
corner of their house smoking adam then puts on&nbsp;
his cigarette and picks alice up before binding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:08.800
her on the table alice tries to protest but adam&nbsp;
ignores her and accuses her to being with another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:17.360
man when alice denies it adam asked her why she&nbsp;
keeps sneaking around and that's when she admits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:24.400
that she is found at least letters furious adam&nbsp;
goes upstairs to retrieve the letters and starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:32.080
throwing them down to alice saying he has nothing&nbsp;
to hide back down alice asks him to untie her but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:39.440
adam only sits on the floor and cries eliminating&nbsp;
over how she wouldn't be in that position if she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:47.840
trusted him trying to get adam sympathy alice&nbsp;
says she just wanted to know him more so that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:55.680
could love him more while she is crying adam&nbsp;
assures alice that he is hers and that he loves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:03.760
her so much he can break her neck adam then asks&nbsp;
if she likes what they are doing but she doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:11.520
answer his question and instead tells him that&nbsp;
she needs to pee after adam unties her alice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:19.440
escapes his house through the fire exit and adam&nbsp;
quickly goes after her begging her to stop as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:28.160
she hides from adam alice witnesses how he could&nbsp;
lost his temper over small thing and throw effect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:34.960
finally it's revealed that the person alice has&nbsp;
been taken to is a senior police officer and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:42.800
explains that that's when she came to him she&nbsp;
asked him if they can open adli blanchard's case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:51.200
but the officer says it's not easy to open a case&nbsp;
like atleast alice restores that adam killed adly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:58.400
but the officer says she has no proof of that&nbsp;
still determined to have adam arrested alice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:06.240
tells him that adam forced himself on michael but&nbsp;
the officer currently replies that michael never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:13.600
reported it the only proof she has is the two&nbsp;
photographs of adley which proves nothing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:20.640
officer then shows adam through the double-sided&nbsp;
class telling the officers about alice's escape in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:29.600
the other interrogation room she hears adam saying&nbsp;
he loves her and the officer tells alice that even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:37.440
though he believes adam has the potential for&nbsp;
violence he isn't sure if he is murdered after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:43.120
closing the binds the officer informs alice&nbsp;
that they can only keep adam for a few hours&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:50.560
adding that she's accusing a hero while providing&nbsp;
no evidence with no one to turn to alice asked for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:58.720
deborah's help to know the truth about adam after&nbsp;
learning from deborah that franz kois was with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:06.160
someone else alice interferes that frank coy's&nbsp;
left adam so he killed her deborah agrees with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:13.600
then she shows alice two different anchors used&nbsp;
in climbing one of which is made of cheap material&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:20.240
she says adam could have switched the anchors&nbsp;
killing francoise and her group finally deborah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:27.600
advises alice to leave adam for her own good&nbsp;
scared alice tells deborah about adley and gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:34.160
her adless pictures alice still thinks that adam&nbsp;
killed her and she must have been be buried at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:42.480
location in the picture at st edmunds then alice&nbsp;
asked devorah to come with her to find adelie on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:49.040
their way to stained admins deborah confesses to&nbsp;
sending alice the notes she knows about adam's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:55.840
violence and she wants her to get away from him&nbsp;
back at deborah's place adam finds that two photos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:04.000
of ali and after quickly realizing where alice&nbsp;
is headed she follows her at saint eight months&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.840
alice find a body buried in the dirt wearing a&nbsp;
necklace like the one deborah gave her when alice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:19.200
confronts her about it deborah ominously says&nbsp;
that adley didn't have to die if only she would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:27.120
told her that she was going back to michael with&nbsp;
a sinner deborah says she gave adley a necklace to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:34.000
and that she found it beautiful just like alice&nbsp;
did with alice determining to know whatever i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:41.200
did the two women start fighting and hitting each&nbsp;
other deborah aggressively admits to sleeping with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:49.040
her brother when they were kids adding that she's&nbsp;
the one who gave him his first place of self&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:57.440
as the struggle deborah yells that adam is hers&nbsp;
and attempts to hit alice with a shovel but adam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:05.120
shows up and tackles her to the ground alison runs&nbsp;
away and adam hits deborah across the face saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:11.840
he was never hers as he starts looking for alice&nbsp;
deborah is about to hit him at the back with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:18.080
uh shovel but alice shoots her with a flare&nbsp;
gun deborah dies in adam's arms leaving he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.040
stunning and devastated he confesses&nbsp;
to alice that he and deborah used to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:29.440
go there together and with a betrayed look&nbsp;
adam says that he thought alice just had to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:37.760
trust him deborah's body is taken by the cops the&nbsp;
following day and so is adam two years later alice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:45.200
and adam see each other again at the airport as&nbsp;
he's going up the escalator while she's going down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:50.640
neither of them says anything but they just&nbsp;
look at each other when adam reaches the top&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:58.400
he stays there for a moment and looks at alice&nbsp;
one last time before walking away meanwhile alice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:05.680
starts thinking that a flat lander like her can't&nbsp;
live at a high at altitude right where adam is
