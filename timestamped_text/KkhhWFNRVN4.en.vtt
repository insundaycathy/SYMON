00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
﻿Intro
In part 1 of How to Beat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:07.040
the Humans as “The Thing”, we broke down what the&nbsp;
Thing is, broke out of the alien-thing’s ice tomb,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.880
assimilated Griggs and Lar’s dog, and started&nbsp;
conspiring against the entire human race.
&nbsp;

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.800
In this part we will continue our rampage,&nbsp;
and see if we can beat the humans or not.
&nbsp;

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.720
Let’s get to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.400
it, the thing’s intestines are itching to&nbsp;
strangle drunk Norwegion researchers.
&nbsp;

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.360
They are so dead.
Body
&nbsp;

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.520
With the Dog-Thing running off to the other&nbsp;
research stations, and The alien-thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.640
distracting all the humans who are out searching&nbsp;
for it, Griggs-Thing could return to the humans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.160
acting all freaked out to blend back in. 
Or. It could use this opportunity to sabotage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.360
weapons and communications. Griggs-Thing&nbsp;
would have memories of the radio equipment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.640
who operates the radio, and the stockpiles of&nbsp;
flamethrowers in the shed. The guns and axes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.840
aren’t particularly dangerous to the Thing,&nbsp;
but the napalm hoses are. Griggs-thing need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.920
only use it’s memories to envision what a&nbsp;
flamethrower would do to a human body.
&nbsp;

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.400
Yah, let's try to avoid that. 
Puncturing holes in the tanks and cutting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.080
fuel lines should only take a minute.&nbsp;
You could also light the shed on fire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.920
but that would bring too much attention&nbsp;
and suspicion to why the flamethrowers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.240
were destroyed. Right now, none of the humans&nbsp;
are thinking about busting out the torch guns,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.440
so subtly sabotaging them is the best bet. 
After destroying the most dangerous weapons the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.440
humans have, cutting the communications&nbsp;
out of the base is the next priority.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.480
The humans don’t know about the thing, yet, but&nbsp;
if they did decide to phone home about the alien,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.080
or they did find out about the thing&nbsp;
cells and relayed that information,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.760
a bunch of men in black are going to show up&nbsp;
and start causing problems for the thing.
&nbsp;

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.640
The thing might be able to use the increased foot&nbsp;
traffic in and out of Antarctica to it’s benefit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.880
but the chances of a strict quarantine,&nbsp;
and intensive research and experimentation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.440
done on the soon to be alien corpse or&nbsp;
the sample Dr Sander took will expose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.160
the thing, leading to its eradication. 
The less alert people are, the better. 
&nbsp;

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.160
While everyone’s still out searching for the&nbsp;
alien, Griggs-Thing should have time to also go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.880
spill some coffee on the radio equipment, fray&nbsp;
some wires, or something to destroy it.
&nbsp;

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.320
The helicopters, snowcats, and other forms of&nbsp;
transportation can be left unimpaired for now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.720
Eventually the thing will need to leave this&nbsp;
research station, and hoofing it on foot in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.480
-40 degree temps isn’t ideal, even for the thing.&nbsp;
Even if the humans figured out what the thing is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.240
they are unlikely to allow anyone to&nbsp;
physically leave the station because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.840
they wouldn’t know who was actually a&nbsp;
thing. They can’t risk it escaping.
&nbsp;

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.720
Some of the researchers stumble upon the&nbsp;
dog kennel. There’s blood everywhere. Why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.600
would the thing leave a bloody mess after&nbsp;
assimilating the dog, but not Griggs. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.680
may have been intentional by the thing.&nbsp;
As far as the researchers are concerned,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.440
the dog was killed and eaten by the bug alien.&nbsp;
This is actually ideal, because if or when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.440
the humans figure out the nature of the&nbsp;
thing, they will realize that the dog&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.160
would be a threat and try to find and kill it.&nbsp;
This way, they think it’s dead and gone.
&nbsp;

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.680
The alien-thing has still managed&nbsp;
to evade the humans so far,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.680
but it’s options are dwindling. 
It could try to make it back to the spaceship,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.120
but the problem is that it doesn’t know&nbsp;
where it is. Griggs-thing would know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.280
but with the humans out looking for them, they&nbsp;
probably didn’t have time to stay and chat.
&nbsp;

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.680
Even if it did know where the spaceship was,&nbsp;
and could transform some alien neural-bio&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.440
links to operate the spaceship, it&nbsp;
is obviously not flyable or else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.920
it would have left Earth a long time ago. 
The best option I could think of is to badly wound&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.560
and infect some of the humans before running off&nbsp;
into the night and digging itself into a hidden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.440
ice coffin where the humans wouldn’t find it.
Wounding instead of killing the humans will cause&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.760
them to abandon the chase to provide medical&nbsp;
care for their friends. This distraction and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.920
diversion of resources gives the alien-thing&nbsp;
the breathing room to run and hide. 
&nbsp;

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.960
It’s possible the alien-thing&nbsp;
won’t survive another freeze,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.760
but the humans are going to kill it anyways. The&nbsp;
last thing griggs-thing and dog-thing need is for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.320
humans to start studying it’s alien body and&nbsp;
putting it’s cells under the microscope.
&nbsp;

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.240
Badly injuring the humans will also&nbsp;
cause them to evacuate their wounded to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.040
a good hospital in a more populated region,&nbsp;
enabling the things to spread further.
&nbsp;

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:41.840
Instead of doing all this strategic shit, the&nbsp;
alien-thing decides to nom on Henrik. 
&nbsp;

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.600
To be fair, it can be hard to think straight&nbsp;
when your starving corpse is thawed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.720
re-animated after a 100 thousand years, only to&nbsp;
be immediately attacked by another species. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.280
rest of the humans converge on it and are forced&nbsp;
to gun it down and burn it, seeing as how it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.280
killed or was killing their friend.
Poor Henrik. He woke up that morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.800
and could never have imagined that this&nbsp;
was the way his life would end. 
&nbsp;

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:13.200
Being pulled inside an alien bug’s stomach. 
It’s digestive acids searing and breaking down his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.840
flesh. Only able to make muffled screams&nbsp;
while suffocating and losing blood. Your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.840
friends realize they can’t help you so they start&nbsp;
shooting at it to try to kill you and it. 
&nbsp;

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.280
None of them put you out of your misery. The fiery&nbsp;
stinging of bullets hitting you is just more pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.840
added to the agony of melting and suffocating.&nbsp;
Then they light it, and you, on fire. 
&nbsp;

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.480
Only then did his consciousness give out.&nbsp;
Maybe he died immediately though.
&nbsp;

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.680
Despite the alien thing failing to hide it’s&nbsp;
body in the snow, with no comms or weapons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.840
griggs-thing blending in nicely, and dog&nbsp;
thing on it’s way to another station,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.680
I think we’re still on track for&nbsp;
world domination in 27,000 hours.
&nbsp;

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.560
Olav, who just witnessed Henrik get mauled&nbsp;
and digested by the alien-thing, is now in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.680
infirmary getting checked out by Karl, with none&nbsp;
other than Griggs-thing right next to them. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.720
Griggs-thing needs to do is touch them. Not like&nbsp;
some stupid finger poke, but like a pat on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.480
back of the head, brush against their arm, caress&nbsp;
his cheek slowly, ya know, something subtle.
&nbsp;

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.760
Light touching should be a viable strategy from&nbsp;
everything we know. Every cell in a thing’s body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:30.000
is a thing cell, each thing cell actively seeks&nbsp;
out non thing cells to assimilate and spread to.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.040
One skin thing cell rubbing up against a&nbsp;
non thing cell should cause it to spread.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.360
It is possible that the thing cells do take&nbsp;
some time to recognize non thing cells,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.520
divide via mitosis, and attack foreign cells,&nbsp;
and this may take some seconds. Mitosis in humans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.480
does take around 2 hours to complete. So just&nbsp;
simply brushing against them might not work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.200
even if the thing can perform mitosis and have one&nbsp;
of the daughter cells invade the foreign cells in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.000
10-20 seconds, that would mean Griggs-Thing&nbsp;
would have to hold hands with Olav for an..&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.800
uncomfortable amount of time to infect him. 
This is still a viable strategy for Griggs-thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.760
though, as all he’d need to do is the old spit&nbsp;
handshake. The thing cells in the saliva would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.520
transfer to the human hand and have enough&nbsp;
time to start assimilating. There’s a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.240
of variations to this you could use, if&nbsp;
you just use your sick imaginations.
&nbsp;

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.040
You might not even need to touch them. As we are&nbsp;
all very aware by now, the air that exits your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.720
mouth contains respiratory droplets, which contain&nbsp;
all kinds of cells from your body, including&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.760
pathogens. These droplets containing thing&nbsp;
cells can hang in the air and travel many feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.080
Just being in the same room and talking to them&nbsp;
could infect them with thing cells. If he wanted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.840
to expedite the infection process, Griggs-thing&nbsp;
could also just sneeze in their faces too.
&nbsp;

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.480
Say Griggs-thing did rudely sneeze in their&nbsp;
faces. How would it know they were infected and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.600
turned into things too? For that matter, how do&nbsp;
thing’s know who other things are in general?
&nbsp;

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.120
Things can’t just ask other&nbsp;
organisms if they are things or not,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.760
nor is it possible to visually detect other&nbsp;
things given they are imitating their enemy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.080
They could physically touch each other to&nbsp;
confirm, like slime molds conjoining to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.760
communicate with each other, but that’s&nbsp;
also pretty impractical and overt.
&nbsp;

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.490
My guess is it would be a form of chemical&nbsp;
sensing. Similar to how individual cells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.760
communicate with neurotransmitters and hormones,&nbsp;
so too could things. Part of the assimilation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:43.440
process’s biological alterations could be to&nbsp;
enhance olfactory receptor neurons in the host,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.800
so that it can detect a distinct&nbsp;
odor other things give off.
&nbsp;

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.760
This odor would be undetectable to other&nbsp;
organisms or humans. Similar to how a dog&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.680
might be able to sense whether a woman is&nbsp;
pregnant or not based on hormone production&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.400
causing them to give off a unique odor, even&nbsp;
though we can’t. This means that two things who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.120
were assimilated independently of each other&nbsp;
could be in the same room with other humans,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.840
realize each other are things, then go verbally&nbsp;
conspire against the humans elsewhere.
&nbsp;

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.080
Griggs-thing could just grab both of them and&nbsp;
shove tentacles in their necks, but it’s too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.800
risky that they would make a commotion and get&nbsp;
caught. While it’s cinematic and intense to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.440
grotesque forms to assimilate others, that’s only&nbsp;
necessary once you’ve been made and the victim is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.760
trying to escape, kill you, and warn others. 
The things just need to use the invasion of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.480
body snatchers strategy of blending in as much&nbsp;
as possible, and only announcing your presence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.480
and revealing your attack form when you are&nbsp;
caught or have an overwhelming advantage.
&nbsp;

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.960
While everyone’s autopsying the alien with&nbsp;
their sandwich gloves, breathing in all it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.120
steaming innards, Griggs-thing was in the&nbsp;
break room pouring another cup of joe.
&nbsp;

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.280
This may be a good opportunity to spike&nbsp;
the coffee pot everyone drinks out of with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.280 --> 00:10:03.840
a couple drops of ‘Thing’ blood. Like David&nbsp;
did to Dr. Holloway in Alien Prometheus.
&nbsp;

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.000
You’d have to let the coffee&nbsp;
cool down a bit first,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.080
but if the Thing had blueprints for&nbsp;
thermophiles like it did for cryophiles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:25.120
the thing cells could easily handle 120 degree&nbsp;
temperatures the coffee would be served at.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.840
The cells in the cups would be ingested by&nbsp;
many of the researchers, and within minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:35.040
they’d be thing versions of themselves. This is&nbsp;
an easy way to infect many people at once.
&nbsp;

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.920
Juliette starts feeling woozy from the autopsy&nbsp;
and starts coughing. This is likely a natural&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.040
reaction from seeing Henrik’s corpse and not from&nbsp;
being assimilated. Like we talked about in part 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.720
you wouldn’t know you were being assimilated.
Griggs-thing comes out of the break room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.840
sees Juliette alone in the hallway coughing, and&nbsp;
goes to console her. Griggs is such a sympathetic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.000
soul, consoling everyone who isn’t feeling&nbsp;
good. Griggs-thing patting her on the back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.480
and breathing in her direction might have been&nbsp;
enough to infect her, but it’s not guaranteed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.040
which is why he most likely followed her&nbsp;
into the bathroom to finish the job.
&nbsp;

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.760
Right now Griggs-thing is pretty much taking&nbsp;
people out impulsively based on whoever seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.640
isolated enough. It’s not a terrible strategy,&nbsp;
but it could be better coordinated, especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.640
with its access to Griggs’ memories.
Griggs-thing should be targeting the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.280
who are most likely to and capable of&nbsp;
figuring out what the thing is. Whoever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.200
is in charge of studying the alien is the&nbsp;
priority target, because they will be the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.440
ones to sound the alarms. Griggs-thing would&nbsp;
know that Sander is an arrogant fool.
&nbsp;

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.360
Adam is a docile follower and unlikely to&nbsp;
speak up without Sander’ permission.
&nbsp;

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.360
Which leaves Kate Lloyd as the primary&nbsp;
skeptic researcher and target.
&nbsp;

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.800
She’s the vertebrate paleontologist,&nbsp;
and a human who would understand what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.520
she was looking at under the microscope. The&nbsp;
others are just geologists, climatologists,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:13.520
ecologists, or other unrelated fields. Kate Lloyd&nbsp;
was brought in specifically for this task. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.920
she’s not exactly qualified to research&nbsp;
alien life forms, but she’s the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.320
relevant person for the job apparently?
Really, now that I think about it, why the hell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.720
did they hire her. It certainly wasn’t because&nbsp;
she would keep her mouth shut and fall in line.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.720
There has to be way more qualified and discrete&nbsp;
people they could have chosen instead.
&nbsp;

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.160
I also think it’s worth mentioning that the&nbsp;
things should be communicating what they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.080
know to each other as best as possible.&nbsp;
Griggs-thing should tell Juliette-thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.880
that the dog-thing is on it’s way to another&nbsp;
station, that comms and weapons were sabotaged,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.880
that it was going to try to assimilate Sam&nbsp;
Carter before they make it to McMurdo and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.360
Juliette should try to infect Kate next. 
You don’t want to just infect other people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.040
and have them all doing their own things&nbsp;
which might jeopardize the operation. 
&nbsp;

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.400
Gotta stay coordinated and organized.
Juliette-thing would have communicated to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:09.200
Griggs-thing that when she was in the rec room,&nbsp;
Carter said he was taking Olav to the military&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.240
hospital in McMurdo because he developed some&nbsp;
form of psychological shock from the incident,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.760
and that Carter said he was going to blow&nbsp;
the lid off this whole operation and tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.160
everyone about the alien and spaceship.
This would bring a lot of unnecessary heat and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.600
scrutiny, which makes Carter the primary target&nbsp;
now. Griggs-thing was already consoling Olav, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.560
is clearly closer friends with him. It makes sense&nbsp;
for Griggs-thing to hitch a ride, stop Carter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:38.880
and further infect McMurdo station. McMurdo is&nbsp;
where the C17 transport out of Antarctica is too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.440
so this would be a way off the continent and&nbsp;
into the more populated areas of the Earth. 
&nbsp;

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.720
Meanwhile, Juliette-thing should immediately go to&nbsp;
intercept the secondary target, Kate Lloyd.
&nbsp;

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.520
Juliette-thing apparently had better things to do,&nbsp;
and doesn’t intercept Kate before she examines a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.000
blood sample of the alien-thing and discovers&nbsp;
it’s imitation and assimilation abilities.
&nbsp;

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:09.120
Kate also finds Juliette’s fillings in the&nbsp;
shower. Damnit Juliette-thing. How hard is it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.440
to clean up after yourself? You easily could have&nbsp;
turned the shower on and picked up your fillings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.600
The fuck is the point of imitating your prey if&nbsp;
you leave a mess of your blood, tooth fillings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.160
and metal implants for others to find. Not&nbsp;
only did you fail to intercept Kate, you left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.560
even more evidence for her to become even more&nbsp;
suspicious that something foul is at play.
&nbsp;

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.600
I don’t really get the whole, The Thing can’t&nbsp;
replicate inorganic material plot device.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.880
Thing cells would simply ignore the inorganic&nbsp;
material and only assimilate the organic tissue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:42.000
If the thing cells perfectly replicated a host&nbsp;
organism’s cells, which had already adapted to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.400
the implant or simply didn't care about things&nbsp;
like dental fillings, then the Thing version&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:51.200
shouldn’t be rejecting them either.
In the 1982 movie, Norris-Thing accidentally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.560
replicated a heart defect, which&nbsp;
caused the Thing to have a genuine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.280
heart attack, ultimately exposing it. 
If the Thing replicates the host’s perfectly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.320
and the assimilated human needs&nbsp;
a metal brace to function:
&nbsp;

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.040
Then spitting that metal brace out would&nbsp;
damage the host organism and expose it.
&nbsp;

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:18.080
But even if the Thing organisms do reject&nbsp;
inorganic materials for some unknown reason, it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.640
wouldn’t be that much of a problem if the things&nbsp;
simply cleaned up after themselves. Or re-pierced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.520
their earrings if they had them. Piercings are&nbsp;
literally just a healed hole, it’s not like the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.080
human body or thing would reject it again. 
While Griggs-thing successfully makes it onto&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.160
the chopper, Juliette-thing decides&nbsp;
to assimilate Edvard in secret.
&nbsp;

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.840
Griggs-thing could walk up to the&nbsp;
pilot and co-pilot and start coughing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:45.120
but he decides to stay seated for the flight to&nbsp;
not risk making anyone suspicious. He ‘will’ need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.520
to take Carter out before they land though.
Kate, having discovered the nature of the thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.600
runs outside and flags the chopper&nbsp;
down, and Carter agrees to land it.
&nbsp;

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.520
What should griggs-thing do? He doesn’t&nbsp;
actually know why the chopper is landing. 
&nbsp;

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:07.200
Why would a vertebrate paleontologist and not&nbsp;
the camp leader be flagging the chopper down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.440
It’s possible that Juliette-thing didn’t&nbsp;
intercept Kate in time, and she managed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.000
to figure out what the thing is. It’s also&nbsp;
very possible that it’s just nothing.
&nbsp;

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.760
But considering Carter and Kate are by&nbsp;
far the biggest tattle-tale bitches on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.840
this base and Carter was already itching&nbsp;
to get the word out, combined with whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.440
Kate is up to, it can’t be good.
Crashing the helicopter and stopping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.680
Carter would make all the researchers panic,&nbsp;
but without a functioning radio they will have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.780
to physically go to other bases for help.&nbsp;
Juliette-thing could then infect whomever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.920
is going to the other base for help, and she can&nbsp;
stay and further infect the Thule station. 
&nbsp;

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.160
The problem with crashing the helicopter&nbsp;
is that it's hovering right above the base.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.560
There’s no guarantee that Carter would’ve&nbsp;
steered it into a valley miles and miles away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.880
If it had crashed in the station’s premises, and&nbsp;
everyone discovered that griggs turned into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.200
spaghetti monster, the jig would be up.
Landing the chopper safely and maintaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:02.160
deception might be the better decision. Edvard,&nbsp;
Juliette, and Griggs-thing’s could all focus fire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.480
on Kate and Carter once back at base. Even&nbsp;
if Kate immediately started ranting about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:10.320
the thing cells replication abilities,&nbsp;
nobody will believe her initially.
&nbsp;

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:15.600
So there will be a window of opportunity to infect&nbsp;
them and others at the base. Keeping suspicions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.160
low is probably the best move for now.
Griggs-thing instead opts for option 1 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.520
explodes into tentacles and starts&nbsp;
attacking Olav and the pilots.
&nbsp;

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.440
Luckily Carter flies the helicopter&nbsp;
into a hillside miles away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.520
The researchers attempt to radio for&nbsp;
help, but Colin, the radio operator,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.920
says it’s not working, that it might be the&nbsp;
storm rolling in causing interference. Ah, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:45.920
Griggs-thing did manage to sabotage it. Yah I&nbsp;
know in the movie it actually is a bad storm,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.600
but I like to think it was griggs-thing&nbsp;
executing the plan correctly.
&nbsp;

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.960
The researchers call an all-hands&nbsp;
meeting to discuss what to do,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:58.560
which Kate rudely interrupts with her rants about&nbsp;
alien cells replicating people. Nobody seems to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.960
believe her, nor is willing to spend 5 minutes&nbsp;
checking the blood sample in the lab. 
&nbsp;

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:13.280
Edvard and Juliette-things are just sitting in on&nbsp;
the convo, which must be a bit awkward for them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:18.000
hearing Kate talk about them as a single cell&nbsp;
that replicates the body they are existing in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.560
which was formerly their friend.
Edvard-thing orders the team to drive a snowcat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.440
to Halley station to retrieve Thule stations’s&nbsp;
helicopter which is refueling there, and asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.400
Colin and Lars to join him on their journey.
The radio operator was a good pick, as he won’t be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:37.440
able to stay and fix the radio. If Edvard-thing&nbsp;
can make it to the helicopter at Halley station&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.360
and infect Lars and Colin on the way,&nbsp;
it will open up a lot of possibilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.120
for spreading to the rest of Earth.
There’s no need to bring Juliette-thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:50.000
she should stay and infect the others at the&nbsp;
base. Starting with Kate. It’s only a matter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.920
of time before she comes up with hard evidence&nbsp;
and a way to kill the things. She has to go. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.480
rest will fall easily after that.
Juliette needs to isolate Kate first,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.640
which you would think would be difficult&nbsp;
considering Kate should be extremely cautious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.440
about social distancing when 1 thing cell could&nbsp;
kill her. But Kate doesn’t seem to care. 
&nbsp;

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.000
Juliette-thing uses her memories of where&nbsp;
the snowcat keys are to suggest to Kate that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.480
they should hide the keys. It’s a perfect&nbsp;
proposal, because the key room is isolated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.800
and she wouldn’t suspect that the thing would&nbsp;
propose cutting off travel out of the base. 
&nbsp;

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.280
What Kate doesn’t understand is that the thing&nbsp;
doesn’t need to leave the base right now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.040
it can just assimilate everyone here&nbsp;
then leave at it’s leisure.
&nbsp;

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.720
Juliette-thing finally isolates&nbsp;
Kate, the primary target,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.160
and instead of just shanking her with&nbsp;
a knife covered in your own blood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.000
it opts to needlessly transform into&nbsp;
a giant mouth with a tentacle.
&nbsp;

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:51.120
Very sophisticated attack form ya got there,&nbsp;
I'm sure a lot of thought went into its design.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:56.720
The transformation process is also painfully slow,&nbsp;
and gives Kate every opportunity to run.
&nbsp;

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:01.520
Juliette-thing just blew everything for the&nbsp;
things. Juliette was a bad human to assimilate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.840
as imitating her meant imitating a&nbsp;
brain structure that was unintelligent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.000
She didn’t clean up after herself in the&nbsp;
bathroom, didn’t intercept Kate in time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.080
and then when she finally had the opportunity&nbsp;
to kill Kate she botched the whole thing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.400
gave the humans all the evidence they needed to&nbsp;
become aware of the threat and fight back.
&nbsp;

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.800
She manages to only kill the lowest&nbsp;
threat human in the entire group,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:33.840
Karl, before getting torched&nbsp;
by the flamethrowers. 
&nbsp;

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.880
Well, I guess Griggs-thing didn’t sabotage&nbsp;
the weapons after all. In a last ditch effort,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.360
Juliette-thing remembers the kitchen has&nbsp;
extinguishers and uses them to put the fire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.160
out. But it’s no match for their flamethrowers&nbsp;
that have an unlimited fuel supply.
&nbsp;

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:55.200
Karl might be able to turn into a thing too,&nbsp;
but Juliette-thing massively damaged him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.440
and the humans will burn him before he can heal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.840
There’s actually a deleted scene&nbsp;
where he did heal and ran off.
&nbsp;

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.520
Edvard-thing has to be pissed that Juliette-thing&nbsp;
didn’t wait a few minutes so he could have escaped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.600
with Colin and Lars. Now he’s stuck here&nbsp;
with everyone agreeing to a quarantine. 
&nbsp;

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.600
There should still be a flamethrower&nbsp;
in the shed though. He could grab it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.360
and just roast everyone. The thing has the&nbsp;
element of surprise, and the other humans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:32.160
would hesitate to kill who they think is their&nbsp;
friend. The time for covert assimilation is up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.520
the thing just needs to use the&nbsp;
human’s weapons against them right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.960
After burning them all to a crisp, he’d be&nbsp;
free to leave and infect the world.
&nbsp;

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:44.480
Kate proposes a blood test to verify who is&nbsp;
human. Sander and Adam agree to go set up the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.720
test while everyone else goes to sabotage&nbsp;
all transportation out of the station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.120
Edvard-thing got really lucky that everyone&nbsp;
was stupid enough to split up like this.
&nbsp;

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.160
He needs to find something to&nbsp;
light the lab on fire with.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.960
While perusing the base for flammables, he runs&nbsp;
into Kate and Lars acting shady in a shed.
&nbsp;

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
On Kate, Lars, and Edvard-thing’s&nbsp;
way back to camp, they see Jameson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.400
and Carter arrive out of the blizzard.
Juliette-thing, while dumb and reckless, should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.800
have debriefed Edvard-thing that Griggs-thing&nbsp;
was on the chopper when it crashed. Griggs-thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.360
obviously didn’t make it, but Jameson and Carter&nbsp;
might have been infected. There’s no way to tell,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.760
as sniffing out their sweet sweet thing&nbsp;
pheromones isn’t possible in this blizzard.
&nbsp;

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.680
This could be another ploy to divert&nbsp;
suspicion away from himself, but this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.920
could also be to eliminate what it thinks&nbsp;
are likely just other human threats.
&nbsp;

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:57.200
Jameson and Carter showing up right now is perfect&nbsp;
timing, even better that Kate and Lars split up to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.240
go imprison them until the test is ready. 
Edvard-thing can use this distraction to sabotage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.400
the lab by getting some gas and flares,&nbsp;
waiting for Adam and Dr. Sander to leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.600
then lighting it on fire.
