00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.100
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.029
Today I will show you a Biography, Drama,
History film from 2011 that is based on true

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.099
events, titled Colonia.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:10.720
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.740
Watch out and take care.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.969
Lena is a stewardess and her plane lands in
Chile.

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.840
The pilot and flight attendants are driving
in a van, but it's stopped because the street

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.070
is blocked.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.100
There are protests against inflation and food
shortages going on.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.830
She sees her long distance boyfriend Daniel
and gets out of the van.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.790
He notices her too and walks up to her and
they kiss.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.370
She wanted to surprise him so she didn't tell
him she was coming.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.990
They go to his apartment.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.800
She looks around to see photographs and posters
and says he's been busy.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.170
He says he didn't come to Chile for nothing.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.620
Lena says he has passed the home inspection
but he still needs to be searched and they

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.100
make out.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.740
Later he brings Lena to a meeting of his movement.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.140
He is brought on stage and gives a speech.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.840
He came to Chile 4 months ago, and it has
become his country.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.440
Daniel believes that they all need more solidarity
and that the suffering of many shouldn’t

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.690
be the foundation of wealth for a few.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.530
The crowd cheers.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.420
Next morning he makes breakfast but seems
to have forgotten to put on pants.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.319
She grabs his camera and starts taking photos.

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:14.920
He chases after her and says i love you and
they start kissing.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.950
Later he's developing the photos.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.959
She compliments him on having a great eye
and says they have gotten so much better.

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.880
When they get to bed, Daniel says he can't
believe she has to leave in 2 days and asks

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.329
her to stay with him.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.200
Lena says she can't stay but maybe he can
come back to Germany.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.579
Following morning Daniel gets a phone call.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.240
He is informed that there's been a military
coup, general Pinochet has taken over, president

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.899
Allende supporters are being arrested and
that Daniel’s posters at the university

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.430
were confiscated.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.939
They are coming to his apartment so they have
to leave immediately.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.359
When they get on the street people are being
lined up by the military.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.149
He starts discreetly taking photos of the
chaos.

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.030
A shot is heard and people start running in
panic but the military chase them down and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.200
whack them.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.619
He's still taking photos and starts walking
closer for better shots but gets noticed.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.509
They take his camera and start beating him
as well.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.619
Lena tries to stop them but her attempts are
futile.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.590
They are brought to a stadium.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.189
Daniel says they’re foreign citizens but
is ignored, receives a blow to the stomach

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.310
and is ordered to get in line and stay quiet.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.879
A general informs people that law and order
is being established in Chile and everyone

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.530
who's there by mistake will soon be released.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.900
Soldiers have orders to shoot everyone who
moves or talks.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.410
They are brought to the middle of the stadium
where a chopper lands.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.159
A general and a man with a bag over his head
walk out.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.000
He points out Allende supporters from the
crowd.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.120
The first one gets taken away but the second
voices his support for their opposition and

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.120
is shot.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.629
He gets past Daniel but takes a second look
and tells them he made the posters.

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.250
He is taken to a bus and driven away.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.550
Lena is released from the stadium.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.269
There are dozens of people looking for their
loved ones.

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.579
She gets back to Daniel's apartment and finds
it trashed.

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.659
Lena goes to the Allende supporters looking
for answers.

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.760
They inform her he's been taken to “The
colony of dignity”.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.290
She says they need to get him out but they
state that nothing can be done about Daniel

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.610
and that they're going into hiding.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.730
Daniel wakes up tied to a metal bed.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.780
A man walks in and starts interrogating him.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.140
Daniel says that he's German and is innocent.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.260
The man starts electrocuting him.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.660
He's beaten and tortured by the army until
Pius turns up pretending to be a caring savior.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.000
Pius says that he's here now and there's no
danger anymore so Daniel can relax.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.959
Lena goes to Amnesty International, which
is a global movement to end human rights abuses.

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.260
The man tells her that “The colony of dignity”
is a long established, respectable and government

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.939
approved enterprise.

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.670
He then signals her to keep quiet and they
act like she leaves.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.079
He then starts playing loud music and tells
her he's being bugged and they can talk now.

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.359
He informs her that her boyfriend is in a
cult run by Pius, who ran from Germany after

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.590
World War 2 and has set up a world with his
own rules in the middle of nowhere.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.389
She asks if she could get in, but is warned
that she may never get back out.

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.030
Lena leaves a letter for the pilot saying
that she won't be coming and asks him to cover

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.749
for her and that she will be on the next week's
flight.

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:07.249
She dresses like a nun, takes the bus and
travels south.

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:11.209
When she gets off, the driver instructs her
to walk towards the mountain.

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.510
She walks through the fields and finds a fenced-off
area in the woods with guard towers.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.440
Lena reaches the gate and a hatch opens with
a woman saying, “God bless.”

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.850
She responds with the same and is let in by
a senior cult member Gisela.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.290
She escorts her to a building and asks if
she wants to join them.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.510
Lena says yes and that she wants to follow
the lord.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.170
Gisela takes her passport and other belongings,
throws them in a box, and takes them to another

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.930
room, saying she won't be needing any of them.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.600
As Lena is looking around, a boy leaves a
different room.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.600
She sees him crying and asks if he's alright,
but Gisela comes back and tells her to leave

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.970
him alone because it's none of her business.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.480
A woman takes the kid while telling him to
pull himself together and stop crying.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.480
Gisela tells Lena it's her turn to go in the
room to do a general confession.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.050
She enters and sees the cult leader Pius.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.540
He asks her name and tells her that once she
joins, she must remain and Lena agrees.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.560
He tells her she's attractive and must have
a boyfriend.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.670
Lena denies this and says she wants to follow
the lord but he can see in her eyes and soul

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.300
that she isn't being truthful.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.220
Pius then orders her to take off her apron
and open her blouse.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.270
When she does he declares, “Gray rags on
the outside and instruments of a prostitute

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.270
beneath.”

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.220
He then stands up and smells her while saying
that he can smell the beast of hell.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.050
He goes on aggressively questioning whether
she renounces Satan, sins of the flesh and

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.120
all lies and deceit.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.320
Finally he asks why she's here, to which Lena
responds that she's here for Pius, because

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.610
she needs him.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.110
He thinks she has finally spoken truthfully
and hugs her.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.130
Gisela explains that men, women and children
live separately because it's better for everyone

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.330
that way.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.500
She shows her the women's dorm and instructs
Lena to use a bandage to tie down her breasts

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.620
and take off her shoes because she looks like
a slut.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.240
In the evening the other women return from
work.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.600
Lena greets them but they don't respond and
avoid eye contact.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.680
When Gisela has left a woman next to her Doro
asks if she's from the outside and Lena says

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.680
yes.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.620
Doro starts giggling and asks if she can tell
her a secret and says she may be getting married

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.690
soon.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.180
Lena is confused because men and women live
separately.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.510
Gisela comes back, interrupting their conversation
and starts giving out mandatory pills without

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.500
explaining what they are.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.380
The next day Daniel is being evaluated by
a doctor who is horrified about his condition.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.010
She thinks the electric shocks may have damaged
his cortex.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.140
Pius states that everyone is good for something.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.680
Meanwhile Lena is working with other women
harvesting potatoes.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.290
She gets dizzy and falls on the ground.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.190
Gisela starts whipping her while calling her
a lazy slut.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.660
Lena says she just needs some water.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.390
Gisela brings a bucket full of water, but
Lena is forbidden to drink it and must carry

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.670
it around.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.230
Lena cries herself to sleep that night.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.850
A week has passed.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.170
There's been a schedule change and all women
go to the women's hall.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:58.410
Lena gets a chance to ask Doro about her fiance,
she explains they only met once, 3 years ago

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.840
at the mixed parade and have been in love
since.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.420
Pius is saying a bunch of religious stuff
and the men cheer to his every phrase.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.490
He's trying to resurrect a dead guy.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.070
The women are in the next room channelling
their energy or whatever.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.930
Some guy stands up to the mic and says that
they all heard God's voice through Pius but

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.090
concludes that their wish couldn't come through
because there's too much sin in their community.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.670
They start wailing.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.940
Another month passes.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.990
Daniel, who acts mentally challenged and calls
himself Hans, is brought to a blacksmith.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.510
The doctor tells him that Hans is as dumb
as they come and that he just needs to keep

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.730
an eye on him.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.520
The blacksmith gives him a meaningless task
and Daniel plays the part.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.320
When the blacksmith is gone Daniel explores
his surroundings and manages to get into a

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.490
darkroom and finds a camera.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.720
He gets caught but plays dumb and says he
needs to pee.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.940
While working Gisela pulls Lena aside and
starts talking about the marriage.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.940
Thinking it's common knowledge, Lena mentions
that the groom's name is Deiter.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.950
That night Gisela comes in and takes Doro,
who is crying and struggling.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.970
She forgets to lock the door so Lena follows
to see what they're doing . She looks through

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:05.150
the window and sees all the men in the room,
with a kid singing in front and Doro looking

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.150
distressed.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.430
Pius tells the kid to stop and starts smelling
the air.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.140
He states that it still stinks and that even
the divine singing couldn't drive the devil

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.140
out.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.700
The men agree to everything Pius says and
exaggerate all of his emotions.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.660
Pius asks Deiter what he thinks about this
“ugly stinking cow”.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.970
He looks hesitant but says it stinks.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.470
He's then asked to come up and relieve her
from the stench.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.400
Pius states that it's the demons he smells
and they need to be driven out.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.460
Doro begs for mercy but Pius says “what
we do, we do with love.”

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.219
Dieter starts hitting her and all the men
cheer.

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:38.969
Lena finds Daniel in the crowd.

00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:43.419
Pius then asks the other men to help out Dieter,
but Lena gets noticed and runs back to the

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:44.550
dorm.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.260
Not knowing which of the women it was, Pius
starts beating Gisela for not locking the

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.460
door.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.850
The next day Lena catches Ursel alone and
inquires about Doro’s condition.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:55.920
Ursel says “She’ll survive”.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.220
Lena then asks how to be taken to men's gathering
like Doro.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.530
The women are working the field and Gisela
gets distracted, so Lena runs off and goes

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.130
for a swim.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.640
Later Lena is sent to the men's gathering
for defiling the water with her “stinking

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.790
naked body” but can't see Daniel.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:15.270
Pius explains how all women are full of lies
and deceit and need to be cleansed.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:19.230
The men start the cleansing, but a loud horn
interrupts them.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.160
Daniel has been trying to escape and has triggered
an alarm.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.040
He tries to climb over the fence, but gets
electrified and passes out.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.770
They find Daniel but don't punish him since
they think his brain is fried from the torture

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.410
and he just wandered off.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.020
3 Months pass.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.060
Pius is in the boys dormitory and they sing
to him.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.130
He makes his pick for the day and 3 of them
go shower.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.120
He enters shortly after.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.780
There's a mixed parade and everyone puts on
their best clothes and is instructed to smile

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.470
and wave their flags.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:51.180
As cars are driving through, Daniel finally
sees Lena for the first time after 130 days

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.580
of them both being there.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.060
She asks him to meet at the potato shed at
night.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:59.500
Pius sells the government weapons and offers
torture services, so they turn a blind eye

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.920
to this place.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.450
The general also wants to buy poison gas they
produce but wants to see if it works first.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.570
Pius finally finds a use for Daniel.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.540
Daniel volunteers for guard duty and goes
to see Lena.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.830
He says he's sorry they brought her here but
Lena says she joined up to find him.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:24.170
Daniel explains that they dont hide anything
from him because they think his brain is fried.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.550
Once in a while he allows them to meet to
make children, but takes the kids away from

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:30.800
their mothers at 3 months so they never even
know their parents.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.950
As they're talking he steps on a hatch and
he climbs down to find a lit tunnel.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.910
Gisela comes back for Lena as her shift is
over.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.790
Daniel stays down and explores.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.600
When he finds the room he was tortured in
he gets flashbacks and decides to smash the

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.600
equipment.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.870
The next morning Lena is asked to see Pius
through the speakers.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.830
He rambles about how you can't trust women
with brains because they lose their way easily

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:56.210
and instructs her to spy on Ursel, because
he can smell that she's up to something.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.710
He arranges for them to see each other more.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.320
Lena knows that Ursel hates being here so
they are honest with each other.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.370
Ursel says she was brought to the compound
when she was 9 by her mother- Gisela.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.490
Later that day Daniel is having a medical
examination.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.370
He's drooling and repeats random words people
say.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.080
As he leaves he accidentally drops the cross.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:24.400
Ursel opens it up and finds a photo of him
and Lena.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.830
He also thinks he has found the exit because
it was the only tunnel blocked with steel

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:28.830
bars.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.990
They have to leave tonight because the poison
gas will be tested on him tomorrow.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:36.440
Daniel wants to expose this place so he took
a bunch of photos of the tunnels with the

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.330
camera from the workshop.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.560
Lena says they wouldn't even be here if he
didn’t take pictures in the first place.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.580
They are interrupted by the sounds of Gisela's
tractor and Daniel goes back in the tunnels

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.360
but drops one of the photos and Lena hides
it under a bucket.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.520
Gisela drops Ursel off but she forgot her
knife, so Gisela goes to fetch it.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.220
They start talking and soon learn they both
were told to spy on the other.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.080
Lena asks why Pius is doing all of this.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.140
She thinks it's because he loves power and
the little boys.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.839
She tells Lena that she found the photo in
the cross and knows they are planning to escape

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:10.210
and tells her she is pregnant.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:15.110
Gisela comes back and notices Lena is holding
the same potato, so she tells her to move.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.300
She picks up the bucket and finds the photo.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.340
Pius is interrogating her but Daniel shows
up and says he's the one that found it and

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.690
leads them to the blacksmith's darkroom.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:27.680
They find all the photos in the blacksmith's
notebook, so Pius thinks he betrayed him and

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.630
lets Lena go.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:34.160
Gisela is escorting her back but Lena notices
Daniel in the shadows and manages to hit Gisela

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.460
with a branch.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.540
By this time Pius realizes he's been duped
and everyone starts frantically looking for

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.050
Lena and Daniel.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.930
They run back to Ursel, enter the tunnels
and Daniel cuts the lock.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:50.920
They manage to get outside, but Ursel steps
on a tripwire, gets shot and dies instantly.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.820
Lena and Daniel hitch a ride and manage to
get to the German embassy, where they show

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.290
them the photos.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:00.030
They are given passports but are informed
their flight is only in a week.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.730
Lena calls the pilot and manages to get 2
seats for today's flight.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.290
The lady isn't happy and makes a phone call.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.960
Two diplomats get them into the airport through
an underground entrance and put them in a

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.140
room, saying that they will get them as soon
as boarding starts.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.140
A bit later they see Pius meeting with them
and realize they're locked in, so they escape

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.740
through the window.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:23.020
They run through the airport, get out on the
runaway and drive a baggage cart to the plane.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:27.130
Pius pulls some strings and the tower cancels
their flight permit.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:31.231
After some pondering the pilot takes off and
they manage to get out of Chile.

00:13:31.231 --> 00:13:35.610
The photos smuggled out caused a major global
scandal, but the Chilean government did nothing.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.790
“The Colony of Dignity” was allowed to
operate for 17 more years until Pinochet came

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.720
out of power and Chile transitioned to Democracy.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.720
The End.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.270
Thank you for watching!
