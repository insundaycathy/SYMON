00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.500
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.850
Today, I'm going to explain a horror film
called "The Exorcist."

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.279
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:07.319
Watch out and take care.

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.019
In Iraq, a veteran Catholic priest, Father
Merrin, joins an archeological dig where he

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.850
discovers a small ancient sculpture that leaves
him stunned.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.770
He becomes concerned and disconnected from
the world after finding the artifact.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.250
Strange omens follow him while he's in the
city, such as an antique clock stopping mid-stroke

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.130
in his presence and nearly getting hit by
a horse carriage.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.769
He heads back to the archeological site, feeling
a sense of dread as he faces the statue of

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.369
a demon whose image the sculpture came from.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.600
In Georgetown, Washington D.C., actress Chris
MacNeil writes notes on her script when a

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.660
strange noise catches her attention.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.780
She steps out of her bedroom, following the
sound of crashes and growls around her house.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.249
She checks on her sleeping daughter, Regan,
whose window is open, letting the cold air

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:48.249
in.

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:51.039
Chris closes the window and tucks the girl
under a blanket.

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:57.609
The next morning, Chris asks her housekeepers
Willi and Karl to set up traps in the attic,

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:58.869
believing there are rats.

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:03.379
Later that day, the movie set for Chris' movie,
Crash Course, buzzed with people.

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.369
Chris complains about the script to the director,
Burke Dennings, who calms her concerns.

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.530
In this film, Chris portrays a teacher who's
angered about their school being torn down.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.450
After filming, Chris walks home, enjoying
the scenery and sounds of the neighborhood.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.000
She passes by a church where two priests talk
about feeling lost.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.159
Chris arrives home, learning that she's invited
to a dinner party at the White House from

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.960
her assistant, Sharon.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.020
Regan happily greets her mother and tells
her about riding a gray horse that she borrowed

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.700
from a man by the river.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.369
After Regan steals something from Chris, the
mother and daughter run around the house,

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.369
laughing.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.930
Meanwhile, one of the priests, Father Damien
Karras, is bothered when a beggar asks for

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.560
a donation in the subway.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.509
He visits his elderly mother, who is delighted
to see him.

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.150
Despite her frail condition and Damien's concern,
his mother refuses to leave her apartment

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.299
for a nursing home.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.590
He leaves her with money on the table and
a kiss on her forehead.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.320
At the MacNeil home, Regan presents her handmade
chicken sculpture to her mother.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.069
Chris finds a ouija board in the basement,
which Regan claims she's played with before.

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.249
As Chris is about to touch the board, the
planchette moves away.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.450
She thinks Regan moved it, but the girl claims
that Captain Howdy answers the questions on

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.909
the ouija board.

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.510
Regan asks Captain Howdy if he thinks Chris
is pretty, but there's no answer.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.540
Later that evening, Chris takes away a tabloid
magazine from Regan, with a photo of them

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.540
on the cover.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.860
Chris suggests sightseeing in Washington for
Regan's upcoming birthday.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.989
Regan teases Chris of marrying Burke, but
she insists that they're just friends.

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:30.120
At a bar, Damien drinks with Father Tom, the
president of Georgetown University.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.489
Damien is tired of the job and wants to spend
more time with his mother, hoping to be reassigned

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.540
to do so.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.700
However, being both a priest and a psychiatrist,
Damien is considered the best fit for his

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.840
job, leading Tom to deny his request.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.860
However, Damien questions his faith and believes
that he's unfit for his job.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.330
On Regan's birthday, Chris is furious that
her ex-husband refuses to answer her calls

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.019
to talk to their daughter.

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.290
Regan listens to her argue with the operator
on the phone, disappointed with how her birthday

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.530
has turned out.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.209
That evening, Chris wakes up to a phone call,
asking her to come to work.

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.640
She finds Regan in her bed, who claims that
her bed was shaking, preventing her from sleeping.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.390
Chris leaves the room and hears the noises
from the attic again.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.550
With the light broken, she lights a candlestick
and checks upstairs to find the source of

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.709
the noise.

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.180
Stumbling in the darkness, Chris checks every
corner until she finds a closed mousetrap

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.890
with no rodent in sight.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.110
Suddenly, the flame in her candlelight roars
before snuffing out.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.880
Karl appears at the attic door, assuring her
that there are no rats there.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.319
One morning, a priest brings flowers to the
university church's altar.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.739
He gasps, seeing the statue of Mary crudely
vandalized.

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.370
On another day, Regan goes through various
medical examinations when she sees an ominous

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.810
face in her mind.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.469
She then becomes aggressive towards the doctors
and starts humming in a trance while waiting.

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.069
The doctor tells Chris that Regan is experiencing
a nerve disorder, which he deems normal for

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.170
her age.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.069
He suggests that Regan is depressed over her
estranged father, making Chris worry.

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.530
The doctor notes that Regan swore during his
examination, but Chris hasn't heard Regan

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.290
use such words before.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.140
He recommends giving Regan stimulants to battle
the depression.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.330
Meanwhile, Damien's mother has been rushed
to the psychiatric facility by her brother.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.890
While they wait, his uncle comments how Damien
could've been rich if he chose to be a psychiatrist

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.190
instead of a priest.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.519
On his way to his mother's bed, the other
patients cling to Damien, seeing that he's

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:07.549
a priest.

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.190
When she sees him, his mother starts crying,
thinking that he forced her there.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.310
Damien calms her by promising to take her
home, but she doesn't listen.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.500
Given their lack of money, Damien is unable
to remove his mother from the facility.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.700
One night at the MacNeil residence, Chris
hosts a dinner party, filling her home with

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.040
people in evening attire.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.381
Here she learns about Father Damien, who also
acts as the psychiatric counselor for the

00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:27.600
university.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.590
According to his colleague, Father Joseph,
Damien's mother passed away days ago.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.700
A fight breaks in the kitchen between Burke
and Karl after the director makes racial comments.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.570
Chris carries the drunk Burke out of the door
as the party continues.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.670
The guests gather around the piano when Regan
joins them, telling a man that he's going

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.690
to die before urinating on the carpet.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.230
Chris pulls her away and bathes her, heavily
worried about her child.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.150
After tucking her to bed, Chris heads down
but hears Regan screaming from the bedroom.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.600
Chris rushes to her bedroom and finds the
bed shaking violently on its own.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.310
One evening, Joseph brings Damien alcohol,
listening to his guilt over his mother's death.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.280
While Damien sleeps, he sees visions of Merrin's
experiences in Iraq, then of his mother calling

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.280
to him.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.620
A glimpse of a demonic face fills his vision
as he runs to his mother, who's heading down

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.840
the subway, out of his reach.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.260
Over the next few days, Chris consults with
multiple physicians who assume that Regan

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.030
suffers from a neurological disorder that
may have led to convulsions, hallucinations,

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.610
and personality changes.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.820
But her brain scans present no lesions, leading
them to a dead end.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.640
The doctors rush to their house, where Regan
convulses violently in her bed, tossing and

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.980
screaming for help.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.930
Her eyes turn white, and a monstrous growl
escapes her throat.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.190
When one of the doctors approaches, she slaps
him across the face.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.520
With a demonic voice, Regan screams obscenities
and hits herself.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.260
The doctors pin her down and inject her with
a sedative.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.890
All the while, Chris screams in agony over
her daughter's condition.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.300
Once Regan is heavily sedated, the doctors
share their theories on her condition.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.850
Abnormal strengths are known to happen during
a patient's pathological state, which may

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.310
have been how Regan tossed on the bed abnormally.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.160
But Chris is hysterical, not convinced with
their claims.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.161
The doctors insist on doing another neurological
exam to find where Regan's lesions are, but

00:06:00.161 --> 00:06:01.980
nothing appears in the results.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.410
Out of options, they finally decide to turn
to a psychiatrist.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.610
When Chris returns home from the hospital,
the lights in her house flicker.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.970
The demonic face appears behind her for a
second, but she doesn't notice.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.610
She finds the window in Regan's bedroom open,
causing the room to be cold.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.470
Chris covers her daughter with blankets before
leaving to find Sharon.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.080
Downstairs, Sharon claims that Burke visited
and was supposed to look after Regan while

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.580
Sharon bought medicine.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.280
But Burke is nowhere in the house.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.580
The doorbell rings, and their co-worker, Chuck,
informs them that Burke is dead after accidentally

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.940
falling off the steps outside the university
behind their house.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.470
Hearing this, Chris is distraught.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.780
She turns and watches Regan climbing down
the stairs on all fours, blood dripping from

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:39.780
her mouth.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.550
Days later, a psychiatrist puts Regan under
hypnosis.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.220
Here, Regan admits that there's someone inside
her, and she's afraid of it.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.690
The psychiatrist talks directly to the being
inside Regan, asking it to come forward.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.520
A photo of Regan falls from the fireplace
as she starts growling.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.080
When asked who it is, her face twists in anger.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.910
She grabs the man between the legs and tackles
him down until she's pulled away.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.351
While jogging in the university, Damien is
approached by Lieutenant Kinderman, who's

00:07:04.351 --> 00:07:06.080
investigating Burke's death.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.130
Unbeknownst to the public, Burke was found
with his head backward.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.840
With this and the recent desecration of the
church, Kinderman believes witchcraft, or

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.910
someone who believes in it, is involved.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.940
Kinderman asks if any of Damien's patients
could have done these, but he denies it.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.770
Meanwhile, Regan is taken to a psychiatric
facility for observation, where the doctors

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.810
assume that she's suffering from delusions
that she's possessed.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.440
Chris is adamant about keeping Regan out of
an asylum.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.080
With no other option, the doctors recommend
exorcism to convince Regan that the spirit

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.040
inside her has been defeated.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.490
At the university, Kinderman investigates
the steps where Burke died.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.530
He finds a peculiar sculpture hidden under
the grass at the bottom of the steps.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.820
Climbing up, he spots Regan's window nearby.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.530
After taking Regan back home, Chris finds
a crucifix under Regan's pillow.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.100
Chris asks Karl, Willis, and Sharon about
the crucifix, but they deny putting it on

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.420
Regan's pillow.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.720
They're interrupted by Kinderman, who questions
Chris about Burke's death.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.850
Given that Regan was sedated that night, she
couldn't have seen anything.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.240
Kinderman remains suspicious, wondering why
Burke would leave Regan alone that night,

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.700
only to fall at the university behind their
house.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.590
He wonders if Burke was pushed out of Regan's
window by someone who arrived that evening.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.280
While Chris pours more coffee for him, Kinderman
finds Regan's clay sculptures on the kitchen

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.280
window.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.370
The sculptures resemble the one he found at
the university.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.060
After Kinderman leaves, Chris crumbles down,
wondering if Regan was involved in Burke's

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.060
death.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.020
A crash sounds from above, followed by Regan
protesting against a demonic voice.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.360
Chris opens Regan's bedroom door and finds
items flying everywhere.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.750
Regan is on the bed, screaming in a demonic
voice as she stabs herself with the crucifix.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.370
Chris tries to pry it off her hands but is
overpowered and thrown against the wall.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.870
Sharon and the others rush to help, but the
door shuts on its own.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.349
Chris evades the large cabinet that hurls
towards her.

00:08:42.349 --> 00:08:45.860
The mother cries in agony, watching Regan's
head turn backward.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.620
Driven to the edge, Chris finally meets with
Damien and asks him to do an exorcism on her

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.620
daughter.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.670
Damien no longer believes in exorcism, having
learned psychiatry and the other reason why

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.379
people are driven insane.

00:08:55.379 --> 00:08:59.009
The exorcism would require approval from the
church, which would be difficult.

00:08:59.009 --> 00:09:03.720
He recommends seeing Regan as a psychiatrist
first, but Chris is tired of this approach.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.339
Convincing him, Chris takes Damien to their
home, where he finds the sick, and disheveled

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:08.760
Regan strapped to the bed.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.009
Most of the furniture was removed from her
room, and the bed is covered in foam to prevent

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:13.550
her from hurting herself.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.519
The voice inside Regan claims to be the Devil,
taunting his guilt over his mother.

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:20.279
Damien challenges it by asking his mother's
maiden name.

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:23.230
Instead of answering, the demon vomits green
liquid on his face.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.680
Later that day, Damien looks through Regan's
old drawings for clues while Chris washes

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.160
and irons his clothes.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.470
He warns her that the exorcism may worsen
her condition, but Chris is convinced that

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.980
nothing could be worse than how Regan is now.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.040
Damien still refuses, knowing how difficult
it will be to get the Church to approve the

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.300
exorcism.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.329
He recommends putting Regan in a high-facility
hospital for observation instead.

00:09:42.329 --> 00:09:46.220
Before he leaves, he confirms that Regan couldn't
have known about his mother's recent death.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.800
He walks away thoughtfully, still refusing
to believe that the girl is possessed.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.870
Outside, Kinderman watches him leave the residence.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.439
That evening, Damien listens to old recordings
of Regan's voice, comparing it to the one

00:09:56.439 --> 00:09:57.740
he heard that night.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.420
Days after, Damien records the demon speaking
in Latin and French to send as proof of possession.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.480
The demon writhes in pain when he uses holy
water, speaking in a strange language.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.320
Afterward, Damien speaks to Chris in her office,
hearing that Regan's father doesn't know about

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.560
her condition yet.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.060
He confesses using tap water instead of holy
water, yet Regan reacted to it violently.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.450
Unsure how to convince him any further, Chris
reveals her suspicion that Regan killed Burke.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.970
That evening, Damien plays the recording from
earlier to a colleague, who claims that she's

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.230
speaking English.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.680
Upon playing the recording in reverse, they
listen to Regan talking in multiple voices

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.680
as if arguing.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.470
Then, the voice calls Merrin's name before
Damien is called back to the house.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.740
Sharon lets him in, not wanting Chris to know
what is happening to her daughter.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.269
They look inside Regan's freezing room, where
Sharon unbuttons Regan's shirt from the stomach

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:42.730
and shows Damien the scar that spells "Help
me."

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.480
This convinces Damien that Regan is genuinely
possessed.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.079
He requests exorcism to the church, insisting
that he does it himself.

00:10:49.079 --> 00:10:53.300
Tom suggests Father Merrin, who has experience
in exorcism, perform it instead while Damien

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.730
will assist.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.279
One night, Merrin arrives at the MacNeil household.

00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:59.740
The demon senses his presence and roars.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.060
Merrin refuses to hear Regan's story first
but instead instructs Damien to prepare the

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.130
exorcism.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:07.290
Merrin warns Damien not to listen to anything
the demon says as it will try to distract

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.329
them with both lies and truths.

00:11:09.329 --> 00:11:12.940
Damien suggests three personalities in Regan's
body, but Merrin insists that there's only

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:13.940
one.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.710
They head up the stairs, speaking to the distraught
mother before entering Regan's room.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.880
The demon taunts them as they douse her and
themselves with holy water.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.610
While Merrin prays, the demon spits on his
face and mocks him.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.600
It turns on the bed, being forced to listen
to the prayer.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.360
The demon insults Damien's mother then starts
lifting the bed, making it shake as it growls

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.040
like a rabid animal.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.970
Merrin demands the demon release Regan and
the bed lifts in midair, stunning Damien.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.079
The room darkens, showing the face of the
demon for a second.

00:11:39.079 --> 00:11:42.450
The demon tosses in bed then vomits green
liquid as the two priests put their hand over

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.750
its body, finishing the prayer.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.259
Damien washes off the vomit from Merrin's
scarf and returns it while the demon laughs

00:11:48.259 --> 00:11:49.259
maniacally.

00:11:49.259 --> 00:11:51.120
Merrin coughs, struggling to keep up.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.189
He commands the demon to leave, causing the
ceiling to crack and the furniture to shake.

00:11:55.189 --> 00:11:58.290
Merrin draws the sign of the cross on Regan's
head, and then the demon turns her head in

00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:59.540
a full circle.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.920
The demon accuses Damien of being at fault
for his mother's death as the entire room

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.950
shakes.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.170
The straps on Regan's arms break, and she
floats in midair.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.149
Merrin sprinkles her with holy water as the
two priests command the demon under the power

00:12:10.149 --> 00:12:11.199
of Christ.

00:12:11.199 --> 00:12:13.420
Slowly, she floats back down.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.249
As soon as she's on the bed, Damien takes
the straps and ties her hands and legs.

00:12:17.249 --> 00:12:20.999
The demon knocks Damien off the bed but is
subjugated again by Merrin's prayer.

00:12:20.999 --> 00:12:24.050
The room shakes, causing both priests to fall
to the floor.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.760
In the darkness, they see an image of Regan
stretching out to a demonic figure.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.629
The image disappears, allowing them to continue.

00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:33.470
Merrin speaks to the demon, instilling the
fear of God in it.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.940
When the demon quiets down, Damien covers
Regan with a blanket.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.660
The two priests rest to gather their strength
back.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.750
Damien is baffled at what he saw, frightened
and confused.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:46.240
Merrin explains that the demon likely chose
Regan to make them doubt their faith.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.930
Merrin excuses himself to the bathroom, where
he shakily takes his medicine.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.050
Damien enters Regan's room again and sees
an image of his mother, asking him why he

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.050
left her.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.690
He sits by Regan's side and dabs a cloth on
her sweating forehead.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.949
In his mother's voice, the demon begs him
to release her.

00:12:59.949 --> 00:13:02.839
He refuses to be swayed, checking the girl's
weakened heart.

00:13:02.839 --> 00:13:06.509
The demon continues to pretend to be his mother,
causing Damien to grieve.

00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:10.279
Seeing him weak, Merrin decides to perform
the exorcism on his own.

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:13.720
Downstairs, Chris finds Damien and asks if
Regan will die.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.279
Damien promises that she won't.

00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:18.689
Determined to save the girl's life, Damien
heads back to the bedroom while Chris answers

00:13:18.689 --> 00:13:20.629
the door, where Kinderman waits for her.

00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:24.269
In Regan's room, Damien finds Merrin dead
while Regan sits motionless.

00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:26.990
He attempts to restart his heart but to no
avail.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:30.100
Damien is enraged, hearing the demon giggle
at Merrin's expense.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.949
He tackles the demon down and commands it
to take him instead.

00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:35.600
The demon pulls off the medallion from Damien's
neck.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.369
With the medallion off, Regan's demonic roars
turn to the girl's cries.

00:13:39.369 --> 00:13:41.980
Damien's eyes turn green, signifying his possession.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.690
The demon reaches down to Regan, but Damien
fights for control, sending himself out the

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.450
window and falling into the steps where Burke
died.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.079
Chris and Kinderman storm into the bedroom,
finding the terrified girl crying.

00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:55.839
Kinderman checks outside the window, seeing
students gather around Damien's body.

00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:59.819
Chris, still in disbelief over the events,
realizes that her daughter is back and desperately

00:13:59.819 --> 00:14:00.959
hugs her.

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:03.899
Outside, Joseph finds Damien struggling for
life.

00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:07.800
Mourning for his friend, Joseph says his last
rites as Damien passes away.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.129
A few days later, Chris packs up the house
to leave the city.

00:14:11.129 --> 00:14:14.699
After everything they went through, Sharon
decides to stay behind and quit being Chris's

00:14:14.699 --> 00:14:15.699
assistant.

00:14:15.699 --> 00:14:18.449
She gives Chris the medallion that she found
in Regan's old room.

00:14:18.449 --> 00:14:22.160
Outside, Joseph approaches Chris, who tells
her that Regan doesn't remember anything from

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.550
her possession.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.089
Regan comes out of the house, bearing bruises
on her face but otherwise back to her normal

00:14:27.089 --> 00:14:28.160
self.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.459
Joseph's clerical collar triggers a distant
memory in Regan, leading her to kiss the priest

00:14:31.459 --> 00:14:33.319
on the cheek before leaving.

00:14:33.319 --> 00:14:37.259
The car drives away with the family, but Chris
stops the car to hand Damien's medallion to

00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:38.259
Joseph.

00:14:38.259 --> 00:14:40.379
Instead, he insists that they keep it.

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:43.930
Seeing the family drive off, Joseph passes
by the steps where Damien fell before walking

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.769
back to find Kinderman at the gate.

00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:48.769
Kinderman asks about Regan, glad to hear that
she's doing well.

00:14:48.769 --> 00:15:00.360
The two men walk together, leaving the old
MacNeil house behind.
