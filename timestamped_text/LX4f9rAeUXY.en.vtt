00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.010
Marvel’s Black Widow is FINALLY coming to
theaters and Disney Plus after a yearlong

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.010
delay.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.459
If your memory is a little hazy about everything
Black Widow got up to in the MCU before her

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:14.719
death in End Game, or if you’re thinking
“Wait, spoiler alert, she DIED?!” then

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.700
boy do I have the video for you.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.240
Instead of going back and watching Scarlet
Johanson’s NINE previous MCU appearances

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.270
to prepare Black Widow, this video has got
you covered.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.990
Here’s a full recap of Black Widow’s history
throughout the MCU.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.410
Throughout the MCU we learn of Natasha Romanoff’s
backstory that pre-dates her first appearances.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.660
She was born in Russia and at a young age
was recruited by the KGB.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.660
She attended the Red Room Academy where she
was educated and indoctrinated in spycraft,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.660
eventually leading to her becoming one of
the world’s greatest assassins.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.660
She was forced to do a lot of pretty messed
up stuff at far too young of an age, including

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.660
murdering innocent people.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.660
Her past in the Red Room will haunt Natasha
throughout her time in the MCU.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.660
Eventually, her skills as an assassin put
her on SHIELD’s radar as a threat, so they

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.660
send their agent Clint Barton, aka Hawkeye,
to take her out.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.660
But Clint sees something worth saving in her,
and helps her defect from Russia and join

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.660
SHIELD.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.660
Which leads us to Natasha’s first official
appearance in the MCU...

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.660
Black Widow, aka Natasha Romanoff, is first
introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.739
in Iron Man 2 as a new employee of Tony Stark
at Stark Industries.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.670
In reality, this is all a cover, as she’s
actually a SHIELD agent working with Nick

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.659
Fury to assess whether or not Tony is worthy
of joining the Avengers Initiative.

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:51.489
Spoiler alert: Tony gets the gig!

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.469
Natasha is given a greater focus in her next
outing, the first Avengers movie.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.229
Working alongside SHIELD, Natasha is a key
figure in assembling the Avengers team, personally

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:06.290
recruiting Bruce Banner, and quite literally
beating some sense into a brainwashed Hawkeye.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.260
This movie gives us a lot of backstory on
Natasha.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.850
She earns Bruce’s trust by telling him about
her time as a child spy and recounts with

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.190
Clint their shared history as SHIELD agents,
including an infamous operation that happened

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.820
in Budapest.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.210
Might we get a glimpse of that Budapest mission
in the Black Widow movie?

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.520
After helping to assemble the Avengers and
saving the world from an alien invasion, Natasha

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.390
partners up with Steve Rogers, who you might
know as Captain America.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.310
During Captain America: Winter Soldier, Natasha
and Steve team-up with Sam Wilson, aka Falcon,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.600
to take down the mysterious Winter Soldier
and the villainous organization HYDRA.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.030
Steve has history with the mysterious assassin,
as the man is revealed to be his old friend

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.980
Bucky Barnes, similarly frozen in time.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.960
Like Natasha, Bucky has been brainwashed by
the enemy and is trained to follow orders

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.480
upon the reading of a series of code words.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.590
Natasha has her own history with Bucky.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.920
In her early days as a SHIELD agent, she was
assigned to protect a scientist, but the Winter

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:17.120
Soldier managed to hunt them down, shooting
Natasha in the stomach and killing the scientist.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.100
By the end Captain America: Winter Soldier,
Natasha and Steve have saved the world from

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.480
another major threat, put a serious damper
on HYDRA’s plans and have brought Bucky

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.770
Barnes closer to redemption.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.560
Next up for Natasha is Avengers: Age of Ultron.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.480
It’s here that Natasha’s budding relationship
with Bruce Banner begins to come into play.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.630
As the Avengers are once again assembled to
take on HYDRA, Natasha begins utilizing a

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.100
lullaby to help bring Bruce back down from
his Hulk state.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.490
While hiding out at Clint’s family home,
it’s revealed that Clint’s wife is pregnant

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.830
with a boy that they’ll name Nathaniel,
after Natasha.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.050
Natasha sees the family life that Clint has
and dreams of a similar one with Bruce.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.110
Bruce rejects the idea, as he’s dangerously
violent and can’t have children.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.150
Natasha reveals that she also sees herself
as a monster due to her Red Room training,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.890
and was sterilized to prevent what the Red
Room considered “distractions.”

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.370
Natasha and Bruce find comfort in one another
and debate running away together, but superhero

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.530
duty calls!

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.310
The Avengers travel to Sokovia to battle the
villainous Ultron.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.700
Although they defeat Ultron after an epic
battle, A Hulk-ed out Bruce decides it would

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.569
be better for the world if the Hulk wasn’t
in it, so he flies off to an unknown location.

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.220
With Bruce gone, Natasha decides to help Steve
lead a new team of Avengers, which includes

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.050
Falcon, War Machine, Wanda Maximoff, and Vision.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.489
And that brings us to Captain America: Civil
War.

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.040
Following the destruction of Sokovia in Age
of Ultron, and an unfortunate event in Lagos

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.020
at the start of Captain America: Civil War,
the United Nations, represented by General

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.030
Thaddeus Ross, wants the Avengers to sign
the Sokovia Accords, which would force them

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.930
to abide by stricter regulations and oversight.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.520
The decision over whether or not to sign the
Sokovia Accords fractures the Avengers, with

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.160
Tony Stark leading the charge in favor, and
Steve Rogers leading those who opposed.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.510
Natasha ultimately sides with Tony, feeling
that she should be held accountable for all

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.560
of her past actions.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.900
Tensions come to a head in a spectacularly
awesome way as Team Cap and Team Iron Man

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.810
fight at an abandoned airport.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.810
During the fight, Black Widow lets Steve and
a rehabilitated Bucky escape.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.450
The rest of Team Cap is captured and arrested,
and Tony informs Natasha that the same would

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.870
happen to her due to her letting Captain America
escape.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.780
And so, Natasha Romanoff was now a fugitive.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.380
And now let’s briefly put in a pin in this
Black Widow history lesson.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.410
Because this is apparently the period of time
when the new Black Widow movie takes place.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:49.190
With Natasha on the run following her letting
Steve Rogers escape, it seems that our favorite

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.280
female assassin decides to return home to
Russia for a family reunion.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.460
What happens while she’s there?

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.040
Well, we’ve got to watch Black Widow to
find that out.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.310
What we do know is that she’ll come back
in touch with her sister, Yelena, and they’ll

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.340
be battling the villainous Taskmaster.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:12.060
It remains to be seen what sort of ramifications
or surprises are in store that could affect

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.940
the entire MCU.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.450
But let’s get back to class, shall we...

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.300
After the events of Civil War, Steve drops
Bucky off in Wakanda to fully deprogram him.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.630
Natasha returns from her hopefully super exciting
and entertaining trip to Russia to join Steve

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.780
in rescuing his imprisoned team.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.120
While most decide to return home to their
normal lives, Sam decides to join Natasha

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.400
and Steve on the run.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.389
The trio are off running secret missions for
SHIELD when they get a call from Bruce Banner

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:38.650
asking for their help.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.590
You see, there’s this guy named Thanos who
wants to assemble all of the infinity stones

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.729
in order to wipe out half of the universe’s
population.

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.090
So Black Widow, Captain America, and Falcon
return to join the Avengers in their fight.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.370
General Ross wants the team arrested, but
is dismissed.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.020
The team is back together!

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.810
And with that comes a brief, awkward reunion
for Natasha and Bruce, who have bigger problems

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.500
to worry about than their budding relationship.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.840
Since one of Thanos’ coveted infinity stones
is embedded into Vison’s skull, the Avengers

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.860
head to Wakanda for help in removing the stone.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.900
While there, a rehabilitated and deprogrammed
Bucky rejoins the team as Thanos and his army

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.180
make their attack.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.462
And that’s where our team of Avengers band
together to fight off Thanos and defeat his

00:06:20.462 --> 00:06:22.070
massive army, saving the day!

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.220
...No, Thanos wins and collects all of the
infinity stones, snapping his fingers and

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.560
wiping out half of the entire universe.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.680
Natasha and the remaining Avengers manage
to track down Thanos and make him pay for

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.290
crimes, but it doesn’t change the fact that
half of their friends are now dead, let alone

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.020
half of the entire universe.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.540
5 years pass and Natasha is forgiven of her
crimes and takes over as leader of the Avengers.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.880
While most of the other Avengers are now disillusioned
and scattered, Natasha has hope that things

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.020
will get better.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.259
The Avengers changed her as a person.

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:54.259
They gave her family.

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:55.500
They gave her hope.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.080
Her character is finally coming to peace with
her past and actually forgiving herself.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:06.140
And that hope isn’t misguided, because Scott
Lang, aka Ant-Man, escapes the Quantum Realm

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.180
with a plan to bring back everyone who died.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.110
A time heist.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.750
Natasha helps reassemble the Avengers, including
a newly tatted up Clint, who’s been off

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.930
the grid and exacting vigilante justice on
those he deems deserve it, like the Yakuza.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:26.090
Clint’s entire family was wiped out by Thanos’
snap, but Natasha offers him a chance to bring

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.160
them back.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.160
The plan?

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.530
The Avengers will travel back in time to various
points from MCU past to collect the stones

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.600
before Thanos and use their power to bring
everyone back to life.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.150
The team splits up to travel to various past
times for various stones, and Natasha and

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.530
Clint are tasked with traveling to Vormir
to retrieve the Soul Stone.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:49.371
Unfortunately, the only way to retrieve the
stone is via sacrifice.

00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:50.371
Both Natasha and Clint are willing to sacrifice
themselves to save each other and half of

00:07:50.371 --> 00:07:51.371
humanity.

00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:54.120
They share an emotional goodbye, and both
believe they should be the one to make the

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.120
sacrifice.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.020
They begin fighting in an attempt to save
the other and sacrifice themself.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:03.020
Ultimately, Natasha wins the fight, forcing
Clint to let her go.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.540
Natasha falls to her death, giving her life
to save her best friend and bring back the

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.810
billions of lives lost due to Thanos’ snap.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.479
Due to her sacrifice, Clint receives the Soul
Stone.

00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:17.180
The other Avengers retrieve their own stones,
and with the infinity gauntlet they are able

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.380
to bring back everyone who was lost.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.970
Due to Natasha’s selfless act, the entire
universe was saved.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:28.470
Oh, and Tony Stark sacrificed himself too,
but he’s the only one who gets a big emotional

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:29.470
funeral.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.470
Sorry, Nat.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.470
You deserved better.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.330
And that’s the (current) entire history
of Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.120
Let me know some of your favorite Black Widow
moments in the comments below and feel free

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.880
in the MCU.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.649
As always, thanks for watching and I’ll
see ya in the next one.
