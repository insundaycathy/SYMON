Without further ado, let's just jump&nbsp;
right into the story. Enjoy watching!.&nbsp;

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.200
This movie begins with being shown a beautiful&nbsp;
woman named Needy. Needy is being held in a mental&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.520
hospital. Because he has mental problems and also&nbsp;
quick to anger. While in the mental hospital,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.920
Needy often injured the nurses and the guards&nbsp;
there. She was also often put in isolation. Before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.480
getting sick and being put in a mental hospital,&nbsp;
Needy is a very smart nerdy woman. Although smart,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.640
Needy is also often considered a strange woman&nbsp;
by her friends at school. Needy lives in a small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.640
town called Devil's Kettle, she has a boyfriend&nbsp;
named Chip, and also a best friend named Jennifer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.120
Jennifer is a beautiful and sexy woman. Jennifer&nbsp;
and Needy have been friends since they were little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.560
until now. They are like siblings, so their school&nbsp;
friends think that they are a lesbian couple.&nbsp;

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.680
One day, Jennifer takes Needy to a bar, which is&nbsp;
called Melody Lane. Where, Jennifer's favorite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.720
band will perform. that night they both finally&nbsp;
arrived at the Bar. they both chatted with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.560
the band's vocalist. As Jennifer goes to get a&nbsp;
drink, Needy overhears a conversation from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.000
band members saying that Jennifer is no longer&nbsp;
a virgin. An annoyed Needy then approached the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.400
band members, and said that, Jennifer is still a&nbsp;
virgin. after Jennifer arrives, Needy then tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.120
her that the band members are bad people.
when the event took place, everything went&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.000
normally as usual. Here, Jennifer looks very&nbsp;
happy, because she saw the band she likes in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.640
person. Suddenly, Needy saw a fire appearing&nbsp;
on the stage. Needy and Jennifer immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.520
ran out of the bar. Arriving outside, the two&nbsp;
of them were approached by the band's vocalist.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.280
She's Jennifer to get in her car. Needy tried to&nbsp;
stop her best friend from leaving, but Jennifer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.720
insisted to go, and asked Needy to be quiet and&nbsp;
not to interfere with her business. Needy was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.880
also worried about Jennifer, because she felt&nbsp;
the members of this band was not a good person.&nbsp;

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.400
Then Arriving home, Needy called her boyfriend&nbsp;
named Chip, and told about the fire incident at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.840
the bar earlier. and she also shared that Jennifer&nbsp;
had left with the band's vocalist, making him very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.760
angry and worried. suddenly, a voice came to&nbsp;
Needy's house. Then Needy checked who had come,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.640
it turned out that the one who had come to his&nbsp;
house was Jennifer. Here, Needy feels strange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.680
with his best friend. Because, Jennifer's body&nbsp;
was covered in blood and her face looked pale.&nbsp;

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.920
While in the house, Jennifer eats&nbsp;
raw meat from Needy's refrigerator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.320
After eating, Jennifer threw up a lot of black&nbsp;
liquid like oil. Needy who saw that was very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.240
surprised. after that, Jennifer immediately left&nbsp;
Needy without speaking a word. on the next day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.160
it looks like all the students feel very sad&nbsp;
about the fire that broke out in the bar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.040
which killed many people. On the other hand,&nbsp;
it looks like Needy is still thinking about his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.880
best friend Jennifer last night. not long after&nbsp;
that, came Jennifer who approached Needy fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.440
Needy, who was still confused, asked her friend&nbsp;
about what happened last night, when she came&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.960
to her house in a strange state. Jennifer then&nbsp;
said to Needy, maybe it was just a hallucination.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.880
After school, Needy told Chip everything, If last&nbsp;
night Jennifer came to her house, like someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.160
possessed by an evil spirit. hearing the story,&nbsp;
Chip thought his girlfriend was making it up.&nbsp;

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.960
in a different place, showing Jennifer who is&nbsp;
heading to Jonas who is still sad, because her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.720
best friend died in a fire last night. With her&nbsp;
beauty and sexiness, Jennifer seduces Jonas,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.920
and invites Jonas to go to the forest. Jonas&nbsp;
who was already aroused agreed to Jennifer's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.920
request. and they both went to the middle of the&nbsp;
forest. Arriving in the middle of the forest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.000
Jonas who was already aroused thought that the&nbsp;
two of them would do a cultural performance or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.920
do having sex. However, here Jennifer turns into&nbsp;
a scary figure who then bites and eats Jonas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.880
a teacher who heard Jonas scream then thought,&nbsp;
that Jonas might be venting his sadness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.480
The teacher immediately rushed to&nbsp;
meet him. Arriving in the forest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.800
the teacher was even surprised by the condition&nbsp;
of Jonas who had died in a very pathetic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.960
condition. Jonas's body was seen to be torn&nbsp;
apart and the contents of his stomach came out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.840
On the other hand, after killing Jonas,&nbsp;
Jennifer's face looks more beautiful and sexy.&nbsp;

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.000
The scene also moves to Chip, who is calling&nbsp;
Needy, to meet and talk about Jonas's death which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.440
was very gruesome. Needy was shocked, and said&nbsp;
that the bad things that happened in this city,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.200
are not coincidences. a month after the&nbsp;
fire incident, and also the death of Jonas,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.560
Jennifer's body is seen increasingly disfigured,&nbsp;
her hair is falling out, and her face is very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.120
pale. On the way home from school, Needy's friend,&nbsp;
Colind, tries to get Jennifer to go out with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.480
At first, Jennifer refused. however, after Needy&nbsp;
told Jennifer that Colind was quite handsome.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.400
then Jennifer wants a date with Colind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.200
That night, Colin was seen heading to Jennifer's&nbsp;
house to date her, strangely the place he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.600
visited looked like an empty house that was&nbsp;
uninhabited. Colind arrived at Jennifer's.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.640
Inside her house, Jennifer teases Colin&nbsp;
for a treat. Then, while having sex,&nbsp;

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.680
it turned out that Jennifer used the&nbsp;
opportunity to eat Colind and tore him to death.&nbsp;

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.320
Elsewhere, Needy is also seen who&nbsp;
is having sex with her boyfriend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.840
Then Needy felt that something bad&nbsp;
was going on, and made her unfocused.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.640
Needy then rushed home. and, on the way home Needy&nbsp;
saw Jennifer in the middle of the road covered in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.080
blood. when she got home, Needy then locked the&nbsp;
door of her house and immediately entered the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.000
house, and she thought about Jennifer's condition&nbsp;
that looks strange lately. Then, Needy rushed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.520
to his room. suddenly, Needy was surprised by&nbsp;
Jennifer who was in her room in good condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:23.200
Meanwhile, on the way, Needy saw Jennifer who was&nbsp;
related by blood. Later, Jennifer told Needy about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.880
her current state. It started when Jennifer was&nbsp;
asked to go out with band members a few years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.840
At first, Jennifer thought that she was invited&nbsp;
to having sex. In fact, the members of the band&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.480
invited him to go to the middle of the forest&nbsp;
to perform a devil worship near a waterfall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.040
the band members are satanists. The purpose of the&nbsp;
band members coming to Jennifer's city is to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.600
the body of a virgin girl, to be sacrificed&nbsp;
to the devil so that their band will be more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.120
famous. at first it went well, and the band grew&nbsp;
in popularity. However, when Jennifer becomes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:01.040
victim, the ritual goes awry. And apparently,&nbsp;
Jennifer has not been a virgin since she was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.800
in middle school. Jennifer did not die and&nbsp;
instead the demon resided in Jennifer's body.&nbsp;

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.800
Here, Jennifer is actually dead. But because,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.920
already possessed by a demon&nbsp;
that made her rise from the dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.680
Because Jennifer is dead, Jennifer must eat&nbsp;
a human body, so that she can be beautiful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.402
again. and she also told Needy that the night she&nbsp;
came to her house, was just to scare her. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.402 --> 00:07:20.752
hearing Jennifer's story, Needy felt sad, because&nbsp;
she could not save Jennifer. Jennifer then tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.752 --> 00:07:21.084
Needy that she will hurt Needy, who is her best&nbsp;
friend. and she also added, that when she was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.084 --> 00:07:21.441
full, she would return to her original form to be&nbsp;
beautiful and stronger than before. here, Jennifer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.160
shows Needy when her hand is injured, her hand&nbsp;
will soon heal without the slightest scar. Needy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.840
then asked Jennifer to go home.&nbsp;

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.040
The next day, while at school, Needy goes to the&nbsp;
library to find out what happened to Jennifer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.920
Here, Needy knows that Jennifer has become a&nbsp;
succubus. This Succubus, Requires human flesh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.880
to become stronger. and the way to kill these&nbsp;
succubus, is to stab their heart when they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:49.680
weak. after knowing this, Needy then met her&nbsp;
boyfriend and told him about it. Needy also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.200
asks Chip not to come to the dance party. because&nbsp;
there, Jennifer will find prey for her to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.960
After listening to Needy's story, Chip still&nbsp;
couldn't believe it. and assumed Needy was making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:08.960
up a story. Chip left Needy, disappointed in him.
In story short, the dance party arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.600
Needy set out alone to keep an eye on Jennifer.&nbsp;
After arriving, Needy did not find Jennifer in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:19.440
that place. elsewhere, in Show Chip going to&nbsp;
the dance alone. Chip walks alone to school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.960
Suddenly, Chip is blocked by Jennifer.&nbsp;
She told Chip that Needy had cheated on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.880
Colind without his knowledge. Hearing this,&nbsp;
Chip felt very sad and disappointed in Needy.&nbsp;

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:37.120
Then Jennifer took Chip to a quiet place. When&nbsp;
he got there, Jennifer threw him into the pond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.880
for him to eat. Needy, who is at the dance,&nbsp;
feels her lover is in danger. Later, Needy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.840
rushes to Chip's house. However, Chip's&nbsp;
mother said that Chip had gone to the dance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:55.280
Hearing this, Needy then ran to find out where&nbsp;
Chip was. Not long after, Needy managed to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.960
Jennifer who was eating Chip's body. Needy,&nbsp;
who saw this, immediately tried to save him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.160
Soon after that, Jennifer was caught off&nbsp;
guard, then was stabbed by Chip which made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:12.000
Jennifer hurt and ran away from them. Chip&nbsp;
who lost a lot of blood was finally died.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.800
Needy is also sad to get ready to find Jennifer&nbsp;
and take revenge for her boyfriend's death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.280
After Needy found Jennifer, a fight&nbsp;
broke out between these two friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.680
Then, Needy stabbed her best&nbsp;
friend in the heart, killing her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.480
Instantly, Jennifer's mother who heard the&nbsp;
noise in Jennifer's room came to her room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.040
Jennifer's mother looks shocked to see&nbsp;
Jennifer died at the hands of Needy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:48.160
Then, Needy was taken to a mental hospital. in&nbsp;
the end, we are shown that Needy can fly. Because,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.320
Needy got a bite wound from Jennifer&nbsp;
which made Needy have some demonic powers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.880
Needy uses her powers to get out of the mental&nbsp;
hospital. Then, Needy rushes to find the band&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.840
members at the beginning of the movie, and&nbsp;
