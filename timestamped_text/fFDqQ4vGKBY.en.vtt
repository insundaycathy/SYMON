00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.080
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m&nbsp;
going to explain a fantasy film called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:15.920
“Miss Peregrine's home for peculiar children,”&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.640
At the beginning of the movie, we see a teenager&nbsp;
named Jake Portman working in a grocery store.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.080
Jake gets a call from his dad, asking him to be&nbsp;
at his grandfather Abe’s home. Abe is a patient&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.920
with dementia and needs to be taken care of at all&nbsp;
times. His co-worker offers to give him a ride.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.480
When he reaches home, he sees his grandfather&nbsp;
missing. Jake and his co-worker go around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.400
looking for him. After a while, he finds Abe&nbsp;
on the ground with both his eyeballs missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.080
Before Jake can react, Abe grabs his hand,&nbsp;
asking him to go back to September 3rd, 1943,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.560
using a postcard and meet a bird. Suddenly&nbsp;
Abe stops talking and takes his last breath.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.400
Jake freezes in shock. Just then, he&nbsp;
notices a massive monster in the dark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.040
The monster goes away when his colleague&nbsp;
accidentally shoots in his direction. 
&nbsp;

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.160
Although Jake believes that Abe’s final words were&nbsp;
just gibberish, the monster he saw that day has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.400
a huge impact on his mental health. It is now a&nbsp;
month after Abe’s death. Jake has started going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.920
therapy. He tells his therapist about stories Abe&nbsp;
used to tell him when he was a child. Abe always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.200
talked about a home for special children somewhere&nbsp;
in Cairnholm, an island off the coast of Wales.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.840
The home was run by a strict but caring lady named&nbsp;
Peregrine, who could turn into a bird. There lived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.600
children with unique qualities, the ones who&nbsp;
didn’t fit in the normal society, like Bronwyn and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.480
Victor, who had superhuman strength, Hugh, who had&nbsp;
bees living inside him, and Emma, who could float.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.680
Abe even had pictures of the children he talked&nbsp;
about. Jake believed his stories for years until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.160
he talked about them in a middle school class&nbsp;
presentation. His classmates made fun of him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.400
for believing such absurd ideas. So Jake angrily&nbsp;
accused Abe of lying, and from that day onwards,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.880
Abe never mentioned the children home. The&nbsp;
therapist thinks that Jake is having a hard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.080
time separating Abe’s fantasies from reality. That&nbsp;
is why he hallucinated the monster that day.
&nbsp;

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.840
Later, when Jake returns home, his aunt gives&nbsp;
him a book she had found in Abe’s belongings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.800
Inside the book is a postcard that has Miss&nbsp;
Peregrine’s name and the children’s home address&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.400
written on it. Jake shows it to his therapist in&nbsp;
the following session. She suggests he visit the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.920
place so he and Abe can have a proper closure.&nbsp;
The very next day, Jake and his father leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.280
for Wales. The two finally reach the town&nbsp;
and check into an old hotel. Jake goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.920
the children’s home to find it fully destroyed.&nbsp;
When he returns, a man tells him that in 1943,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.640
a Nazi missile landed on the children’s home&nbsp;
and destroyed it, killing everyone inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.000
The following day, Jake goes back to the&nbsp;
home and looks around when suddenly, a girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.360
appears in front of him. Startled, he starts&nbsp;
to run, falls down, and goes unconscious. 
&nbsp;

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.040
When he regains consciousness, he is being carried&nbsp;
by Bronwyn, the girl from his grandfather’s story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.200
who has superhuman strength. He sees other&nbsp;
characters from the story in front of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.960
Jake is shocked but delighted to see that the&nbsp;
stories are true. Emma, the girl who can float,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.840
tells Jake that they are sent by Miss Peregrine&nbsp;
to bring him into the loop. They take him inside a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.600
cave, but Jake gets nervous and runs back to his&nbsp;
hotel. There, he comes across unfamiliar faces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.800
who ask him who he is. It turns out that after&nbsp;
entering the cave, he traveled back in time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.200
to September 3, 1943. The people in the hotel&nbsp;
think that he is a spy and are about to kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.440
him when the children from earlier save&nbsp;
him. They take him to the children’s home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.280
where he finally meets Miss Peregrine. Inside, a&nbsp;
girl named Olive is boiling tea with her hands,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.680
showing that she can create fire with them. Miss&nbsp;
Peregrine reveals to him that the children's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.360
home was established to accommodate people born&nbsp;
with unique qualities called the peculiars. 
&nbsp;

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.040
Such unique qualities are acquired as recessive&nbsp;
genes and can show itself in any generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.440
Children’s homes like this are spread throughout&nbsp;
the world to protect the peculiars from normal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.600
people. Every children's home is run by a breed of&nbsp;
peculiar called the Ymbrynes. Ymbrynes can freeze&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.520
time and repeat it, and also shapeshift into&nbsp;
birds. Hence, Miss Peregrine, being a Ymbryne,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.880
resets the time every day. The people of the&nbsp;
children's home have been re-living September 3rd,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.560
1943, for as long as they can remember. Abe used&nbsp;
to live in the children’s home when he was little,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.120
and the children Jake met earlier were his&nbsp;
grandfather’s friends. Since they lived in a loop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.680
they haven’t aged. Jake is shocked at the&nbsp;
revelation. He asks Miss Peregrine what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.560
Abe’s power was, but she dismisses him.
While roaming around the house, Jake meets a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.000
peculiar named Enoch, whose ability is that he can&nbsp;
make the dead people and inanimate objects come to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.280
life as his puppet. At supper, it is revealed&nbsp;
that Abe left the children’s home to join the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.720
army. He also finds out that Emma used to be in&nbsp;
love with Abe when he was around. After that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.320
everyone sits down to watch a movie. A peculiar&nbsp;
named Horace can project his dreams onto the wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.760
and can also dream of the future. They watch&nbsp;
Horace’s dream like a movie. After the movie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.680
everyone goes outside to watch Peregrine reset&nbsp;
time. Jake watches in awe as she stops the missile&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.640
from being dropped in the house and resets&nbsp;
the time to September 3rd again. Jake then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.280
finds a letter written to Miss Peregrine by his&nbsp;
grandfather and keeps it with him. Emma takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.800
Jake to the cave to get him out of the loop.&nbsp;
As they walk, an injured Ymbryne bird lands in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.840
front of them. Emma takes the bird and goes back&nbsp;
to the house as Jake comes out of the loop. 
&nbsp;

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.160
When he is back in the hotel, Jake reads&nbsp;
the letter he had stolen. In the letter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.480
Abe warns Peregrine of someone named Barron, who&nbsp;
has been trying to harm peculiars of another loop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.120
The following day, Jake’s dad takes&nbsp;
him to a beach to watch birds. There,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:05.280
they meet an Ornithologist named John. Jake’s dad,&nbsp;
who watches birds as a hobby, is annoyed by John,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.960
so they return to the hotel. Jake waits for his&nbsp;
father to fall asleep and goes back into the loop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.920
He asks Miss Peregrine about Barron. But Miss&nbsp;
Peregrine is mad at him for being intrusive and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.440
doesn’t answer his question. Enoch takes him to&nbsp;
a peculiar named Victor, but Jake is shocked to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.880
see Victor’s dead body lying on a bed. Then,&nbsp;
Enoch places a heart into his body and makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:33.120
him his puppet, demonstrating his power. When they&nbsp;
later go on a walk, he asks Emma about Barron. 
&nbsp;

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.000
To answer his question, Emma takes him under&nbsp;
the sea and into the remains of a shrunken ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.600
She uses her power to manipulate air and makes&nbsp;
the chamber water-free. She then hands him a box&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.120
and claims that it belonged to Abe. Inside is a&nbsp;
map of every loop of the world and pictures of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:56.080
some peculiars. One of them is Barron, the leader&nbsp;
of a group of bad peculiars called the Hollows.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.800
She tells him that Abe left the children’s home&nbsp;
to hunt them, but couldn’t. Hollows look for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.800
peculiar kids and kill them. Only Peregrine knows&nbsp;
what their real motive is. Emma then takes Jake to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.560
watch Peregrine killing a monster, similar to the&nbsp;
one Jake saw when Abe died. Emma says that no one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.240
other than Abe and Jake can see the monster. Even&nbsp;
Peregrine is using her time manipulation skills to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:25.360
kill it. It turns out that Jake is also a peculiar&nbsp;
like his grandfather, and both their skill is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.440
they can see the invisible monsters. 
When they are back in the children's home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.560
Peregrine tells Jake about Hollows and their&nbsp;
origin. Hollows were regular peculiars who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.640
were tired of living in loops. They believed&nbsp;
that harnessing the essence of Ymbryne’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.040
powers would make them immortal, and they&nbsp;
could live outside the loop without aging.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:48.640
So, they abducted a Ymbryne and conducted an&nbsp;
experiment. However, the experiment failed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.600
turning the Hollows into invisible monsters.&nbsp;
To go back to their human form, they had to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:59.680
feed on peculiars’ eyes. Hollows started abducting&nbsp;
peculiar children for their eyes. Barron and some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.200
of his friends regained their human forms, but&nbsp;
their eyes remained milky white. Some monsters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.720
are still looking for children’s eyes to feed on.&nbsp;
As she completes telling the story, Miss Avocet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.760
regains consciousness. She is the Ymbryne&nbsp;
that Emma had found in the cave earlier.
&nbsp;

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.320
Miss Avocet tells them that the children’s&nbsp;
home she was a caretaker of has been completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.040
destroyed by the monsters who killed all her&nbsp;
children for their eyes. Barron is planning to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:31.520
conduct the experiment again, this time by using&nbsp;
more Ymbrynes. His next target is Peregrine’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.240
children’s home. Hearing this, Miss Peregrine&nbsp;
quickly asks the kids to pack their bags.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.040
She wants to change the loop so they can be&nbsp;
safer. Emma asks Jake to come with them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.240
the other loop. However, Jake denies it and&nbsp;
goes back to the island, exiting the loop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.120
When he reaches the beach, he sees a crowd&nbsp;
gathering around a dead body. His dad and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:57.280
Ornithologist John are there too. Jake notices the&nbsp;
dead body’s eyes have been taken. He realizes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.720
the Hollows are already here and runs towards the&nbsp;
cave to warn Miss Peregrine. John offers Jake’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:08.320
dad to bring him back and follows him. He enters&nbsp;
the cave behind Jake. It is revealed that John&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.280
is actually Barron, who has been using his&nbsp;
shapeshifting abilities to disguise himself. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.880
reveals that he also disguised as Jake’s therapist&nbsp;
to get Jake to the island and find the location&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.960
of the loop through him. He then threatens&nbsp;
Jake to take him to the children’s home.
&nbsp;

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.000
Miss Peregrine is shocked to see Barron at&nbsp;
her door. With no way out, she offers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.440
go with Barron if he leaves the children out of&nbsp;
this. After the two leave, Miss Avocet and Jake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.720
close all the doors and windows to the house and&nbsp;
gather weapons. Since Barron knows where they are,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.880
he can send his monster friends to hunt&nbsp;
the children for their eyes. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:48.400
an invisible monster attacks Miss Avocet when&nbsp;
Jake is not around. It kills the poor lady but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.920
is injured by Jake right after. Everyone then runs&nbsp;
to the attic and escapes through a tree branch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.480
Since Peregrine is not here to restart the&nbsp;
loop, the day changes to September four, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:04.480
the nazi missile drops on the house. Thankfully,&nbsp;
everyone is safe. When they are out of the loop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.360
they plan to go to the black loop, where Barron&nbsp;
is conducting the experiment using Miss Peregrine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.080
and the other Ymbrynes. They get on a ship&nbsp;
and continue the journey using Abe’s map.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.800
They finally get to a carnival. Jake and Emma&nbsp;
enter the black loop, which takes them back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:26.000
to 2016. They see Barron, his friends, and some&nbsp;
monsters inside. Jake uses Emma to provoke Barron,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.240
making him send the monsters and two of&nbsp;
his men outside to kill the children. 
&nbsp;

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.640
But the children have already planned a way&nbsp;
to defeat them. They throw snow at those men,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.760
revealing the shape of the monsters. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
Enoch makes a bunch of skeletons his puppets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.960
and sends them to fight the monsters. Then, the&nbsp;
children make their way to Barron and his friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.680
They fight them using their unique powers and&nbsp;
manage to defeat everyone except for Barron.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.760
Jake releases the Ymbrynes from the cages,&nbsp;
including Miss Peregrine, but they cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:59.200
help him since they are injured. Now, Barron and&nbsp;
Jake stand face to face when suddenly, Barron&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.880
shapeshifts into Jake. Emma and Enoch come inside&nbsp;
and are confused about which is the real Jake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:10.240
They point a crossbow at them, as both try to&nbsp;
prove they are the real Jake. Just then, a monster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.680
enters the room. Jake sees it and informs the two.&nbsp;
The monster mistakes Barrow for Jake and attacks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:19.520
him, sucking his eyes and killing him. Finally,&nbsp;
Jake kills the monster, and everyone is safe. 
&nbsp;

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.960
Before the time loop closes, Jake says goodbye&nbsp;
to the children as they exit and return to their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:32.400
ship in 1943, while he stays in 2016. Jake travels&nbsp;
to his home in Florida to see Abe is still alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.600
It turns out Barron's death at the beginning&nbsp;
of 2016 erased his presence in Florida later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:43.120
on. Jake is delighted and tells Abe everything&nbsp;
that has happened. Abe asks Jake to go back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.080
Emma as she is waiting for him. Jake takes&nbsp;
his advice and travels the world, going into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.600
many loops to look for Emma and the others. He&nbsp;
finally finds them on the ship, still traveling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.880
Jake tells Emma that he loves her and the two&nbsp;
