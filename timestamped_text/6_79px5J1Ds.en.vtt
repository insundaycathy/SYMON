00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.600
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm&nbsp;
going to explain an adventure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.080
drama, horror film called "High Life."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.000
Inside a space station, a baby named Willow&nbsp;
plays by herself in her makeshift playpen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.120
Her father, Monte, talks to her via the speakers&nbsp;
while he's making repairs outside the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.200
Willow continues to babble, distressed when&nbsp;
the movie playing on her screen ends. Her cries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.040
grow louder, blaring inside Monte's spacesuit,&nbsp;
causing him to drop his wrench out of reach.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.400
Monte freezes, staring blankly into space as one&nbsp;
of his only tools in the space station disappears.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.560
He snaps out of it when&nbsp;
Willow starts babbling again.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.360
Willow watches from the screen as her father&nbsp;
enters the airlock room and removes his spacesuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.640
Monte gathers vegetables from the garden&nbsp;
and makes baby food to feed Willow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.240
As the day goes on, Monte focuses&nbsp;
on caring for the child on his own.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.680
He is troubled when the lights go out in the&nbsp;
hallway but is thankful when the power comes back.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.440
The day continues with Monte&nbsp;
talking to the baby as he cleans up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.600
He rambles on about recycling their waste then&nbsp;
tries to teach her the word taboo. Monte wonders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.960
what his father would think of him now, noting&nbsp;
that Willow has broken the laws of nature.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.680
As Willow sleeps, Monte sings her a song&nbsp;
softly, feeling her breath and heartbeat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.840
The lights turn red, and an alarm blares from&nbsp;
afar. Carefully, Monte gets up and leaves.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.120
In a control room, Monte records his progress&nbsp;
on the computer. He reports the repairs he made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.880
to the station and that he and Willow are in&nbsp;
good health. The computer receives a response&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.800
that his clearance is granted, allowing their&nbsp;
life support to continue for another 24 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.400
Finally, the power turns back on in&nbsp;
the station, and the alarm stops.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.920
Relieved yet tired, Monte enters the morgue and&nbsp;
unzips a bag, revealing a blonde woman inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.600
He zips the bag up again and removes it&nbsp;
from the table. He then starts moving all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.080
the bodies inside and dressing them in spacesuits.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.560
One by one, he carries the bodies and&nbsp;
releases them into space. Once all are gone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.600
he stares into the void, letting go of&nbsp;
the past that brought him to where he is.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.680
Monte turns back, seeing the&nbsp;
only other spacesuit left inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.960
He imagines a red-headed woman wearing&nbsp;
a spacesuit, floating in the room as if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.280
inviting him to join her. On his knees, Monte&nbsp;
weeps, fighting to push down the thoughts.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.440
Monte heads back to the morgue, staring&nbsp;
at the empty room as Willow cries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.280
He logs the deactivated cryogenics in the&nbsp;
control room before comforting the baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.280
Broken and overwhelmed, Monte begs&nbsp;
Willow to stop crying. Once she's calm,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.360
Willow pokes at a scar on Monte's arm, leading him&nbsp;
to remember the doctor who tended to him before.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.480
Once Willow is asleep, Monte ponders over their&nbsp;
situation. He is alone with the child in space,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.360
with no hope of ever returning&nbsp;
to Earth. With those in mind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.360
he entertains the idea of ending both their lives.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.560
Monte heads to the control room, staring at the&nbsp;
computer that plays a video of a boy at the beach.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.000
Monte has grown tired of the footages of&nbsp;
life on Earth, seeing it as a virus that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.120
drives him insane. He heads for the&nbsp;
infirmary and searches the medicine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.360
cabinet. When he finds an empty bottle, he&nbsp;
throws it against the wall in frustration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.800
Next, he finds another bottle and spills&nbsp;
its contents in his hand but places them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.360
back in the bottle, leaving only one. Finally,&nbsp;
Monte decides against his plan to end it all.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.920
Since the space station left the solar system,&nbsp;
Monte hasn't been able to contact Earth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.960
even though he receives the videos&nbsp;
from Earth. He wonders if the videos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.960
were programmed to make them&nbsp;
think they can still return.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.000
When Monte sleeps, he dreams about his childhood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.520
when he found his dog dead in the river banks&nbsp;
with his friend running away from the scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.640
Not long after, his friend was&nbsp;
found dead, bearing a head wound.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.720
Back on Earth, a woman interviews a&nbsp;
professor who expresses his disdain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.080
about death row inmates being sent&nbsp;
to outer space to be experimented on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.440
He believes it's inhumane, notably that&nbsp;
the government doesn't inform the inmates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.880
that they have no chance of returning to&nbsp;
Earth. It also takes years for Earth to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.160
receive the report sent from these space&nbsp;
stations, thus barring any communication.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.480
In the space station, Monte happily&nbsp;
teaches Willow how to walk. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.840
seeing his daughter grow, he starts to remember&nbsp;
his former companions in the space station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.080
He remembers the red-headed woman, Boyse,&nbsp;
fondly, imagining her previous life on Earth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.400
hitchhiking on a train with friends. He thinks&nbsp;
she was happy, despite living a poor lifestyle.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.040
Before the space station, he and the rest&nbsp;
were considered scums of society on Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.680
Most of them were death row&nbsp;
inmates or serving a life sentence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.720
so when they were given the opportunity&nbsp;
to serve science instead, they agreed.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.840
In the third year after the ship left Earth,&nbsp;
Monte stops Boyse from vandalizing the wall. Their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.560
quarrel leads to a fight that ends with Boyse&nbsp;
slicing his arm. In retaliation, he punches her.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.440
They're both taken to the&nbsp;
infirmary, where Dr. Dibs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.360
stitches up Monte's arm. Boyse accuses Dr. Dibs&nbsp;
of knowing that they will never return to Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.240
Dr. Dibs notes that their lives&nbsp;
had improved in the space station,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.000
compared to how they were on Earth. Boyse sits&nbsp;
beside her friend, Elektra, and berates Dr. Dibs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.600
that their experiments to have a successful birth&nbsp;
outside the solar system will only kill them.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.680
As part of the experiment, Dr. Dibs takes&nbsp;
samples from the male inmates in exchange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.120
for recreational pills. However,&nbsp;
Monte doesn't take part in this.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.040
The ship's pilot, Nansen, questions why Dr. Dibs&nbsp;
bothers with it, as all babies produced there die&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.840
from radiation. She asks Dr. Dibs what happens if&nbsp;
she's successful, but the doctor doesn't answer.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.640
Later on, Dr. Dibs heads down the engine room&nbsp;
and into a closed, private room called "The Box."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.800
There, she undresses and uses a device&nbsp;
inside for an intimate time by herself.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.280
After the event, Monte sees her coming out&nbsp;
of the Box, questioning if it is suitable for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.120
her to go there. She assures him that&nbsp;
it does. Dr. Dibs knows that all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.240
inmates think of her as a witch, but Monte&nbsp;
compliments her to make her feel better,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.200
though he doesn't understand why she's&nbsp;
still obsessed with the experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.240
After she leaves, an inmate named Ettore&nbsp;
goes inside the Box for his own pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.920
Monte refuses to use the Box, as he has&nbsp;
chosen abstinence to make himself stronger.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.920
In the garden, Monte tends to the plants with his&nbsp;
friend, Tcherny. Monte enjoys being in the garden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.000
since it reminds him of home. Tcherny hopes his&nbsp;
son is living a better life on Earth than he is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.520
then asks Monte about his family.&nbsp;
Monte replies that he only had his dog.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.760
The whole crew watches the stars getting&nbsp;
farther from the ship's window. Even though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.160
it seems that the ship is moving backward, they&nbsp;
are moving forward at 99% the speed of light.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.840
Unfortunately, their speed causes the space&nbsp;
around them to warp, which bothers Monte.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.440
One day, Dr. Dibs discovers that&nbsp;
the ship's captain, Chandra,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.520
has developed leukemia due to&nbsp;
radiation. Monte is thankful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.320
for having good genes that prevent him&nbsp;
from getting affected by the radiation.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.400
Other than the fertility experiments, part&nbsp;
of the group's mission is to harvest energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.600
from a black hole that could provide&nbsp;
humanity an infinite energy resource.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.840
With their journey reaching its midpoint, the&nbsp;
crew prepares for the ship's deceleration. Monte&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.840
helps strap his companions to their seats, with&nbsp;
Boyse being protective over the pregnant Elektra.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.560
Days after the deceleration, Ettore&nbsp;
makes a move on Nansen, who rejects him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.720
He checks the hallway and watches Dr. Dibs and&nbsp;
Chandra flirt, touching himself as they do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.960
When Dr. Dibs refuses Chandra, Ettore&nbsp;
disappointedly goes back into his room. With&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.800
the uncomfortable situation with his roommates,&nbsp;
Tcherny decides to sleep in the garden instead.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.080
In the other room, Boyse takes out supplies&nbsp;
she took from the clinic while Mink keeps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.560
watch by the door. Elektra mocks Boyse as she&nbsp;
attempts to undo Dr. Dibs' insemination on her.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.600
Weeks later, Elektra dies after giving birth,&nbsp;
and her baby soon dies due to radiation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.800
The inmates gather as Dr. Dibs&nbsp;
seals Elektra's body in the morgue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.760
Boyse is upset and angered, blaming&nbsp;
Dr. Dibs for her friend's death.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.760
Chandra suffers a stroke just as the&nbsp;
alarms blare. Chandra needs to input&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.280
the report to sustain their life support&nbsp;
but is not in the condition to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.680
So instead, Dr. Dib slices his finger to take the&nbsp;
captain's transceiver to input the report herself.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.120
Later that day, Monte collects&nbsp;
Boyse and Mink from the garden,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.000
telling them it's almost lights&nbsp;
out. Boyse looks at him fondly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.040
then starts singing, mocking him, but&nbsp;
her face saddens as the song ends.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.200
Chandra becomes bedridden after&nbsp;
his stroke. Dr. Dibs comforts him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.000
massaging his legs to prevent atrophy. But Chandra&nbsp;
refuses to live with his body as his prison.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.280
As he wishes, Dr. Dibs euthanizes him&nbsp;
and stays with him until he's gone.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.040
One night, Ettore enters the girl's room, staring&nbsp;
at Boyse as she sleeps. He removes her blanket and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.240
begins touching her. Boyse wakes up, screaming&nbsp;
in protest. Mink wakes up, but Ettore punches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.160
her until she's knocked down. Nansen goes&nbsp;
in to pull him off, but Ettore beats her.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.360
Boyse and Mink are unable to escape, strapped to&nbsp;
their beds. Monte and Tcherny hear the commotion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.600
and help the girls. Monte continuously beats&nbsp;
Ettore until Tcherny pulls him away, letting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.920
the injured man out of the room. Once freed,&nbsp;
Mink stabs Ettore in the face with broken glass.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.640
After the event, Dr. Dibs checks on&nbsp;
Boyse, confirming that she isn't pregnant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.960
Boyse is determined not to have kids. She&nbsp;
asks Dr. Dibs if she truly suffocated her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.520
children and husband, thus&nbsp;
earning her life sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.400
Dr. Dibs admits that she attempted&nbsp;
to end her life after the tragedy.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.640
Due to the altercation with Ettore, Dr. Dibs&nbsp;
doubles the inmates' sedatives to keep them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.400
calm and sleep through the night. While the&nbsp;
inmates are asleep, Dr. Dibs checks on their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.120
rooms one by one then stops at Monte's. When she&nbsp;
notices that Nansen is still awake, she urges the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.080
woman to sleep. Instead, Nansen pretends to sleep&nbsp;
but watches as Dr. Dibs climbs into Monte's bed.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.960
Dr. Dibs expresses her fondness for him, being&nbsp;
the only one who doesn't want anything from her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.040
With him fully sedated, Dr. Dibs takes&nbsp;
advantage of him then collects his fluids.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.640
She secretly inseminates Boyse while she's&nbsp;
passed out, praying for a child to be conceived.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.240
Months later, Boyse successfully&nbsp;
gives birth to a baby girl,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.160
but the new mother becomes depressed after&nbsp;
being an unwitting part of Dr. Dibs' experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.880
On the other hand, Dr. Dibs is&nbsp;
delighted for a healthy baby.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.240
Years later, Willow has grown into a teenager.&nbsp;
Monte wakes up, finding her in his bed after she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.200
struggles to sleep. He scolds her, and Willow&nbsp;
climbs back to her bed. After she does so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.720
Monte looks down on the bed, seeing bloodstains&nbsp;
that suggest she's reached womanhood.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.480
Willow confesses to having read his records&nbsp;
that say he killed his childhood friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.560
over the death of his dog. Monte confirms&nbsp;
this, commenting that the girl was insane.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.920
Back in the past, Monte and Tcherny help&nbsp;
Nansen prepare the shuttle as the ship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.040
approaches a black hole. Nansen&nbsp;
is troubled by the expedition,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.920
but since she's the only pilot&nbsp;
they have, only she can do the job.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.320
Once the men are away, Boyse heads down&nbsp;
to the airlock room, carrying a shovel.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.280
Monte, Tcherny, and Dr. Dibs watch as Nansen&nbsp;
leaves with the shuttle in the control room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.560
But instead of Nansen, it's Boyse&nbsp;
in the shuttle, replacing Nansen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.000
whom she struck with the shovel earlier.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.560
Boyse smiles as she approaches the black&nbsp;
hole. But a molecular cloud diverts the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.600
shuttle's trajectory, forcing it&nbsp;
into the center of the black hole.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.280
The black hole causes the shuttle to stretch&nbsp;
and compress, ending Boyse's journey in space.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.960
After losing her friend and finding&nbsp;
Nansen lifeless in the engine room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.560
Mink takes the shovel and strikes Dr.&nbsp;
Dibs, blaming her for all the tragedy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.760
Monte steals the shovel from Mink and hits&nbsp;
her on the head, accidentally killing her.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.480
Despite the happiness she found in the living&nbsp;
child, Dr. Dibs is driven to the edge. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.400
leaves behind the captain's transceiver and&nbsp;
confesses to Monte that he is the baby's father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.080
Dr. Dibs exits the spaceship, ejecting&nbsp;
herself into space without a spacesuit on.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.400
Monte heads downstairs but is too&nbsp;
late to save her. He harms himself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.240
feeling the insanity of the events washing&nbsp;
over him. He takes the captain's transceiver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.160
and looks outside the window, finding Dr. Dib's&nbsp;
body floating in space with a smile on her face.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.240
With Monte and Tcherny the only ones left,&nbsp;
Tcherny recounts how he viewed the mission&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.160
as a way to bring glory to his family after his&nbsp;
crimes, but his wife disagreed, wanting to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.400
grieved for his death instead of losing him in&nbsp;
this unknown journey. Tcherny dies not long after,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.960
and Monte buries him in the garden, knowing&nbsp;
that his friend would have wanted it.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.040
After burying his friend, Monte&nbsp;
takes the baby out of the incubator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.800
At first, he doubted his thoughts about&nbsp;
the child, unsure of what to do with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.440
But seeing her healthy and full of&nbsp;
hope, he grows affection for her.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.000
In the present, Monte and the teenage Willow&nbsp;
try to fix a leak in their water storage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.960
With years revolving around the&nbsp;
black hole, the ship is in disarray.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.640
The system detects another ship&nbsp;
nearby, one that is similar to theirs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.040
Monte tries to communicate with the ship&nbsp;
but receives no response. He warns Willow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.280
that other people might be on board, but she's&nbsp;
confused about why he's worried. Monte chuckles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.040
wondering instead if the people could help them.&nbsp;
But Willow replies that they don't need help.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.840
After connecting their ship with the other one,&nbsp;
Monte enters the opposite ship to investigate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.520
From the airlock room, he spots dogs&nbsp;
on the other side. He pries the door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.800
open and approaches the dogs while&nbsp;
Willow watches from the control room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.080
The other ship is in utter chaos, with&nbsp;
only the dogs as the living creatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.600
Monte finds puppies that he carries closer&nbsp;
for Willow to see better in the camera.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.040
Once he's back in their spaceship, Willow&nbsp;
demands the puppy, but Monte insists that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.720
they can't take it. Monte orders her&nbsp;
to leave so that he can decontaminate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.520
Monte heads to the garden and uses&nbsp;
the misting system to clean himself.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.360
After he's done, Willow apologizes&nbsp;
for insisting on the dog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.960
realizing that they only need each other.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.400
Later that day, Monte catches Willow praying,&nbsp;
asking her if she knew about gods. She admits that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.800
she only wanted to know how it feels to pray. The&nbsp;
alarm alerts Monte to log his report for the day.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.520
In space, the black hole produces a ring of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.480
yellow light. Willow insists that it&nbsp;
means they're supposed to enter it.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.560
With nothing left to lose, they prepare&nbsp;
the second shuttle. Willow wants to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.560
the records they have onboard. Even if Monte&nbsp;
and his former crewmates were criminals, she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.640
always viewed them as her heroes. Monte assumes&nbsp;
that the blackhole's firewall will destroy the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.160
ship and everything in it, but Willow trusts that&nbsp;
there's no firewall and that they will survive.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.800
As they prepare their spacesuits, Willow asks&nbsp;
if she looks like her mother, but Monte says no.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.680
Instead, he says that she's&nbsp;
nothing like anyone else.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.840
The shuttle ejects from the spaceship,&nbsp;
with the father and daughter inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.560
Willow looks up at the spaceship that&nbsp;
she's called home her entire life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.480
saying farewell to it in her mind. Their shuttle&nbsp;
is filled with the yellow light as Monte takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.280
Willow's hand, ready to face whatever&nbsp;
becomes of them through the black hole.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.720
Whether they pass through and reach&nbsp;
the next stage of their lives or die,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.320
at least they leave the spaceship together.
