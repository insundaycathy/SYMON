00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.560
Who is this guy this is Elliot and Elliot is&nbsp;
a wreck he is pushed around and talked down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.560
plus he is never taken seriously to be fair&nbsp;
i think that's his fault point is most of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.920
us start somewhere at the bottom with shitty&nbsp;
jobs i mean and if we want things to change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.560
i guess we have to change ourselves but that is&nbsp;
something he does not understand and therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.560
is prone to quick money promised by pop-up ads&nbsp;
triggered by visiting questionable webpages to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.000
give you a quick overview of his life he just&nbsp;
lost his job his black girlfriend is pregnant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.600
his racist son of a [ __ ] father got evicted and&nbsp;
now plans to move in with him and he also takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.800
care of his mentally impaired younger brother&nbsp;
that's a pretty shitty situation to be in not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.880
gonna lie and i think we can all agree that we all&nbsp;
wish him the best but to be honest to end up in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.920
hopeless situation like that you need more than&nbsp;
just bad luck what you need is bad luck paired&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.360
with an additional above average dedication to&nbsp;
things up but Elliot has good fortune coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.920
his way quick money yep the way to riches and&nbsp;
wealth without breaking a sweat for it in fact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.760
all he needs to do to get his cash is making kids&nbsp;
cry trading ostriches in the streets and eating

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.720
[ __ ] insects me explain alright so Elliot&nbsp;
receives a phone call by a random old chap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.800
that promises him a thousand dollars for killing a&nbsp;
fly okay i'm gonna hang up now at this moment you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.440
are being defeated by a fly now to me that voice&nbsp;
on the other side sounds pretty fishy but Elliot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.280
doesn't care right he needs the money so he kills&nbsp;
that fly and instantly receives a thousand dollars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.680
just like that the phone rings again and the voice&nbsp;
on the other side promises him another 3.6 k if he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.200
eats that fly what does Elliot do he eats that fly&nbsp;
of course i mean ever since Bear Grylls that stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.360
is uh culturally respected but here's the catch&nbsp;
the rules of the game are the following so there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.600
will be 13 challenges right now Elliot has already&nbsp;
succeeded with two and after each challenge he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.280
will receive a higher amount of money than he&nbsp;
has received before but if you stop or interfere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.200
with the game in any way including telling anyone&nbsp;
about it you will lose all earned money thus far&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.920
and after successfully winning all challenges&nbsp;
if you should make it that far you should have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.480
won about 5 million dollars however in my humble&nbsp;
opinion these rules should ring the bells i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.200
the red flag present is equivalent to an albino&nbsp;
in Nigeria fact is nothing in this world is free&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.640
therefore i think it is safe to assume that the&nbsp;
challenges you will face could become a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.800
extreme and also for the record this is important&nbsp;
to me even killing a fly for a thousand dollars is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.920
pathetic i'm not a vegan but hear me out killing&nbsp;
the fly is not the issue here but what you do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.040
is you let yourself be enslaved by a stranger&nbsp;
to do something that you normally wouldn't do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.920
just for the sake of money and that is a&nbsp;
dangerous precedence if you are not aware&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.800
of it but if you are aware of it you may have a&nbsp;
chance to participate in the game and turn the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.040
tables in your favor here's my idea first i think&nbsp;
you have to understand that this game probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.320
cannot be won at least not with maintaining your&nbsp;
full health at one point during this game the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.440
game masters will most likely request you to do&nbsp;
something that crosses a certain line and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.080
if participated will threaten your well-being&nbsp;
the worst possible challenge that could await&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.240
you is probably somewhere on the line of excessive&nbsp;
physical force against someone else or maybe even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:51.280
yourself it may be something like mutilation&nbsp;
abduction extreme humiliation aka black mirror&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.320
episode 1 or even worse watching dumb people doing&nbsp;
dumb on youtube for 24 7. if something like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.400
arises a reasonable person wouldn't continue right&nbsp;
and therefore would lose all the money as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.120
so if you want to win this game you must prepare&nbsp;
for the worst possible challenge and if you do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.560
that you will realize that even if 12 of the 13&nbsp;
challenges are easy peasy but the 13th challenge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.160
is impossible then it doesn't make much sense&nbsp;
to participate but what are the challenges well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.480
let's look at the game the first challenge&nbsp;
was killing a fly for a thousand bucks then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.960
eating it for another 3.6 k the third challenge is&nbsp;
causing a kid to cry the fourth burning activity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.720
scene in the backyard of a church and the fifth is&nbsp;
trade an ostrich for the clothe of a homeless man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.560
yeah that's some funny ass challenges that would&nbsp;
cause me to wonder if i'm on a cheap tv show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.320
question would you draw the line at any of these&nbsp;
five challenges chances are you probably don't me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:55.040
neither i guess if i would commit to any of these&nbsp;
you see people nowadays do worse stuff for 16 subs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.760
on the web i wouldn't even commit to the first one&nbsp;
but if i decided to go along with it for whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.360
reason i would not have had a problem with any of&nbsp;
these firstly i'm making kids cry unintentionally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.400
by just staring at them perhaps it's because of&nbsp;
my left lazy eye i don't know and secondly burning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:17.200
a nativity scene for 10 grand i mean Jesus would&nbsp;
understand no doubt god bless the lord and trading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.480
an ostrich for a bunch of smelly clothes well&nbsp;
i wish it was the other way around but for 20k&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.920
man i can't complain the key to success in this&nbsp;
game is knowing when it's enough and honestly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.400
after those five games and having collected&nbsp;
around forty thousand dollars you already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.520
have everything you need to turn your life around&nbsp;
therefore the only way to beat this game in case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.360
of an impossible challenge is scam the scammer&nbsp;
quick side note here if all 13 challenges are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.520
possible to overcome without crossing a certain&nbsp;
line then fine have fun playing and getting rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.840
but you shouldn't count on it if you don't expect&nbsp;
the worst this game will beat the [ __ ] out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.000
you so beat number one expect the worst and&nbsp;
beat number two prepare to run this is what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.440
you need to do we know that after each challenge&nbsp;
the money is instantly transferred to our account&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.440
that implies two things first the money is in our&nbsp;
possession and second they seem to spy on us in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.040
real time visually and auditory these are two&nbsp;
important facts that will help us beat the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.120
once you receive a sum you should cash it out&nbsp;
and hide it in a secure place but considering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.320
you are observed this may not be the best way&nbsp;
to go so perhaps better would be the idea to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.080
transfer it to a foreign bank account invest it&nbsp;
into cryptocurrency or even better pay off your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.600
student loans and other debts and bills ahead of&nbsp;
time this prevents the game master to cancel the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.040
transactions if you should stop playing the game&nbsp;
since the rules predict a complete loss of won&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.960
money when we stop playing we must conclude that&nbsp;
they somehow have attorney power over our account&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.560
which further implies that they are very powerful&nbsp;
so every amount we receive and reinvest safely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.360
will function sort of like a checkpoint&nbsp;
we can't fall behind it this on the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.000
hand will definitely agitate the game masters&nbsp;
and therefore you should be cautious about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.080
that leads me to my alternative point play the&nbsp;
game with the intention of exposing it to Interpol&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.360
why not the FBI you might ask well i will get&nbsp;
to that in a second now of course if the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.960
is a truly benevolent game then you don't need to&nbsp;
worry about anything but since we must expect the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.720
worst you would do well to record all the phone&nbsp;
calls the timelines note the rules and save the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.240
transaction slips etc also you must tell someone&nbsp;
about your participation all of this must be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.840
done secretly obviously don't forget that you're&nbsp;
observed you must consider the fact that your home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.240
and clothes are bugged there are probably&nbsp;
hidden cameras everywhere and one or more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.280
people are steadily following you most likely as&nbsp;
well "the guy's nice that's him that's the man."

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.400
You should also tell someone about it preferably&nbsp;
someone close to you don't forget that you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.120
observed your environment is probably bugged&nbsp;
and you can't ignore the possibility of video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.920
surveillance either therefore i would make&nbsp;
an appointment at the local massage parlor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.560
get my partner in crime in there too&nbsp;
take off my clothes and let's get it on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.960
just kidding but that spot would be a good&nbsp;
one to exchange crucial information at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:20.480
the reason for that is privacy however i urge you&nbsp;
not to talk even in there do it like the soviets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.200
did write your dialogue on a piece of paper&nbsp;
and pass it back and forth another thing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.080
works fine is turn up some music and whisper in&nbsp;
each other's ears when things are starting to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.960
downhill or you decide to stop playing the game&nbsp;
the gathered information will help you to seek&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:40.480
professional help the best place to get help from&nbsp;
is Interpol especially since they are much harder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:46.000
to corrupt because they are ruled internationally&nbsp;
forget about your local police station they suck i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.800
think that should be clear by now they aren't much&nbsp;
help and you cannot allow yourself to slip with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.600
this method you secure your family's well-being&nbsp;
and with the method before we have figured out on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.640
how to keep the one money do what i have said&nbsp;
before and get the [ __ ] out of this country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:06.160
of course Elliot doesn't do any of this because&nbsp;
Elliot likes flashy pop-up ads and doesn't think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:11.200
much further than the digits in his bank account&nbsp;
but for now let's have a look if any of the five&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:18.240
next challenges are more problematic number six&nbsp;
um is having a cup of coffee with a dead body what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:25.520
yep i know he has time until 4 p.m to be at the&nbsp;
local cafe two blocks away including that stranger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.480
that he has found dead in his apartment i think&nbsp;
it is safe to say that at this point most people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.600
would stop playing and just let it be the reasons&nbsp;
for that are more than obvious and i don't think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.840
there are many people that are [ __ ] up enough&nbsp;
that would actually continue playing this game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:46.000
firstly that grown-up male body is probably around&nbsp;
200 pounds you'll have a hard time just getting it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.480
out of the tub that's problem number one problem&nbsp;
number two is it's a dead body if you are doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:58.640
this for 50 grand only then i have a better idea&nbsp;
for you visit the countryside look out for an ATM&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:04.400
at least 45 minutes away from the next police&nbsp;
station and blow that up you're welcome and oh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.920
by the way this is purely hypothetical thank you&nbsp;
but what does Elliot decide to do "i'll have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.800
cheeseburger" - "the Bernard's burger?" - "yeah it&nbsp;
sounds great." - Doesn't look very pleasant does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:20.320
it and the police entering doesn't make it much&nbsp;
more comfortable either two things here first why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.160
in god's name would you lift up the dead body from&nbsp;
the wheelchair and carry it into the cafe i mean a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:32.640
wheelchair is a chair on wheels you get the point&nbsp;
right how about rolling in Elliot barely succeeds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.360
this challenge and after having to sneak his&nbsp;
way through confronting the police officers that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.560
surprise surprise didn't figure out anything he is&nbsp;
able to convince him and just leave as if nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.680
happened oh and by the way because of that bold&nbsp;
move of tricking the police officer he has also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:53.040
surpassed challenge 7. Elliot leaves a cafe while&nbsp;
not bothering to take his new buddy with him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.520
surely having a bunch of police officers in the&nbsp;
back doesn't make it easier but that's exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:03.040
why you should have used that miraculous invention&nbsp;
called the wheelchair anyway the phone rings again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.240
but this time the voice on the other side shares&nbsp;
different information he tells Elliot that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:14.480
crimes he has so far committed will put him in&nbsp;
jail for 10 years oh boy didn't see that comment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:21.360
Einstein but the voice continues he need not worry&nbsp;
because if he is able to win all 13 challenges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.800
the game masters will make all those charges go&nbsp;
away it should be obvious that what they're doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.760
is playing mind games here they push you into&nbsp;
committing shady stuff and then present themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:37.440
as your savior if you fall for that then you&nbsp;
deserve it in my opinion something like that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.320
was bound to happen it really didn't surprise me&nbsp;
at that point during the movie but if you did what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.960
i have shared so far in this video then you would&nbsp;
have been sufficiently prepared for such a case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.160
at this point it's pretty much over if you have&nbsp;
touched the dead body from before and did what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:57.360
they asked you to do you crossed the line that you&nbsp;
would have better left out however if you at least&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.480
gather some information about the calls especially&nbsp;
recorded the phone calls themselves this is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.360
best timing to come clean and turn yourself in&nbsp;
while that is the best thing you could possibly do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:13.040
right now Elliot decides to accept challenge eight&nbsp;
and cuts off the arm of his former school bully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:19.680
yeah that escalated quickly huh so apparently this&nbsp;
guy used to bully Elliot back in primary school&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.680
how original anyway there was one curious thing&nbsp;
that happens here that guy voluntarily offers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:31.520
his arm to be cut off Elliot realizes that he is&nbsp;
paid to do that meaning he is another participant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.600
in that game now Elliot proceeds and cuts off the&nbsp;
arm in my opinion that was the dumbest move so far&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.400
because if you have another participant in front&nbsp;
of you that is playing the same game but his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:48.160
challenge forces him to cut off his limb then what&nbsp;
do you think is coming up next for you exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.520
most likely the same type of stuff um question at&nbsp;
this point for you for how much money would you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:00.000
cut off your right arm or left arm whichever is um&nbsp;
your main side for me i wouldn't i wouldn't do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.640
i personally not not for 100 million dollars i&nbsp;
wouldn't do it would i for 100 million dollars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:14.560
i'm not sure now the next two challenges aren't&nbsp;
as bad surprisingly next up is humiliation and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:19.520
so Elliot has to break the inventory of the&nbsp;
engagement dinner party of him and his wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.760
now that sucks of course and people will&nbsp;
look at you as if you're a crazy person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.680
but once you got all challenges solved you can&nbsp;
let them know that that stunt you have made was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:32.720
for half a million dollars and so everybody would&nbsp;
understand so since this challenge wasn't really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.960
out of proportion if we think in terms of the&nbsp;
money we receive there is nothing to complain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.920
here the next challenge though forces him to&nbsp;
surrender himself to the police which is a bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:47.680
odd but again there were countless options to&nbsp;
back out and or establish a system in which you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:53.200
are guaranteed to walk away with more than when&nbsp;
you entered the game let's recap for a second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:58.880
so far Elliot has committed countless crimes that&nbsp;
would put him in jail for a long time however we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.920
also must consider that most of the challenges&nbsp;
weren't too extreme i mean amputating the arm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.360
of someone that wants to amputate it is not an&nbsp;
everyday thing but i don't see a moral issue here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.320
the worst thing that has been done was drinking a&nbsp;
cup of coffee with a dead body in a public place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.480
and if he didn't throw away that wheelchair he&nbsp;
could have made it look like nothing happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.600
the point that i'm trying to make is that even&nbsp;
though none of the challenges so far were out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:29.600
of this world the game has not yet ended and&nbsp;
therefore it really doesn't matter fact is Elliot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:35.440
has not prepared anything he has no plan if things&nbsp;
won't work out and that means either he will die&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:41.200
or he will end up in jail for decades now the&nbsp;
options to avoid that i have already established&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.800
but the next challenge makes it all a bit trickier&nbsp;
so in reality this game is harder to beat with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:52.320
every new challenge you commit to that's why i&nbsp;
was so diligent trying to make clear that if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.280
start playing this game without contemplating it&nbsp;
first you have already lost on the escape from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.080
police he meets an older hispanic lady whom he&nbsp;
brings to her home in the end it turns out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:08.320
she too is involved in the game but it seems like&nbsp;
she doesn't participate but is more like an npc&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:13.440
he ends up helping her with her laundry hanging&nbsp;
spot and figures out a couple minutes later that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.880
this action would cause around 10&nbsp;
motorcyclists to lose their heads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:22.880
see so far you haven't killed anyone so far you&nbsp;
still had the chance to drop the ball and walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:28.160
away talk to the judge show him the calls and hope&nbsp;
you won't be getting a too terrible punishment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.640
but if you kill someone then that's it nothing&nbsp;
can be done at this point remember when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.640
caller mentioned that all charges will&nbsp;
be deleted once he wins all challenges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.440
well that's it once you kill someone you&nbsp;
must end it no matter what is coming next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.320
so really the only way to beat this game is at the&nbsp;
start if you don't then play ignorantly along like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.880
Elliot did then the only way to beat the game at&nbsp;
this point is to give up your money and walk away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.160
Elliot arrives back home and finds out that&nbsp;
his impaired brother is playing the game too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.600
the last challenge the 13th one is killing&nbsp;
a family member and we are told that that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:07.040
always the case no matter who is playing so in&nbsp;
the end Elliot survives but kills his brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.480
his stat reveals that he has killed their mom&nbsp;
to beat challenge 13 back in the day and Elliot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:19.280
decides after successfully overcoming challenge&nbsp;
13 that he doesn't want the money okay that's that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:33.760
took a long time to figure out my friend
Thanks for watching
