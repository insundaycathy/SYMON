00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.600
If a meteorite impacted the Earth creating
an expanding iridescent bubble that caused

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.429
the death of anyone who entered, what would
you do?

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.709
In this requested How to Beat video, we’ll
follow the scientists, see if we can make

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:16.250
better decisions, and ultimately attempt to
beat the Shimmer in, Annihilation.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.250
Think you could do better?

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.970
Let us know in the comments.

to request or vote for 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.130
a movie, visit my reddit page.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:52.120
Let’s get to it.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.910
We start out following Lena, a cellular biology
professor and Army veteran, being questioned

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.810
after returning as the sole survivor of an
expedition to an anomalous zone known as the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.810
"Shimmer".

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.980
The interrogator asks her how she survived
on a few days worth of food rations, when

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.299
they recounted that she was inside the Shimmer
for 4 months.

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.290
Lena replies that she only thought she was
inside for a few days.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.239
Given the alien and unknown nature of the
Shimmer, it’s possible there is a time dilation

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.599
inside its borders.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.930
However, Lena did say that all of her team
members mysteriously died and vanished.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.230
I don’t want to jump to conclusions here,
but we can’t rule out Natalie Portman whacking

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.739
her teammates and eating them.

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.409
We then rewind to a couple weeks before her
expedition into the Shimmer.

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.450
She’s dealing with depression from losing
her soldier husband who was missing in action

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.040
for the past year after a covert op went sideways,
as far as she was told.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.170
After 12 months of nothing, he shows up at
home.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.219
Only it’s not the type of reunion you see
in YouTube videos where the soldier shows

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:56.370
up, hugs his wife, gives their dog a belly
rub, and they take their kids to go get ice

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.370
cream.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.969
Kane looks like his sanity and soul got sucked
out of his body.

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:02.760
He’s unable to recall what happened or how
he got here.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.910
He also says something interesting, that he
showed up at the house, saw Lena, and ‘recognized

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.530
her’, and that’s why he entered her house.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.909
Whatever happened to him, it must’ve triggered
a massive dissociative disorder.

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.409
With the added complication of throwing up
blood.

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.489
En route to the hospital they get hijacked
by a bunch of unmarked black vans full of

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.900
spec ops soldiers.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.139
The next thing Lena knows is that she’s
waking up in a detention cell, being questioned

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.510
about her husband by a psychologist.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.290
She quickly realizes that she should probably
get a lawyer before answering any more questions,

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.890
which would normally be a good call, but it
doesn’t work very well when you're at a

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.489
CIA blacksite and they just refuse.

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.299
Knowing Lena’s prodigious credentials in
cellular biology and her intimate relationship

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.760
with one of the soldiers sent into the Shimmer,
they give her front row seats to the phenomenon

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:59.279
and debrief her on what they know, which isn’t
much.

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:03.849
It appeared three years ago after a meteorite
impacted next to a lighthouse, and when the

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.430
park warden went to check it out, he never
returned.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.430
Can we just pause on this for a second.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.829
I get the appeal of wanting to check out an
alien phenomenon, but maybe carelessly wandering

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.749
into an alien bubble you know nothing about
was a stupid idea?

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:16.749
I digress.

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:20.840
Since then they’ve sent in drones, animals,
and teams of people by air, land and sea to

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.810
investigate it, but nothing and noone that
entered the Shimmer ever came back out.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.200
That is, until Lena’s husband did, albeit
not unscathed.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.810
He’s suffering from multiple organ failure
among many other things.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.790
Apparently their examinations of Kane haven’t
revealed any new information, nor had they

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.420
even detected him leaving the Shimmer.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.290
Unless he teleported, I have a hard time believing
he just waltzed out without anyone noticing.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.160
As far as the SWAT team, I think they only
came after Lena dialed 911 for Kane, which

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.850
triggered alarms at the NSA.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.570
Dr. Ventress mentions that they’ve deployed
their usual unoriginal cover up narrative

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.520
of a chemical spill to avoid rampant speculation
and visitation by the masses, which seems

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.940
to have worked because most of the world is
still somehow unaware of the Shimmer’s existence

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.850
after 3 whole years.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.340
The cover up is not going to last long with
how rapidly the Shimmer is expanding, so they’re

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.140
on the clock to figure this thing out and
stop it before they lose all control.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.290
That’s why they are launching another expedition
in a few days led by psychologist Dr. Ventress,

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:32.650
followed by physicist Josie Radek, geomorphologist
Cassie Sheppard, and paramedic Anya Thorensen.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.900
Why is a psychologist in charge of investigating
and stopping this extraterrestrial phenomenon,

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.180
dictating who goes into the Shimmer, and leading
an expeditionary unit into the unknown which

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.000
has claimed countless lives already?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.640
Shouldn’t someone with more relevant experience
be leading this operation?

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.520
Hell, I don’t get why you’d bring a psychologist
at all.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.370
There isn’t any strong evidence to suggest
that the Shimmer causes psychological disorders.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.190
Humans that went inside didn’t come back
crazy, they just didn’t come back at all.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.060
I mean Kane came back crazy, but you get my
point.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.520
You could say that people didn’t come back
because they went crazy for some reason, but

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.590
it’s doubtful that that’s the issue because
their insentient drones became compromised

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.590
as well.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.420
Even if the Shimmer was making them homicidal
and suicidal, she’d be affected too.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:27.970
It’s not like she’s going to be sitting
down and having therapy lessons with them.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:38.440
The geomorphologist, which is a person that
studies the evolution of topography by physical,

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.880
chemical, or biological processes, I kind
of get.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.980
From their POV from outside the Shimmer, the
topography within looks unchanged or is indiscernibly

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.980
different.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.780
So bringing someone in to study how the topography
of Earthly landmasses change is assuming that

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.430
the land is changing.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.570
Maybe they have reason to believe there’s
a terraforming type process going on, in which

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:03.780
case this person could be valuable in gleaning
insights as to how these changes are occurring.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.880
As for the physicist, yah, totally makes sense.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.520
Energy, matter, space, time, math.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.520
100%.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.400
What I don’t get is why they haven’t sent
a physicist in already in the 3 years they’ve

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.450
known about the Shimmer.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.040
And if they already have, to no success, why
send in more?

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.060
The soldiers and teams they’ve sent in prior
to this expedition would have had medical

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.400
training, which obviously didn’t help them.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.400
Still, guess it couldn’t hurt to bring a
paramedic along.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.350
But these choices just feel odd and haphazard.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:36.200
I get the feeling, that after 3 years of failed
attempts to study it form the outside and

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.590
inside, they are getting hopeless and just
hail marrying in anyone brave, dumb, curious,

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.080
or desparate enough to volunteer.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.080
Like Lena.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.192
Who wants to find answers that could save
her husband’s life.

00:07:48.192 --> 00:07:51.190
Dr. Ventress accepts her request, and why
wouldn’t she?

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.970
There's not too many scientists that are willing
to step inside a blackhole to investigate

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.650
what’s on the other side of the event horizon.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.160
Again, at this point, why not send in a cellular
biologist.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.220
Fuck it.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:06.010
They really just handed rifles and rations
to a bunch of scientists, professors, and

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:10.350
doctors, and pointed them towards the alien
bubble of death with no military escort.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.210
Yah, I’d say the government has officially
stopped caring.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.380
We don’t know the full extent of the things
they’ve already tried.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.390
Only what was briefly mentioned by Dr. Ventress.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:23.420
Based on what we do know, could we have attacked
the Shimmer problem at its onset better than

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.200
a depressed psychologist?

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.200
I think so.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.920
The meteorite that impacted the lighthouse
was sizable enough that it should have been

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:35.740
picked up by sensors or witnessed by humans,
and investigated by research teams.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.279
Luckily it landed on a remote shoreline and
not in a major city.

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:44.490
Upon realizing that they most definitely are
dealing with something not from this world,

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:49.639
and which defies all understanding, an immediate
quarantine and cover up should be implemented.

00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:54.200
It should go without saying that the Shimmer
should be regarded as potentially extremely

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.620
dangerous, especially considering that they
already had a person go MIA inside it.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.060
As much data should be acquired from outside
the bubble as possible.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.310
Even with the Shimmer border refracting and
distorting the light, you can still see inside,

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.980
and there doesn’t appear to be any notable
changes occurring.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.050
Satellites and drones should be able to obtain
a decent level of fidelity and be able to

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.740
see what’s going on inside.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.569
All types of sensors should be employed and
tested at the edges as well.

00:09:18.569 --> 00:09:22.779
The next stage would be sending in drones
to run tests from within the Shimmer.

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:26.600
Like Dr. Ventress, I would quickly find out
that the signals would be distorted by the

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.310
Shimmer border and thus controlling the drones
via electromagnetic waves from the outside

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.310
wouldn’t be possible.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.689
That’s not a huge problem, electricity and
machines still operate just fine within its

00:09:36.689 --> 00:09:49.120
borders.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.610
You could code instructions into drones to
fly a specific course and return to base,

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.990
so the drone wouldn’t need to be controlled
remotely.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:00.060
You could even rig up giant overhead camera
systems like football stadiums have.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.300
There’s only so much you could learn from
video, and they will likely need to obtain

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:07.699
physical samples, run experiments with mice,
and set up more advanced equipment within

00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:08.699
the Shimmer.

00:10:08.699 --> 00:10:12.720
Luckily, most of this could be accomplished
just inside the permeable border with minimal

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.040
human exposure.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.449
As with many things, the answers usually lie
in the origin.

00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:20.499
The bubble should still be small enough at
the beginning that trekking in wouldn’t

00:10:20.499 --> 00:10:21.790
be much of a journey.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.470
Still, you’d want to closely monitor anyone
who passed through the border, as well as

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:30.079
try to protect them as much as possible using
biosuits, handheld sensors, attach them to

00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:34.860
cables to pull them out, keep them in eyesight,
have manual methods of communication that

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.259
don’t rely on electromagnetic waves, etc.

00:10:37.259 --> 00:10:41.459
I think a more optimal and efficient method
would be to either drive in via the shoreline

00:10:41.459 --> 00:10:44.300
or land a helicopter right next to the lighthouse.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.670
The helicopter should be functional, there
just wouldn’t be any communications with

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:48.670
the outside.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:52.540
If for some reason this wasn’t possible,
you could potentially parachute a team into

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:57.870
the lighthouse area, then use a Fulton surface-to-air
recovery system to extract them quickly.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:01.240
This way they would minimize their exposure
time and get to the source immediately.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.329
We’ll see how these strategies could impact
how the story unfolds.

00:11:06.329 --> 00:11:11.279
Let’s continue.

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:14.769
Right after they pass through the Shimmer
wall, they immediately wake up at camp with

00:11:14.769 --> 00:11:18.100
no memory of anything they did after passing
through the border.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.749
They figure they’ve been inside for a few
days already based on the rations that have

00:11:21.749 --> 00:11:22.749
been used up.

00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:26.680
Perhaps passing through the Shimmer border
altered their neurochemistry which triggered

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.300
a form of amnesia.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.220
This affliction wouldn’t have been a surprise
if they did proper testing at the border with

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:37.389
mice and closely monitored terminally ill
patients before yolo-ing a bunch of researchers

00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:39.740
into the alien bermuda triangle.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.920
Needless to say, not remembering the last
few days since you entered would be incredibly

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.470
worrying and grounds to leave immediately.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:51.379
The team agrees, and attempts to locate their
position with their GPS equipment and compasses,

00:11:51.379 --> 00:11:55.149
as well as radio their situation to the forward
operating base.

00:11:55.149 --> 00:11:56.149
None work.

00:11:56.149 --> 00:12:00.569
The Shimmer must be disrupting the electromagnetic
waves and the entire EM field.

00:12:00.569 --> 00:12:04.630
Again, it should’ve been painfully obvious
that none of this would work with how previous

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:09.360
teams ghosted them, and if they had run literally
any tests whatsoever.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.800
Even Dr. Ventress makes a smartass remark
about how it was ridiculous to think their

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:22.940
equipment would work.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:28.769
Which like, cool, then why didn’t you as
team lead prepare any sort of redundancy or

00:12:28.769 --> 00:12:30.589
backup forms of communication?

00:12:30.589 --> 00:12:32.329
Oh, right.

00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:34.269
Because you’re a fucking psychologist.

00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:38.889
Things like morse code communicated via sound
or light to observers on the outside, colored

00:12:38.889 --> 00:12:42.569
flare guns, or even a damn homing pigeon could
have been implemented.

00:12:42.569 --> 00:12:47.160
Flare’s could also have been used for location
identification or to signal for an immediate

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.860
exfiltration so they didn’t have to hike
for 3 days back to the border after they realized

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.490
they had massive memory loss.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:58.610
It’s also a bit ridiculous that there was
no implementation of situation reports, say,

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:02.620
every 30 minutes or so, using these forms
of manual communication.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.290
You want a constant relaying of inside data
so if something happens to them, it doesn’t

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.290
die with them.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:12.459
They currently have no idea where they are
or what direction is North, so they use the

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:14.949
sun and the time to orient themselves.

00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:19.839
Point the hour hand towards the sun, and halfway
between the hour hand and 12 o clock is South.

00:13:19.839 --> 00:13:20.839
Pretty smart.

00:13:20.839 --> 00:13:25.360
Once oriented, they decide to head South towards
the Lighthouse because the shoreline is there,

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.930
and they can easily walk alongside it to the
border.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:32.069
Which is exactly why they should have entered
via the shoreline in the first place.

00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:35.740
But now that they are trying to get out, going
South to the shoreline doesn’t make much

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:36.740
sense.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.690
The shoreline is much more likely to lead
them into the heart of the Shimmer where it’s

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:41.170
effects are strongest.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.860
Going North towards their base and civilization
seems like a better idea.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.089
Nonetheless, the team breaks camp and heads
for shore.

00:13:48.089 --> 00:13:52.670
The next thing they come across is an abandoned
cabin with strange flowers growing around

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:53.670
it.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:57.689
I personally wouldn’t have thought anything
of it, but Lena’s cellular biology background

00:13:57.689 --> 00:14:05.310
is throwing off red flags.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:11.010
The Shimmer appears to be causing some form
of genetic mutation or enhanced cross hybridization

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:15.800
in the plant life which Lena and Dr. Ventress
both suggest could be caused by disease.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.769
It’s possible that the meteorite could have
harbored pathogens that infected the surrounding

00:14:20.769 --> 00:14:26.019
organic life, and the EM field distortion
is being caused by an unknown element in the

00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:27.019
meteorite.

00:14:27.019 --> 00:14:30.009
It’s also possible that it wasn’t a meteorite
at all.

00:14:30.009 --> 00:14:34.410
It could be an alien drone sent to Earth to
terraform it for their species.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:38.810
Whatever caused these genetic mutations in
the plants could also cause them in humans.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.209
It would explain everyone going missing and
Kane throwing up blood.

00:14:42.209 --> 00:14:46.249
The team is likely already fucked if that’s
the case, but I wouldn’t be snacking on

00:14:46.249 --> 00:14:49.689
plant berries or refilling my canteen in a
stream.

00:14:49.689 --> 00:14:53.819
And on that point: I know these are unique
looking flowers and not the corpse of a little

00:14:53.819 --> 00:14:57.949
green man, but wouldn’t you want to be wearing
some latex gloves at least.

00:14:57.949 --> 00:15:02.079
There’s just a general lack of PPE that’s
probably going to get someone killed.

00:15:02.079 --> 00:15:05.870
It doesn’t seem like they brought any equipment
along that they could use to examine and test

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.240
their strange findings.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.510
They’re basically guinea pigs blindly stumbling
in the direction of the lighthouse, trying

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.529
to guess what’s going on by feel.

00:15:13.529 --> 00:15:16.170
I’m sure this will work out for them just
fine.

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:20.069
Anya wants to use the boat, which I think
could be a good idea and take the load off

00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:31.329
their legs since they’ve been hiking for
a week now.

00:15:31.329 --> 00:15:36.040
Second thought, negative on the float trip
through mutated, hyper aggressive alligator

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.230
infested waters.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:41.009
I know Josie got jumped out of nowhere, and
that they couldn’t have predicted getting

00:15:41.009 --> 00:15:45.739
hunted by super-gators, but this is the Southeastern
area of the U.S.

00:15:45.739 --> 00:15:49.629
They should’ve been briefed and trained
on gators being a possible threat.

00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:53.679
All the science geeks running around like
chickens with their heads cut off is exactly

00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:56.459
why having a military escort would’ve been
a good idea.

00:15:56.459 --> 00:16:01.619
I will give Lena some big credit for handling
that AR15 like an absolute unit and saving

00:16:01.619 --> 00:16:02.970
everyone’s asses though.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:07.199
While Lena was sending hot lead down the red
spotted albino gator’s throat, she noticed

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:08.839
something odd about it’s teeth.

00:16:08.839 --> 00:16:13.869
So they pull it’s mouth back open, and crazy
as it may sound, this gator has concentric

00:16:13.869 --> 00:16:15.580
rows of shark teeth.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.239
The hybrid flowers were strange.

00:16:18.239 --> 00:16:19.239
Alligators with shark-teeth?

00:16:19.239 --> 00:16:21.350
That’s on another level completely.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.559
How could an alligator be sharing genetic
traits of a shark?

00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:29.860
It’s impossible that they mated due to the
vast genetic differences between the two species,

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.110
and uh, anatomical differences.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:36.860
This would imply that the mutations they are
observing could be caused by a form of horizontal

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.189
gene transfer called transduction.

00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:41.410
Basically, an alien virus.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.449
Here’s the problem with this theory.

00:16:43.449 --> 00:16:47.559
They aren’t anywhere close to the ocean,
and alligators typically don’t travel very

00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:48.559
far.

00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:53.129
So how would this gator have come into contact
with a virus that infected a shark.

00:16:53.129 --> 00:16:54.819
Something else is going on.

00:16:54.819 --> 00:16:59.100
Somehow unphased by the mutated reptiles,
they hop into some canoes and navigate the

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:03.720
swamps until they reach Fort Amaya, the old
military headquarters that was used until

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.049
the Shimmer swallowed it.

00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:10.050
The sides of the concrete bunkers have, as
Lena points out, colorful malignant tumors

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.059
growing on them.

00:17:11.059 --> 00:17:15.549
There’s not much else to do but take samples
and keep heading for the exfil location.

00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:20.290
With sundown rapidly approaching and not wanting
to be out in the open with the mutant wildlife,

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.069
they decide to set up camp in the base.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:26.290
When they enter the mess hall they find the
abandoned gear of the soldiers they previously

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.290
sent in.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.050
A bad sign, but at least there’s no bodies.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.500
Or wait, is it worse that there are no bodies.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.990
Guess we’ll find out soon enough.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:39.240
Lena spots a guard roster with Kane’s name
on it, among other names that were suspiciously

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.380
crossed out.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.060
She says that if the soldiers were guarding
the perimeter, they should too.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.600
Honestly you probably should’ve been doing
that from the start, though I doubt it will

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.990
help you much if multiple special forces teams
got annihilated.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:55.070
But hey, maybe your psychologist team lead
will do a better job of watching your six

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.210
while you sleep behind alien lines.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:01.250
They also find a package containing a video
labeled, ‘for those that follow’.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:06.330
I’m getting Halo Flood vibes here.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.649
Okayyy.

00:18:09.649 --> 00:18:16.029
That’s not normal, or explainable in any
way.

00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:19.899
It would have been nice if the soldiers wrote
down a detailed report of what was going on

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:22.289
instead of just leaving a cryptic video.

00:18:22.289 --> 00:18:26.649
Dr. Ventress notices the area where the video
was taken, and they find the soldier with

00:18:26.649 --> 00:18:28.210
the snake intestines.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:32.580
Whatever was happening to him progressed until
he turned into a psychonaut wit dream.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:37.010
Lena takes some samples of Captain Keyes while
Josie decides to stick her bare hand in the

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:41.210
murky water to pick up the bloody knife that
was used to cut open the infected soldier

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:42.740
with snake intestines.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.000
Do you want snake intestines, because that’s
how you get snake intestines.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.731
Good call setting up in the guard tower for
the night, I wouldn’t want to be at ground

00:18:50.731 --> 00:18:55.960
level with the shark-gators, man-bear-pigs,
spider-snakes, panthers with fire-ant mandibles,

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.289
or whatever other monstrosities the Shimmer
is creating.

00:18:59.289 --> 00:19:01.650
Lena did bring a microscope after all.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.029
How is she just now getting around to examining
the samples?

00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:08.820
This is literally the first time anyone has
broken out a single piece of equipment on

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.360
their science expedition.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.050
So far it’s been more like a bunch of middle
schoolers on a field trip trying to catch

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.149
butterflies.

00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:20.179
Under the microscope, each sample's cell division
is producing a Shimmering child variant.

00:19:20.179 --> 00:19:25.220
I’d say she should check her own blood sample
too, but I think she knows they’re already

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.220
affected.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.510
The Shimmering child cells should’ve been
observable by testing mice and collecting

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:33.440
plant life samples at the border, shame they
had to figure it out like this.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.190
For some reason Dr. Ventress is at ground
level in a guard post instead of guarding

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:42.700
from the tower which is a way better vantage
point, much safer, and close enough to her

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.680
team that she could get help if something
attacked.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:50.500
They are in a national park full of dangerous
animals and insects that are undergoing crazy

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.440
mutations, there could be anything out there.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:20:08.220
I’d also have brought that M249 SAW up to
the guard tower for additional firepower.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.269
Sounds like some hungry wildlife caught a
whiff of fresh meat.

00:20:11.269 --> 00:20:15.490
Cassie, Anya, and Josie all hear it, wake
up, and leave the safety of the guard tower

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:19.270
to wander into the dark tall grass where they
heard the roaring beast.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:23.760
Lena is the only one who brought NVG’s,
and they are shitty gen 2 ones.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.830
Could the government not spare some thermal
goggles or mounted flashlights for the most

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.779
important mission humans have ever embarked
on.

00:20:30.779 --> 00:20:35.220
Then again, this whole operation has been
led by a psychologist who’s done nothing

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.890
but the bare minimum.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.900
Hate to say it, but Cassie’s 100% dead.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.750
No sense in running into the forest and getting
killed too.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:50.289
The next morning Dr. Ventress plans to continue
on towards the lighthouse with or without

00:20:50.289 --> 00:20:51.289
them.

00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:55.080
Anya and Josie both want to GTFO immediately
with the evidence they have, but know they

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.550
need Lena’s help since she’s the only
one capable of defending them.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:02.470
Lena agrees that they should go back, but
insists that going to the shoreline is the

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:06.600
best route out of the Shimmer, citing that
it took them 6 days to get here, when the

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.130
shoreline is only 2 days away.

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:09.370
It’s a tough call.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:14.269
The lighthouse is the epicenter, so the mutations
would be worse going towards it, but once

00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:18.370
they got to the shore it would be one long
walk on the beach and they’d be free.

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:22.060
If they backtracked it would probably take
longer and they’d be traversing marshlands

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.720
full of dangerous wildlife.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.510
The only benefit is that they’d be getting
further from the source, which might not even

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:28.710
matter at this point.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:32.769
Lena has to know that their cells are dividing
into Shimmer cells too, so their best shot

00:21:32.769 --> 00:21:39.110
at surviving is going to the source to try
to find the off button.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.840
You should have a map that you could use to
verify all of this super easily.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.620
Must be the PTSD or Shimmer induced schizophrenia
that’s making her so paranoid.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.350
Either way, I’d unload her rifle when she
wasn’t looking.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:55.000
Anya and Josie both reluctantly agree to head
towards the lighthouse with Lena and Ventress.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.019
On their way they come across Cassie's bloody
boot, and Lena splits up from the group to

00:21:59.019 --> 00:22:01.250
confirm that Cassie was killed.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:05.850
Normally i’d say splitting up is a bad idea,
but with these paranoid, untrained, panicky

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:12.269
idiots it’s probably best that they aren’t
behind you with their finger on the trigger.

00:22:12.269 --> 00:22:15.380
This must have been what she was mentioning
about duplicate forms.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:19.389
The way they moved is more than mutation,
it's almost like a melding of consciousness

00:22:19.389 --> 00:22:20.389
or something.

00:22:20.389 --> 00:22:24.850
Lena taking her rucksack off before heading
into the suspicious area where she expected

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.830
potential conflict is a nice touch and shows
her military training.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.769
Sheppard didn’t make it.

00:22:30.769 --> 00:22:33.019
They are currently in the bear-thing’s territory.

00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:37.169
It could still be out here, so maybe you slack
jawed dolts should stay alert and have your

00:22:37.169 --> 00:22:40.370
guns in low-ready until you’re out of the
danger zone.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:41.870
Things continue to get stranger.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.590
In one of the clearings there are plants in
the shape of humans.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:51.020
Upon examination, Josie supposes that if you
sequenced the genome of these plant person

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:55.480
things, you would find semblances of the human
Hox gene, which is the gene that determines

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.150
the layout of our body.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.000
How humans grow to be humans.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:11.610
Josie has a theory on why this may be.

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.500
Surely you could have found that out with
testing done like I mentioned earlier.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:20.330
It took you a week of exposure wandering around
an alien dreamscape to come to that conclusion.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:24.010
If what you’re saying is true, though we
don’t know because apparently the scientific

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:29.210
method now means making bold assumptions without
any rigor or testing, then you all are basically

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:30.210
dead.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:34.720
You’ll either end up as wall art, bear shit,
or have mutated so much so fast that your

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.570
self will cease to exist.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:39.929
At their next camp, Anya notices her hand
changing shape.

00:23:39.929 --> 00:23:44.350
It appears as though going towards the lighthouse
was a bad idea, woops.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:48.610
Lena confirms their suspicions when she puts
her own blood under the microscope.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:53.210
When each of their human cells divide, they
produce a Shimmer cell, much like the other

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:54.210
samples.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.280
Hey, on the bright side, maybe they’ll gain
some superhero powers out of this.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.990
I’m not too optimistic though.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:00.380
What’s that line from the Kingsman..

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.549
Yah, this ain’t that kind of movie.

00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:08.900
Lena’s been having flashbacks of her having
an affair while her husband was deployed.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.890
She now realizes that Kane had found out,
and that’s why he took on more dangerous

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.370
missions like this one.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:19.179
She is starting to draw connections between
the self-destructive behavior present in her,

00:24:19.179 --> 00:24:24.399
in her husband, in all her team members, in
the genes of the cells she studies professionally,

00:24:24.399 --> 00:24:26.870
and in the entropic conditions of the Shimmer.

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:29.200
Hard to say what this means or how it could
help.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.610
It’s almost like they are fighting a force
of nature.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:36.409
Anya finally snaps under the expedited entropy
present in the Shimmer, and ties up all of

00:24:36.409 --> 00:24:37.500
her teammates.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.080
There were two theories about what happened
to the previous teams.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.230
That something killed them, or they all went
crazy and killed each other.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:50.380
Since Anya never saw the bear or Cassie’s
body, she thinks they are all lying and conspiring

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.380
against her.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:55.559
The Shimmer induced amnesia must still be
affecting them, because she most definitely

00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:59.149
heard the bear roar and Cassie screaming for
her life.

00:24:59.149 --> 00:25:03.090
Just before she carves open their stomachs
to see if their insides are moving, she hears

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:09.279
what sounds like Cassie calling for help.

00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:14.080
Lena knows Cassie’s dead and that this is
yet another distorted form of danger, but

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:19.740
Anya’s skepticism of Cassie’s death compels
her to run outside to check it out.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:24.299
I don’t think that was Cassie.

00:25:24.299 --> 00:25:26.419
Yah, that’s definitely not Cassie.

00:25:26.419 --> 00:25:30.840
Lena tells everyone to not react, which is
a bit easier said than done when face to face

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:31.840
with this.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.330
Actually, I thought with black bears you are
supposed to get as big and loud as possible,

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.990
and that you’re not supposed to play dead
with them.

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:47.059
This is the Shimmer though, so who knows what
this thing actually is.

00:25:47.059 --> 00:25:50.420
That explains why it sounded like Cassie screaming
outside.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:54.050
Thinking back, Cassie’s body did have her
vocal cords gnawed out.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:58.450
Her DNA must’ve transferred into the bear’s
throat and mutated it’s vocal structure

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.090
to replicate hers.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:04.080
Staying chill seems to be working, until Anya
rolls in like a lead farmer.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:09.020
She shoots way too high, misses all her shots,
and gets her jaw ripped clean off.

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:13.660
Josie gets free, grabs a rifle and dumps a
mag into the bear's face before Lena gets

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:20.450
mutilated.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:24.720
The next morning Dr. Ventress heads off to
the lighthouse by herself to finish the job

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.860
before she and the rest of the crew becomes
compromised too.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.400
With Josie currently turning into a plant,
I'd say that’s a good call.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:36.559
We never see Josie’s final form, but it’s
implied she turned into a more grotesque form

00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:37.980
of the Hox gene plants.

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.639
Lena’s only real option is to continue to
the lighthouse, meet up with Dr. Ventress,

00:26:42.639 --> 00:26:44.970
find the source, and destroy it if possible.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:49.370
She makes it to the shoreline where there
are glass trees forming out of the beach sand.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:53.889
Everything they encountered up until now was
caused by genetic mutations of living matter.

00:26:53.889 --> 00:26:57.639
How is sand turning into glass and actively
forming tree-like structures?

00:26:57.639 --> 00:27:03.390
There are no living cells, no energy source,
no inherent capacity for movement or genetic

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:04.390
mutation.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.919
This is evident that there is more to the
Shimmer than the emittance of a form of radiation

00:27:07.919 --> 00:27:11.399
that’s refracting and transferring DNA between
living organisms.

00:27:11.399 --> 00:27:16.049
In-front of the lighthouse there are skeletons
laid out in a ceremonious fashion, which Lena

00:27:16.049 --> 00:27:18.049
doesn’t seem to pay much attention to.

00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:21.889
One of the soldiers must’ve lost it and
killed their teammates before turning themselves

00:27:21.889 --> 00:27:24.080
into the bomb shadow inside.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.149
Like all horrific tragedies and disasters,
I'm just glad we got it on camera.

00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:36.059
Lena does what any of us would do, hit play.

00:27:36.059 --> 00:27:41.029
Kane nuking himself with a phosphorous grenade
on camera is fucked up, but then we find out

00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:43.559
that the cameraman is another Kane.

00:27:43.559 --> 00:27:46.720
Could it be a duplicate form like the deer
she saw earlier?

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.269
If so, which one was actually her husband.

00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:52.889
I have a feeling I'm going to be left with
a lot more questions.

00:27:52.889 --> 00:27:58.210
Lena then hears Dr. Ventress down inside the
mysterious meteorite hole and crawls in after

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.210
her.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:02.649
She finds, well, I don’t know if it’s
actually Dr. Ventress anymore.

00:28:02.649 --> 00:28:07.179
Ventress says that it’s inside them, that’s
it’s not like them, and that it will grow

00:28:07.179 --> 00:28:09.190
until it encompasses everything.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:14.389
It will fragment their bodies and minds into
their smallest parts until not one part remains.

00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:15.389
Annihilation.

00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:20.470
In physics, annihilation is a reaction in
which a particle and its antiparticle collide,

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:22.710
resulting in the particles turning into energy.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:27.990
The meteorite, or UFO, whatever it is, could
be made of antimatter or emitting antiparticles

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.990
in some way.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:32.789
I don’t know enough about particle physics
to speculate any further than this, and neither

00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:34.429
does this story's creator.

00:28:34.429 --> 00:28:39.030
Ventress then proceeds to puke technicolor
rainbows until her body glows incandescent

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:44.760
and evaporates into a seemingly sentient mini
nebula that seduces Lena with it’s fractal

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.760
deadlights.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:46.840
I still got nothing here guys.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:52.309
A drop of Lena’s blood gets gravity welled
into it, and using her DNA it creates an iridescent

00:28:52.309 --> 00:28:54.639
metallic humanoid replica of her.

00:28:54.639 --> 00:28:58.379
Naturally, Lena gets freaked the fuck out
and runs out of the cave, but the humanoid

00:28:58.379 --> 00:28:59.799
teleported ahead of her.

00:28:59.799 --> 00:29:03.759
This confirms that the Shimmer is warping
space and time in some way too.

00:29:03.759 --> 00:29:07.330
Her humanoid is mirroring, imitating, and
almost learning from her.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:14.250
It doesn’t seem to want to hurt her, but
Lena’s not taking any chances.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:18.730
By detonating the bomb in its hands and seeing
the flames melt it back into its metallic

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.980
form, she realized that the original Kane
was the one that died.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:26.629
For some uninterpretable reason, the humanoid
harnesses the flames and ignites the source

00:29:26.629 --> 00:29:30.409
of the Shimmer, burning and collapsing all
it’s constructs to the ground.

00:29:30.409 --> 00:29:34.380
I don’t even think Lena knew what she was
doing, blowing up her half-hostile doppelgänger

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.529
was just the only thing that made much sense.

00:29:36.529 --> 00:29:40.440
This method of destroying the Shimmer wasn’t
something you could calculate, predict, or

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.440
strategize around.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:45.730
Kane and Ventress both entered the cave and
were cloned or annihilated without successfully

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:46.860
destroying the Shimmer.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.960
It was purely serendipitous that Lena’s
efforts succeeded.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.519
If Lena’s mission had failed, I’d probably
have tried nuking the lighthouse as a last

00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:57.490
ditch, but besides that I don’t know what
could have been done.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:01.809
The original Lena, if you can call her that,
survives and makes it back to the base where

00:30:01.809 --> 00:30:11.120
she’s questioned about what happened.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.029
No real answers or explanations are provided.

00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:16.899
Everything that had occurred just raised more
questions.

00:30:16.899 --> 00:30:22.090
How Lena got the Ouroboros tattoo which both
Anya and snake intestines bro had, how Kane

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:26.620
magically healed once the Shimmer collapsed,
why the humanoid destroyed the Shimmer, how

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:31.580
Lena survived for 4 months without food or
if there was a time dilation, if the Shimmer

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.730
was truly gone, and on and on.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:38.170
The movie ends with Lena and Kane’s humanoid
embracing each other with a Shimmer in both

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:39.170
their eyes.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:43.290
The scientists should have discovered their
Shimmer cells when they took their blood samples.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:44.690
Not sure how that would help though.

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:48.970
It’s possible they could reverse science
the Shimmer cells, or at minimum prevent Kane

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:52.580
and Lena from going back into the world and
reproducing Shimmer children.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.790
So how could things have gone down differently?

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:58.890
With more comprehensive and thorough testing
done, as well as inserting teams directly

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:03.499
at the source instead of having humans hike
40 miles from the border to the lighthouse,

00:31:03.499 --> 00:31:08.230
their exposure would’ve been mitigated and
chances of survival and success improved significantly.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:12.840
However, the Shimmer relied on too much Serendipity
to occur to say that we could have predictably

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:13.840
beaten it.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.039
So I'd say that the Shimmer was unbeaten.

00:31:16.039 --> 00:31:20.870
Thanks for watching, and remember, if you
see a meteorite impact the Earth and a massive

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:25.859
shimmering bubble appears around it, don’t
wander into it to check it out yourself.
