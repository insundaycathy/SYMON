00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.990
Hello Everyone, this is Mr Brain Junkie Here,
and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.550
an action monster film called the host, be
ready for some spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.850
In the underground facility of a morgue, a
senior pathologist complains about the cleanliness

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.040
of the room.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.910
He tells the associate to throw away the chemicals
down the sink as they are covered in dust.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.710
the man looks at him in shock, as that would
be a clear violation of the law.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.250
The head scientist threatens him with his
job, which forces the man to empty the numerous

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.210
bottles into the sewage.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.210
As time goes on, people begin noticing weird
creatures inside the lake, but paying no attention

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.950
to the possible consequences.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.630
A salary man plans to commit suicide by jumping
into the river, but before does, he notices

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.720
a large shadow inside the water.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.489
Seeing that his co-workers are not aware of
the danger, he tells them goodbye and proceeds

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:50.860
to leap in.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.020
Gangdu is the son of a convenient store owner,
and he's not very good at doing his job, falling

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.899
a sleep all the time.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.329
His father, HeeBong is unsatisfied with the
son and tells him to wake up and take care

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.649
of the costumers.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.900
Although Gangdu is lazy and quite useless,
he loves his daughter very much even though

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.750
she has a very low opinion of her father just
like everyone else.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.810
They watch television together and cheers
for Gangdu's sister, Nam-Joo, who's a national

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.890
archery champion competing for the first place.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.740
suddenly, a news flash comes on that show
the body of the salaryman from before, but

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.979
half of his body is missing as if something
bit him before he died

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.360
Heebong tells his son to get out and go back
to work, as the customers are complaining

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.189
about their orders.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.619
Gangdu brings the food to the people, but
notices that everyone is starring at the river.

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.560
They see a strange creature under the bridge,
and wonders what it can be.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.270
The animal begins moving, eventually dropping
into the water.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.329
The people walk even closer to the river front
and Gangdu throws a can of beer at the creature,

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.620
which it quickly takes underwater.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.130
Everyone begins throwing garbage into the
river as well, and soon the creature disappears,

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.610
leaving nothing but trash in the water.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.030
Just when Gangdu is about to leave, he sees
the giant creature on shore, charging towards

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.670
the people and knocking them into the river.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.290
Everybody runs in fear while the monster continues
to trample over the spectators and attacking

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.290
them furiously.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.209
Gandu tries to tell the people to run, but
gets knocked over by the giant beast.

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.610
The creature begins running towards the population
center, while everyone runs away, looking

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.749
for shelter.

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:29.409
The monster charges inside a mobile container
full of people, turning the shelter into a

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.470
giant lunch box, as it devours everyone inside.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.170
An American soldier tries to free the people
with Gangdu, but the monster rushes out of

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.349
the room that is now full of blood.

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.610
They chase after the monster and tries their
best to stop it's destruction, but nearly

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.560
gets killed as the soldier get wounded badly
by the creature.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.870
Gangdu tries to save the man by hitting the
monster on the tail, but the attacks are ineffective

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.230
as the creature turns around and forces Gangdu
to run away quickly.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.889
Hyun walks outside of the convenient store
looking

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.140
for her father, only to see that everyone

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.879
has disappeared.

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.099
Gangdu grabs his daughter quickly and runs
for safety, but in the midst of chaos, he

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.519
notices that he grabbed the wrong person.

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.709
The man turns around, only to see the monster
charging towards his daughter, taking her

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:13.769
away.

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.409
The creature jumps in the river and swims
to the other side.

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.579
Gangdu tries to chase after, but watches hopelessly
as the daughter is taken into the water.

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.199
The armies arrive soon to block off the area,
and the people mourn for their family's death

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:30.279
as a huge community funeral takes place in
the shelter.

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:35.790
Hyun's uncle, Nam-il also arrives with tears
in his eyes after hearing about the death

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.960
of his niece.  

00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:41.006
The family embrace each other as they fall onto the floor in sadness

00:03:41.006 --> 00:03:44.247
but instead of helping them, the news reporters surround them and

00:03:44.247 --> 00:03:46.720
begin to take pictures like vultures

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.040
A government worker in a biohazard suit comes
to greet the people and inquires about those

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.639
who made physical contact with the creature.

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.510
The people are afraid to admit their involvement,
but after being asked repeatedly, some raise

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.540
their hands, including Gangdu in the the fear
of legal punishment.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.540
The family embrace each other as they fall
onto the floor in sadness, but instead of

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.540
helping them, the new reporters surround them
and begins to take pictures like vultures.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.869
More workers in the yellow suits begin rushing
into the building, trying to quarantine the

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:07.869
families.

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:11.299
They take away Gangdu forcefully as his family
begs for them to stop.

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.979
In turns out that the American soldier who
helped Gangdu was able survive the monster's

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:21.199
attack, but soon became sick after being infected
with a virus that the creature carries.

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.810
The government is pulling back their military
forces and sending in specialized teams trained

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.770
to handle virus outbreaks.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.400
At the same time, Gangdu and his family arrived
at the hospital, but is surprised to see the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.419
lack of quarantine measures, as even the doctors
are not wearing masks.

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.699
At night, the father gets a phone call which
he immediately recognize as the daughter.

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.650
Gangdu tries to ask for her location, but
the signal cuts out suddenly, as the rest

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.710
of the family wakes up as well.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.860
The monster continues to attack the humans,
killing the quarantine workers and bringing

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.180
them back to it's nest inside the sewers where
the creature is storing them as food for later.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.639
Hyun sneaks out from inside the opening of
a drainage and examines the worker that the

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.590
monster brought in, but the man died of drowning
as he spits out water from his lungs.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.110
The girl manages to find a cell phone on the
body, but it's not functional anymore after

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.849
being submerged inside the river.

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:18.040
Back in the hospital, Gangdu tries to convince
the police that his daughter is alive, but

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.570
the officer thinks that the man's crazy and
wants the doctor to give him a psychiatric

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.569
evaluation.

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.430
realizing that his daughter might begin starving
soon, the family tries sneaking out from the

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.389
hospital, but gets recognized immediately
because of Gangdu's blonde hair.

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.860
They run towards the elevator then into the
parking garage, where a vehicle driven by

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.419
gangsters was arranged to pick them up.

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.100
The family successfully escapes the hospital,
as the police officer desperately chases them

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.419
on foot.

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.699
After the escape, the gangsters charge the
old man a large amount of money for rescuing

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:54.400
them, providing them with guns and a government
vehicle so that they can blend in.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.512
HeeBong has no choice but to give them all
his savings including his credit cards as well

00:05:59.512 --> 00:06:03.370
They drive towards a police check point and
tries to pass through, but a police captain

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.860
recognizes them as wanted escapees from the
hospital.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.460
With no other choice, Heebong bribes the officer
with the only money that they have left.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.710
The family begins searching for Hyun inside
every sewer system that they find on the maps

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.139
that they were given, but the area is too
large to cover and they have no clue as to

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:21.270
where the girl is

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.949
Nam-Il complains that they'll never find his
niece this way as they are looking blindly,

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:30.639
but his sister tells him to stop complaining
as they have no other options.

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.960
Suddenly, the family notices something moving
ahead of them, and prepares their guns to

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.350
shoot.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.020
Nam-joo feels water drip on her in the ceiling,
and they shoot multiple shots, only to realize

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.400
that it was nothing.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.180
However, it turns out that there are two other
boys hiding beside the walls, and they escape

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.330
out of the sewers after nearly being killed
by the family.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.710
The two boys are homeless, and the older brother
decides to steal food from the nearest convenient

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.580
store, which turns out to be the one that
Gangdu owns on the beach.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.479
The younger boy, See-joo, wants to take their
money as well, but his brother stops him and

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:07.729
tells him that that is wrong, as they are
only taking things they need to survive.

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:12.749
They head out with bags of food after ransacking
the storage, only to see the monster charging

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:14.669
towards them from under the bridge.

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:19.419
The two runs quickly back towards the shelter,
but the monster chases them closely behind

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:22.229
as the boys run desperately for their lives.

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:26.449
moments later, Heebong goes back to their
store, and sees that the doors have been forced

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:27.449
open.

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:31.509
He pays it no attention and the family continues
to have their dinner while imagining that

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:33.749
Hyun was there with them as well.

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:38.330
Meanwhile, the girl is trying to survive by
gathering water from the sewers, but sees

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.449
the monster approaching and quickly pretends
to be dead.

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:45.840
The creature drops off the boys he captured
from earlier, and Hyun notices that the younger

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.759
brother is still alive.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:51.370
She tries her best to save the boy and protect
him from the monster.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.980
After some time, Gangdu notices the creature
standing outside their store, and the father

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.800
tries to shoot the monster, but ultimately
misses.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.400
It charges towards them and begins pushing
on the structure, eventually flipping the

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.999
whole place over, while the father continues
to shoot.

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:11.309
After the monster has stopped, the family
moves out only to see it lying on the ground,

00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:13.559
apparently wounded by the gunshots.

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:17.809
the uncle fires at the monster, which prompts
it to run towards the river as the family

00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:19.500
continues their pursuit.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.249
However, they soon run out of bullets as the
creature jumps into the river.

00:08:24.249 --> 00:08:28.909
Heebong tells everyone to stay back as Gandu
give his father the gun with the last bullet.

00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:34.000
The monster begins swimming towards the family
again, while Nam-joo try shooting it with her arrows

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.310
The creature charges at the old man and he
fires the gun, but it turns out that Gangdu

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:41.630
miscalculated and there was nothing left to
shoot.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.970
Heebong turns around and calmly tells his
family

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.820
to run as the creature tramples over him.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:52.089
It grabs Heebong by the leg and smashes him
to the ground as everyone watches hopelessly.

00:08:52.089 --> 00:08:56.269
Gangdu runs towards the father's lifeless
body and cries in pain, but they can't stay

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:59.860
there for long as the police are heading this
way as well.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.040
He tells the siblings to run away for the
sake of finding Hyun, and proceeds to cover

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.050
his father's face with newspaper.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:11.240
Gangdu tries to leave as well, but is unable
to overcome his grief and gets captured by

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.540
the police officers.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:17.230
At night, the uncle goes to his friend for
help who has a job in the phone company.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.500
They sneak into the office building and begins
locating the last call from Hyun.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:26.050
They managed to find her location, but the
friend goes into the manager's office and

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:31.120
reveals that he betrayed the man by informing
the police in order to obtain the bounty money.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.630
Nam-il sees the people after him, and quickly
turns off the lights, escaping out of the

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.410
office and locking his pursuers inside.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:43.370
He escapes the building, but sees that the
police are chasing after him as well.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.280
IN a state of panic, he jumps under the bridge
and avoids detection.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.860
the uncle calls the sister and texts her Hyun
location before finally fainting from the

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.510
pain of the fall.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.420
Namjoo notices her brother's message, and
quickly runs towards the sewer that her niece

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.430
is in.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:03.240
She goes under the bridge and towards the
entrance, while calling Gangdu about her location.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:08.130
Suddenly, she sees the monster running towards
her and tries to shoot, but gets knocked over

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:12.149
into the ditches which luckily prevents the
beast from getting to her.

00:10:12.149 --> 00:10:16.680
After being informed about his daughter's
location, Gandu tries to escape the hospital,

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.320
but is stopped by the doctors who continues
to perform painful experiments on him.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.670
The leading researcher reveals that there
is no virus, and that the government is simply

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:29.480
using it to distract the people from the monster's
origins.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.019
Gandu overhears their conversation, which
prompts the doctors to lobotomize the man

00:10:34.019 --> 00:10:35.800
in order to silence him.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.100
On the other side, Hyun is trying to comfort
the boy by asking him to think about what

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.209
