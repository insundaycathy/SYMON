that<00:02:01.409><c> it's</c><00:02:01.680><c> filmed</c><00:02:02.040><c> in</c><00:02:02.189><c> a</c><00:02:02.250><c> hospital</c><00:02:02.790><c> and</c>

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
that it's filmed in a hospital and
 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
that it's filmed in a hospital and

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
school over the last couple of days and
I<00:02:05.670><c> think</c><00:02:06.000><c> that</c><00:02:06.119><c> the</c><00:02:06.270><c> latter</c><00:02:06.479><c> could</c><00:02:06.899><c> be</c><00:02:07.110><c> that</c>

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 align:start position:0%
I think that the latter could be that
