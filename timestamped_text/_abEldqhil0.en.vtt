a basketball game at his school which his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.320

the game his friend lets him play a game boy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.280
with a looney tunes game lebron goes up to&nbsp;
play and misses his shot during the game

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.280
the coach tells him that he has great potential&nbsp;
but he has to let go of distractions lebron&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.280
agrees and throws away the game boy promising&nbsp;
to dedicate himself to the game the credits show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.840
lebron throughout his successful basketball career&nbsp;
playing for different teams and starting a family

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.280
a darius is practicing his basketball skills while&nbsp;
dom is more interested in video games and has even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.040
designed a basketball themed game of his own&nbsp;
lebron thinks dom has potential in the sport&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.200
but he doesn't know how to tell his&nbsp;
dad that he has different interests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.800
camilla tells lebron to hear out&nbsp;
their son and respect his desires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.200
at the warner brothers studio an ai named&nbsp;
algierithm studies all of lebron's career and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.880
laments to his buddy pete that he's stuck in the&nbsp;
studio server-verse with all of their ips he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.280
a plan to finally get himself noticed and he plans&nbsp;
to use lebron and some new tech to accomplish his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.560
goal he creates an email to a studio executive and&nbsp;
the idea is hatched dom is working on his game and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.680
wanting to go to a video game design camp the&nbsp;
following weekend instead of the basketball camp&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.440
that his dad wants him to go to he is working on&nbsp;
a character based on lebron with his own special&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.280
skill but unfortunately dom's computer crashes&nbsp;
when the lebron character does his special move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.520
causing a glitch and for the character to be&nbsp;
erased lebron tries to reassure dom that things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.640
will be okay and invites him on the wb studio tour&nbsp;
that he was invited to lebron goes with dom and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.880
his friend malik they watched a presentation&nbsp;
it involves the new tech called warner 3000&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.560
and would apparently scan lebron and put him in&nbsp;
the world of several wb properties like batman

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.640
game of thrones or harry potter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.320
after the presentation they talked with the two&nbsp;
executives of wb lebron finds the idea to be dumb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.280
and tacky which algae overhears through a camera&nbsp;
enraging him however dom thinks the idea is cool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.040
and admits to his dad that he's planning to go to&nbsp;
the game design camp instead of basketball camp&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.080
this leads to an argument between father and&nbsp;
son with dom telling lebron that he never lets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.440
him be himself as the two start leaving the&nbsp;
elevator takes them to the lower level where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.800
the server-verse room is dom is lured in by a&nbsp;
giant mechanical ball that pulls him and later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:10.080
lebron inside there they meet algae who charms&nbsp;
dom but lebron quickly figures he's a bad guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.280
algae makes dom disappear and tells lebron that&nbsp;
he will get him back but first he must beat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.720
algae at a basketball game of his own creation&nbsp;
he then has pete send lebron to the rejects

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.840
celebrant passes through several other&nbsp;
wb worlds before landing in tune world

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.800
lebron becomes animated and finds that&nbsp;
the world of the looney tunes is vacant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.000
until he comes across a poster for rabbit&nbsp;
and duck season this summons bugs bunny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:04.800
who has continued living there alone hey you're&nbsp;
that famous basketball oh my god is that a yep

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.840
why would you do that

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.320
since all the other tunes abandoned him after&nbsp;
lebron tells bugs that algae has his son bugs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.440
expresses his own grudge with algae since it was&nbsp;
he who convinced the other tunes that there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.120
more to seed in their own toon world leaving bugs&nbsp;
all alone lebron then looks out at a clock that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.520
is counting down for less than 24 hours for him&nbsp;
to assemble his team bugs agrees to help lebron&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.760

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:03.200
martian and his dog canine so that he can claim&nbsp;
the land i claim this planet in the name of mars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.520
bugs just uses this as a distraction so he and&nbsp;
lebron can steal marvin's ship and go look for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.120
the other tunes while lebron thinks they can&nbsp;
use strong wb characters like the iron giant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.120

orphanage before superman and the other heroes&nbsp;&nbsp;

but when bugs and lebron come asking for her help&nbsp;
she refuses as she completes the obstacle course

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.800
until lebron says he is doing this for his&nbsp;
son at which point lola has a change of heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.920
and rescues him and bugs from falling to their&nbsp;
deaths but failing to complete the course in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.400
time wonder woman still commends&nbsp;
lola for putting her values first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:25.840
and lola still becomes an amazon before&nbsp;
joining her old tune friends again

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:36.480
meanwhile algae shows interest in dom's video&nbsp;
game endeavors something he never got from his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.360

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.640
algae steals the code of his phone through pete

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.880
lebron and the tunes try to get some training done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.320
for the big game but their wacky&nbsp;
antics get in the way of actual

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:21.840
skill

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.480
outside in the real world malik is frantically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.640
searching for lebron and dom until&nbsp;
he is found by camilla darius and

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:38.880
sasha tricks dom into coming&nbsp;
up with the code for his own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:49.840
game into his world with dom giving&nbsp;
his own character the highest skills

00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:03.840
before assembling mutated versions of&nbsp;
other basketball players i'm sure you can

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.440
algae starts to set his plan in&nbsp;
motion as the countdown for lebron&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:17.840
to find his team is up and the game&nbsp;
is set to take place in two world

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:31.840
well if it isn't the old news lg&nbsp;
upgrades the tunes into 3d characters

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.680
while he turns lebron back to his human body

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.080
the next is bugs

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.400
soon a vast majority of characters from the&nbsp;
serververse show up for the game including the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:08.000
iron giant king kong the flintstones the jetsons&nbsp;
pennywise scooby-doo yogi bear and many more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.840
using his own app algae gets all&nbsp;
of lebron's social media followers

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.360
ernie johnson jr and lil rel howery are&nbsp;
also pulled into the game as commentators&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.160
all these spectators i don't know but the&nbsp;
line for the bathroom is gonna be insane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.560
including lebron's own family is now trapped&nbsp;
in the server verse to watch the game

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.880
algae announces that if the tomb squad wins&nbsp;
lebron and his family can return to their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.560
real world but if the goon squad wins all the&nbsp;
humans will remain trapped in the server verse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:09.840
well at least we're good and algae&nbsp;
will permanently delete the tunes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:18.880
algae brings out the goon squad comprised&nbsp;
of snake monster the white member played by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:26.400
diana taurasi the water and fire hybrid wet&nbsp;
fire played by clay thompson the spider creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:34.080
eric nica played by nicole mc the bird-like&nbsp;
giant the brow played by anthony davis

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:51.840
and the team captain the upgraded dominic james

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.840
in the start of the game dom utilizes his&nbsp;
special skills in the game to lebron's surprise

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:20.720
since they are playing by algae's rules anything&nbsp;
goes which allows the goons to dominate in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.280
first two quarters since lebron is still making&nbsp;
the tunes play through basic fundamentals

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.200
basketball but with a sting to it we gotta

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.840
but failed big time

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.720
then a new character was introduced&nbsp;
a time-bending robot called chronos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.680
played by damian lillard he uses a clock&nbsp;
to manipulate time to slow the everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.360
around him and let him do what he&nbsp;
wants with the toon squad members

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.920
and then score points

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.960
after half time the tunes are feeling wiped out

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.640
sylvester tries to cheer them up by saying&nbsp;
they found michael jordan in the crowd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.840
and can help give them a&nbsp;
boost they desperately need

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.040
except it's actually the actor michael b jordan

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.920
who still encourages lebron&nbsp;
and roots for him and the tunes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.160
when lola says that they are doing everything&nbsp;
that lebron told him to do he realizes that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:57.280
is preventing them from playing with their own&nbsp;
special skills just as he was with dom he hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.400
the reigns over to bugs who tells the gang that&nbsp;
they are going to go full looney for the next half

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.280
when the tunes return they bring their a game

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.840
with 20 birds scores the first bucket

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:25.840
gossamer also absorbs wet fire to slow&nbsp;
him down someone's absorbed in the game

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:46.240
that's all porter even wraps a ferocious freestyle&nbsp;
to algae giving them special skills points&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:53.840
the crowd is getting hope and&nbsp;
cheering for the tunes squad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:07.840
then wiley and roadrunner helping score&nbsp;
multiple points with a clone machine

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.160
at wiley's expense then granny challenges chronos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:21.840
and granny scores major points against&nbsp;
kronos even getting him to rapidly age

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:35.840
lebron tried to use again a power-up again and&nbsp;
this time it was successfully done beautifully

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.360
the tunes finally managed to&nbsp;
catch up on the scoreboard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.080
lebron and dom then have a public reconciliation&nbsp;
after lebron admits that his son designed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:55.120
something special and that he wishes he had seen&nbsp;
it earlier the two expressed their love for one

00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:03.840
another

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.840
and dom leaves the goon squad after seeing&nbsp;
that algae truly is a bad guy this further&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:18.960
enrages the ai especially after he sees&nbsp;
that even pete wants to join the heroes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.600
and he morphs into a giant robot that takes&nbsp;
full control over the game in the fourth quarter

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:34.560
algae cheats and steals points from the tunes&nbsp;
with mere seconds left on the clock lebron&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:40.240
and the tunes try to figure out a strategy until&nbsp;
dom remembers that the lebron character glitched&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:46.480
after performing his special move causing the game&nbsp;
to freeze if they do the same there algae won't be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.520
able to have power in there but the one performing&nbsp;
the glitch move may be permanently deleted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:56.480
lebron agrees to try out the move the&nbsp;
game resumes but as lola passes the ball&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:01.840
to lebron bugs takes it and pulls the move off&nbsp;
himself causing himself and the game to glitch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.000
lebron uses a power-up to launch&nbsp;
himself to make the winning basket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.920
only for algae to jump and try to pull him&nbsp;
down dom thinks quickly and tosses his dad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.880
another power up giving him enough of a boost&nbsp;
to score the winning basket and defeat algae

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.640
he is turned into a poster and is destroyed&nbsp;
when pete flies through him with algae gone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:33.920
the tunes turned back to their cartoon self&nbsp;
the humans returned to the real world while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:39.840
lebron and dom say goodbye to the tunes the gang&nbsp;
gathers around bugs as their world is restored&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:45.200
he continues to glitch but expresses happiness&nbsp;
that he got his friends back together and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:51.760
he apparently disappears after saying that's all&nbsp;
folks then lebron and dom reuniting with the rest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:51.760 --> 00:19:01.600
of the family and malik lebron prepares to bring&nbsp;
dom to what the boy thinks is basketball camp&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:07.200
but he's actually bringing dom to sign up for the&nbsp;
game design camp finally allowing his son to reach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:13.120
his full potential however dom keeps a basketball&nbsp;
with him so he can practice on this side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.760
lebron then finds that bugs is now&nbsp;
in the real world as he is a tune&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.560
and therefore cannot die he asks lebron&nbsp;
if he can crash at his place for a while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:26.080
to which he agrees until bug says that&nbsp;
he is bringing the whole gang with him
