00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.120
Hi guys, K-Movie Recapped&nbsp;
here. Before we start, WARNING!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.400
Spoilers Ahead! Today, I’m going to explain a&nbsp;
2021 Korean Sci-Fi-Drama movie called Seobok.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.800
This movie tells the story of an ex-agent&nbsp;
of the intelligence agency and an immortal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.440
superhuman who is a specimen of a secret&nbsp;
experiment. They are involved in dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.840
situations due to several forces who want&nbsp;
to take possession of the experiment result.&nbsp;

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.360
The story starts with Min Ki hun, who is&nbsp;
an ex-agent of the intelligence agency,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.080
having trouble sleeping for the past 2 days.&nbsp;
He goes to his friend in a hospital to ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.880
for some drugs to help him sleep. After he&nbsp;
gets it, he goes to a nearby lake to use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.440
drugs and sleeps in his car. While asleep,&nbsp;
he is dreaming that he drowns in the lake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.120
It looks like he has a traumatic event in the&nbsp;
past that he can’t forget. Suddenly, a man in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.880
suit wakes him up and forces him to follow him. It&nbsp;
turns out that his ex-superior, Chief Ahn Ik-Hyun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.680
is the one who summoned him. He asks Min&nbsp;
to do a secret mission. For some reason,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.480
he agrees to do it despite his reluctance.
Min then goes to a large ship with a secret&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.240
high-tech laboratory inside. He meets Dr. Shin,&nbsp;
who is one of the researchers in that laboratory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.680
Dr. Shin explains to Min that they are conducting&nbsp;
the first genetically engineered clone on humans,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.720
which is led by Dr. Lim. They successfully&nbsp;
clone a human with a different genetic sequence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.760
That specimen is immortal and his bone marrow&nbsp;
can cure any disease known to humankind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.960
Moreover, he has a strong brainwave that&nbsp;
makes him able to control things around him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.040
They call him Seobok. When Seobok&nbsp;
is demonstrating his power,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.960
Min suddenly collapses. After he awakes, Dr.&nbsp;
Shin knows that Min has a deadly brain tumor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.760
He offers him to be a test subject for the Seobok&nbsp;
bone marrow experiment which he gladly accepts.&nbsp;

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.040
After that, he goes to meet Chief Ahn. He&nbsp;
explains all about the experiment to Min.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.520
He tells him that recently one of the&nbsp;
researchers was killed by an unknown group.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.240
It looks like there is someone who is trying&nbsp;
to steal the experiment result. So they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.080
planning to move Seobok to a secure bunker. Min’s&nbsp;
mission is to escort Seobok during the transfer.&nbsp;

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.320
On the next day, he goes back to the&nbsp;
lab to get Seobok for the transfer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.680
He sees Seobok endures pain when the researcher&nbsp;
injects something into him. Dr. Lim tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.040
Seobok needs an inhibitor injection every day to&nbsp;
stay alive because his cell division is too rapid.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.480
He is invisible to any kind of disease but still&nbsp;
can die if he is killed or gets into an accident.&nbsp;

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.840
During the transfer, a group of men&nbsp;
with heavy weapons attack the convoy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.240
Min’s team fails to defend the attack, making&nbsp;
them successfully kidnap Seobok and Min. At their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.600
hideout, one of the attackers tries to inject&nbsp;
something into Seobok. This makes Seobok angry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.560
and knocks him down with his power. Min and&nbsp;
Seobok then successfully run away in a truck.&nbsp;

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.760
Min immediately calls Chief Ahn for backup,&nbsp;
he tells him to go to a nearby safe house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.880
Unfortunately, the truck breaks down mid-way&nbsp;
which makes them have to walk to the safehouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.640
Seobok asks Min a bunch of questions about the&nbsp;
situation. He doesn’t understand why people hunt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.160
him down. But it turns out that Seobok already&nbsp;
knew that he is an immortal specimen. They walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.720
through a night market, which is the first time&nbsp;
for Seobok to see normal life outside the lab.&nbsp;

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.560
At the safehouse, Seobok becomes addicted&nbsp;
to instant noodles. While eating, he tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.480
Min that Dr. Lim is actually his mother.&nbsp;
Finally, backup has come. But unexpectedly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.320
they try to kill Seobok. Chief Ahn has instructed&nbsp;
them to take out Seobok. Min tries to protect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.280
Seobok. When they shoot him, Seobok deflects&nbsp;
the bullets with his power and knocks them down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.800
Chief Ahn orders Min to kill Seobok immediately&nbsp;
for the safety of the nation, but he declines.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.160
They can’t trust the intelligence agency&nbsp;
anymore, so Min brings Seobok to the laboratory.&nbsp;

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.600
On the way to the lab, Seobok vomits blood.&nbsp;
It happens because he hasn’t got his daily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.600
dose of inhibitor injection. They stop at a gas&nbsp;
station. Min leaves Seobok alone to call the lab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.040
to tell them about Seobok's condition. When he is&nbsp;
alone, he goes to a minimarket and has a quarrel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.080
with some teenager there. He beats them with&nbsp;
his power and destroys the whole minimarket.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.840
Because of this, the intelligence&nbsp;
agency now knows about their location.&nbsp;

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.360
They quickly resume their journey, but when Seobok&nbsp;
knows that they are heading to the lab, he opposes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.880
the idea. He hates the lab and doesn’t want to&nbsp;
go back there. In the heat of the argument, Min&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.640
suddenly collapses again. When he awakes, Seobok&nbsp;
is still there. They sit on the beach together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.840
under the night sky. Seobok tells Min about his&nbsp;
daily life in the lab with his mom and the fact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.720
that he never sleeps in his life. They then&nbsp;
discuss more about the mortality of humankind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.600
Min tells Seobok the story of when he betrayed&nbsp;
his partner under the order of chief Ahn,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.560
which is the biggest regret in his life.
Seobok asks Min to take him to a nearby church.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.120
It turns out that it is a memorial place for Han&nbsp;
Kyung-Yoon, the real son of Dr. Lim. He died in an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.720
accident and she cloned him, which is how Seobok&nbsp;
was born. He then decides to go back to the lab,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.120
the place where he belongs. On the way there&nbsp;
he vomits more blood and becomes weaker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.560
Seeing this, Min accelerates the car but it makes&nbsp;
the police and the intelligence agency know his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.000
position and chase him. In front of the Laboratory&nbsp;
ship, the intelligence has set up a barricade,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.200
making him unable to enter the ship.&nbsp;
Suddenly, an airstrike blows up the barricade,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.480
and an unknown group of mercenaries comes. It’s&nbsp;
the same group who attacked the transfer convoy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.680
It turns out that they are hired by Chairman&nbsp;
Kim, the funder of the secret experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.640
He already knew that the intelligence agency had&nbsp;
made an agreement with the US to kill Seobok,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.400
so he hired a mercenary group to stop them.
The mercenary tases Min, making him unconscious,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.840
then brings them inside the lab. Chief Ahn asks&nbsp;
Chairman Kim to stop playing God and hand over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.840
Seobok to them, but he refuses. When Min wakes&nbsp;
up, he sees Seobok attached to a bone marrow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.720
extraction machine. Dr. Shin explains to him&nbsp;
that Seobok will be attached to that machine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.880
forever. Min feels that it is morally wrong,&nbsp;
so he forces Dr. Shin to stop the procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.320
He grabs a gun from one of the guards and takes&nbsp;
Dr. Shin as a hostage. He looks for Dr. Lim, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.920
to his surprise, Dr. Lim is already dead. Earlier,&nbsp;
she tried to kill Chairman Kim but one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.040
guards shot her dead. Min is heavily outnumbered,&nbsp;
which makes the guards successfully take him down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.360
Suddenly Seobok rises from the machine&nbsp;
and sees his mother's dead body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.720
which makes him furious. Dr. Shin tries to&nbsp;
inject a sedative into Seobok, but Seobok&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.760
realizes it and uses his power to repeatedly&nbsp;
slam him to the ground. The guards shoot him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.040
but his power deflects all the bullets. He easily&nbsp;
defeats all the guards and goes to Chairman Kim,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.880
the one who is responsible for the experiment. He&nbsp;
crushes him with his power, killing him instantly.&nbsp;

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.560
He then goes outside, where the intelligence&nbsp;
agency troops are already waiting for him. He uses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.800
his brainwave power so hard until he vomits blood.&nbsp;
Seeing this, Min tries to help him. Seobok then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.840
rises once again and uses all of his remaining&nbsp;
power to create a huge crater on the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.520
trapping all the troops inside. An oil pipe is&nbsp;
leaking towards the crater. He asks Min to end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.560
his life or he will burn all the troops alive. He&nbsp;
doesn’t have any more reason to live and wants to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.560
end all of his suffering. At first, Min hesitates,&nbsp;
but he finally agrees and shoots Seobok as he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.640
requested, ending his eternal life. In the end,&nbsp;
the experiment couldn’t contribute to anything. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.920
only brings pain and suffering. Min contemplates&nbsp;
for the last time at the beach where he and Seobok&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:44.480
once sat together, then he walks away in silence.
