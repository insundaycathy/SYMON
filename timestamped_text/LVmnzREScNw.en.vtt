00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.110
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.680
Today I will show you an adventure film from
2021, titled Jungle Cruise.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.750
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.550
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.710
The movie starts with the Amazonian legend
of the Tears of the Moon, a tree holding magical

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.880
powers of healing and removing any curse within
a single petal of its bloom.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.140
Many had traveled great distances to find
it, but the most notable one is the conquistador

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.060
Aguirre, who was determined to possess its
power.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.720
Aguirre and his men fought the jungle that
protected the magical tree until he was found

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.960
by the tree's true guardians and nursed back
to health by them.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.590
The moment he recovered, Aguirre demanded
they give him the arrowhead which is the key

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.120
to finding the tree.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.859
The guardians refused so the conquistador
attacked them, but all he and his men got

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.680
was a curse never to leave the sight of the
Amazonian river again.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.149
MacGregor can be seen retelling the legend
of the tree, showing its possible location

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.280
on a map.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.850
He is presenting the ideas about the arrowhead
to a society that holds it among other artifacts,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.530
and requesting access to it so that he could
launch an expedition, hoping to find the Tears

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.769
of the Moon.

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.460
His sister Lily, the real author of his speech,
can be seen up in the rafters mouthing the

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.460
words.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.010
When she realizes that her brother won't convince
the society to give them the arrowhead, Lily

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.400
takes matters into her own hands, while MacGregor
stalls them.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.090
She enters the hallways of the society with
a map to take her to the room with the artifacts

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.220
when she bumps into Prince Joachim.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.630
The man thinks that she's merely looking for
the assistant's room so he lets her pass.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.050
Lily breaks into the room and changes into
some male clothes to look more inconspicuous.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.610
She manages to find the crate containing the
artifact and once she opens it and steals

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.760
the arrowhead, Joachim is led into the room
by one of the society members.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.300
He too is looking for the arrowhead, so when
they open the crate and see the artifact missing,

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.990
Joachim turns and sees Lily trying to escape
the room.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.120
He tells the men to stop her, but she manages
to fight them all off in daring and creative

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.270
ways, showing both her physical skill and
intelligence.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.700
In the end, it's Joachim that stops her, sending
Lily flinging on library steps out of the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.700
window.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.330
She holds on tight as Joachim loosens the
string on the steps, sending Lily hurling

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.280
even farther towards the street.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.760
He asks her to give him the arrowhead if she
wants his help so Lily throws Joachim the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.860
box then drops into the bus her brother managed
to stop for her benefit.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.350
Joachim opens it only to find the arrowhead
gone.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.700
The society member tries to apologize to him
for losing the artifact but the prince, after

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.340
learning who Lily is, just kills all of them.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.450
Later, Lily and MacGregor are packing to go
on their expedition to the Amazonian river

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.140
and find the tree, with the glorified notion
that it will help them cure the world of disease.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.740
With the entire route planned out, all they
have left is to find is a skipper to take

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.090
them through the river.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.220
Cut to the Amazon sometime later, in the middle
of a cruise taking a group of English tourists

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.540
along the river.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.430
The skipper of this particularly banged-up
vessel is Frank, a grifter who has designed

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.340
his entire cruise on the premise that everything
in the Amazon can kill you, just to swindle

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.880
a little bit more money from his passengers.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.100
He employs all kinds of tricks and schemes
to convince the tourists they're having a

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.580
risky adventure, even paying a tribe to help
him lie.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.150
Meanwhile, Lily and MacGregor arrive in the
little town by the Amazon where Frank has

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.850
set up his operation.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.510
They are also being followed by the prince's
men.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.120
She's excited to find a skipper for their
travel and runs out to find Nilo, who seems

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.040
to own most of the boats in the dock.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.319
Nilo, on the other hand, goes to have a talk
with Frank, who's just docked his boat and

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.320
asks him to pay what he owes him.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.310
When Frank can't pay everything, Nilo takes
his engine and locks it away, saying that

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.700
he'll give it back when he pays in full.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.120
MacGregor and Lily separate to find Nilo,
when she finds herself standing in front of

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.680
his office, talking to Frank instead.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.099
He has broken into the office to steal the
key to retrieve his engine and pretends to

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.400
be Nilo so Lily doesn't suspect he's up to
no good.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.630
When Lily explains that she needs someone
to take her downriver and that she has a lot

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.900
of money, Frank opens the door.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.630
She storms inside and immediately tells him
where she needs to go.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.270
Frank still pretends to be Nilo as he tells
Lily that the place she wants to go to is

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.980
dangerous, and asks her where she got the
map.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.400
She takes pride in it, saying that it was
drawn by Aguirre's cartographer some 400 years

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.130
ago and that it belonged to her father who
used to tell her about the legend.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.290
Frank laughs at her and proposes a different
kind of adventure.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.860
Lily notices that he was trying to get into
the box with the key to his boat so she unlocks

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.070
it for him.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.610
That convinces Frank to take the job so he
leads Lily into the restaurant to seal the

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.620
deal.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.990
As they haggle about the price for the journey,
MacGregor shows up with the real Nilo.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.420
Lily says goodbye to Frank when she realizes
that she's been swindled and he's able to

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.070
see the arrowhead hanging around her neck.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.930
After seeing it, he's determined to get her
as a client and keeps dropping his price,

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.970
saying he's the only one that can get her
there.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.000
Suddenly, a jaguar walks into the restaurant
and while Nilo runs to hide, Frank protects

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.870
MacGregor and Lily from the animal, struggling
with it and eventually outsmarting it with

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:33.919
a steak.

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.729
The way Frank deals with the jaguar convinces
Lily that he's the right man for the job and

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.360
she hires him on the spot.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.810
Later, Frank picks up the siblings from the
dock, but another problem occurs.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.590
Lily gets kidnapped by some locals for Joachim
and Frank sails the boat out with MacGregor

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.300
to escape Nilo's men.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.430
Fortunately, Lily manages to escape her captors
fast through an elaborate run around the dock

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.610
and is finally picked up by Frank and MacGregor
in the boat.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.639
As they sail away, Joachim is informed that
Lily wasn't captured so he orders his men

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.580
to surface the submarine.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.580
He's adamant about getting to the tree because
he thinks it will aid Germany in WW1.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.210
First, Joachim shoots at the boat, but when
that fails he aims a torpedo on them.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.249
With a slick maneuver, Frank saves the boat
from the torpedo as the submarine's propeller

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:20.110
gets caught in a rope and it's hurled toward
the dock, destroying all of Nilo's ships.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.550
Frank and his passengers are finally on their
way toward the magical tree.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.319
While MacGregor isn't quite enjoying his time
in the scorching Sun, Lily loves every moment

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.870
of being on the river.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.349
She gets excited at every creature roaming
around the boat and films all she can with

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.350
her handheld camera, including the burly Frank.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.919
He's a curious man so he has a go at the camera
himself, revealing a possible attraction toward

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:40.919
Lily.

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.639
She doesn't give him much time to relax, however,
and demands that he direct the ship toward

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.639
a more dangerous, but faster, route.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.349
Frank gives her a hard time about it, though
since Lily insists, he decides to let her

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:52.389
have her way.

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.309
Later, Frank anchors the boat for the night
so the engine can rest.

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:59.780
MacGregor turns in for the night, as Frank
and Lily spend a little bit more time talking

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.039
on the deck and warming up to each other.

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.300
However, MacGregor has an unfortunate encounter
with Proxima, leading the big cat right up

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.710
to the deck.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.349
Frank tells Proxima to heel and she starts
licking MacGregor's face.

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.280
Lily gets really upset with Frank when she
realizes that she is Frank's pet and any trust

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.309
that she might have gained in him, dissipates
momentarily.

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:22.369
Meanwhile, Joachim changes course as well
intending to find the cursed conquistadors

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:24.509
to help him find the way to the tree.

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.289
When he arrives at the place where Aguirre
and his men were captured with the curse,

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.860
Joachim approaches the conquistador's body
and drops a little bit of river water on it

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.129
to awaken it.

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:36.680
Two snakes appear out of the body that are
a part of Aguirre and through them, he makes

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.630
a deal with Joachim to find the arrowhead,
so they can both get what they're after.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.539
The snake swears on the deal and Joachim releases
the conquistador and his men from their prison.

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:49.460
The next day, Frank and his passengers finally
arrive at the rapids.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.659
As they move through the unsafe waters, Frank
manages to keep them afloat and Lily insists

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:57.599
they continue on that route, no matter how
frightened and awful she feels.

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:01.499
The boat almost makes an insane drop during
their journey in the rapids, terrifying all

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:05.399
of them, but Frank successfully maneuvers
it back to calmer waters.

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:09.339
Even though the boat is settled, none of its
passengers are, so they all vomit on the side

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:11.370
of its bow, including Proxima.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.569
Later, as Frank and MacGregor gather trees
to fuel the engine, the brother confesses

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:19.710
his reasons to join Lily's expedition, even
though he isn't much of an adventurer like

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:20.710
her.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.399
After he realized that he was gay, Lily was
the only one in their family to stay at his

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:27.059
side and for that, he would follow her anywhere.

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:31.279
Meanwhile, Lily breaks into Frank's quarters
and makes a curious discovery.

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:35.020
When Frank gets back to the boat, Lily confronts
him about all the materials and maps she's

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.849
found on the tree in his cabin, thinking that
he's after it himself.

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:42.619
Frank tells her that it might have been the
case before, but not for a long time.

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:46.440
He says that it was also his reason to come
to the Amazon, searching for its magic, though

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.300
he was never able to find it.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.449
Suddenly, the boat is ambushed by one of Frank's
paid tribes and they carry on the rouse for

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:54.789
Lily and MacGregor for a little bit.

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:58.370
Frank plays translator between Lily and the
chief until Lily takes things too far and

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.969
the chief decides to stop the charade.

00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:04.550
Lily and MacGregor aren't too understanding
about it when they find out.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.830
Sometime later, Lily asks the chief to help
her translate the markings on the arrowhead.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.180
She tells Lily the markings mean that the
one seeking the Tear of the Moon must turn

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.580
water into stone and mend a broken heart.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.409
The tree must be under the rare crying Moon
to produce the special bloom, which according

00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:20.689
to the woman will happen in two days.

00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:24.439
She says that to get to the tree one must
follow the serpent that bites its own tail,

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:28.240
an image that Lily remembers seeing on the
map and promptly finds there.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.419
Lily thinks that she can get to the place
with a canoe and without Frank so she pays

00:08:31.419 --> 00:08:33.089
him the rest of the money.

00:08:33.089 --> 00:08:37.190
That night, the village gets attacked by the
cursed conquistadors looking for the arrowhead.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.409
Frank, MacGregor, and Lily each fight a different
conquistador.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:45.470
One of them manages to snatch the arrowhead
from Lily's neck and give it to Aguirre.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:50.329
The conquistador tries to flee, but Frank
stops him and struggles with him for the artifact.

00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:54.019
Aguirre stabs him and before he falls down
through the trees, he steals the arrowhead

00:08:54.019 --> 00:08:55.899
back and throws it to Lily.

00:08:55.899 --> 00:09:00.029
The chief saves Lily and MacGregor, getting
them safely down and telling Lily to run by

00:09:00.029 --> 00:09:03.750
getting out of sight of the river where the
conquistadors can't reach her.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.380
As Lily runs, Aguirre's snakes catch up to
her and grab her.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.850
But before he can do anything to Lily, the
jungle drags him and his men back to the river.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.720
As the conquistadors gather themselves up,
they realize they need Joachim's help to get

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.890
to Lily.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.070
One of Aguirre's men sends his bees to the
prince to inform him of their situation.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:25.550
The following morning, Lily finds Frank, happily
thinking that he's alive and well.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:30.130
When the chief and MacGregor show up, he notices
a dagger protruding out of Frank's back.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:34.459
Frank has no choice but to finally tell them
the truth that he was actually one of Aguirre's

00:09:34.459 --> 00:09:35.529
conquistadors.

00:09:35.529 --> 00:09:39.769
Before he can explain anything further, Lily
has to pull out the dagger from his chest.

00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:43.319
When she takes it out without hurting Frank
one bit, MacGregor faints after witnessing

00:09:43.319 --> 00:09:44.319
it.

00:09:44.319 --> 00:09:47.649
Lily later wakes him up to say goodbye, since
she will be traveling the rest of the journey

00:09:47.649 --> 00:09:48.990
with Frank alone.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.220
Meanwhile, the cursed conquistador's bees
arrive at Joachim's submarine and he welcomes

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.579
them inside.

00:09:54.579 --> 00:09:57.730
One of the bees shows him the location of
the arrowhead on the map and they manage to

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.180
have an entire conversation to the amazement
of his subordinates.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.070
Back at the boat and on their journey, Frank
and Lily talk about his life during the last

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.350
400 years.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:10.231
He tells her that he was Aguirre's best friend
so he set off to the Amazon with him to find

00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:13.889
the Tear of the Moon because Aguirre needed
to save his daughter from dying.

00:10:13.889 --> 00:10:18.699
He worked as his cartographer, in fact, he
was the one that drew her map of the river.

00:10:18.699 --> 00:10:22.199
Frank followed Aguirre to the depths of the
jungle to find the magical tree petal, but

00:10:22.199 --> 00:10:26.259
once he saw what the conquistador was ready
to do to the tribe that healed them, he realized

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:28.069
he couldn't be a part of it.

00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:31.709
Frank stopped him from killing the chieftain’s
daughter who managed to escape with the arrowhead

00:10:31.709 --> 00:10:34.640
while the chieftain cursed all of them with
his last breath.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.660
As the years went by, Frank and Aguirre fought
over and over again, until he trapped him

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.110
and his men in a cave where the jungle couldn't
return them to the river.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:46.790
For 300 years the jungle ravaged their bodies,
turning them into the monster they are.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:51.100
Lily listens to him carefully and asks him
what he did for those last 3 centuries.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.670
Frank tells her that he built the town where
she found him, gaining and losing friends

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:57.810
on the way when he decided to search for the
Tears of the Moon.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:02.000
He built his boat and searched the entire
river, finding nothing, until one day he just

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.050
stopped looking and began giving cruises to
tourists.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:08.940
Over the years he kept finding strays, as
he calls his big cats and kept taking care

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.600
of them one after the other, ergo the name
Proxima which means next.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.360
Meanwhile, prince Joachim catches up to MacGregor
with his submarine.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.790
He takes MacGregor in and blackmails him into
sharing the location of the Tear of the Moon.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.170
MacGregor shows him the location on the map
and Joachim kills the conquistador's bees

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.930
so they don't share the information with their
master.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.759
As Frank and Lily are sailing towards the
same location, he tells her what will happen

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:33.089
when he finally gets a petal from the tree.

00:11:33.089 --> 00:11:36.779
He says he would have two choices and he will
take the one that will finally grant him some

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:37.779
rest.

00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:41.190
The next day, they arrive at an impasse at
the river and Lily thinks that they have reached

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.510
the point where water turns to stone as the
arrowhead stated.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.360
Frank dives into the river and finds an ancient
chamber with a lever, but dives back up to

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.540
tell Lily that she will have the misfortune
to open it because he can't fit inside.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.350
She freaks out a little since she can't swim,
but eventually Frank convinces her that there

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.870
is no other way and they dive in together.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.670
Once she's inside the chamber, she pushes
a lever that closes the door and when she

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.990
panics, Frank gives her a little boost of
air by kissing her.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:10.259
Lily manages to push the ancient lever down,
while Frank is swarmed by piranhas.

00:12:10.259 --> 00:12:14.209
The water begins to run out of the cove, but
Lily has no way of getting out until the water

00:12:14.209 --> 00:12:15.780
is fully drained.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.910
When Frank finally gets to her, thinking that
she's drowned, she awakens and slaps him for

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.269
leaving her under.

00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:24.579
As they get dressed they realize that they've
found the location of the tree, but there's

00:12:24.579 --> 00:12:28.740
one more problem revealed when the rest of
the water drains from the cove.

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.250
Joachim is there as well with MacGregor as
his prisoner.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:35.610
To make matters even worse, one of the conquistador's
bees has been following them, goes back to

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.240
report the location to the cursed men.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.389
Joachim takes the arrowhead from Lily and
makes Frank take them inside the cave with

00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:43.120
the tree on his steamboat.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.819
When they reach the tree, it looks like it's
been dead for centuries.

00:12:46.819 --> 00:12:49.740
Joachim tells Lily to make the tree bloom
because she's one of the only people that

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.949
know how to do it, but when she refuses, Frank
says that he'll do that for a single petal

00:12:53.949 --> 00:12:55.510
in return.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.740
Joachim agrees to the terms but keeps MacGregor
as collateral.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.480
Frank gets the arrowhead from the prince and
tries to find a way to open the tree.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.970
When he doesn't succeed at once, Joachim makes
Lily help him in return for Frank's petal.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:11.060
The two of them working in unison, soon discover
that the arrowhead isn't that at all, but

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.649
in fact a heart.

00:13:12.649 --> 00:13:16.430
According to the instructions they break it
apart and find a magical piece inside.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.279
They place that piece on one side of the relief
and the mended heart on the other.

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:23.540
The magic of the tree is instantly visible
as it begins to bloom in the light of the

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.690
Moon.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.640
Once the tree has fully bloomed, Lily shoots
Frank, sending him falling back to the bottom

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.139
of the cave.

00:13:30.139 --> 00:13:33.600
Joachim sends his men to pluck the petals
from the tree before the crying Moon sets.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.670
In the meantime, Frank saves MacGregor from
Joachim's men and they take back the ship

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.800
with a little help from Proxima.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.410
Lily jumps up on the tree to get a petal,
but she barely manages to run fast enough

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.480
to grab one as the Moon sets.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.290
When she finally plucks one Tear, she falls
down the tree and Joachim is there to blackmail

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:52.380
her again, the petal for her brother's life
and hers.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:57.140
Suddenly, the tree begins to fall apart so
she drops the petal and grabs onto the prince,

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.560
saving herself.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.120
Frank manages to grab hold of the petal as
well.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.079
The last thing before the adventure is over,
the conquistadors arrive at the tree as well

00:14:05.079 --> 00:14:06.579
and kill the prince.

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:10.950
They go after Lily as well, but Frank shows
them the petal and gets them to follow him.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.660
He leaves MacGregor on the surface and makes
Proxima stay with him to protect both him

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:15.860
and Lily.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:19.269
She drops from the tree next to her brother
and they see Frank aiming to crash the boat

00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:20.910
into the ancient monument.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:24.589
The conquistadors fight Frank for the petal,
but he manages to fight all of them off as

00:14:24.589 --> 00:14:25.950
they come after him.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:30.449
Lastly, he battles with Aguirre, who asks
him for the petal once more, but it is revealed

00:14:30.449 --> 00:14:33.620
to be in MacGregor's possession, so he can
give it to Lily.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.279
The boat crashes into the ancient monument
and stops the river water from coming inside

00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:38.410
the cave.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.750
The jungle takes the conquistadors, including
Frank, and turns them back into stone because

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:44.910
it can't return them to the river.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:48.940
Lily arrives at the spot and decides to give
the petal to Frank so it will break his curse,

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.589
leaving her dreams about helping humanity
asunder.

00:14:51.589 --> 00:14:55.600
When nothing happens, she and her brother
leave, with Proxima waiting patiently before

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.970
her master.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:00.540
Lily hears her roars as Frank comes back to
life and runs into his arms.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:04.880
Suddenly, they see that the magical tree has
gifted them one more petal to take from it.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.310
Later, they return to the town and give Nilo
the tiny raft they were able to use to sail

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:10.310
back.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:14.129
And in the final image of the film, they have
all returned to London together.

00:15:14.129 --> 00:15:21.519
Lily and Frank can be seen driving through
London in a car, with Proxima in the back.
