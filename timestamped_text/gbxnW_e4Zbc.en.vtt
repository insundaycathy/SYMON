Hi, Movie Recaps here.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.370
Today I will show you a crime, drama, thriller
film from 2019, titled Joker.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.790
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.870
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.910
The movie begins in Gotham City, where we
find Arthur Fleck at his company's office

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.060
getting ready to work - he's putting make-up
on because he's a party clown.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.810
As he watches his reflection in the mirror,
he puts two fingers in his mouth and twists

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.100
it up and down a few times while a single
tear runs down his cheek.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.730
Moments later, we find him on the street,
dancing while promoting with a sign the shop

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.770
that has hired him.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.530
Suddenly, some kids come by and take the sign
from him, running away as soon as they have

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.530
it.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.929
Arthur chases them through the city and finds
them waiting in an alley, where the kids proceed

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:44.730
to smash the sign on his head and, after he
falls to the floor, they start kicking and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.839
punching him.

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.579
After work is done, Arthur goes to see his
therapist.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.769
He laughs for a couple of seconds and after
he comments on how tough things are getting

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.030
out there, the therapist asks him if he's
been working on his journal.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.249
He hands it to her, saying he's been using
it as a journal but also as a joke diary because

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:01.500
he's pursuing a career in stand-up comedy.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.220
The therapist goes through the pages and finds
some upsetting words: "I just hope my death

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.110
makes more sense than my life".

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.080
She hands the journal back to Arthur and asks
him how it feels to come to these appointments,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.270
Arthur says he felt better when he was locked
at the hospital and remembers how he used

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.160
to hit his head against his room's door.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.610
He asks the therapist if the doctor could
increase his medication, and she points out

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.470
he's already on seven on them.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.990
Arthur replies he doesn't want to feel bad
anymore.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.470
Once therapy is over, Arthur takes the bus.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.600
The kid sitting in front of him is staring,
so he starts making funny faces for him, earning

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.020
him the mother's scolding.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.390
Arthur suddenly starts laughing and when the
mother is offended by this, he hands her a

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.990
card that explains he laughs because of a
neurological condition.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.970
After getting off the bus, he stops by the
pharmacy to pick up his medicine before going

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:43.980
home.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.250
Inside the building, he checks the mailbox
then goes up to his apartment, where he lives

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.990
with his mother Penny Fleck.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.040
She asks him if they've gotten any mail, and
when he says no, she wonders if Thomas Wayne,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.390
a former employer of hers, hasn't been receiving
her letters.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.900
Arthur reminds her Wayne's a busy businessman
and urges her to eat.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.070
After cutting up her food for her, he joins
her on the bed so they can watch the Murray

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.000
Franklin talk show together.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.420
Arthur starts daydreaming and he imagines
himself among Franklin's public, where the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.090
host hears him and asks him to stand up.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.660
Arthur introduces himself and tells him how
he takes care of his mother, which Franklin

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.160
respects, so he asks him to come down; Arthur
does so as he enjoys everyone's applause.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.480
When he makes it to Franklin's side, the host
tells him he would give up tv and fame to

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.030
have a kid like Arthur, then they hug.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.940
Back in reality, Arthur smiles at this little
dream.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.450
The next day at work, we can see Arthur's
body is covered in bruises.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.010
His coworker Randall approaches him and after
telling him he's heard about the beating,

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.200
he decides to gift Arthur his gun.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.370
Another coworker, Gary, interrupts them then
to tell Arthur their boss is looking for him.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.830
Arthur goes to see him in his office and he's
told they've received another complaint about

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.540
him for disappearing and not returning the
sign.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.730
Arthur explains he was robbed but his boss
doesn't believe him, because nobody would

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.110
steal a sign.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.760
So he says he'll have to take the sign out
of his paycheck then proceeds to scold Arthur,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.569
who stays silent and smiling.

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.890
But after that meeting is over, he goes outside
to kick a trash can in frustration.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.870
Later that day, when going back to his apartment,
Arthur shares the elevator with his neighbor

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.050
Sophie Dumond and her daughter.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.790
When the elevator stops for a moment, Sophie
comments the building is incredibly awful

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.510
and makes a gesture with her hand pretending
to shoot her head.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.840
Arthur smiles and, when they make it to their
floor and get off the elevator, he returns

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.560
the shooting gesture.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.069
Moments later, Arthur is giving Penny a bath.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.540
She keeps on asking about the letters because
she thinks Wayne was a good man who wouldn't

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.660
like seeing them live like this, Arthur asks
her not to worry about money because his stand-up

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.020
show will make it to the big clubs soon.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.610
Penny says she thought you had to be funny
to be a comedian.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.500
A couple of hours later, after having put
his mother to bed, Arthur watches a movie

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.380
and practices with his new gun.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.130
When a song begins to play on the tv, he starts
dancing to it while pretending to talk to

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.960
a girl, but he accidentally shoots the gun
and makes a hole in the wall.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.420
His mother wakes up and asks about the noise,
he tells her it's just a war movie on tv.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.450
The next day, Arthur follows Sophie around
town and even on public transport.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.280
In the evening, he goes to see a stand-up
show to take some notes, which he continues

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.570
to work on when he returns to his place later,
where he writes "the worst part of having

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.180
a mental illness is people expect you to behave
as if you don't".

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.380
His writing is interrupted by the doorbell,
and Arthur opens the door to find Sophie.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.379
She asks him if he's been following her around,
which he confirms, so she wonders if he was

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:18.989
going to rob her place.

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.569
He says he could do it now and she laughs
before telling him he's funny, prompting Arthur

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:24.650
to invite her to his stand-up show.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.620
Sophie accepts before leaving.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.319
The following day, Arthur is working as a
clown in a hospital, entertaining the kids.

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.960
During his performance, his gun falls to the
floor.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.909
He hurries to pick it up and asks the children
to keep it a secret.

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.580
But later in the evening, while talking to
his boss on the phone, the man is mad about

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.729
this incident.

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.330
Arthur tries to convince him the gun was just
a prop, but his boss doesn't believe him and

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.419
tells him Randall said he tried to buy a gun
off him last week.

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.880
Arthur gets fired, and in frustration, he
hits the phonebooth glass with his head.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.169
Afterward, he takes the subway to go home.

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.020
In the same car as him, there are three guys
in suits bothering a young woman.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.569
When Arthur suddenly starts laughing, the
woman gets up and leaves, and one of the guys

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.249
starts singing "Send In The Clowns" as the
three of them approach him.

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:10.039
They take off his wig and bag, wondering why
he laughs, but when he tries to explain and

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.830
take his things back, they grab him and punch
him, then they throw him on the floor to kick

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.830
him.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.379
This time though, Arthur defends himself:
he takes out his gun and shoots two of the

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:19.379
men.

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:23.110
The third one runs away and leaves the car
when the subway stops at the station, Arthur

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.159
follows him out and shoots him when they reach
the stairs.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.289
As his ears start ringing, Arthur realizes
what he's done and rushes out of the station,

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.639
runs through the streets, and enters the bathrooms
of the local park.

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.120
In there, after a moment of panicking, he
dances.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.089
Moments later, he returns to his apartment
building, knocks on Sophie's door and as soon

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:44.009
as she opens it, he goes inside and kisses
her.

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.249
The door closes behind them, implying they
spend the night together.

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:50.930
The next day, Arthur goes to his workplace
to pick up all his belongings and hears his

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.680
coworkers discuss the news of a clown shooting
three men in the subway.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.270
They also try to offer him some words of sympathy,
including Randall, whose hypocrisy irritates

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.729
Arthur, so he tells everyone it was his gun
that did the crime.

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.789
Before leaving, Arthur hits the punch clock,
which falls to the floor and breaks.

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:11.000
On his way out, he sees the "don't forget
to smile" sign and crosses out two words,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.509
transforming it into "don't smile".

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:17.319
Back in his apartment, after he takes his
last few pills, Arthur joins his mother to

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:18.600
watch tv.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.379
Thomas Wayne is on the news because the murdered
men were employees at his company.

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:26.539
When the host asks him about the city's new
anti-rich sentiment, Wayne says he's considering

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.210
running for mayor to fix it, and when he's
asked about the murderer, he says it makes

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.752
sense that he had been wearing a clown mask
because he was a coward that wanted to hide

00:06:33.752 --> 00:06:34.840
his face.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.099
He thinks all people that do nothing with
their lives are clowns.

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:41.180
Some days later, Arthur is seeing his therapist
again.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.350
He tries to tell her he finally feels like
he exists and people are started to notice,

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.060
but she interrupts him to tell him the government
has cut their funding, so this is their last

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.060
meeting.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.509
When he asks her whom he will have to talk
to for his medication, she has nothing to

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:55.969
say except for an apology.

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:59.909
Later at night, Arthur is behind the scenes
at a bar, waiting for his turn to present

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:01.499
his stand-up routine.

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:03.120
Sophie is among the public.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.319
When his time comes, he goes on stage and
starts laughing uncontrollably, and when he

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:11.250
finally manages to read some jokes from his
notebook, they fall flat.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.330
After the show is over, he leaves the bar
with Sophie, and while they walk together,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.589
he sees the newspapers have published a clown
face with the news of the murders, which pleases

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:22.819
him, especially when Sophie comments the clown
is a hero.

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:27.120
When a car drives by, Arthur also notices
someone is wearing a clown mask similar to

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.939
the drawings on the papers.

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:32.849
After having dinner with Sophie, he goes back
to his apartment, where his mother has fallen

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:34.819
asleep in front of the tv.

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:38.289
He wakes her up and sends her to bed, she
tells him she's written a new letter before

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:39.900
entering her room.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.500
Arthur decides to grab the letter to read
it and finds out he's Wayne's illegitimate

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.990
son, which makes him furious with Penny.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.399
She's afraid of his reaction so she locks
herself in the bathroom and speaks from inside,

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:54.039
explaining she and Wayne were in love but
they had to keep appearances, and she couldn't

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:56.539
say anything because she signed some papers.

00:07:56.539 --> 00:08:01.089
The next day, Arthur is reading the newspaper
on the train and finds a picture of the Waynes,

00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:03.569
which he tears off and saves in his notebook.

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:07.389
Moments later, he's visiting the Wayne mansion,
where a young Bruce Wayne is playing in the

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:08.389
garden.

00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:11.879
The kid approaches the gate when Arthur comes
closer and starts performing some magic for

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:14.069
him, but Bruce isn't impressed.

00:08:14.069 --> 00:08:17.659
After asking his name, Arthur reaches through
the gate and puts his fingers in Bruce's mouth

00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:19.039
to make him smile.

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:22.620
They're suddenly interrupted by Alfred, who
pushes Bruce aside and threatens to call the

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.719
police.

00:08:23.719 --> 00:08:27.289
Arthur tells him he's Penny's son and that
he wants to see Mr. Wayne because he knows

00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:31.210
everything, Alfred replies his mother was
delusional and laughs at him.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.740
Angry, Arthur reaches through the gates again
and tries to choke him but lets go of him

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.209
when he sees Bruce.

00:08:36.209 --> 00:08:39.639
When he makes it home in the evening, he finds
paramedics taking his mother to the hospital,

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:42.440
and he gets in the ambulance to go with her.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.990
Some hours later, while waiting outside the
hospital, Arthur is approached by two cops.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.339
They had been talking to Penny when she had
the stroke, and now they want to interrogate

00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:52.310
Arthur about the subway murders.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.370
He tells them his gun was just a prop before
going back to his mom.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.990
In the room, Sophie is keeping him company.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.980
After she leaves, Arthur puts on the Franklin
show on tv, and he's hurt to see they're showing

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.740
clips of his stand-up routine to make fun
of him.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.670
Later on, when he's back in his apartment,
the tv news shows that people are rioting

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.250
while wearing clown masks because Wayne called
them clowns.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.850
Arthur decides to join these protests, and
when he gets there, he takes advantage of

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:20.020
a fight between cops and civilians to sneak
inside the building Wayne is currently at,

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.519
which is a movie theatre.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:25.690
He steals an employee's uniform and puts it
on to access the auditorium, watching the

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.080
movie while keeping an eye on Wayne.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.710
When he leaves the room, Arthur follows him
into the bathroom and confronts him about

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:32.710
Penny.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.779
Wayne says she was crazy and he never touched
her, Arthur was actually adopted.

00:09:36.779 --> 00:09:41.040
Arthur doesn't believe this and gets angry,
causing him to laugh; Wayne punches him for

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.149
it before leaving.

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:45.870
When Arthur returns to his apartment, he ignores
a call from the cops and gets inside the fridge

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.459
to spend the night in it.

00:09:47.459 --> 00:09:51.130
The next day, he gets a call from Franklin's
production asking if he would like to appear

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.899
in the show, he obviously accepts.

00:09:53.899 --> 00:09:57.880
Afterward, he takes the bus to the Arkham
State Hospital, where he asks for his mother's

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.880
file.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.129
The clerk confirms she was psychotic and hurt
her child, but he can't give the file to Arthur,

00:10:03.129 --> 00:10:06.209
so he steals it and runs away with it to read
it while hiding.

00:10:06.209 --> 00:10:10.790
The file confirms Arthur was adopted and Penny
lied about Wayne, she also raised Arthur along

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.970
with an abusive boyfriend that got arrested
later.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:18.459
Incredibly upset by this news, Arthur returns
home and enters Sophie's apartment unannounced.

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:22.100
When Sophie finds him, she gets scared and
asks him to leave, and as Arthur remembers

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.920
the time they spent together, we learn it
all had been his imagination.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.569
The next day, while visiting Penny, he tells
her his life is a comedy and not a tragedy

00:10:30.569 --> 00:10:32.899
before suffocating her with a pillow.

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:36.360
Later on, Arthur is at his place getting ready
for the show.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.880
After practicing what he's going to say, he
dyes his hair green and starts applying his

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.589
make-up, but he's interrupted by the doorbell.

00:10:42.589 --> 00:10:46.019
He grabs a pair of scissors and hides them
in his pants before opening the door to find

00:10:46.019 --> 00:10:49.779
Gary and Randall, who come to visit him after
hearing of Penny's death.

00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:53.690
Randall is worried because the cops have been
interrogating clowns and Arthur has his gun,

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.890
Arthur responds by stabbing him with the scissors
and punching him.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.460
Gary freaks out and wants to leave, Arthur
lets him go without hurting him because he

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.829
was the only one that was ever nice to him.

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:06.720
After changing into a new suit, Arthur leaves
for the show, and he's found by the cops on

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.770
the street.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.480
He starts running away and enters the subway,
which is filled with people going to the protests

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.790
with clown masks.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.590
The cops follow him there, jumping from car
to car, and when Arthur steals a clown mask

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.750
from a guy, he causes a fight to start.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:23.120
Amidst all this confusion, the cops accidentally
shoot a civilian, so when the subway stops

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:28.220
at the station, everyone is jumping on the
officers, allowing Arthur to escape unnoticed.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.440
Moments later, he makes it to the studio.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.550
While waiting in the dressing room, Franklin
comes by to check on him and ask him for a

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.779
clean show.

00:11:34.779 --> 00:11:39.060
Arthur accepts and promises his clown make-up
isn't political, he also asks to be introduced

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.340
as "Joker".

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.940
Soon afterward, he's called to the stage,
which he enters dancing.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.100
After kissing another guest and reassuring
them once more that his make-up is not political,

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.209
he tries to tell a joke about death, which
he's scolded for, then he admits being the

00:11:52.209 --> 00:11:55.319
subway killer because he has nothing left
to lose.

00:11:55.319 --> 00:11:58.600
After a long speech about the system failing
the little people and how Franklin is the

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.129
same for having brought him to the show to
make fun of him, Arthur shoots him on camera.

00:12:03.129 --> 00:12:06.600
After the transmission is cut off, Arthur
is arrested by the cops.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.100
While being taken away in a police car, he
sees all the riots in the streets with people

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.579
wearing clown masks.

00:12:11.579 --> 00:12:14.990
He's calling it all beautiful when the car
is suddenly hit by an ambulance, knocking

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.990
him out.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.779
The protester that had been driving the ambulance
comes out and finds Arthur, so with the help

00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:23.920
of other mask-wearers, they take him out of
the car and put him on top of the hood.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.769
Meanwhile, in another part of town, the Waynes
are leaving a theater when a protester follows

00:12:28.769 --> 00:12:29.769
them.

00:12:29.769 --> 00:12:33.340
After telling Wayne he deserves it, he shoots
him and his wife, leaving little Bruce alone

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.250
with the bodies of his parents.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.720
Back to Arthur, he's now waking up and finding
the protesters clapping and whooping for him,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.110
so Arthur stands up on top of the car to do
a little dance for them.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:47.310
When he notices the blood coming out of his
nose, he uses it to draw a bigger smile around

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.420
his mouth.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.010
Days later, we find Arthur has been sent to
the Arkham State Hospital.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:56.839
While the therapist checks on him, he starts
laughing, so she asks him what's so funny,

00:12:56.839 --> 00:12:59.970
but he replies she wouldn't get it and starts
singing "That's life".

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:04.029
The movie ends when, a moment afterward, Arthur
is seen leaving the room and dancing in the

00:13:04.029 --> 00:13:13.259
hallway, leaving bloody footprints behind.
