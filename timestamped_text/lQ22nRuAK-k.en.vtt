franchise and where I think it's going
I<00:00:11.429><c> personally</c><00:00:11.910><c> do</c><00:00:12.150><c> like</c><00:00:12.300><c> the</c><00:00:12.389><c> first</c><00:00:12.599><c> one</c><00:00:12.780><c> more</c>

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
I personally do like the first one more
 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.539 align:start position:0%
I personally do like the first one more
than<00:00:13.049><c> the</c><00:00:13.170><c> second</c><00:00:13.530><c> one</c><00:00:13.679><c> but</c><00:00:13.920><c> if</c><00:00:14.040><c> my</c><00:00:14.190><c> theory</c>

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 align:start position:0%
than the second one but if my theory
 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.580 align:start position:0%
than the second one but if my theory
serves<00:00:14.910><c> to</c><00:00:15.089><c> be</c><00:00:15.210><c> correct</c><00:00:15.690><c> then</c><00:00:16.109><c> things</c><00:00:16.410><c> are</c>

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 align:start position:0%
serves to be correct then things are
 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.519 align:start position:0%
serves to be correct then things are
about<00:00:16.680><c> to</c><00:00:16.800><c> get</c><00:00:17.010><c> a</c><00:00:17.070><c> lot</c><00:00:17.400><c> more</c><00:00:17.430><c> fast</c><00:00:18.240><c> and</c><00:00:18.539><c> furious</c>
