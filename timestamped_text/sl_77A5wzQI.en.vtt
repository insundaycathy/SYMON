00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.230
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.970
Today I will show you a sci-fi thriller film
from 2011, titled Limitless.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.170
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.940
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.860
There's loud banging on a metal door, leading
to a fancy apartment with boxed up belongings.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.760
A tiny tour of the high-end apartment complex
reveals two dead bodies.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.040
And on top of the building, standing right
on the edge of a balcony, is Eddie.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.570
He takes one foot off the edge and he hears
two gunshots in the next apartment over.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.029
His neighbor must have checked on the noise.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.809
Someone is screaming in front of Eddie's door
to be let in.

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.350
Eddie's disappointed in himself.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.160
Does he jump?

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.050
A little over a year earlier, Eddie is walking
down the street, looking completely different.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.730
He says he's a writer.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.019
Drinking midday in a bar, he's telling two
guys about his novel, for which no one believes

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:48.809
he has a contract for.

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.699
It's a question if he believes it himself.

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.239
Later, he's seen writing.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.709
Trying to write.

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:55.859
Procrastinating.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.069
Until he finally leaves his apartment and
goes out to drink again.

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.469
A few weeks, if not even months, pass with
him not writing a single word.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.570
Eventually, his girlfriend Lindy leaves him.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.740
Eddie thinks it's out of the blue, but she
clearly doesn't.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.020
He gets ready to propose to her, but she reminds
him of the last time he was married, to Melissa.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.110
That marriage didn't work out that well.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.200
Later, he's walking home, feeling bad about
himself in general, when he sees his ex-brother-in-law,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.390
Vernon.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.460
Eddie's not excited to see him.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.800
After a little chit chat, where they both
lie to each other a bit about what they're

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.950
doing, Vernon convinces him to have a drink
together.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.290
They go to a bar and he tells him about how
Melissa is doing.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.930
Then they start talking about Eddie's "creative
problems" and Vernon suggests he can help

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.930
him.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.950
He shows him the drug he's selling.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.640
It's some kind of magic designer drug that
supposedly can help you access your whole

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.650
brain.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.770
Eddie doesn't think it can help him.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.700
Vernon needs to leave, so he gives him his
business card and a sample of the expensive

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.180
drug for free.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.100
On his walk home, Eddie is still wallowing
in self-loathing, when he decides to take

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.159
the drug.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.890
He walks into his building and immediately
runs into his landlord's wife Valerie who

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.890
hates him.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.240
As she's screaming at him, his mind is racing,
wondering about the effects of the drug, when

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.709
it finally hits.

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.849
Suddenly, he starts noticing everything that
he previously wouldn't have.

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.930
The little things all around him, the little
things about her.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.760
At one point, he asks her what's wrong, catching
her off guard.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.659
They start talking about her studies, as he
begins accessing different memories in his

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.170
mind that he didn't even knew he remembered.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.599
He offers to help with her essay as she starts
warming up to him.

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.129
And when the essay is done, they have intercourse.

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.680
He walks into his apartment and suddenly realizes
how filthy and disgusting it is.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.739
So he starts cleaning and fixing it up, putting
everything in its place, until it looks like

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.019
an actual place someone would live in.

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.660
The drug has made his mind perfectly clear.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.999
So he does the one thing he knows he should
be doing with a clear mind, writing.

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.430
And this time, he's actually doing it.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.769
The next morning, Eddie wakes up and feels
that the drug has completely wore off.

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.549
The good news is that he still has the pages
he's written from his novel, so he goes to

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.159
see his publisher.

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.359
Eddie asks her to read the unfinished manuscript
and promises to return the advance if she

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:08.450
doesn't like it.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.680
As soon as he gets home, he has 3 new messages
from her, saying that what she read was brilliant.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.010
Eddie thinks to call her back, but instead
goes to see Vernon.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.170
He opens the doors for him, looking like someone
has roughed him up, and lets him in reluctantly.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.499
Vernon knows why he's there and tells him
that he'll give him more of the drug, but

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:28.120
that first he has to run some errands for
him.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.650
Eddie goes to get his dry cleaning and pick
up some breakfast, but when he comes back

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.819
he finds the apartment door open.

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.280
The place is completely ransacked and Vernon
is on his couch.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.609
Eddie walks over and sees that he's dead.

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.499
He immediately calls the police and while
he waits for them to get there, he realizes

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:47.459
that the people that were apparently looking
for the drugs, never found them.

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.629
So he gets to looking for himself.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.159
Eddie ultimately finds the drugs, as well
as Vernon's black book and some money.

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.180
Suddenly the police are at the door.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.939
Later, he's being questioned in a police station.

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.840
The detective is suspicious of Eddie and his
story.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.299
Melissa calls the detective's desk and asks
to speak to Eddie.

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.450
She tells him that she doesn't want him at
Vernon's funeral and that she'll call him

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.139
when all of it is over.

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.700
Eddie leaves the police station, paranoid
that he's being followed.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.370
He gets home, counts the money and takes one
tablet, which kicks off a montage of him completely

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.120
rediscovering himself and the power of the
drug.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.950
First, he gets a haircut and new clothes.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.890
Finishes his novel and delivers it to his
publisher.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.240
He learns the piano in 3 days and also learns
to speak new languages with little effort,

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.210
then uses them to pick up women.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.800
Suddenly, he can use math to win at poker.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.060
He knows what combination of drugs his aunt
with cancer needs.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.970
He can talk business with Wall Street types
and impress everyone with his wit.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.420
He even gets an offer to work for one of them.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.820
Eddie makes new friends, rich ones with private
jets and poolside manors that he vacations

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.820
with.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.590
But he starts getting reckless and he needs
more and more adrenaline rushes.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.150
At some point, he has an epiphany of what
he needs to do and it's not writing.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.680
We see him back at his apartment, looking
at the trade numbers and taking the drug.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.670
He needs money for what he wants to do and
investing in trades isn't enough.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.030
Eddie looks for a loan shark at a diner.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.050
He convinces him to give him 100 thousand
dollars.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.730
They meet for the drop at a park and the loan
shark tells him what will happen if he doesn't

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.830
return the money.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.070
Later, he takes the job offered to him earlier
and quickly figures out how to double his

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.650
money investing.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.080
Eddie gets noticed by the bigger players in
the finance game and he gets a meeting with

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.180
one of them.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.280
He tells Lindy about it over dinner and impresses
her by ordering in Italian.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.890
He apologizes to her and tries to charm her,
to win her back.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.990
They get back together and start seeing each
other again.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.970
As time goes by and he becomes more successful,
he gets the feeling he's being followed.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.240
One night, as he's in his apartment with Lindy,
he starts feeling strange.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.350
The next day, him and his boss have a lunch
meeting with Carl Van Loon.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.030
Eddie explains his grandiose pattern recognition
abilities and tries to impress the man.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.930
He gets a ride home from him and in the car
Van Loon hands him some documents, telling

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.520
him to look them over.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.390
When they reach his place, Eddie gives him
an evaluation of what he's read.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.440
The man is impressed and sets up another meeting
with him.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.970
Eddie's too energized to go home, so he takes
a walk, planning his future, thinking he could

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.920
even be president one day.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.170
Suddenly, he starts feeling strange again,
as if time started to move completely different.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.530
So he keeps walking and walking until he reaches
a bar, unaware of how he got there.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.410
Then he's at a party with one girl and next
in a hotel with another.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.400
He thinks he's being followed.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.500
Later he starts a fight in the subway, realizing
that he's learned how to fight just by watching

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.060
Kung Fu movies and boxing on TV.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.740
He runs throughout the city and suddenly finds
himself on top of a bridge, where he stops,

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.120
without being able to recall the last 18 hours
of his life.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.500
Eddie wakes up the next day feeling horrible.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.950
He decides not to take another tablet and
tries to go through the documents sent to

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.870
him by Van Loon, but they seem illegible.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.520
Eddie goes to the meeting sober and unprepared.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.590
Van Loon keeps asking him questions expecting
high level answers from him, but all Eddie

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.740
can focus on is the TV, where the news are
reporting that the woman he was in the hotel

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.990
with is dead.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.830
He leaves the meeting abruptly.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.940
When he gets home, the phone rings.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.370
It's Melissa.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.740
He asks her to meet him later that day.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.960
Eddie remembers Vernon's black book and starts
calling the people from the list.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.710
Everyone on the list is either dead or terribly
sick.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.990
The last number he dials belongs to the man
who followed him and who's sitting on the

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.590
same bench with him.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.710
Eddie sees him and runs, as the man chases
after him.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.570
He finally looses him by going inside a cab.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.300
He meets with Melissa and she tells him that
she had also been on the drug and barely made

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.730
it out alive when she stopped using it.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:42.020
She notices that he's been taking it too and
tells him to go off it slowly, otherwise it

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.280
could be lethal.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.890
Eddie keeps getting worse as he comes back
home, where the loan shark is waiting for

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:47.890
him.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.540
The man takes his last tablet and ingests
it.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.920
As Eddie is grabbing the money he owes him
from the bank the man seems unaffected by

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.150
the drug.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:59.170
Eddie gives him his money and he says he feels
great, but there are no noticeable changes

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.900
to his intelligence yet.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.750
Later, Eddie stumbles into Lindy's office.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.880
He tells her everything and asks her to get
him the drugs he's hidden in her apartment.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.650
Lindy gets there and finds them easily, but
as she's getting back to the office she calls

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.350
Eddie and tells him that there is a man following
her.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.990
Her cab gets stuck in traffic and the man
is seen coming up to her.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.260
Eddie tells her to run and the man chases
after her too.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.139
Lindy runs into a park and asks two guys to
help her.

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:28.040
The man walks up to them and stabs them both
as she runs away again.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.580
Lindy hides and calls Eddie, tells him that
she's stuck and afraid.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.669
He tells her to take one of the tablets and
she does it.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:37.060
Suddenly the drug takes effect on Lindy too.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.400
She goes through the same thing Eddie did
when he first took it and instantly starts

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.150
running away, knowing exactly what to do.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.440
The man follows her every step, until she
incapacitates him and escapes.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.640
Lindy gets to Eddie and gives him a tablet.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.620
They check into a hotel together.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.260
The following morning Lindy is getting ready
to leave and Eddie tries to persuade her that

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.640
he'll be get on track.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.230
But, after taking the drug herself, she disagrees.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.550
He sees the good sides of the drug, while
she is scared of it.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.930
Eddie tells her that he will eventually get
off the drug, but she leaves regardless.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.200
Eddie sees the loan shark waiting for him
and he goes up to him.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.450
The man wants more drugs so he gives him a
few to hold him over.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:19.660
Later, he hires two bodyguards that follow
him everywhere and he goes to see Van Loon.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.920
Eddie apologizes about the meeting, explaining
he was sick, but he had already won the man

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.330
over before, so Van Loon still gives him the
job.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.580
He brokers the biggest merger in history for
Van Loom and gets back on his feet.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.650
Not waiting around until his stash of the
drug runs out, he goes to a chemist and tells

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:39.570
him that he'll give him 2 million dollars
if he recreates it in 6 months.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.410
While Eddie's having lunch one day, the detective
comes to see him.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.700
He tells him that he's been identified as
the man running out of the hotel when the

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.170
young woman was killed.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.340
So, Eddie hires the top lawyer to bail him
out.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.250
Later, he's at a big meeting for the merger
with Van Loon, when he notices that one of

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.500
the men, Atwood, from the opposing side is
sick.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.650
They will reconvene to sign the contract the
next day.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:06.290
After the meeting, Eddie talks to Van Loon
and he threatens him not to make him his competition,

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.580
explaining that whatever makes him that good
at his job is a gift, not something earned

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.240
through hard work.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.580
Eddie goes back to the hotel, finding his
room trashed.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.910
He buys the fancy apartment that was seen
in the beginning of the film.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.440
Later, he runs into the loan shark again,
who's completely transformed.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.850
He tells Eddie to bring him more tablets or
he'll tell his boss about his trouble with

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.020
the police.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.290
The next day, Van Loon and Eddie are waiting
for Atwood to come in and sign the documents

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.670
for the merger.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.510
When he doesn't show up, his wife comes to
their offices to tell them that he's sick,

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.190
but as soon as he's better he will sign the
contract.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.820
The two of them walk her out and as she's
going into the car Eddie sees that the man

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.640
who's been following him is getting inside
the car with her.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.830
Her husband was sick because of the drug.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:51.230
Eddie meets his lawyer in a police station
and gets into a line up.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.630
Thankfully, he doesn't get picked out.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.770
He leaves the loan shark waiting and instead
goes back to the Van Loon office, who's watching

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:58.920
the news.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.860
They're reporting about the merger.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.670
His new boss is angry about it, but tells
him that Atwood is dying.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.470
He's worried about the merger.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:11.480
Eddie realizes that he needs to take another
tablet and leaves, but can't find his stash.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.810
He comes back to the office, when a package
comes for him.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:18.790
As Van Loon keeps pushing for information
he thinks Eddie has, he opens the package

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.880
to find the severed hands of his bodyguards
inside.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.460
He rushes out and goes back to his apartment.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:28.120
There he listens to the news where Atwood's
wife is giving a statement, rather lying about

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.330
the merger.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.660
Her lawyer takes over the interview, which
is also his lawyer.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.810
The doorbell rings and it's the loan shark,
asking him to open the door.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.310
Next, Eddie is seen standing on the edge of
his balcony.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.620
He doesn't jump.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:46.250
He tries to remember where he could've left
one more tablet and scrambles to find one.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.060
When he does, he ends up dropping it in the
same moment that the loan shark walks into

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.400
his apartment.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.630
His goons grab Eddie and sit him down, as
the he explains that he uses the drug dissolved

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.230
in a solution and injected through a vein.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:03.180
He shoots up and tells his men to find Eddie's
stash, while he tortures him for the information.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.860
The goons are trying to open up his safe,
so they don't hear when Eddie stabs their

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.710
boss as he leans over.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:12.130
He kills him, then drinks his blood to get
a fix of the drug.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.010
It works, so he knows how to fight off the
goons.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.940
He takes down one of them and then the other.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.950
Meanwhile, Atwood dies at the hospital.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:23.240
Eddie goes there and is seen sitting down
next to the man who followed him.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.730
Later, the same man helps him find more drugs
in the apartment of the lawyer, who took Atwood's

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.140
stash for himself.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:33.290
Twelve months later, Eddie has a book out
and is running for the senate.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.430
Van Loon is waiting in his office.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.180
They chat a little, but Van Loon tells him
that he knows about the drug.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.880
He tells him that he shut down his lab that
morning and that he can supply him with the

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.380
drug in the future if he agrees to work for
him.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.180
They leave the office to get lunch together,
but Eddie refuses to get in the car as well

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.970
as work with Van Loon.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.310
Eddie tells him that he learned how to change
the drug, how to get off it while keeping

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.260
all of the positive effects.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.630
He can see everything, he's unstoppable.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:04.660
Eddie refuses any possibility to work with
Van Loon and sends him on his way.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:11.770
He walks to a restaurant and meets with Lindy
there.
