Today we are checking out one of the goriest
anime in existence in the form of Corpse Party

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.030
Tortured Souls.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.100
This anime is based on the long living series
of games titled Corpse Party in which a group

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.710
of young high school kids get stuck in a closed
down elementary school in another dimension

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.010
filled with blood thirsty child spirits!

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.600
and leave disturbed so finish the food, lets
get into the breakdown!

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.280
The 
story starts out with little girls laughing.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.890
Then we cut to another girl who finds herself
in some random classroom.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.690
She notices a slip of paper and then we go
into a flashback where we see a group of kids

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.690
telling storys.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.329
The storyteller is Ayumi Shinozaki, the scaredy
cat is Satoshi, the sexy short hair cutie

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.580
is Naomi, the girl with the two balls on her
head is Mayu, four eyes is Morishige, Naomi's

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.920
best friend is Seiko, and the delinquent is
Yoshiki.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.040
The teacher is Ms. Yui and she scares the
group of kids.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.509
Along with her is Satoshi's little sister
Yuka.

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.859
Since Mayu is leaving schools, the group desides
to begin some friendship game.

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:20.929
They start the cham where they have to say
Sachiko san nine times and they all have to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:21.990
pull a piece from that paper.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.450
As long as they have it, they will always
be friends.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.869
Then randomly the school starts shaking violently
and in response the group all fall through

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:29.869
the floor.

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.679
Naoi wakes up and finds Seiko in the same
room and they express curiousness at the weird

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.280
situation they are in.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.639
Naomi happened to sprain her leg in that fall
but as the two are walking, we see a long-haired

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:40.969
figure behind them.

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:46.969
Seiko starts being all lesbany and Naomi gives
Seiko some ass-medicine when we hear some

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:47.969
Engrish.

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:49.189
Seiko: "Oh, Thank You".

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.609
Naomi gets surprised by Seiko too look at
that face!

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.539
The two discover that its an elementary school
and we get more background info trying to

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.969
get us to be shocked more when these characters
die.

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.090
They go to the infirmary and Seiko wraps up
Naomi's leg.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.939
We get more character development in the bed
and then Seiko reveals she left her friendship

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.010
slip and leaves Naomi behind.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.340
Naomi gets paralyzed by a bell and she sees
that her room is all haunted.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.690
Then a spirit starts fondling her and back
with Seiko, who is wondering about Naomi,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.430
she see's that somebody had a very bad day.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.030
Naomi hears Seiko's screams and breaks free.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.340
She tries throwing a chair at the ghost and
realizes the door is covered in hair as the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.690
scary ghost asks where Saa Chan is going.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.560
She breaks free, but then notices a very dead
body.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.230
Then she sees a red dress demon girl behind
her and she opens her mouth as blood drips

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.230
out.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.490
Seiko finds Naomi and then WTF Naomi!

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.330
Naomi starts screaming at Seiko for not being
there.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.010
Clearly an amount of verbal anger that Seiko
didn't deserve directed at her.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.260
Seiko runs away thinking Naomi is tripping,
then hears someone calling for her.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.840
Naomi finds a gorey staircase and finds Seiko's
lost lipstick.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.270
Then she finds Seiko's hanging body in a bathroom
stall and she's still alive, but Naomi gets

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.540
all stupid trying to save her friend, when
all she has to do is put herself under her.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.870
She grabs a bucket full of guts, but Seiko
dies, and Naomi ends the episode in her cries.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.510
Episode Two starts off with just murder as
someone explains a curse that causes people

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.510
to go crazy.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.970
Then a girl in glasses, Naho, tells Naomi
that Seiko killed herself to protect herself

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.040
from the curse, and now Naomi will die all
alone.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.440
We see Morishige trying to escape but Naho
explains he can't as he asks about Mayu's

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.440
location.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.710
Then it cuts to Satoshi and Yuka reading about
the school's history, but Yuka has something

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.710
to say.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.090
Satoshi and Yuka try finding a bathroom and
Yuka keeps talking in first person.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.120
They find Morishige taking pictures of a wall
with exploded remains all over it.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.410
Then they split up for some reason, its like
they don't know that if you in a fucked situation,

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.990
the best thing to do is stay together.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.920
Next it cuts to Yoshiki and Shinozaki and
she feels like her heads about to explode.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.730
Then they notice a weird ghost boy and heï¿½s
about to Bruce Lee them but then the boy disappears.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.630
Then Naho comes up and Shinozaki recognizes
her.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.319
Naho explains that 4 kids spirits created
an unescapable void in the Heavenly Host Elementary

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.319
School.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.260
Naho says they should try appeasing the spirts
by finding the killer, then the two learn

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.540
that all the students are in different closed
spaces and won't be able to meet each other.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.209
Yui sensei reads more about some child murders
that took place at the school, you're about

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.150
to see the victims of what that paper entails.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.240
She sees Mayu talking to the kids that she
was just reading about and that's exactly

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.289
how they were killed.

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:29.410
Yui sensei tries to save Mayu from the vengeful
spirits, but instead the spirits grab Mayu

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.419
by the legs and drag her with superhuman speed
and smash her into a wall as Yui sensei looks

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:35.430
on horrified.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.099
Then we see her balls is all that's left.

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.370
Then suddenly a man sneaks up and KO's the
unaware teacher.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.419
Morishige sits and cries still wondering where
Mayu is, but he doesn't realize he is actually

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.800
looking right at her.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.169
He gets a call telling him don't look at my
insides which is Mayu from the grave which

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.550
causes him to breakdown.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.620
Satoshi and Yuka then get led by that demon
girl in the ed dress.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.249
They get led outside as Yuka struggles to
hold her pee.

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:04.969
Satoshi's dumbass lets Yuka go with the demon
girl to the bathroom, yes you heard it right,

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.509
Satoshi is a bucket of fuck who lets his bloodline
be in danger with the antagonist of the movie,

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:14.050
idgaf if she looked like Dora, Satoshi shoulda
watched her pee damnit.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.800
Yuka tries using the bathroom and the demon
girl leaves her behind and she gets scared

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.090
by a spirit girl.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.910
The two siblings then get separated and Demon
Dress girl surprises Satoshi as Yuka cries

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.110
for her brother.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.289
Next it cuts to Shinozaki and Yoshiki walking
with a doll that supposedly belongs to the

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:30.289
killer.

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.629
The doll starts talking, apparently apologizing
for the murders.

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:38.559
They find the dead spirits boy pack from earlier
and he appears and asks for it back by suffocating

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:45.259
Shinozaki, but she uses the boys tongue to
get him to stop which releases the boy from

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:46.259
the void and into the heavens.

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.210
The duo try to figure out how they will appease
the spirits, but then it cuts to Yuka trying

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.650
to find her brother but she runs into a crazy
Morishige hitting a corpse.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.659
He tries helping her but his definition of
help is on some pedophile shit.

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:02.499
Yuka hides under some floorboards, but then
Uchiha Sauske, I mean Kizami, a random student

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:03.879
offers help to Yuka.

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:09.810
They run into Morishige but Kizami literally
destroys him effortlessly before turning crazy

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:10.870
himself.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.680
And that ends the first two episodes of Corpse
Party Tortured Souls.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.309

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:23.069
in those.

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:26.879
Anyway if you still watching, lets go over
the most disturbed moment and most enjoyed

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:29.219
moment is that Spooky Stuff.

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:33.870
Okay let's get right into it.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.719
The most Disturbed moment goes to Mayu's death.

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:40.500
The characters do have some history behind
them, and as nice as they are I don't think

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.629
Mayu deserved to get thrown into a wall like
that.

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:48.479
Although the real disturbed part is the fact
that shes stuck in that void forever, and

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:49.479
will possibly be feeling that death for all
eternity.

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:50.830
The most enjoyed moment is Seiko's cuteness.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.830
I wish she lived longer cuz I love me some
Seiko.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.090
