Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:07.020
Today, I'm going to explain an adventure,
drama, sci-fi film called “Chronicle.”

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.380
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.480
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.190
Andrew is a high schooler living in Seattle
with his sick mother and abusive father.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.120
Andrew is an outcast, having little to no
friends and being relatively unknown at his

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.120
school.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.769
Tired of his father’s abuse, Andrew decides
to buy a camera as a sort of deterrent for

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:25.010
his father.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.990
Andrew tells his father that he’ll be recording
everything from this point on.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.010
Andrew visits his bedridden mother, Karen,
and she wishes him a good day at school.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.239
Andrew’s cousin and closest friend, Matt,
picks up Andrew, and they both head to school.

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.870
Matt gives Andrew nuggets of wisdom from philosophers
he’s been reading on, and Andrew teases

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.870
him.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.640
Andrew spends some time recording his school,
showing the camera where he eats and hangs

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.640
out.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.600
Some teenagers bully Andrew and take his camera
away, teasing him.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.150
They eventually give it back after ridiculing
him.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.430
On their way home, Matt invites Andrew to
a party, but Andrew declines.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.219
Matt is adamant about making Andrew come,
thinking that some time outside can be good

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.380
for him.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.300
Andrew reluctantly agrees.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.110
At home, Andrew looks through his recording
when his father, Richard, barges in.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.680
Richard smacks Andrew across the face, pushing
him to the floor.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.570
Richard angrily tells Andrew that he’s to
do what he’s told.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.940
Matt and Andrew later arrive at the party
and split up.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.560
Andrew records the party, seeing people having
fun and dancing.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.240
He then spots Casey, a girl who also records
her day for her vlog.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.610
Matt steps in and awkwardly tries to impress
Casey, again dropping philosophical jargon.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.990
Andrew gets into some trouble when a guy accuses
Andrew of filming his girlfriend.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.960
Andrew steps out of the party and heads to
the parking lot.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.830
He cries as he cleans the dirt off of his
camera.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.421
Andrew is frustrated, feeling like he doesn’t
belong in the crowd.

00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:48.020
Steve, the popular kid, running for class
president, calls out to Andrew and invites

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.140
him to join him and his friends.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.640
Steve says he and Matt had found something
in the woods and asks Andrew to film what

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.640
they’ve discovered.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.320
Andrew joins Steve, and they arrive at a hole
in the middle of a clearing.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.240
They hear strange sounds coming from the pit,
and Steve dives in to explore.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.840
They explore deeper into the hole and find
a cavern containing a massive glowing crystal.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.220
It starts humming, and everything begins shaking
before turning black.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.150
Several weeks later, Matt, Steve, and Andrew
are in a backyard where they throw a baseball

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.480
at each other.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.810
When Matt throws the ball at Steve, the ball
swerves right and hits Steve sideways.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.140
Matt then throws the ball at Andrew, and Andrew
stops the ball mid-air with his mind.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.140
Andrew’s nose starts bleeding, and he drops
it.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.980
The three then play with Lego pieces inside
and levitate the pieces without touching them.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.800
It appears that the mysterious crystal has
given them the power of telekinesis.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.210
Later, they decide to return to the hole but
see dirt has wholly filled it in.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.410
Authorities also arrive and tell the boys
to keep away from the spot.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.030
On their ride home, Steve and Andrew talk
about their families.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.170
Andrew tells Steve about his mom, and his
father who used to be a fireman.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.160
An accident had injured Richard, and he now
stays at home and collects insurance checks

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.690
from the government.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.670
Steve also shares some problems at home with
his parents.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.810
At home, Andrew practices levitating his camera.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.840
He hears his father on the phone, begging
someone for more medical aid for Karen.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.410
Richard says he can no longer afford Karen’s
medication, but her situation is getting worse.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.540
The next day, Andrew takes Karen out for a
stroll in the marina, and the pair enjoy a

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.780
lovely time out.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.200
Later, the boys are again outside, practicing
their powers, throwing stones at a lake.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.380
Andrew asks Matt if he likes him, and Matt
says he does, but he used to find Andrew hard

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.090
to communicate with.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.090
Andrew then asks him if he thinks they can
do more with their powers.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.060
At school, Matt theorizes that their power
is equitable to a muscle that they have to

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.819
improve for it to get stronger.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.580
The night before, he says he could lift up
his bed off the ground without getting a nosebleed.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.430
If they lift something up too heavy or try
to do something too complicated, it would

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.400
strain their power, and their nose would start
to bleed.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.680
He suggests a slow progression to improve
their strength.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.520
Andrew then suggests heading somewhere public
to practice their abilities, and they decide

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.980
to do it at a supermarket.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.040
They each begin messing with people, doing
harmless pranks.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.060
Andrew makes a grocery cart roll away, Steve
scares a child by levitating a stuffed animal,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.640
and Matt tries to get a piece of gum out of
a person’s mouth but ends up whacking them

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.690
instead.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.900
At a diner, Andrew tries stabbing Matt with
a fork to show how their powers can even protect

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.510
them from sharp objects and projectiles.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.910
Andrew then manifests an image of the Virgin
Mary on his pancake pate, scaring one of the

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.020
waitresses.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.990
The boys are having a fun time, using their
powers foolishly.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.070
At the parking lot, Steve tries pranking a
woman.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.410
He successfully moves her car to a different
parking spot.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.380
Matt and Andrew are impressed, noting that
this is probably the heaviest any of them

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.650
have ever lifted.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.000
Steve’s nose starts bleeding profusely,
but he maintains he feels fine.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.720
The woman returns, and they all laugh at her
confusion.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.000
Later, they’re on a drive home when a truck
behind them starts honking.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.120
Andrew steps in, aiming to make the pick-up
truck swerve a little, but ends up putting

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.600
too much force.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.460
The truck veers off the road into a ravine
and falling into a river.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.940
The boys rush out to help, and Steven dives
into the water to retrieve the driver.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.130
They then call the police.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.990
Steve is visibly shaken by what happened,
and Matt confronts Andrew.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.790
Andrew seems aloof and distant as Matt talks
down to him, saying he’s put someone in

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.150
grave danger.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.139
Matt says their powers are getting stronger
and harder to control and proposes implementing

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.340
rules.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.110
The following day, they meet up with Steve
at a landfill and see that he’s levitating

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.210
above them.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.210
He encourages them to try it out.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.160
Matt goes first but has trouble getting himself
off the ground, faceplanting several times.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.850
Andrew tries next and gets himself up, ecstatic
that he can float.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.120
He joins Steven, and they both cheer.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.120
Later, the boys are soaring through the clouds.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.440
They all speed through the sky, flying past
one another at neck-breaking speeds.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.690
They even start throwing a football, catching
it midair.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.010
They slow down, floating above when a plane
suddenly flies past them.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.840
Steve gets knocked out, and Andrew flies in
to save him.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.170
He grabs Steve, but they keep falling.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.310
Andrew slows them both down seconds before
hitting the ground, and they both end up unscathed.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.630
Matt joins them, and they all start laughing
and cheering among themselves, elated knowing

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.190
they’re the first humans to fly.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.120
They then gather for a sleepover at Steve’s
house, and Andrew tells them that the day

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.919
has been the best day of his entire life.

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.040
The next day at school, they plan to go on
a trip around the world, flying to their dream

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.600
destinations.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.370
Steve says he’s planning a weekend trip
to Hawaii, and Andrew says he wants to go

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.669
to Tibet, thinking how beautiful and tranquil
it is, saying that the monks there have achieved

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:33.310
a high level of enlightenment.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.560
Matt later meets with Casey, handing her a
donation.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.690
He says it’s for the drought she mentioned
in one of her vlogs.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.770
Casey then tells Matt he can just mail it
in himself.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.990
Casey asks Matt the reason for his sudden
change, saying how he used to be too smart

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.880
to hang out with, and now he seems to care
much for world issues and starts hanging out

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.080
with people.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.949
Matt says that he’s changed now, and he
has a better understanding of people.

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:00.919
He tells Casey he wants to hang out with her
too, but Casey closes the door on him.

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:05.550
Andrew and Steve hang out on top of a building,
and Steve is amazed at Andrew’s utilization

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.440
of his power, seeing that he can levitate
his camera with finesse.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.860
Andrew then says that he’s been lonely for
a long time before they got powers.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.120
He’s didn’t even hang out with Matt that
much, even though they’re cousins.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.699
Steve then proposes they enter the school
talent show, telling Andrew he’ll help him

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:21.900
with the performance.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.979
Andrew then prepares for the talent show,
showing off his attire to Karen.

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:29.759
As he heads out, Richard calls him and tells
Andrew he’s suspicious of him.

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:32.180
Richard says he knows Andrew is up to something.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.729
At the talent show, Matt is operating the
camera, and he runs into Casey, who’s also

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:37.770
recording the event.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.060
Steve and Andrew appear onstage and begin
their magic show.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.290
The illusions and tricks are pretty much child’s
play for Andrew, using his telekinetic abilities.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.300
The two put on a great show, their classmates
and schoolmates cheering all throughout the

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.300
performance.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.850
Matt and Andrew then head to a house party
where people all greet him.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:59.229
At last, Andrew experiences how it’s like
to be noticed and appreciated.

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:01.520
The whole ordeal is very validating for him.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.479
Andrew meets a pink-haired girl at the party,
and they start talking and hit it off immediately.

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:09.789
Andrew has fun at the party, and Matt is left
with the camera.

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:13.949
He leaves a sweet message for Andrew, but
Casey spots him and invites him to leave the

00:08:13.949 --> 00:08:14.949
party.

00:08:14.949 --> 00:08:17.539
Steve is then the new cameraman, and he looks
for Andrew.

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:21.890
He goes upstairs to discover that Andrew had
thrown up all over the girl he was with.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.850
Matt comes in laughing, but Andrew doesn’t
take the situation lightly.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.690
He shouts at Andrew, telling him to leave.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.959
The following day, Andrew plays with a spider
before making it levitate and splitting it

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:34.240
into pieces.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.139
Richard is then seen looking through Andrew’s
room, and he sees the camera.

00:08:38.139 --> 00:08:42.159
Richard then confronts Andrew about spending
too much money on a camera while having barely

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.579
any money for his mother’s medication.

00:08:44.579 --> 00:08:48.689
Richard continues shouting at him, and Andrew
answers back, angering Richard.

00:08:48.689 --> 00:08:53.360
Richard then attacks Andrew, pinning him down,
but Andrew fights back, using his powers to

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.620
overpower Richard.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.560
Andrew tells him he can crush him if he wanted
to, then throws him to the floor.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.649
Richard is left moaning and groaning.

00:09:00.649 --> 00:09:04.410
Meanwhile, Matt is with Casey when his nose
starts bleeding even though he hasn’t used

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.069
his powers.

00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:08.899
Andrew is in the middle of a thunderstorm,
crying.

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:13.829
Steve arrives, saying his nose started bleeding,
and he heard Andrew’s voice calling to him.

00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:17.649
Andrew asks Steve to leave him alone, but
Steve tells Andrew to calm down and return

00:09:17.649 --> 00:09:19.060
to the ground.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.519
Andrew gets angrier, and lightning suddenly
strikes.

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:25.449
Time passes, and Andrew records a funeral.

00:09:25.449 --> 00:09:29.089
He sees Casey and Matt attending, as well
as their other classmates.

00:09:29.089 --> 00:09:31.040
Steve had been struck by lightning and died.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.449
Andrew then spots Matt glaring at him.

00:09:33.449 --> 00:09:37.589
After the service, Matt confronts Andrew about
what happened to Steve, questioning how he

00:09:37.589 --> 00:09:41.329
got struck by lightning when there were no
recorded lightning strikes.

00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:45.240
Matt orders Andrew to tell the truth, but
Andrew remains quiet.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.749
He avoids the confrontation and flies away.

00:09:47.749 --> 00:09:51.800
The next day, Andrew is back at Steve’s
grave, apologizing.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.300
He says he didn’t know what happened, and
he must’ve lost control.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.920
He goes back to the pit where they got their
powers and sees it’s now overgrown with

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.269
grass, and a pattern has started forming around
it.

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:06.519
Andrew then heads to school and sees people
ridiculing him for vomiting at the party.

00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:09.910
He sees the pink-haired girl with her friends,
and her friends make fun of him too.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.739
The bully also teases him, mimicking him vomiting.

00:10:12.739 --> 00:10:14.339
Andrew is overcome by anger.

00:10:14.339 --> 00:10:17.449
He approaches the bully and pulls several
of his teeth out.

00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:21.670
At a bathroom stall, he shows the camera the
pieces of teeth and describes how he took

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.740
them.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.949
At a junkyard, Andrew talks to his camera
and speaks about evolution and the concept

00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:28.279
of an apex predator.

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:31.869
He talks about how predators don’t feel
guilt when killing their prey and how humans

00:10:31.869 --> 00:10:35.860
don’t feel guilt when stepping on ants or
squishing flies and mosquitoes.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.970
He equates himself as being a human apex predator.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:43.350
His abilities may bring harm to people, but
for him, that’s just how things are.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.139
He then crushes a car behind him with ease.

00:10:46.139 --> 00:10:49.809
Matt barges into Andrew’s room, finding
out about what happened at school with the

00:10:49.809 --> 00:10:50.809
bully.

00:10:50.809 --> 00:10:54.149
He stresses how important it is for them to
follow their rules as they’re getting too

00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:56.129
powerful for their own good.

00:10:56.129 --> 00:11:00.649
Matt then warns Andrew that he’d have to
step in if Andrew doesn’t stop harming people.

00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:05.329
They get into an argument, and Matt throws
a punch, but Andrew catches his fist.

00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:07.149
Matt then leaves immediately.

00:11:07.149 --> 00:11:11.430
Andrew heads to the pharmacy to get more medication
for his mother, but the pharmacist tells him

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.250
he doesn’t have enough money.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.850
Left with no other choice, Andrew decides
to take more drastic action for his mother.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.930
He takes his father’s old firefighter suit
and goes out to forcefully take money from

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:22.930
people.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.410
He first targets the men on his street who
always make fun of him.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.589
He blasts all of them away, smashing them
into cars and onto the asphalt.

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:34.569
In seconds, he renders all of them unconscious
and takes all their money.

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:38.709
He then goes to a gasoline station, disabling
the cashier and taking all the money in the

00:11:38.709 --> 00:11:40.189
cash register.

00:11:40.189 --> 00:11:44.350
As he makes his way out, the cashier chases
after him with a shotgun.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:48.550
Andrew swipes the shotgun away, and it ends
up firing at a gasoline tank.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.779
The tank explodes, and the cashier and Andrew
are thrown back.

00:11:51.779 --> 00:11:54.350
Andrew catches fire and loses consciousness.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:57.829
Andrew gets admitted to a hospital, and Richard
is called in.

00:11:57.829 --> 00:12:00.670
Richard enters Andrew’s room and starts
crying.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.660
He tells an unconscious Andrew that Karen
had died.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.809
He then blames Andrew for her death as he
thinks she wouldn’t have died if he hadn’t

00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:08.499
been looking for Andrew.

00:12:08.499 --> 00:12:12.829
He starts shouting at Andrew, ordering him
to apologize for Karen’s death.

00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:17.350
His shouting gets louder, and Andrew finally
wakes up, blasting a hole through the hospital

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.350
wall.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.999
Matt is at a birthday party when his nose
starts bleeding.

00:12:20.999 --> 00:12:25.069
He immediately knows something is wrong with
Andrew and sees a news report about an explosion

00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:26.399
at the hospital.

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:29.509
He immediately leaves with Casey driving to
the hospital.

00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:33.339
They reach the hospital and see Andrew picking
up Richard and dropping him.

00:12:33.339 --> 00:12:35.589
Matt swoops in and catches Richard, everyone
seeing him flying.

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:39.800
They get into the car again, but Andrew finds
them and lifts them to the Space Needle before

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.110
dropping them.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.200
Matt gets Casey and flies her down to safety.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.190
People are recording everything on their cellphones,
and police and medical personnel scramble

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.040
to handle the situation.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.489
Matt flies up to Andrew, trying to calm him
down and convince him to stop.

00:12:54.489 --> 00:12:58.360
Andrew says he has always been treated terribly,
and this is his chance to take revenge on

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.389
everything that has happened to him.

00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:03.689
Matt promises that he’ll help change his
life and tells him they could run away and

00:13:03.689 --> 00:13:05.319
start a new life.

00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:09.079
Matt continues speaking, but Andrew throws
a bus at him.

00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:12.269
Andrew then lands at a building, and Matt
gets up to fight back.

00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:14.869
Andrew and Matt fight, getting thrown all
over the city.

00:13:14.869 --> 00:13:21.429
They smash through roads, cars, buildings,
apartments, and houses, not showing any signs

00:13:21.429 --> 00:13:22.829
of slowing down.

00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:26.980
They throw vehicles at each other, Andrew
having no regard for human life.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:31.009
Matt still tries to convince Andrew to stop,
but the police surround them.

00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:35.249
Matt gets shot, and Andrew blasts the police
back before flying away.

00:13:35.249 --> 00:13:39.680
They both land at a plaza in front of a building,
where the police surround them again.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.600
Matt begs Andrew to stop, but he doesn’t
listen.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.350
The police open fire, but Andrew stops all
the bullets.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.869
Andrew then starts shouting, and the buildings
behind them shake violently.

00:13:49.869 --> 00:13:52.819
Glass and concrete crack, and debris rains
on them.

00:13:52.819 --> 00:13:56.920
Matt pleads with Andrew not to hurt the cops,
but Andrew is too far gone.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.129
He realizes there’s no other way but to
kill Andrew.

00:14:00.129 --> 00:14:04.589
Matt takes the statue behind Andrew and aims
a steel spear at him before impaling him through

00:14:04.589 --> 00:14:06.009
the chest.

00:14:06.009 --> 00:14:09.560
Everything falls quiet, and Andrew hangs lifeless
in the middle of the plaza.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.680
The police approach, but Andrew flies up and
escapes.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.470
Time passes, and Matt is seen flying above
snowy mountaintops.

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:22.369
He talks to a camera as if it were Andrew,
and he points it at several Tibetan monk temples.

00:14:22.369 --> 00:14:32.639
He leaves, saying farewell to Andrew.
