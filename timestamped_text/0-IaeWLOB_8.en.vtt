00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.680
today i'm going to explain a science&nbsp;
fiction film called the mandela effect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.120
spoilers ahead watch out and take care that&nbsp;
day a game maker named brendan his wife claire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.640
and their daughter named sam are on vacation to a&nbsp;
beach the three of them enjoy being together full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.400
of happiness jokes and laughter while they are&nbsp;
relaxing sam intends to look for snails around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.360
beach and she promises not to play in the water&nbsp;
claire agrees on the condition that sam doesn't go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.640
too far from their site when sam is busy looking&nbsp;
for snails she doesn't realize that the waves drag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.240
her curious george sam tries to take the doll but&nbsp;
unfortunately she is dragged along by the waves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.880
sam's death makes brendan and claire feel very sad&nbsp;
claire tries to move on but brendan who loves his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.000
daughter very much couldn't just let her go while&nbsp;
they are packing sam's things brendan accidentally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.720
sees a book titled the berenstain bear he feels&nbsp;
odd because he clearly remembers that the book&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.400
was previously titled the berenstain bear with an&nbsp;
e instead of an a when they are sleeping suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.040
a strange sound comes from the kitchen and it&nbsp;
turns out to be matt his brother-in-law who comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.920
to look for food in the refrigerator brendan then&nbsp;
gives him some pizza and he also asks matt about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.960
the book the berenstain bear matt replies that&nbsp;
the book is titled the berenstain bear with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.840
letter e but brendan shows matt that the correct&nbsp;
writing is the berenstain bear with the letter a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.040
out of curiosity brendan tries to find it on the&nbsp;
internet and it turns out that there are many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.080
people who think that the writing in the book is&nbsp;
the berenstein bear with an e brendan continues to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.240
look for information about it until he finally&nbsp;
finds a theory that explains the incident&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.680
namely the mandela effect theory the next day&nbsp;
brendan is confused by the photo of his family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.560
on the refrigerator he asks his wife where the&nbsp;
photo was taken and claire replies that it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.040
taken in front of the griffith observatory but&nbsp;
brendan is very sure that they didn't take photos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.640
in that place instead they took pictures at the&nbsp;
pacific science center in seattle his wife doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.600
respond and tells him to leave because she is busy&nbsp;
cooking brendan then goes to see matt and talks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.040
about the mandela effect theory brendan feels that&nbsp;
he is experiencing the mandela effect phenomena&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.160
but matt denies and says that the phenomenon is&nbsp;
just false memory but brendan still believes in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.880
his theory and believes that he now lives in a&nbsp;
parallel universe brendan continues to explore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.440
these theories and then he sees on the form that&nbsp;
the mandela effect is caused by an experiment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.120
with a large hadron collider created by cern the&nbsp;
experiment is conducted in 2008 in russia and at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.760
the same time many people experience strange&nbsp;
phenomena one of which is the mandela effect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.840
brendan then tries to go to a priest named isaac&nbsp;
to find out about the existence of god but after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.120
listening to isaac's words brendan doesn't believe&nbsp;
that god has created this world seeing brendan's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.720
strange behavior claire tries to remind brendan&nbsp;
not to stick with past memories with sam she wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.600
brendan to forget the past and live a new life he&nbsp;
then asks his wife about the picture of the guy in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.720
the monopoly claire firmly believes that the guy's&nbsp;
image in monopoly is wearing a monocle on one side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.560
of his eye when she checks it it turns out that&nbsp;
the guy's image is not using a monocle furthermore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.800
brendan also points out that the monkey character&nbsp;
curious george doesn't actually have a tail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.800
but the curious george doll that sam has a tale&nbsp;
brendan tries to explain that all of these relate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.360
to the theory of the mandela effect brendan&nbsp;
feels that sam's death at that time is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.600
another parallel universe version that enters the&nbsp;
current world and then shifted the actual events&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.440
but claire is angry and disappointed with brendan&nbsp;
who only cares about himself with strange theories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.760
making them unable to move on even so brendan&nbsp;
remains convinced that the mandela effect exists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.000
brendan then studies the theory deeper he&nbsp;
discovers that the mandela effect could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.080
occur due to other parallel universes being&nbsp;
mixed into the world he is currently living in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.360
parallel universes themselves are numerous and&nbsp;
each parallel universe contains another version&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.400
of the current life story he feels most likely&nbsp;
sam is still alive in another parallel universe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.080
in the end he finds the name of a scientist named&nbsp;
dr roland fuchs who also believes that this world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.120
is just a simulation brendan then tries to&nbsp;
see dr roland but he is too busy at the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.880
the next day brendan tries to see him again&nbsp;
there the two of them have a chat about roland's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.080
research the doctor explains that his research&nbsp;
shows that the universe is a computer simulation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.960
designed for an unknown purpose the simulation&nbsp;
then creates new simulations with a different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.240
version of the story every second the mandela&nbsp;
effect experienced by brendan is a form of bug&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.960
or a mix between the current simulation and&nbsp;
other simulations that's what causes life to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.640
go wrong from roland's explanation brendan also&nbsp;
concludes that if a program forms this world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.160
he could change the program by using script coding&nbsp;
so that the world runs properly without any bugs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.600
but it looks like he can't do that if he only uses&nbsp;
an ordinary computer dr roland also agrees that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.560
they can't change the world with just an ordinary&nbsp;
computer with very low specifications roland then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.720
shows brendan that he and his team have made the&nbsp;
first quantum computer stored in one university&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.760
dr roland then explains that there's a possibility&nbsp;
that brendan's program could be run using the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.800
quantum computer brendan then decides to look for&nbsp;
books on quantum computer programming and start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.920
coding scripts based on them he also combines some&nbsp;
of his game programming code with quantum code so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.440
that he manages to create a new script the next&nbsp;
day brendan is surprised by the presence of sam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.080
who's already at their house at first he&nbsp;
thinks that it is just his imagination&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.640
but in the end he believes that he is the one&nbsp;
who brings sam back from the parallel world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.920
without wasting time brendan then takes advantage&nbsp;
of it by having fun with his daughter brendan is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.800
happy because he manages to shift the story of&nbsp;
sam's death with another parallel version but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.240
at that time brendan begins to feel strange about&nbsp;
claire's behavior he realizes that in the parallel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.800
version he sees now sam is still alive but claire&nbsp;
becomes a very stressed woman suddenly brendan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.960
goes straight to dr rollin but he is shocked&nbsp;
when he hears the news that roland committed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.080
suicide two months ago he feels that the script&nbsp;
he entered cause an extraordinary mandela effect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.360
realizing a bug in the script brendan immediately&nbsp;
decides to make a coding script to run the command&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.400
to reinstall the universe the reinstallation aims&nbsp;
to make the universe runs normally without any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.360
bugs like the mandela effect brendan doubts the&nbsp;
script he is worried that the universe would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.400
destroyed and could not be recreated but for the&nbsp;
sake of his daughter and wife brendan decides to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.960
go to the facility where the quantum computer&nbsp;
is and then start entering his coding script&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.000
brendan manages to run his script and the quantum&nbsp;
computer then shows signs of reaction brendan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.360
immediately rushes away but he sees all the cars&nbsp;
in the parking lot are missing on the bus he sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.560
that everyone is starting to glitch he sees the&nbsp;
buildings also glitch brendan then goes to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.920
his family and he sees that the situation has gone&nbsp;
awry he sees his wife glitches and the building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.760
turns dark in the end he sees two moons colliding&nbsp;
and finally the whole universe disappears into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.960
the darkness a moment later brendan's script&nbsp;
suddenly runs again and the world began to reform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:02.560
planets microbes viruses sea animals humans and&nbsp;
entire cities are now back to normal without any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.240
other glitches including the mandela effect then&nbsp;
the scene returns when brendan claire and also sam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.280
are at the beach when sam goes looking for snails&nbsp;
brendan calls sam and tells her to leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.640
curious george doll which looks like it doesn't&nbsp;
have a tail anymore finally as sam goes looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.160
for snails brendan keeps an eye on his daughter&nbsp;
and the movie ends subscribe for more videos&nbsp;&nbsp;
