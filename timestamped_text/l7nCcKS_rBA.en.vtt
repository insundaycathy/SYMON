00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.640
Welcome to Slash Forward. Imagine wanting&nbsp;
something so bad you find yourself waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.040
forty years for the chance to make your dream&nbsp;
a reality. And then, after taking all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.040
appropriate steps and precautions you manage to&nbsp;
get within a hair’s breadth of achieving your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.400
goals - only to have some asshole lock you in a&nbsp;
basement and set you on fire!? Talk about a gut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.400
punch. Despite the depressing nature of this&nbsp;
scenario, we will be making preparations for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.240
welcoming the upcoming Halloween Kills movie into&nbsp;
our eyeholes by taking a look at the 2018 sequel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.640
to the original 1978 Halloween, Hall-o-weeeen?&nbsp;
Long after the residents of Haddonfield forgot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.120
about the old babysitter murders, and as&nbsp;
a result of his therapeutic stagnation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.600
Michael Myers is set to be transferred to a&nbsp;
high-security facility where he may be crammed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.760
into a dark pit to live out the remainder&nbsp;
of his days. In the intervening years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.040
Laurie Strode has been solely focused on&nbsp;
preparing herself for a presumed final showdown,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.360
even sacrificing her relationship with her&nbsp;
daughter to make sure she stays on track.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.600
Will this be the final showdown? Who will&nbsp;
survive? Let’s take a look and see. Be sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.000
to comment with your favorite Halloween timeline,&nbsp;
and while you’re here, check out some other fine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.400
selections from the channel’s catalogue. I’ve&nbsp;
covered quite a few movies. Let’s get to it.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.760
We open on the endless passage of time - a&nbsp;
constant hindrance for the mentally infirm,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.120
relegated to passing each new moment as the&nbsp;
last. Here a couple of podcasters are looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.840
to capitalize on the chance to interview Smith&nbsp;
Grove’s most infamous before he is transferred&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.920
to a far less accommodating facility.&nbsp;
They are escorted back by his caretaker,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.600
Dr. Sartain, whose obsessive study&nbsp;
of Michael Myers is coming to an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.880
end as he has made no progress whatsoever -&nbsp;
Michael has never even uttered a single word.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.120
They arrive during recess where the patients&nbsp;
are graciously chained up outside so they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.320
get a little Vitamin D. After forty years of&nbsp;
inactivity, Aaron presumes he has what it takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.120
to get inside as he comes bearing a precious&nbsp;
gift. At the mere presence of the artefact the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.480
air bristles with activity, riling up the inmates&nbsp;
as Aaron eggs him on, thirsting for a response.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.760
We then transition to Haddonfield as our guerilla&nbsp;
journalists try to build up some B-roll after an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.160
unsuccessful provocation. They’re pressing&nbsp;
forward, hoping to draw out Laurie Strode,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.840
who has since become a cagey, survivalist loner -&nbsp;
offering her a bag in exchange for a conversation.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.080
Still reluctant, she does let them in and sits&nbsp;
down to talk. Dana starts by trying to build&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.080
up their credentials, hoping to earn trust&nbsp;
and impressing upon her the importance of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.560
drawing insight from her travails. But all this&nbsp;
fluffing about the importance of her story is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.360
little more than an irritant, and diving right&nbsp;
into her losing custody of her daughter only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.880
pushes things over the line. Seeing that they’re&nbsp;
losing her, Aaron goes for broke and reveals that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.040
what they really want is a sensationalist&nbsp;
Strode/Myers sit down so the two enemies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.880
can try to hash out their differences, Ricki&nbsp;
Lake-style. In response, she shows them the door.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.440
After that we swoop in to meet Laurie’s daughter&nbsp;
Karen, and her granddaughter Allyson. Through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.040
conversation we find that Karen was able to adjust&nbsp;
some appointments so that she would be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.080
make it to her National Honor Society event that&nbsp;
evening, and that she and Ray are excited to meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.960
Allyson’s boyfriend Cameron. Then Allyson hits&nbsp;
her mom with a test - asking her if she invited&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.520
grandma like she said she would. She confirms that&nbsp;
she did, failing the test with a clear lie. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.160
one she considers necessary in order to protect&nbsp;
her precious daughter from her flaky mother.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.000
The lie is confirmed by Alysson when, in&nbsp;
discussing this issue with her friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.080
on the way to school, she reveals that she&nbsp;
actually invited her grandmother herself. But,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.320
in fairness, it’s a hard time of year for&nbsp;
the family, being permanently haunted by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.880
events that, for everyone else, are now&nbsp;
mostly local folklore. As a testament to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.960
the prevailing attitude, Dave wonders if&nbsp;
it was even that big of a deal? I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.480
it was one guy with a knife pulling&nbsp;
in a low to moderate body count.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.720
We continue to familiarize ourselves with&nbsp;
the friend group as Alysson makes out with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.080
Cameron in the hallway. Then buddy Oscar joins&nbsp;
in, providing unsolicited kisses to his chums.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.240
As the day wears on, Laurie seeks to meet up&nbsp;
with Alysson in her own way. She has come to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.640
gift her the podcast money and encourage her&nbsp;
to get out there and take life by the tail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.320
But who is she to make such a suggestion?&nbsp;
I mean, she’s been living like a hermit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.800
constantly preparing for a disaster that’s never&nbsp;
happened and has proved completely incapable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.280
of getting over her past. But Laurie relishes&nbsp;
confrontation and admits that she would take on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.680
all the hate if it means having a daughter who’s&nbsp;
tough as nails and ready to take on the world.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.080
She then goes back to where everything feels&nbsp;
right, at her stronghold with her weapons, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.440
she cares for as if they were her own appendages.&nbsp;
Then later that evening we see the casters working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.680
through some of their research, hoping to find&nbsp;
a good hook by listening to old tapes from Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.800
Loomis. Meanwhile, it’s transfer time at the funny&nbsp;
farm where a huge batch of loonies get loaded up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.920
including Dr. Sartain. As the one primarily&nbsp;
responsible for the most dangerous patient,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.840
he wants to oversee the proceedings.&nbsp;
But outside they also have a guardian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.840
angel in Laurie Strode who sees them&nbsp;
off with a blood-curdling scream.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.720
While back at Chili’s the gang is slammin some&nbsp;
appeteasers and getting intimately acquainted with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.760
Cameron. They high-five over the jalapeno poppers&nbsp;
and bottomless margs as Laurie arrives to check in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.320
on the festivities and blow off some steam before&nbsp;
formally joining them for dinner. She adds to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.040
conversation by openly sobbing and lamenting&nbsp;
her hesitance in killing Michael when given the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.080
chance. Alysson learns that Karen’s hesitance to&nbsp;
include grandma over the years wasn’t necessarily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.600
unreasonable. She runs out to provide whatever&nbsp;
comfort she can, but does she even understand?

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.680
Not at all, we see, when Karen takes a&nbsp;
minute to flash back and reveal the absurd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.120
circumstances of her childhood spent prepping&nbsp;
in various ways. Right up until CPS came and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.680
took her away. Resentful of Laurie’s attempt to&nbsp;
protect her by training her for the inevitable,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.680
she made it her goal to to protect Alysson&nbsp;
by shielding her from the horrors of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.240
You know, we all have our own ideas about the&nbsp;
best way to parent, who’s to say what’s best?

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.800
Back out on the county roads a father and son&nbsp;
discuss the merits of hunting and fishing versus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.200
expressing oneself through the art of dance.&nbsp;
Before finding a resolution the pair runs across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.360
a busload of wandering psychos. After his dad goes&nbsp;
to check it out, Lumpy calls 911. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.960
they really need some more info, so he is sent to&nbsp;
wade into the darkness and try to get a handle on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.840
things. He approaches slowly, rifle at the ready,&nbsp;
and has the pleasure of poking at his first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.760
nearly dead man, who warns him to run. He carries&nbsp;
on and soon runs across Dr. Sartain who tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.640
startle him into not shooting, resulting in&nbsp;
the opposite outcome. There’s a lot of novel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.280
experiences for a young man going down this&nbsp;
evening. And if only he had left the keys,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.600
he might have been able to share these&nbsp;
stories with someone someday. But he can’t.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.920
Officer Hawkins gets the call and rushes right&nbsp;
out there to poke around. The party has mostly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.640
dispersed at this point, but he still takes it&nbsp;
slow and steady. Due to all the dead bodies. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:45.600
finds the doctor at death’s door, mostly concerned&nbsp;
about whether he escaped We may never know.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.440
The next day Aaron and Dana take a quick&nbsp;
visit to the grave of Judith Myers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.120
and instantly erupt into melodramatic&nbsp;
narrative - apparently for the sole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.880
benefit of the groundskeeper. While&nbsp;
at Haddonfield Memorial Sheriff Barker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.480
strolls in to report that most of the&nbsp;
patients are accounted for, but none&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.640
of them are able to relay a comprehensible&nbsp;
account of what transpired. The only useful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.880
information is Hawkins’ recognition that the&nbsp;
bus manifest has Michael Myers’ name on it.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.520
Elsewhere, as our podcast journalists fuel&nbsp;
up, we see a familiar shape creeping around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.280
and committing violence in the background.&nbsp;
Dana takes a little time for herself in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.520
the loo when she is alarmed by some heavy&nbsp;
footfalls and the sound of stall checks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.800
which is revealed to be a man&nbsp;
with no respect for privacy.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.560
Out at the shop Aaron goes to settle up,&nbsp;
coming face to face with the violence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.440
cluing him in on the situation in which he finds&nbsp;
himself. Back at the stall Michael attempts to buy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.480
his way in with a handful of bloody chiclets,&nbsp;
causing Dana to immediately salamander into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.120
an adjacent stall where she is granted a few&nbsp;
moments by Aaron who bursts in to confront a now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.280
unbounded Michael. He has a crow bar, but&nbsp;
lacks the necessary blackness in his heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.760
to commit violence. The end result is his face&nbsp;
getting turned into mashed potatoes all over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.640
bathroom. When he returns to Dana, she does&nbsp;
little to earn her freedom, and so she dies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.120
Then Michael goes out to pop the trunk and&nbsp;
reunites face with mask - the true flesh.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.920
Then the news hits Laurie, who immediately begins&nbsp;
lockdown and descends into her panic room for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.960
phase one of preparations. This includes, we come&nbsp;
to learn, forcibly entering Karen’s home to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.400
if she’s remembered her lessons. She has not, and&nbsp;
so she is chastised for her laziness. Regardless,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.800
they brush off her massacre preparation&nbsp;
warnings in favor of preparing dinner.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.600
Back at the station, the boys are&nbsp;
just now catching up with the path&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.800
of destruction - the gravity&nbsp;
of the situation now confirmed.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.320
With the pieces in place, we now&nbsp;
arrive in Haddonfield on Halloween.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.840
Michael makes a quick appearance before&nbsp;
dipping out to find the secret candy. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.720
glides on into the first house and, candy&nbsp;
desires unfulfilled, he trades hammer for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.040
knife. On his way out he ponders what do&nbsp;
babies think about? Before hitting the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.200
busy strip. His goal here is quite simple&nbsp;
- drop in and out of the shadows, finding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.400
potential victims and turning them into actual&nbsp;
victims. (helping them fulfill their potential)

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.400
At the dance the special secret of the Bonnie&nbsp;
and Clyde couples costume is revealed to be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.640
contravention of heterotypic gender&nbsp;
norms - a pretty low-tier rebellious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.600
statement for highschoolers these&nbsp;
days. They head in where the kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.520
are just bebopping all over the place.&nbsp;
Alysson takes a quick call from Vicky,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.440
who is stuck babysitting and invites them&nbsp;
over to smoke some reefer after the party.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.080
Despite her coded language, Juien is savvy&nbsp;
and knows exactly what the teens are up to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.800
earning him an early bedtime. Back at the&nbsp;
gymnasium Alysson returns to find that Cameron&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.600
couldn’t go a full two minutes without being&nbsp;
the focus of female sexual attraction. He tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.320
to convince Allyson that he’s really a nice guy.&nbsp;
And then, like all nice guys, he doubles down by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.440
blaming his behavior on her phone attentiveness&nbsp;
in an overly dramatic manner Got her!

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:40.000
Out in town Laurie is cruising the streets,&nbsp;
listening to a police scanner. While,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.040
by happenstance, Michael arrives at Julien’s&nbsp;
home where Vicky is busy cleaning the largest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.000
knife possible. Then Dave arrives and shows off&nbsp;
his commemorative tattoo, which earns him a dry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.920
hump session. So they get right down to&nbsp;
business, writhing around on the couch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.960
But Vicky is distracted by a noise. Before Dave&nbsp;
can go check Julien jumps out to warn them about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.320
the bogeyman - an obvious, childish lie. Vicky&nbsp;
agrees to go check it out. After finding nothing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.120
she puts him back to bed. His final request is to&nbsp;
close the closet door, which doesn’t seem to want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.440
to - oh, there’s a man in there. He drags her&nbsp;
into the room for stabbing while Dave summons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.680
the courage to come to her rescue, taking up&nbsp;
the blade only after the screaming has stopped.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.760
The call goes out for a domestic disturbance,&nbsp;
and they spring into action. Hawkins arrives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.000
on scene first and finds the back door open.&nbsp;
So, he proceeds inward, announcing himself but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.960
receiving no reply. He goes upstairs and finds&nbsp;
a suspicious figure covered by a sheet, which he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.200
hopes to be able to pull back without getting&nbsp;
stabbed. He is successful as it’s Vicky under&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.600
there. Laurie arrives and takes a more active&nbsp;
approach up front. She clears the streets and sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.560
Michael two windows down from Hawkins. While her&nbsp;
aim is true, the shot does not find its target.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.440
Michael then casually strolls out with Hawkins&nbsp;
in pursuit - but delayed by the discovery of Dave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.000
pinned to the wall. Laurie catches up with him and&nbsp;
manages to graze his neck, which doesn’t faze him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
She and Frank then meet up, two traumatized old&nbsp;
timers who bore witness to the 1978 massacre.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.760
As they sort through the scene, Sheriff&nbsp;
Barker arrives with Dr. Sartain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.320
now cognizant and eager to spill the beans.&nbsp;
The two officers have a dispute about whether&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.880
he is an asset or a liability, but he did&nbsp;
warn them that Michael will kill again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.080
and that’s some hot info. Then&nbsp;
Laurie chimes in to suggest action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.080
bringing the doctor to his feet as she&nbsp;
represents a nut he sure would like to crack.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.240
While the rest of the town is on lockdown, we&nbsp;
transition to Oscar escorting Alysson - the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.640
coolest, nicest, prettiest girl in school&nbsp;
who deserves so much better than Cameron.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.480
After dropping that hot little nugget, he&nbsp;
invites her to take a shortcut with him.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.320
Meanwhile Hawkins and Sartain are cruising&nbsp;
the streets with their eyes peeled. Through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.200
this conversation, Dr. Sartain gives some&nbsp;
indications that he’s a real freak who would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.440
take great pleasure from diving deep into&nbsp;
Michael’s mind and swimming around in there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.440
likely while naked. While they’re out, they&nbsp;
all pull up to Alysson’s house and drop a huge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.200
flaming bag of reality on her doorstep.&nbsp;
In their attempts to reach her we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.720
learn that the plan is to barricade&nbsp;
themselves at granny Strode’s house.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.560
Back with the kids, we see Oscar’s&nbsp;
shortcut consisted of cutting across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.280
one yard, and that by Allyson deserving&nbsp;
better he was referring to his mouth being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.800
on her mouth. Good guy Oscar then&nbsp;
cowers in the face of rejection,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.720
grovelling on the ground and unloading all&nbsp;
his troubles into the uncaring darkness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.360
which he believes to be occupied by the&nbsp;
homeowner. But, he soon finds out that it is not.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.200
Of course, after the stunt he pulled,&nbsp;
Ally’s not falling for his silly games.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.120
So he dies screaming, stabbed in the&nbsp;
back with his jaw impaled on a picket.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:30.400
That Allyson believes in, catching her up now&nbsp;
with the rest of us. And, in an unusual twist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.880
she manages to run screaming and actually&nbsp;
find someone willing to administer assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:40.560
Hawkins soon arrives and Sartain hops out to soak&nbsp;
in all the firsthand Michael Myers experiences.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.320
As they head out to the Strode&nbsp;
stronghold, Hawkins gets eyes on ya boi,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.560
and risks a full on Ben Tramer fiasco&nbsp;
in order to put an end to the terror.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.200
Unfortunately Dr. Sartain takes his&nbsp;
custodial responsibilities very seriously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.600
and intervenes to prevent the kill shot. In&nbsp;
a shocking twist he goes one step further,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.560
brandishing his trusty pen knife and murdering&nbsp;
Hawkins. Honestly, he’s never felt closer with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.280
his patient - they may really be in a position to&nbsp;
make some progress here. Then he loads him up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:12.320
Alysson and announces his hunch that Michael’s&nbsp;
compulsion to hunt Laurie is what keeps him alive.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.720
He further explains that he’s really keen to&nbsp;
hear Michael’s husky voice whisper something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.800
into his ear. Seeing an opportunity to gain&nbsp;
some leverage, Alysson claims that Michael&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.440
spoke to her, and she’ll tell him but only if&nbsp;
he lets her out. You know he’s gotta find out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.160
so he pulls over and tries to compel her to tell&nbsp;
him. But Michael wakes up and puts an end to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:36.080
He drags him out and after begging for just a&nbsp;
single word, he instead performs a single action.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.000
Alysson also runs off, which all happens&nbsp;
just down the road from the Strode house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.800
attracting the attention of the officers keeping&nbsp;
guard. They approach cautiously, but find nothing.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.120
As the house is prepped, Ray pauses his&nbsp;
yo-yoing when he notices the police cruiser&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.440
parked out front. He goes to see how things&nbsp;
are going, but finds the men to be unwell,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.480
although that is a subjective assessment. At any&nbsp;
rate, Ray will take this experience to the grave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.600
as he is dragged deep into the murky&nbsp;
darkness, firing flaccidly into the dark.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.400
Laurie calls out, then the hunter and prey tingle&nbsp;
with excitement as the big moment approaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.920
It unfortunately starts with Laurie, after forty&nbsp;
years of preparations, standing next to a window.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.640
It very nearly ends here, except she happens to&nbsp;
just be built different. She runs down to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.880
panic room to hit the lights as Michael makes his&nbsp;
way in. Laurie then ventures up to try and finish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.520
what she started. She works her way through, room&nbsp;
by room, clearing them and locking them down.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.680
She follows a blood trail that leads upstairs, and&nbsp;
eventually finds herself in the mannequin room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.600
so who knows what’s what. Sure enough, he&nbsp;
pops out and guts her before tossing her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.640
over the balcony. He is distracted momentarily by&nbsp;
Allyson’s arrival, allowing Laurie to disappear.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.480
Karen pops out to hurry her down the&nbsp;
stairs where they wait with bated breath&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.440
as Michael puzzles this out. When he gets it,&nbsp;
Karen goes to grab her old trusty, but when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:56.080
it comes down to it, she loses her resolve&nbsp;
and calls out for mommy to save her psyche.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.840
Laurie does come out then and beans Michael,&nbsp;
sending him rolling into the basement. As the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.560
ladies run out, Michael snags Karen’s ankle.&nbsp;
This gives Alysson a chance to draw blood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.000
an important rite of passage. We then&nbsp;
learn that this stronghold that was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.240
presented as Laurie’s prison was actually&nbsp;
a trap for Michael. After he is captured,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.640
Laurie hits the gas and pilot lights. Then&nbsp;
she tosses him a farewell road flare. But,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:23.280
as the house violently erupts into flames,&nbsp;
Michael seems nonplussed. The three survivors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.440
run out to the road and find help from a simple&nbsp;
chicken farmer, riding off into the night.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.440
For this post-story wrap up I have a few thoughts&nbsp;
about this movie, but then some nitpicks to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.680
from a “How to Beat” perspective, because the&nbsp;
survivalist aspects of this movie seem ripe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.440
for the picking. Personally, I liked this one&nbsp;
a lot. I know there are some issues with it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.920
but I think the general audience critique tends&nbsp;
to go too far in terms of its derision over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.600
what they’re trying to do here. I really&nbsp;
enjoy the Halloween franchise overall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.760
despite its multitude of various timelines you&nbsp;
have to keep up with. But, while anchored by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.920
one of the best horror films of all time,&nbsp;
the series quality is very inconsistent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.080
I recently rewatched parts four and five&nbsp;
purely for pleasure, which may seem weird,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.480
but I like them. Although, they’re really not&nbsp;
great. If I could make a timely reference,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.200
part 4’s Michael looks like he was played by Pat&nbsp;
from Saturday Night Live. What I’m saying is, even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:14.880
if 2018 didn’t work for you, in comparison to the&nbsp;
series, it’s one of the better ones. Objectively.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.200
One of the things I did like was the direction&nbsp;
they took it in regards to presenting the what-if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.520
scenario of looking at the original survivors&nbsp;
forty years later and basing the story around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:28.240
the wreckage left by the original trauma. It&nbsp;
had similar vibes to Rob Zombie’s sequel in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.040
that regard, just with a far less depressing and&nbsp;
dark tone. I will say that one reason I’m able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.680
derive so much pleasure from the nonsensical is&nbsp;
that my natural state when taking in movies is to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:43.040
go brain-off. I never find myself trying to solve&nbsp;
a mystery presented to me on screen, for instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.680
So, provide some cool visuals, reasonable plot&nbsp;
points and some sweet payoffs and I’m all good.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.320
This film delivers in that regard. However, I&nbsp;
can’t go brain off when I’m taking script notes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.160
which churned up quite a few issues for me -&nbsp;
specifically in regards to how they handled and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.640
presented Laurie’s survivalism in the film.&nbsp;
Realistically, it starts out fairly tame,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.720
with little to object to. She likes popping&nbsp;
off rounds in her backyard, making her own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.040
preserves and maintaining a well-stocked&nbsp;
panic room. All pretty standard stuff.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.960
It’s when they ramp things up and show how far&nbsp;
she’s actually taken it that things begin to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.200
fall apart. If you’ve seen this film before,&nbsp;
and you weren’t unsettled by the fact that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:22.480
rested up against a door with two windows in it,&nbsp;
you have a steely constitution. Decisions aside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.400
why does her forest stronghold have a door&nbsp;
with windows to begin with? Furthermore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.000
why on Earth would you set up a system&nbsp;
that requires you to bodily move through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.840
the home to check and clear all the rooms&nbsp;
in order to manually hit the door buttons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.320
which are right outside the rooms? These are, of&nbsp;
course, rhetorical questions. The answer to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.480
is that you would not, if you were worth&nbsp;
your salt in an emergency prep situation.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.800
She has cameras, wired up a bitching light&nbsp;
system and had an automated kitchen island,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.360
among other contraptions. These skills should be&nbsp;
put to good use by creating a system whereby the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.600
operator would be able to utilize a central&nbsp;
system to power the doors and activate them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.680
all at once or individually. I assume the&nbsp;
purpose here is to limit Michael’s movement,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:04.000
prevent the possibility of escape and focus&nbsp;
the eventual fire into the core of the home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.600
I’m on board with that, but it was&nbsp;
implemented sloppily and dangerously.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.680
With all of that time to prepare and build&nbsp;
a home around a trap with such a specific,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.480
singular purpose, you should really be focusing on&nbsp;
developing a failsafe way of getting Michael into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.080
the basement and lighting it up. Just think&nbsp;
for a moment - for the purpose of the plot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.840
all this stuff happened at the stairwell to&nbsp;
the basement. But it was a stairwell that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.360
was intentionally hidden. And when the&nbsp;
time came, there were some uncomfortable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.560
path crossings back and forth to get him in and&nbsp;
them out. So many things would have to go just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.120
right to accomplish this and get out without&nbsp;
suffering losses. It seems like a far shot.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.360
I suppose it is possible that he was intended to&nbsp;
be contained to the main portion of the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.680
with the basement as a backup. However, the way&nbsp;
they bladed him in like that really made it seem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:50.000
like that was the end goal. This is supported&nbsp;
by the incendiary devices contained therein,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.560
which were controlled from outside of that room.&nbsp;
Again, the argument could be made that these are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:59.040
backup systems with built in redundancies to&nbsp;
ensure success. I would still contend that, if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.440
this is the case, it would be preferable to come&nbsp;
up with a better way to achieve the ultimate goal.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.640
If you really want to go deep into the&nbsp;
level of chess being played here by Laurie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.960
you could also say that the door situation&nbsp;
was somewhat intentional in that she wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:15.440
maintain a strong prison barrier, but with some&nbsp;
manner of ingress available to ensure Michael&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.200
can enter the trap (but with the unintended&nbsp;
side effect of getting her face smashed up).&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.520
Even if that were the case, it still calls the&nbsp;
method into question, because once he comes in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.520
they still have to get him into the basement&nbsp;
that they occupy. While I acknowledge that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.840
it’s an important part of the story arc to have&nbsp;
Allyson get blood on her hands to ensure none of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.320
the three generations are innocent for whatever is&nbsp;
going to come in the sequel, all of that trauma,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.400
suffering and uncertainty could have been&nbsp;
avoided with the most basic ambush device,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.360
the trapdoor. Michael enters, he falls and then&nbsp;
he gets burned up. Clean, easy and it gets the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:45.971
job done. If not that, at least try to create&nbsp;
situations where the drama can spring forth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:45.971 --> 00:19:47.360
naturally as a result of good and reasonable&nbsp;
decisions being made. Although, with the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:51.840
turned to ash, this shouldn’t pose any issues in&nbsp;
the sequel. So that’s a promising starting point.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:20:05.840
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;
