00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.040
Welcome Back to Movies Recapped,
Today I am going to explain The American Action

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.670
Science fiction, Chappie.
The film starts showing a country.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.980
Criminality had become common in this area.
No one had control over criminals.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.780
The government of that country is very disturbed.
As a result, they proposed to the police department

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.710
that they hire a robot to assist them.
So they may assist you to stop the criminality.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.810
Now a company is ordered to create the police
robots.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.930
The scientist of that company creates many
robots.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.660
Which were going to assist the police officers.
There is also an engineer in that company.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.629
He also creates a best robot.
Its characteristic included that human being

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.239
themselves could control it.
It is shown on a day that a robot becomes

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.800
out of order.
And it is brought to repair. It often used

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.190
to be out of order.
It was always sent back after repairing.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.460
Then the drug dealers are shown. The 3 persons
are driving away to deliver the drug to someone.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.210
But their drug packets are dropped on the
way and opened.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.089
And these are wasted. That man's hair had
braiding whom they had to delivere this drug

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.410
He says to them after being furious, Return
my money!

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.750
He points his gun on them. At the same time,
police and police robots reach there.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.070
Drug dealer flees, witnessing them.
A hair braiding person attacks the police

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.000
robot which had recently come after repairing.
Then this robot is again brought to repair.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.970
But it was not easy task for this robot to
be repaired after being damaged many times.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.630
Its battery was completely damaged.
So this robot is sent to update its system.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.930
The scene turns and the same gang member is
shown who contacts the same drug dealer.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.450
He says to him, Return my amount of money!
Police was not able to arrest me.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.430
It may not happen that I may kill all of you,
coming there.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.070
Hearing it, that drug dealer gets worried.
He asks his companions, From where will we

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.410
arrange 20 million rands?
Three of them plan that they will make a great

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.490
robbery!
But they say, there is still a problem that

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.800
police robot reach everywhere!
Now female drug dealer is also saying it,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.970
It is not easy to keep away from the police
robot!

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.670
We will have to capture the controller of
the police robot for this.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.460
So we may turn off the system of all police
robot, capturing him.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.519
Our task will become easy as such.
On the other side, the same scientist is shown

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.469
in the company where the robots are made.
Who had created all these police robots.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.940
He is working on a new project. He works very
hard on it.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.910
At last he is succeeded. He immediately runs
to his CEO.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.390
And he reveals to him that, If I applied this
method on robot making,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.519
Then I can get much progress. It was such
type of the robot which could communicate

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.959
and think.
It will have its separate artificial human

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.319
brain.
His CEO says to him, I don't understand such

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.780
ideas!
Don't waste your moments if it is not easy

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.079
to happen!
Just carry on your work what is going on !

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.140
But scientists is upset because he was sure,
That he could make the human mind robots if

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.740
he continued it.
He returns back from there. But he thinks

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.360
that he will not let his attempts waste.
He says , I myself will conduct the experiment

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.819
on it!
I will surely show them to make such type

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.239
of the robot.
Then scientist takes a damaged robot from

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.989
there which was sent to update its system.
He also takes the chip of the police robot.

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.029
Putting it into his vehicle stealthily, he
begins to leave that place.

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:16.489
His thoughts was to check it on this robot.
Then dug dealers kidnaps him on the way.

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.799
They bring him into their secret location.
And they ask him while pointing the gun that,

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.450
Tell us the way how the police robot's system
may be turned off.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.169
Hand us over the whole control!
Then scientist says to them, How can I give

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.980
the control of robots to you.
They are connected with satellites and work

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.830
through them.
I have no control over them. I have just created.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.629
Those dug dealers say to him, Okay! We will
end you in this way.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.810
Then they find that damaged robot from scientist's
car while checking it before.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.170
They ask him, Are you going to create a new
robot!

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.540
Then scientist tells them , No! It is an old
robot.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.299
There are only some experiments are required
on it.

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.569
Then those drug dealers ask him, Why do you
not create a new robot for us?

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.669
We will mutually make it and use it for us.
But scientist says , No! The task that I am

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:07.639
going to conduct is very critical!
And the created robot will also be very complex.

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.849
We will have to care it too much.
Those dug dealers assure, No Problem!

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.799
We will together take care of it.
Those drug dealers make him seated there and

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.180
say,
Update or install the software of it just

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.889
before us!
Then scientist starts to do it. And he adjusts

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.840
the chip in it after copying the data in it.
It happened the same what he had thought.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.680
That robot was just acting like the kids.
It was frightening from them.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.040
It was pouncing its hand as a cat does to
see the things.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.259
Its movement were childlike. First of all,
scientist was not expecting it.

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:42.030
This robot will be activated. But he had also
succeeded here.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.729
Now he had to take the further steps. Female
drug dealer also takes interest in it.

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.750
So she names it "Chappie". It means, this
movie has also been made on this name.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.930
So this robot may be considered the major
character of this movie.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.139
That drug dealer who had asked the scientist
to repair this robot,

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.340
He becomes malicious and he points his gun
on that scientist.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.500
He says to him, Go away! Don't ever return
back.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.870
It means that they wanted to keep that robot
themselves.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.530
Scientist leaves that place. Then that robots
making company is seen.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.620
In which a man is demonstrating his robotic
designs.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.960
The designs of which he had created some robots.
But CEO and the engineer of that company refuse

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.520
to accept this design .
Because they propose that it is big sized

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.970
and it is going to take too power.
There will be spent the great cost on it.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.699
Now that scientist had returned to his company
again.

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.409
He works harder and thinks more designs of
the robots.

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:39.270
At last, CEO likes his made designs.
And she orders that robots will be created

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.770
based on these designs.
He is extremity excited. All were wishing

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.400
him.
But it is not tolerated by the engineer.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.669
He plans that I will damage his created robots.
I will also steal the security chip. He does

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.790
not get the chip anywhere when he goes to
search for it.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.169
He knows after checking the system,
That it is in the same robot which has been

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.349
sent to update its system.
He is shocked enough. Because there is neither

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.669
robot nor the chip.
Contrarily, "Chappie" comes on the scene who

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:11.030
was taking those drug dealers as its family.
That foul drug dealer trains it for fighting.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.550
So it may bring a lot of money for them while
robbing.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.120
Contrarily, that engineer comes to that scientist.
He asks him, pointing his head with a gun,

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.830
Tell me where is chip.
Hand me over the key of that place!

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.520
That scientist asks him, What is your problem
with me?

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.720
I have neither a key nor a chip!
Engineer fires his gun. Fortunately, its magazine

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.960
is empty.
Then engineer says to all, Don't be afraid.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.610
It was just a fun!
Saying it, he leaves that place.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.830
Scientist instantly goes to meet "Chappie",
thinking something.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.419
Engineer had also witnessed him. So his curiosity
is aroused.

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:48.260
He also pursues him. Scientist says , going
to "Chappie".

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.979
Listen to me! You will not take a wrong step!
He makes it understand perfectly. You are

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:57.000
a good robot!
Promise me! You will also act nicely.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.469
Then "Chappie" gives its words to him! And
scientist gets satisfied.

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:04.319
He says to "Chappie", Come! I teach you how
to paint.

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:08.710
Then he begins to teach him how to paint.
Female drug dealer is also standing beside

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.479
it.
She is not objecting him Then that cruel drug

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:15.160
dealer approaches there.
He flies into rage, seeing the scientist there

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.540
again.
He gets him out from there while hitting.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.620
I will kill you if you ever step in it!
Now that cruel drug dealer takes "Chappie"

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.729
to a place,
There are the worst gang members. He says

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:28.219
to the gang members,
Hit it! I want to check its power.

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:31.250
I want to make it more powerful! You may train
it.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.880
Now those worst boys begin to attack "Chappie".
"Chappie" was not like the police robot but

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.800
the childlike so it starts to be frightened.
He does not fight them in return. Bad boys

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:48.330
throw stones on it,
So its body catches fire. And it somehow flees

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.580
.
On the other side, that engineer had identified

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.979
the location of "Chappie".
He brings "Chappie" back in his vehicle, reaching

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:58.650
there immediately.
He opens the hand of "Chappie" while driving

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:03.060
and takes out that chip.
Afterward, it was going to damage "Chappie"

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.340
.
Then "Chappie" lifts up and escapes , attacking

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.580
him.
"Chappie" heads straight for the drug dealers'

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.060
safe haven.
The female drug dealer was sweet and caring.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.841
She brings "Chappie" back to life.
Who did turn you into this condition, she

00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:20.129
asks her as she shows her affections?
But "Chappie" was very afraid. That girl also

00:08:20.129 --> 00:08:25.639
recovers its hand.
Now it dawns. Now that cruel drug dealer says

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:28.629
to "Chappie",
It is my fault that I left you among the bad

00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:31.800
boys.
And you got hit. But listen! you must know

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.740
to fight for your defense.
I will also train of shooting the gun!

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.479
But "Chappie" was not willing to act like
this.

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:42.419
Because it had promised to that scientist.
Now that bad drug dealer feels that it is

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:46.190
not following him.
Then it plays a trick to make it convinced.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:50.690
He says to it, Alright! You are not using
this gun because people will be killed.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:55.380
You care people so much! Let's go! I train
you the use of other weapons.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.810
The people are only knocked out through them.
They get no harm.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:02.800
Now "Chappie" had a childlike mind. So it
is entrapped by him.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.380
Taking the advantage of it, that bad drug
dealer train it to use the other weapons.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.800
Now it is the day when those drug dealers
had to rob greatly.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.800
But they had not such weapons.
it means that technological weapons.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.910
Through which they can frighten and kill the
people.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.730
Now that bad dealer begins to tell one more
exaggerated story to "Chappie".

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.790
He says, "Chappie"! Someone has escaped, stealing
my car.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.360
Look! Bring all cars to me so that I may check
which is mine.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.150
Now "Chappie" was childlike. It used to think
like the kids.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:36.339
So it is entangled in is story. And he throws
all the people from the cars.

00:09:36.339 --> 00:09:41.130
He had come after stealing the cars of others.
Bad drug dealer is very excited.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.430
And he becomes richer while selling the spare
parts and other machinery of cars.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.800
He purchases the costly weapons from them.
It is falling night. And it is also raining

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.000
. Bad drug dealer observes that,
"Chappie" is sitting near a dead dog and it

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.130
is very grieved.
That drug dealer says to it, Don't be sad!

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:03.170
You will also be no more one day.
That robot says, I don't die! I am a robot.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.460
That drug dealer says to it, Are you checking
the time of battery on yourself?

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.880
It is running out. Scientist installed a battery
system in you,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.320
So you may be ended soon! This fact hurts
"Chappie".

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.080
It begins to hate the scientist. Then drug
dealer says to him to increase his value,

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.769
I will transfer you into such immortal body.
You will always remain alive. But there is

00:10:23.769 --> 00:10:26.630
a condition for it.
You will have to rob with us.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.550
Look! I will spend the money on your body,
getting from there.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.630
At first, "Chappie" refuses then he agrees
in this greed,

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:38.450
That it will remain alive forever. Contrarily,
scientist was very disturbed.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.889
Because he was thinking as "Chappie" may not
bring devastation now.

00:10:41.889 --> 00:10:46.190
He thinks, I may go to make it understand!
As he goes to their hiding place and calls

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.899
"Chappie",
"Chappie" overlooks him in spite of hearing

00:10:48.899 --> 00:10:52.070
him.
It does not respond him. Because it had developed

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.930
the hate for scientist in it.
Scientist goes after it and says, Why are

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:59.690
you not listening me?
Then "Chappie" responds, Don't talk with me

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.060
more!
you have installed such a system in me so

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:06.170
I may damage soon.
Scientist tells, It is not as such! Who did

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.630
say it to you this?
you are not only one robot in which the battery

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:13.980
has been set.
On the other side, the engineer was very envious.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.180
So he destroys all scientist's created robots
whole, using a system.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.120
It means, he damages their system.
Now all robot had been damaged throughout

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.230
the country.
Now criminals had got freedom. They begin

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.960
to spread the criminality in the whole country.
At the same time, Chappie's system also begin

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.220
to damage.
But scientist immediately detects it.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.480
He repairs it, bringing it into the factory
. And it also restarts it.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.510
So it may be saved before damaging.
"Chappie" embraces scientist, restoring itself.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.389
There is also a gigantic robot. "Chappie"
likes it very much.

00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:49.760
It suggests to scientist, transfer me into
this robotic body!

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.220
I have liked it! And I will also remain alive
forever.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:58.460
Then scientist tells it, No! It is "A I".
It is just a robot. And you can think like

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.820
the human beings.
Your program cannot be copied or transferred

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.250
into anything.
It is your own thought. "Chappie" gets angry

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.820
from him.
And it argues him , You don't want that I

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.470
may survive.
Engineer is also listening this conversation

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.980
there.
He is astonished how a robot is talking like

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:18.430
the humans.
So "Chappie" goes from there, taking the neurotransmitter.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:25.120
So it may copy its consciousness. And he also
succeeds in doing so.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.160
then drug dealer reaches there and says, The
time of robbery has arrived!

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.250
They begin to arrange their weapons. "Chappie"
was also quite prepared for it.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:38.451
They reach that place where they had to rob.
TV is also broadcasting this news. Scientist

00:12:38.451 --> 00:12:41.490
notices this ,
"Chappie" is robbing instead of giving its

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.880
words.
He feels bad. That engineer used to be envious

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.529
from that scientist,
Because he had also made some robot designs,

00:12:48.529 --> 00:12:51.449
But his robot designs had not been accepted
before.

00:12:51.449 --> 00:12:56.279
Ans scientist's designs had to be accepted.
He never used to tolerate it. He had got a

00:12:56.279 --> 00:13:00.360
chance to complain.
He immediately goes to the CEO of the company.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.750
He says to her, Are you noticing?
You had forbidden scientist. In spite of it,

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:09.009
he created the human mind robot.
He says to CEO, Just check after accepting

00:13:09.009 --> 00:13:13.290
my robot design!
I will hold a complete control over my robot.

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:17.670
And I will damage "Chappie". His CEO says
to him, What can be done at this critical

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:21.029
time?
I give you chance! That engineer immediately

00:13:21.029 --> 00:13:24.980
activates his robot.
And he begins to control it. He had sent his

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.829
robot to end "Chappie".
Knowing it, scientist goes to "Chappie" after

00:13:28.829 --> 00:13:32.269
being upset.
Then that gang member arrives there.

00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:36.699
And he was asking drug dealer to pay his debt.
The engineer's robot had also reached there

00:13:36.699 --> 00:13:39.240
till that time.
A big quarrel begins among them.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.529
A great firing is started. Meanwhile this
female dug dealer and her fiend receive the

00:13:43.529 --> 00:13:47.009
gun shot.
Scientist also becomes the target of gun at

00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:50.000
the same time.
But "Chappie" is confused when he observes

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.850
that scientist has been shot.
Because it had affections for him in some

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.610
way.
Female drug dealer is also with him.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:01.290
And they move, taking away the wounded scientist.
On the other side, that male drug dealer,

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.519
He is attempting to stop that big robot made
by the engineer.

00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:08.970
Otherwise, that robot may also kill him.
That robot was biggest that it is going to

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:14.170
attack that male drug dealer.
But female drug dealer begins to shoot that

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.100
robot with her gun, witnessing it.
Then that robot becomes aggressive.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.230
It starts to move to that female drug dealer,
leaving the male drug dealer.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.870
That gigantic robot kills that female drug
dealer.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.550
"Chappie" takes her its mother so it become
furious , seeing it.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.730
So it explodes this gigantic robot, using
an explosive.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.570
Afterward, it drives itself to the company,
making the scientist sit in the car.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.110
Engineer is waiting for them. He begins to
attack them as they reach there.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.139
"Chappie" was already in rage on him so it
attacks him contrarily.

00:14:44.139 --> 00:14:47.430
Because it knew that he is one who is controlling
gigantic robot.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.900
"Chappie" makes that engineer knock out while
hitting badly.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.930
On the other side, scientist was not restoring
his sense.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:59.480
"Chappie" does what it understands.
He changes the scientist's body into a robot.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:04.480
Scientist does not understand , waking up,How
How did he transfer into the body of robot?

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.709
So he says to "Chappie", I also transfer you!
Now "Chappie" was also in the body of other

00:15:09.709 --> 00:15:14.149
robot.
He was excited. In the end , it is seen that,

00:15:14.149 --> 00:15:18.160
Female drug dealer is being buried by "Chappie"
and scientist.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.650
"Chappie" says to female dug dealer directing
its face to her,

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:26.560
Mother! Don't' be worried. I will also transfer
your body into a robot.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.529
That is true! While hacking the entire system,
it creates a new robot.

00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:33.790
It also replicates the consciousness of a
female drug dealer.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.829
That female drug dealer was now operating
as a robot.

00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:41.670
And the movie also completes on this scene.
