00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.980
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.110
Today I'm going to show you a 1996 science
fiction action film called Independence Day.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.550
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.070
Watch out and take careIn New Mexico, the
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.800
detects a pulsing signal over their radar
on the second of July.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.660
The one in charge informs their chief, and
they continue to investigate the source of

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.779
the movement.

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.890
They guess that it's a radio signal from another
world, but it seems impossible.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.410
They carry on with finding the origin, and
they find out that it's coming from the moon.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.469
Radar receptions are impaired, but the government
manages to trace the problem.

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.859
A flying object which is 550 kilometres in
diameter enters orbit around Earth.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.030
In the White House, the Secretary of Defense
calls President Thomas Whitmore a visit to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.539
alarm him about the situation.

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:52.210
A giant alien mothership is getting closer
to the Earth's atmosphere as time passes by.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.999
David Levinson, an MIT-trained satellite technician,
works at a cable company in New York City.

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:02.739
During that day, their office becomes extremely
busy as satellites are malfunctioning.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.560
David tries to understand the situation, but
he finds it difficult to believe that big

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.460
objects could approach Earth.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.310
The mothership deploys several dozen saucer-shaped
spacecraft, each about 24 kilometres across.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.149
The smaller spacecraft, also known as destroyers,
take positions over many of Earth's major

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:26.020
cities, including New York, Washington, D.C.,
Los Angeles, and Moscow.Major generals meet

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.159
with the President to discuss how they can
address the situation; another soldier walks

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.180
in and informs them that the ship is multiplying
and is about to enter the Earth's atmosphere

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.700
in the next minutes.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.420
In a faraway desert in Iraq, people sight
an enormous swarm of clouds covering the massive

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.600
spacecraft; marine operators spot this and
inform the U.S. government.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.899
Television channels worldwide are malfunctioning,
and news channels can hardly show updates

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.479
on the situation.

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.600
As the spacecraft gets more exposed to the
Earth, President Whitmore decides to address

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.490
the nation with an emergency broadcast.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.149
Earthquakes happen all around the country,
and people from different cities start to

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.350
notice smoke and big chunks of clouds; the
spaceship is beginning to reveal itself to

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.799
the human world.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.159
It is now directly above buildings and people's
homes.

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:11.920
Panic overtakes cities.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.090
People are in complete disbelief as they see
the spaceship emerging from the clouds.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.430
They all take a moment to get a glimpse of
that rare or rather historical sighting.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.569
Because of this,
people start running to hide or take shelter.

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.010
The traffic is in complete chaos as cars start
to bump against each other.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.849
Instead of fleeing their office, David gets
a closer look at the spaceship on the building's

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:32.849
rooftop.

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.000
He observes it and decodes a signal with hidden
satellite transmissions, which he firmly believes

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.950
is a timer counting down to a coordinated
attack by the aliens.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.180
Meanwhile, Captain Steven Hiller, a Marine
FA-18 pilot, is at home with his family during

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.379
the event.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.069
His girlfriend's son informs him and his girlfriend
about the aliens, but they brush him off.

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.209
Captain Hiller finally comes outside and notices
a helicopter flying over and sees the big

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.360
ship floating over the city.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.510
David returns to the office and explains to
his coworker that the spaceship and its destroyers

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.610
position themselves in major cities to countdown
to a powerful attack.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.130
The aliens are using one signal to synchronize
their plans, and in six hours, that signal

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.030
will completely disappear.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.480
As his coworker panics, they watch while president
Whitmore addresses the nation.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.990
David immediately calls his ex-wife, White
House Communications Director Constance Spano,

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.079
to warn her that she is in great danger in
the White House.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.930
Constance tells David that he is just paranoid
and hangs up the phone.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.739
David decides to come to Washington for Constance,
with the help of his father, Julius.

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.269
On the television, a man named Russell Casse,
a former fighter pilot and war veteran, acts

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.250
hysteric, claiming that he got abducted by
aliens ten years ago, wherein they experimented

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.340
on him.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.950
Together with his children, Russell decides
to leave the area that they are at to get

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.739
away from danger.

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.520
When David and Julius enter Washington, protesters
scatter around the White House.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.620
David tries to contact Constance again to
gain access to the premises.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.370
After successfully convincing her to let them
in, David warns President Whitmore of the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.950
impending attack.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.150
He makes an illustration to explain the aliens'
plan on their agenda on Earth.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.069
The countdown is almost over, and the government
should resort to immediate courses of actions.

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.280
The air force gets a closer look at the spaceship,
causing the aliens to attack with advanced

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.390
directed energy weapons.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.720
President Whitmore immediately orders large-scale
evacuations of the targeted U.S. cities, but

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.140
it is too late.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.170
While the President and his associates, including
David and Julius, board a helicopter to safety,

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.610
the countdown ends.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.320
The destroyers fire a destructive beam, causing
a tremendous explosion that burns up the targeted

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.330
cities.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.060
Citizens clamour and panic as they are stuck
in traffic and their homes.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.280
Most of the people left behind got wiped out
in the massive eruptions and died.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.480
The once vibrant places are now nothing but
ashes.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.630
During the
explosion, Captain Hiller's girlfriend, Jasmine,

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.450
is stuck in traffic with her son, Dylan.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.780
They manage to escape by running to a small
room in the tunnel.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.940
When they got out, the world left behind is
a complete disaster; No signs of life are

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.510
present.On the third of July, the United States
conducts a counter-attack led by the Black

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.170
Knights, a squadron of the Marine Corps.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.600
They participate in an assault on one of the
destroyers, which is in Los Angeles.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.530
The squad fires their initial attack, but
their weapons fail to penetrate the destroyer

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.760
because force fields protect it.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.330
As the team gets closer to it, smaller attacker
ships release their shields, which decimate

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.070
the Black Knights and other military bases.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.440
The generals instruct the squadrons to abort
the mission, as the aliens are highly in favour

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.270
of the battle.Meanwhile, Captain Hiller manages
to evade the attackers' guns and lures an

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.330
attacker to the Grand Canyon.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.440
As his jet is about to run out of fuel, he
deploys the parachute for his jet, and it

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.130
drapes onto the attacker, giving it zero visibility,
causing it to crash.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.810
Captain Hiller ejects from the jet and survives.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.010
He starts to approach the crashed attacker
angrily and punches the alien inside it, knocking

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.710
it unconscious.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.780
Onboard Air Force One, President Whitmore
discusses with his staff ways to cope with

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.460
the situation after news that the North American
Aerospace Defense Command is gone.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.290
Arguing about how they should have announced
an executive order to evacuate the main cities

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.940
under attack, David's father suggests that
the U.S. government did know about the attackers,

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.600
having recorded some evidence of a previous
visit to Area 51 in the Nevada desert.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.530
The President brushes him off by saying that
Area 51 does not exist.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.270
However, the defence secretary tells him that
it does.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.870
Captain Hiller struggles to drag the alien's
body across the desert using his parachute.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.270
He sees a convoy of vehicles approaching and
asks for help.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.040
These are some of the survivors of the explosion.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.110
He comes across Russell, who he asks for help.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.040
The President arrives at the research facility;
the head scientist, Dr Brackish Okun, gives

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.280
him a tour.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.620
He reveals a spacecraft that they are currently
researching.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.710
Dr Okun tells them that the biochemistry of
the aliens is similar to that of humans as

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.430
they can breathe the same air.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.940
They do not seem to use sound to communicate.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.460
However, the Area 51 group believes they communicate
telepathically.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.560
Dr Okun continues to show them three actual
bodies of the aliens

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.620
that are preserving in the lab.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.050
Captain Hiller arrives at Area 51 with the
captured alien; staff and soldiers rush to

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.320
examine it.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.390
As the procedure to remove the outer suit
from the alien begins, the living being inside

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.710
it reveals.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.060
The alien regains consciousness and kills
the staff inside the operating room.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.280
It manages to manipulate and use Dr Okun's
voice to communicate with the President outside

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.800
the glass windows.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.110
It commands the group to release it.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.690
President Whitmore asks a question to the
alien, asking if humans and their invaders

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.210
can live in peace.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.270
The alien answers, "no peace".

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.800
It then uses its telepathic skills to invade
President Whitmore's mind, immobilizing him

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.280
for a brief time.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.710
The personnel manage to shoot the alien, finally
killing it, while Dr Okun falls in a coma.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.410
While the President was immobilized, he could
read the alien's thoughts and get a hold of

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:57.510
their plan, mainly to attack planets, kill
life in it, and use its resources.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.920
He orders the bombers to deploy and strike
one of the spaceships.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.630
The weapon explodes, but it fails to penetrate
through the force field once again.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.940
Because of this, the President gives the order
to call back the remaining bombers.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.500
First Lady Marilyn Whitmore, the President's
wife, is caught up and stranded in Los Angeles

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.220
with Captain Hiller's girlfriend and her son.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:22.130
Captain Hiller rescues and flies them to area
51 to reunite with the rest of the team.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.280
One of the resident doctors informs the President
that his wife has uncontrollable internal

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.280
bleeding.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.280
He comforts her by saying that she will be
fine, but not long after that, the First Lady

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.550
dies.

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:36.839
On the fourth of July, David gathers everyone
and demonstrates how the attacker's shield

00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:37.839
works.

00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:41.599
He continues to activate a program on his
laptop that can deactivate the attacker's

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:42.630
shield.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.600
The bullet effectively gets through the attacker
ship.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.759
David presents a plan that involves using
a newly operable alien attacker to gain access

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:53.910
to the inside of the alien mother ship in
space to introduce a computer virus that will

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:58.459
disintegrate the protective force fields around
the destroyers and attackers on Earth.

00:08:58.459 --> 00:09:02.449
Captain Hiller volunteers to pilot the attacker;
David suggests that he accompany Hiller to

00:09:02.449 --> 00:09:04.730
upload the virus to the mother ship.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.709
The Americans start to communicate the plan
to military bases throughout the world using

00:09:08.709 --> 00:09:11.120
Morse code to coordinate an attack.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.870
With a lack of human resources, the commanders
call for volunteer pilots to start their mission,

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.639
including President Whitmore and Russell,
who wants to get his revenge on the aliens.

00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:24.600
Captain Hiller and Jasmine decide to get married
before he leaves for his mission.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.060
Dylan acts as their ring bearer, while Constance
and David act as their witnesses.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.949
At this moment, the ex-lovers reconnect as
they hold hands.

00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:37.240
Before taking off, President Whitmore gives
a speech about the new Independence Day.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.899
Julius and Constance bid David goodbye.

00:09:39.899 --> 00:09:42.480
Hope and worry fill the air at the same time.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.459
Captain Hiller and David prepare to launch
the attacker.

00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:49.339
As they reach the mother ship, President Whitmore
takes charge of the American jet fighters

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:52.670
against the alien destroyers approaching Area
51.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.779
In the mothership, swarms of attackers surround
them.

00:09:55.779 --> 00:09:59.689
Thousands of aliens seem to be planning for
a complete invasion of the Earth.

00:09:59.689 --> 00:10:03.430
They get to the heart of the mother ship and
implant the virus successfully.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:07.370
The squad's supply of missiles is quickly
exhausted even though the force field got

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:08.370
broken.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.930
They manage to destroy more attackers and
move forward.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.519
A war instantly begins, and people start to
evacuate.

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:18.350
The underside of the spaceship opens up as
its energy weapon prepares to fire on the

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:19.350
base.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.420
Russell radios that he has a final rocket
and launches it.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:27.389
However, his firing mechanism jams, and he
decides to sacrifice himself by piloting his

00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:30.710
aircraft into the alien weapon in a kamikaze
attack.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:35.350
The explosion annihilates the whole spaceship,
leaving the humans in victory.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:39.130
Back in the mother ship, Captain Hiller fails
to disconnect from a clamp.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:43.089
They smoke cigars before they fire the nuke
and sincerely thank each other.

00:10:43.089 --> 00:10:46.940
The weapon penetrates to a control centre
navigated by an alien.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.579
Captain Hiller's ship is now free, and he
furiously drives it toward the portal where

00:10:50.579 --> 00:10:53.800
they entered, narrowly escaping in the last
seconds.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.000
The mother ship explodes instantly.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.939
They arrive on the Earth safely, and both
smoke their "victory cigars".

00:10:59.939 --> 00:11:08.199
The whole team celebrates and reunites while
the rest of the world exalts in joy as humans

00:11:08.199 --> 00:11:14.720
have claimed their home again.
