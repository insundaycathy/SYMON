Edward Lewis, is a high-powered corporate
raider from New York, he buys and dismantles

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.839
struggling companies, selling off the assets
for profit. He wants his girlfriend to accompany

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.880
him during a business trip, but fed up with
being his "beck and call girl," she ends their

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.890
relationship. This all takes place at a swanky
party held by his partner Philip Stuckey,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.340
and he decides to cuts loose in Stuckey's
Lotus. He gets lost and accidentally stops

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.870
along Hollywood Boulevard in the city’s
red-light district. There he encounters prostitute

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.400
Vivian Ward. He asks for directions from hooker
Vivenne Ward. She charges him, then gets in.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.790
As he is having difficulties driving a manual
transmission car, he pays Vivian to drive

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.270
him to the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel.
Edward then impulsively hires her for the

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.630
night, He asks her up to his penthouse suite
on a whim and pays her to stay all night,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.740
although he seems uncomfortable at first and
despite some awkwardness, he finds her charming

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.439
and gets on well with her. The next day, he
asks Vivian to play his girlfriend that week

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.380
at a series of business events he's attending
while attempting a takeover of shipbuilder

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.329
James Morse's company. Edward offers Vivian
$3,000 for six days, He also gives her money

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.939
for clothes and says she needs to be at his
"beck and call" with no strings attached.

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.259
Vivian excitedly accepts, She calls her room-mate
Kit to leave her money for the rent, and goes

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.450
shopping on Rodeo Drive for more appropriate
clothes.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.049
but when she attempts to go shopping on Rodeo
Drive, a snooty saleswomen won't serve her

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.789
as she is still dressed like a hooker and
so she returns to the hotel, where she gets

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.850
stopped by the hotel manager, Barney. He wants
to make it clear that they are making an exception

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.319
having her at the hotel as Edward is such
a special guest. Vivienne gets upset as she

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.479
still has no outfit for dinner, and Barney
helps her, along with coaching her on dinner

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.889
etiquette. When Edwards returns, Edward is
impressed by Vivian's transformation and opens

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:05.539
up to her, revealing details about his personal
and business life, including his turbulent

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.679
relationship with his late father.

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.140
The next day, Vivienne tells him about the
experience shopping the previous day, and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.630
Edward takes her back to spend an obscene
amount of money on clothes, leaving her to

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.210
go back to his work as she is transformed
from hooker to lady. She goes back to the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.770
shop from the previous day to show them the
big mistake they made! Back at hotel, she

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.020
looks like a genuine guest, but when Edward
gets home he is still busy with work, and

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.600
they take a bath together and talk into the
night about their pasts and how they ended

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.250
up where they are today.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.480
The following day, Edward takes Vivienne to
the polo. While Vivienne chats to David Morse,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.060
the grandson of the man involved in Edward's
latest deal, Philip is worried she is a corporate

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.010
spy. Edward reassures him by telling him how
they met and that she’s a hooker. Later

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.730
at the event Philip comes on to Vivienne.
When they return to the hotel, she is furious

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.620
with Edward for telling him, and plans to
leave, but he persuades her to see out the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.110
week. Edward leaves work early the next day
and takes Vivian by private jet to see La

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.310
traviata at the San Francisco Opera. The story
of a prostitute who falls in love with a rich

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.340
man moves Vivian.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.620
She clearly is moved by the music, and says
"If I forget to tell you later, I had a wonderful

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.040
time tonight". On returning to the hotel,
he falls asleep while she is getting ready

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.820
for bed. Vivian then kisses him on the lips,
she doesn't do this with clients, and they

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.410
make love as partners, rather than client
and hooker. After mistakenly believing Edward

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.890
is asleep, Vivian admits she loves him.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.110
Edwards return to New York is imminent, so
over breakfast, Edward offers to help Vivian

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.510
get off the streets and suggests putting her
up in a nice condo and giving her an allowance,

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.510
promising to visit her regularly. so, he can
continue seeing her, but she feels insulted

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.620
as Edward is still treating her like a prostitute,
and says this is not the fairy tale she wants.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.470
He then goes off to work without resolving
the situation. Kit then comes to the hotel

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.960
and sees that she has fallen for him, but
she denies it.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.471
Edward meets Morse, about to close the deal,
and changes his mind at the last minute. His

00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:06.740
time with Vivienne has shown him another way
of being. He wants to create things rather

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.900
than just making money. He chooses to work
with Morse to save his company instead of

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.210
dismantling it.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.440
Philip is livid, furious that Edward's new
direction has cost him a fortune and goes

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.959
to the hotel. Vivienne is there and he blames
her for changing Edwards character. he attempts

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.720
to rape her and then hits her, Edward returns
just in time and pulls him off. Edward then

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.000
fires him and chucks him out. With his business
in L A complete, Edward asks Vivian to stay

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.521
with him one more night, but only because
she wants to, not because he will pay. She

00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:38.590
refuses and leaves.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.970
Vivienne is then seen back at home with Kit,
packing up to leave for San Franscisco.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.930
Edward re-thinks his life, and while being
driven to the airport, has the chauffeur detour

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.960
to Vivian's apartment building. He climbs
out through the white limousine's sunroof

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.460
and ascends the fire escape to kiss Vivian,
overcoming his fear of heights and metaphorically

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.210
fulfilling her fairytale dream.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.650
