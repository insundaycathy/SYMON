00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.520
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I’m going to explain a drama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.800
horror, sci-fi film called, “Sputnik.”&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.360
During the Cold War in 1983, two Russian&nbsp;
cosmonauts, Commander Konstantin Veshnyakov&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.520
and Lieutenant Kirill Averchenko complete&nbsp;
the final leg of the “Orbit-4” space mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.234
Averchenko talks about his excitement to see&nbsp;
his family as they prepare for an atmospheric&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:27.520
reentry towards the earth. After executing all&nbsp;
the system procedures, the two men are finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.680
ready to descend. As they begin to enter the&nbsp;
earth’s atmosphere, powerful turbulence suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.160
causes their spacecraft to shake vigorously,&nbsp;
forcing the system to fluctuate. As both men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.680
try to regain their composure, they notice&nbsp;
a silhouette of a non-terrestrial creature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.280
lumbering across the window toward them.&nbsp;
The Orbit-4 spacecraft enters the earth’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.880
atmosphere as it crash-landed in the fields&nbsp;
of Kazakhstan with only Konstatin surviving.&nbsp;

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.040
Inside The Research Institute of&nbsp;
Brain in Moscow, Dr. Tatyana Yurievna,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.720
a psychiatrist and a renowned neurophysiologist,&nbsp;
stands on trial for alleged malpractice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.480
She explains that her patient was improperly&nbsp;
diagnosed by the previous doctor and insists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.920
that the method of submerging the patient into&nbsp;
the water is necessary to temporarily cut the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.200
oxygen supply inside the lungs. In the end,&nbsp;
Tatyana is sanctioned for dismissal. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.480
Colonel Semiradov, Head Secretary of the Soviet&nbsp;
Union’s Scientific Research, spectates her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.200
proceedings from afar. Impressed by her forthright&nbsp;
attitude, he approaches Tatyana and presents a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.160
proposition. Semiradov tells Tatyana that he&nbsp;
runs a research institute for neuropsychiatry.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.520
He persuades her that he will take care of the&nbsp;
review board if she goes with him to Kazakhstan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.000
to work on a case. Showing no reluctance,&nbsp;
Tatyana takes the helicopter with Semiradov,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.560
heading their way to Kazakhstan. Inflight,&nbsp;
Semiradov discloses how they had to falsify the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.280
media reports about the recent Orbit-4 landing.&nbsp;
He then tells Tatyana how they lost radio contact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.760
with them on the day before they landed. And the&nbsp;
patient, sole survivor Commander Konstantin, who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.760
was then retrieved near the spacecraft’s remains,&nbsp;
suddenly suffers from episodic memory loss.&nbsp;

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.640
They soon arrive at the All-Union Scientific&nbsp;
Research Institute. As they head to one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.520
underground labs, Semiradov tells Tatyana that&nbsp;
she has access to 90% of the facility. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.880
find Dr. Yan Rigel, the Research Director of the&nbsp;
institute, attempting to hypnotize Konstantin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.960
After a few minutes of bad luck, Rigel&nbsp;
ends the session in disappointment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.520
As Rigel vents his frustration out, Tatyana&nbsp;
enters the glass confinement to meet Konstantin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.920
She introduces herself and offers him a cup of&nbsp;
tea. Just as he grabs the cup, Tatyana observes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.240
his every movement keenly. She explains that&nbsp;
she was requested to assess his condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.080
Then she shows an indifferent expression towards&nbsp;
him and suddenly asks about his toy. Despite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.240
Tatyana’s impoliteness, Konstantin graciously&nbsp;
answers that it’s a cosmonaut’s tradition to bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.400
one personal possession with them in space. After&nbsp;
a few minutes of running through the initial stage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.160
of the interview, Konstantin asks Tatyana’s help&nbsp;
to contact his mother to tell her that he’s doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.880
well. Neither confirming to agree nor disagree,&nbsp;
she then takes her leave. On the other side of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.640
the glass confinement, she tells her colleagues&nbsp;
that the patient is suffering from P.T.S.D,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.720
or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, and explains&nbsp;
that his sensory receptors may be damaged as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.640
she expresses her disapproval of confining&nbsp;
Konstantin more of a prisoner than a patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.040
After stating her case, Tatyana tells Semiradov&nbsp;
that she's already done and now intends to leave.&nbsp;

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.440
Tatyana is scheduled for the next day’s flight&nbsp;
to Moscow, without a choice, she is compelled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.360
to stay for the night. After making up her&nbsp;
room, she then goes to the telephone to grant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.760
Konstantin’s request to call his mother, but the&nbsp;
operator denies her attempt. Later that night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.480
Semiradov knocks on her door, bringing her back&nbsp;
to the lab. A group of soldiers suddenly arrives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.240
moving quickly to secure an additional set&nbsp;
of latches around Konstantin’s confines.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.600
Then on a monitor screen, Tatyana&nbsp;
watches Konstantin struggle as he spews&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.440
blood on the floor, after which an embryo of a&nbsp;
non-terrestrial creature comes out from his mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.480
Seeing the creature come to&nbsp;
life, she spaces out in extreme&nbsp;

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.240
terror. Tatyana then clings around&nbsp;
herself, trying to keep herself together.&nbsp;

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.240
Semiradov explains that the creature resides&nbsp;
inside Konstantine. The creature comes out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.400
from its host during the night. Although it may&nbsp;
look like Konstantin suffers in pain, it exits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.720
and enters his body without really harming him.&nbsp;
Tatyana is suspicious and demands the reason why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.800
they want her to work on this classified case.&nbsp;
Semiradov admits that he chose her because of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.400
radical approach in the medical field regardless&nbsp;
of the process in order to get certain results.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.720
Instead of being flattered, Tatyana feels&nbsp;
that her abilities are being challenged.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.240
She then pensively demands all the classified&nbsp;
materials to properly officiate the case.&nbsp;

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.080
Tatyana finds out about the nature of the&nbsp;
creature as she examines the results of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.360
the previous experiments when they tried&nbsp;
to separate the creature from its host.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.760
Without the creature, Konstantin’s vital signs&nbsp;
progressively deteriorate; while at the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.680
he acquires phenomenal vitality and exceptional&nbsp;
healing capabilities when the creature is inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.680
his body. The creature incubates itself&nbsp;
between Konstantin's esophagus and stomach;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.680
and every time it urges to exit its host,&nbsp;
it induces a toxin that relaxes the muscles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.920
knocking its host unconscious as it ventures&nbsp;
outside. Its ability to withstand outside its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.600
host’s body increases by a fraction of ten&nbsp;
minutes on every occasion; and currently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.840
the creature can stay outside for over an hour.&nbsp;
Tatyana is determined to find out whether the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.240
creature is a parasite or a symbiote that&nbsp;
bonds with its host, creating a single entity.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.880
Meanwhile, as Tatyana reviews&nbsp;
the footage of the creature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.240
Dr. Rigel enters the room. She then asks Rigel how&nbsp;
the creature feeds. Rigel explains that it gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.960
its nutrients from the food that Konstantin eats.&nbsp;
As Tatyana notices Rigel’s enmity towards her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.800
she sarcastically clarifies that she is not after&nbsp;
his position nor his aim for the Nobel Prize.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.680
Later on, she makes an appointment with Konstantin&nbsp;
and catches him inside his cell exercising.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.440
Konstantin confronts Tatyana that she might&nbsp;
presumably be drawn to him and accuses her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.760
she willingly presented herself to officiate&nbsp;
this case. Tatyana sarcastically informs him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.920
that she is more likely to think that he is&nbsp;
deranged. Catching his attention, Konstantin asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.160
her to elaborate. She discloses that the whole&nbsp;
institution thinks that he killed his co-pilot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.640
Averchenko. After finding Averchenko dead as soon&nbsp;
as they have landed, there is no other person that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.200
is likely to be suspected except him. Showing&nbsp;
signs of aggravation, Konstantin realizes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.120
it could be the whole reason why they held him&nbsp;
in detention. As he conveys how he prepares for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.040
this moment of truth, he insists that he didn't&nbsp;
know how it happened if it did really happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.960
Ignoring his claim, Tatyana adds that she&nbsp;
read on his profile that he abandoned his son.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.640
She accuses him of being self-centered to have&nbsp;
chosen his career as a space crew rather than to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.520
be a father to his child. Konstantin is offended&nbsp;
and asks her to leave. She then quickly returns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.600
to her infuriated colleagues and apologizes&nbsp;
for her menial manner towards Konstantin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.520
She orders them to test his endocrine levels as&nbsp;
she explains that she intended to aggravate him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.200
on purpose to increase his psychological stress&nbsp;
in order to accurately determine how the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.160
reacts to hormonal change. Afterward, she asks&nbsp;
Semiradov to transfer Konstantin into a medical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.440
unit during daylight hours and to allow him&nbsp;
to interact with other people in an attempt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.040
to recreate a normal life circumstance for&nbsp;
him to obtain a realistic clinical approach.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.640
The next day, Tatyana pays Konstantin a visit&nbsp;
to his assigned medical unit. She apologizes for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.400
provoking him intentionally just to measure&nbsp;
his hormone levels under severe distress.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.960
Konstantin sits down silently, turning his&nbsp;
back on her. As Tatyana is about to leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.480
he suddenly tells her that he didn’t know&nbsp;
about the child. A week before his flight he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.800
was informed about his fiance’s death. His fiance&nbsp;
didn’t have any relatives so his son was brought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.000
into an orphanage without his knowledge.&nbsp;
The government concealed that information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.840
from him in order to prevent him from making&nbsp;
any sudden decisions prior to their mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.040
Then Konstantin approaches her and tells her&nbsp;
about his suspicion that she stayed not to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.040
cure him of amnesia but for a far greater&nbsp;
reason. Tatyana falls silent for a while,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.560
and as she stares at him, she tells him that&nbsp;
she is not allowed to disclose anything.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.560
On that night, Tatyana stands behind the glass&nbsp;
confinement as Konstantin lies unconsciously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.880
on the floor. The creature walks towards her,&nbsp;
scanning her on the other side of the glass.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.720
Tatyana demonstrates to show how she lies&nbsp;
on the floor. Observing her movements,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.040
the creature imitates her position. She then&nbsp;
accidentally knocks Konstantin's toy as she stands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.160
up. As the toy staggers, the creature looks at it&nbsp;
in fascination. Tatyana then puts on a protective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.240
suit and demands to raise the glass. Without&nbsp;
anything in between them, she places the toy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.400
in front of the creature. All of the sudden, the&nbsp;
creature twines around the toy unexpectedly, as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.960
if a predator protecting its offspring. Looking in&nbsp;
astonishment, Tatyana tries to lay a hand on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.280
creature but suddenly slips on the slime in the&nbsp;
attempt, causing the creature to react violently.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.680
Semiradov immobilizes the creature by switching&nbsp;
the bright lights on. Then he immediately lures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.080
the glass down as the soldiers pull Tatyana
to safety.&nbsp;

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.160
Right after the incident, Semiradov checks&nbsp;
on Tatyana. Excited about her new discovery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.600
she tells him how Konstantin’s subconscious&nbsp;
self embodies the creature’s mind after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.600
noticing how the creature reacted towards&nbsp;
the toy. She hypothesizes that it reacted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.640
in such a way because the toy reminds him&nbsp;
about the guilt he feels towards his son.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.720
She is convinced that Konstantin and the creature&nbsp;
are a single entity and share the same conscious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.360
mind. She assesses that the creature partially&nbsp;
alleviates Konstantin's memory and social skills,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.160
causing amnesia. She then concludes that at some&nbsp;
point, the creature will no longer need its host.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.960
She suggests bringing Konstantin&nbsp;
to Moscow for proper treatment but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.720
is instantly rejected by the Colonel.&nbsp;
Semiradov justifies that he makes fake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.240
reports every day to protect his comrade and&nbsp;
to substantially avoid getting an order from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.520
the higher ops to destroy the creature and&nbsp;
most likely eliminate Konstantin as well.&nbsp;

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.640
Tatyana once again reviews the videos and happens&nbsp;
to notice some parts of the footage were edited.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.080
She then confronts Rigel about her suspicion&nbsp;
that the creature might not be feeding on what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.480
Konstantin takes in for himself but entirely feeds&nbsp;
itself separately. She asserts that in order for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.960
her to lead a sound investigation, she demands&nbsp;
the right to know about everything. Rigel reacts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.280
distressfully as he threatens her, telling her&nbsp;
to go back to Moscow. Tatyana then reminds Rigel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.120
about the Nobel Prize after which she insists that&nbsp;
he won’t make any progress without her expertise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.720
as she convinces Rigel to provide her all the&nbsp;
information without letting Semiradov know.&nbsp;

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.040
Later that night, Rigel takes Tatyana&nbsp;
during the creature’s feeding sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.880
Concealing herself at the back of Rigil’s truck,&nbsp;
she’s able to sneak inside the feeding chamber.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.120
Rigil hands her a night-vision telescope in order&nbsp;
for her to completely observe the whole procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.640
In a large cage, the soldiers locked&nbsp;
in one of the prisoners inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.560
Due to its sensitivity towards bright lights, the&nbsp;
feeding must be done in a low light condition as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.640
they bring forth the creature to its human prey.&nbsp;
The creature shows itself to its victims first in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.080
order to expand their fear, letting the brain&nbsp;
increase its cortisol production from which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.800
the creature feeds and obtains its nutrition.
The next morning, Tatyana invites Konstantin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.360
for a run around the facility’s compound. As they&nbsp;
do their rounds, Tatyana secretly tells him about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.600
the alien creature from outer space that’s inside&nbsp;
him. Then she continues about her recent discovery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.120
that the creature feeds on people. She then&nbsp;
explains that she can help him separate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.720
creature from himself, but in order to do that,&nbsp;
they need someone that can inform the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.440
regarding his condition. He acts as if he heard&nbsp;
nothing from Tatyana and quickly turns around.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.640
Just as before Konstantin finishes his&nbsp;
run, he instructs her to meet him at&nbsp;

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.880
midnight on the hallway that&nbsp;
is located close to the lab.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.840
At exactly midnight, both Konstantin and&nbsp;
Tatyana are able to meet at the rendezvous.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.080
They remain covert, slipping in the hallway,&nbsp;
heading towards the facility’s morgue. Konstantin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.480
confesses that he is the creature himself, a&nbsp;
version of himself without morals nor obligations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.560
He admits that he feels everything it feels and&nbsp;
clearly remembers every detail of what it sees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.920
Then she asks for the reason why he keeps it for&nbsp;
himself if he already knew what was happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.160
from the beginning. He justifies that if ever&nbsp;
Semiradov knows that he can control the creature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.840
the more that he will be kept in custody.&nbsp;
He plans to endure everything for two weeks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.920
before getting a discharge order from the review&nbsp;
board; however, Tatyana disapproves of the thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.960
that he needs to feed on people for
another two weeks. This creates a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.720
great deal of disagreement between them.
Upon returning to her room, one of the soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.880
intercepts her and takes her to Semiradov’s&nbsp;
office. She then confronts Semiradov about feeding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.640
people to the creature. He admits that the real&nbsp;
reason they are here is to find a way to control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.640
the creature, turning it into an effective weapon.&nbsp;
He then takes her to the feeding chamber and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.880
locks her inside the cage together with two other&nbsp;
prisoners. From a distance, the creature quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.320
moves in to attack one of the frightened inmates&nbsp;
when Tatyana suddenly stands in front of it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.320
protecting the man behind her. The creature&nbsp;
shows hostility but was seized by Tatyana’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.880
determination to defend the man. Witnessing&nbsp;
its marvel, Semiradov subjugates Tatyana to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.320
cooperate with him to investigate how to fully&nbsp;
control the creature as he threatens her life.&nbsp;

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.920
Tatyana forces herself to work the next day. She&nbsp;
decides to study the catatonic body of Averchenko&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.520
with Rigel, to unravel the truth behind the&nbsp;
creature’s decision for choosing Konstantin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.600
over him. She finds out that Averchenko has an&nbsp;
early stage of cancer that they couldn’t detect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.320
prior to lift-off. It started with a kidney tumor&nbsp;
that eventually causes Addison’s Disease, a rare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.400
disorder of adrenal insufficiency, preventing the&nbsp;
body to produce high concentrations of metabolic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.880
hormones that include cortisol. The creature was&nbsp;
able to detect Averchenko’s condition, causing it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.520
to choose Konstantin as its host. As she calls&nbsp;
Rigel to examine Averchenko’s body, she hides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.840
her message using medical jargon, stating: At 2&nbsp;
P.M. by the medical unit, they will attempt an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.720
escape together with him. Using the same cryptic&nbsp;
language, Rigel refuses to connive with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.720
Continuing their conversation with the same&nbsp;
language, Tatyana manages to convince him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.880
He then provides Tatyana with a bag that&nbsp;
contains a sedative. Without a moment to waste,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.440
Tatyana approaches the guard and quickly injects&nbsp;
the sedative in his neck, knocking him down. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.880
then takes his gun, gives it to Rigel, and&nbsp;
asks him to be on the lookout as she steps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.680
inside Konstantin’s room. Tatyana finds Konstantin&nbsp;
weeping on the floor, feeling sorry for himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.360
Regardless, she tells him her plan&nbsp;
to escape and convinces him to do so.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.080
As they leave the room, Rigel hands Tatyana the&nbsp;
keys to his vehicle and tells them where to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.080
it. Rigel chooses to stay, telling them that there&nbsp;
is something that he needs to do in order to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.480
everything right — they then exchange sincere&nbsp;
farewells. Looking at Tatyana and Konstantin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.160
heading for the exits, Rigel rushes towards&nbsp;
his office as he securely locks the doors with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.360
a table. Then he calls the authorities, reporting&nbsp;
the incident. Meanwhile, in the surveillance room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.680
Semiradov looks at Tatyana and Konstantin&nbsp;
running off. He then executes a directive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.600
to retrieve Konstantin alive, and all at&nbsp;
once, a shoot to kill order for Tatyana.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.480
At the enclosure, the response team&nbsp;
is already holding their position,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.800
waiting for them to surrender. As Tatyana tries&nbsp;
to move away from Konstantin while she raises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.200
her hand, the response team suddenly shoots her.&nbsp;
Taking a bullet to the gut, she is lucky enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.120
that they missed killing her. On the other&nbsp;
hand, Semiradov manages to get inside his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.880
office after Rigel discloses all the information&nbsp;
to the authorities regarding their operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.840
Rigel tells Semiradov that he has already informed&nbsp;
them about their illegal activities. Expressing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.840
his grave disappointment towards Rigel’s&nbsp;
disloyalty, Semiradov shoots him dead on his seat.&nbsp;

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.920
Back at the enclosure, hiding behind the&nbsp;
crates, the response team slowly closes in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.840
Tatyana then throws the syringe that contains a&nbsp;
cocktail of hormones that can imitate the effects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.680
of Addison’s Disease, forcing the creature&nbsp;
to leave his body immediately. The creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.680
suddenly appears in front of the soldiers,&nbsp;
attacking them one by one. Then Tatyana&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.920
quickly drags Konstantin inside Rigel’s jeep and&nbsp;
rapidly drives it crashing through the gates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.760
Semiradov arrives a little too late at&nbsp;
the enclosure. Discovering that Tatyana&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.360
and Konstantin had already fled, he decides&nbsp;
to take the creature out all by himself.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.400
Driving at daybreak, Tatyana suddenly stops&nbsp;
to check on Konstantin's severe condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.880
Just behind them, Semiradov and his team&nbsp;
are closing in. Feeling helpless, Tatyana&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.880
approaches them and admits she was wrong to think&nbsp;
that Konstantin can survive without the creature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.240
Semiradov takes out the heavily injured creature&nbsp;
with the intention to force it back inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.880
Konstantin. As Konstantin becomes completely&nbsp;
symbiotic with the creature, he then transfers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.120
his consciousness to the symbiote, killing&nbsp;
Semiradov and his team. Clear from all the danger,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.080
the creature reenters Konstantin’s body, and in&nbsp;
a few seconds, Konstantin regains his vitality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.400
Looking from afar, they see the authorities&nbsp;
coming in. Now able to heave a sigh of relief,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.560
Konstantin tells Tatyana that he has finally made&nbsp;
his decision just as he subsequently pulls the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:16.080
trigger to kill the creature — alongside himself.
Tatyana survives and now leads a free life. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.840
quite some time, after all that's been done,&nbsp;
she is now ready to lead a new life together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.280
with her adoptive son, the son of the&nbsp;
late Commander Konstantin Veshnyakov.
