00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.979
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.960
Today I'm going to show you a science fiction
action film called Voyagers.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.410
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.849
Watch out and take care In the year 2063,
science discovers a habitable planet that

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.650
is suitable for human life and colonization.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.920
The voyage to that planet will take 86 years
in total.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.230
For this venture, a scouting mission will
lead the trip to save the deteriorating situation

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.350
on Earth.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.960
The crew has to reproduce during the journey,
and their grandchildren will be the ones to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.369
reach the planet.

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.020
For this purpose, 30 qualified crew members
must be chosen.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.850
They are bred from the genome of intelligent
people.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.649
They are exclusively educated to cope with
multiple challenges they could encounter in

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.510
their journey at a young age.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.510
They grow up to be children trained in complete
isolation so they won't miss the Earth during

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.730
their lonely mission.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.369
Richard, a scientist in charge of monitoring
their progress, is one of the few adults these

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:52.870
children see.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.739
Whenever he visits them, the children are
thrilled.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.479
In the learning centre, he checks on their
progress and looks for new skills that they

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:00.569
develop.

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:04.049
He decides to accompany them on the flight
with no return to protect them and ensure

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.329
their safety.

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.270
It is more self-sacrifice on his end, but
he is willing to permanently leave Earth for

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.590
this mission.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.119
This also bids them more time to arrive at
the planet sooner.

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.159
The rocket finally leaves Earth; Richard and
the children transfer to the main ship, which

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.170
will be their home forever.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.189
Richard takes a last look on Earth and accepts
that he will never see it again, and taking

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.450
care of the children is his new reality.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.179
Ten years after their descent, the children
are now teenagers who continue to attend classes

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.439
and go about their daily routines.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.140
They are all assigned tasks that are in line
with their nature of interest.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.860
Some are doctors, engineers, chemists, and
so on.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.700
However, all of them act and move docilely.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.780
In their lives, the same things happen every
day.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.049
Richard still monitors and takes care of them
after all these years.

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.590
To the crew members, he is their father figure,
and they always abide by his rules.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.409
He counsels them in one-on-one sessions to
ask how they are regularly.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.270
Without knowledge of what the outside world
looks like, Richard shares his experiences

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.649
with them.

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.490
Inside the ship, plants and food resources
are kept and maintained.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.640
Seeds and plants are secured in airtight compartments
to prevent them from being bad and reach the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.740
target planet, where they can plant.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.470
This keeps them healthy even though they are
far away from nature.One day, the botanist

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.070
Christopher discovers a problem in their irrigation
system; the computer detects toxin in their

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.070
water.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.810
He brings up the concern to Richard's attention
and sees that the toxin's source is in their

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.830
urine, which means that they are drinking
or eating something that causes this.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.819
Richard says that it's only the filter, and
he should not worry about anything else.

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.799
However, he knows exactly the source.

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.040
Christopher is unconvinced and investigates
further.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.349
Christopher and Zac, his best friend, discovers
that the blue drink everyone takes after meals

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.780
contain an unknown chemical substance.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.849
He secretly uses the computer and learns that
the chemical substance is a drug that keeps

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.290
their personality dull and suppresses their
sensual drive.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.500
This
explains how everyone lacks energy and emotions.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.189
Both of them realize that the board is drugging
them.

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.799
Without a clue on what to do with the knowledge
they have gained, they keep it to themselves

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.739
at first.The following day, Christopher and
Zac do not drink their daily doses of the

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:12.959
blue liquid.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.920
Their defiance gives them a new sense of satisfaction.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.620
They share this information with two other
crew members and reveal the location of the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.659
secret compartment in the ship.

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.720
During Christopher's counselling with Richard,
he asks about the secret compartment; Richard

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.930
explains that the chamber is reserved for
the third generation on board.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.540
Christopher has second thoughts about the
blue drink, but eventually, he realizes that

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.280
it's better to keep it to himself and his
peers.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.190
In his office, Richard informs the mission
control board on Earth that the children are

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.170
starting to lose trust in him and that he
wants to reveal the truth about everything,

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.610
but the answer will take over two months because
of the distance.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.569
As the crew members line up for their daily
routine and check-ups, Christopher starts

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.050
to feel attracted to Sela; he begins to notice
her physical features vividly and even tries

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.480
to hold her hand.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.909
However, Sela turns to him, and he stops looking.

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.090
Zac feels the same way about Sela.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.450
He approaches her and says that she looks
completely different.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.110
Zac even grabs her shoulder to get her attention.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.430
However, Sela is clueless and does not feel
anything because she still drinks the blue

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.689
liquid.

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:18.080
Christopher notices their interaction and
starts feeling a sense of rivalry with his

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.490
best friend.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.250
During their physical exercises, only Christopher
and Zac seem active.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.590
The rest of the crew members remain dull.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.800
They both wrestle playfully and seem to have
a hard time controlling their emotions.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.780
Their peers find it weird and highly unusual.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.020
In a private room, Edward, the expert on the
ship's mechanisms, alarms Christopher and

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.650
Zac that sounds are coming from outside the
ship.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.340
The three of them discuss it, but they fail
to arrive at a conclusion.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.400
Conspiracies about an extraterrestrial being
are shared among the crew members.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.520
In the next room, Richard shows Sela some
natural herbs and let her experience the scent

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.580
of these.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.240
Although the few scents are constrained in
tiny bottles, she appreciates it very much.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.290
Unknowingly, Zac watches Richard put his hand
on Sela's shoulder, which arouses jealousy.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.170
He says how unfair it is that Richard can
touch her while he can't.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.620
Christopher gets worried about Zac's demeanour.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.760
Moments after, Richard gathers and informs
the crew that a malfunction in their communication

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.250
system happened.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.240
He assigns Zac to fix the exterior of the
ship with him.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.570
While preparing, Sela explains the safety
gear to Zac; he then touches her body and

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.510
holds her unpleasantly.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.320
Richard tries to stop him, but he runs away.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.290
One of the crew members, Phoebe, reveals to
Richard that Zac has stopped drinking the

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.610
blue liquid, causing his unpredictable behaviour.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.090
Worry fills
Richard's face because he knows the consequences

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.610
if the crew members stop drinking the blue
liquidâ€”chaos.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.230
He then approaches Christopher to ask if he
has stopped drinking it as well.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.050
Christopher answers honestly and says that
it is unfair to sacrifice their lives and

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.170
feelings for the board's mission.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:55.350
Kai, a fellow crew member, is in charge of
the control room to monitor the ship's outer

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.580
layer and other activities.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.970
Zac enters and also observes the operation
from the screen.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.900
Instead of Zac, Christopher is the one who
goes with Richard outside the ship to carry

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.930
out the maintenance because of the incident
with Sela.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.090
After knowing that Christopher is the one
accompanying Richard, Zac gets annoyed.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.870
Christopher is amazed to see the stars in
the galaxy and admires its beauty.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.080
They continue to do repairs while the rest
of the crew observe from the inside.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.450
They notice an eerie and unfamiliar sound
but see nothing; eventually, the power inside

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.080
the ship blacks out.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.660
Not long after that, Richard falls unconscious
for an unknown reason after a black and shadow-like

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.470
force passes by him.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.250
He is unable to move, and the rope tied to
the ship prevents him from floating away.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.930
Christopher comes to rescue him.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.280
In the ship, they switch to emergency power
while putting off the fire that the blackout

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.320
causes.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.490
Richard's face and upper body are covered
with burn wounds.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.260
They try to revive him, but he is unresponsive.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.250
Finally, the medical team announces his time
of death.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.200
Everyone grieves and are taken by shock because
of his sudden passing.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.120
They have a meeting to discuss what could
have killed him; only Edward responds by saying

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.580
that a black force was the reason.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.610
Some of them think that an extraterrestrial
life form caused Richard's death.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.420
After the incident, the surveillance records
were destroyed, leaving them clueless about

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.680
what happened.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.960
They receive a message from the program that
they should choose a new chief officer.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.160
Zac volunteers to take over the position,
but the other crew members suggest appointing

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.750
Sela, but she declines.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.760
Eventually, they decide to have an election.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.530
After casting votes to nominate a leader,
Christopher wins as the new chief officer.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.150
Zac looks underwhelmed and obviously jealous.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.280
But still, he congratulates his best friend.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.720
Christopher orders the crew to repair the
damage caused by the fire for everything to

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.620
be slightly back to normal.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.430
The crew members willingly abide as he supervises
their progress.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.240
Sela looks at Richard's belongings for the
last time before getting rid of them, as instructed

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.270
by the manuals.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:54.250
She also shows Christopher pictures of the
late Richard from his childhood.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.610
They continue to watch his past videos and
remember moments with him.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.270
Instead of working on the ship's damage that
night, Zac explains that the refrigerators

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.830
caught a short circuit.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.940
He then suggests that they have a party to
celebrate having a new chief officer.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.730
All of them gather in the dining area to have
a feast.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.080
After, the crew members head to the drinking
station to have a dose of the blue drink.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.590
Kai, one of Zac's close friends, stops the
group and informs them that they should not

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:23.500
drink it, according to Zac, as it is a medication
to control them.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.140
The members oblige and throw away the drink.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:31.120
While Christopher and Sela become closer,
Zac finds a love interest of his ownâ€”Julie.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.050
The previously orderly life on the ship increasingly
falls into

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:38.370
chaos as they continue exploring more human
feelings and emotions.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.000
Zac's jealousy grows as he realizes that Christopher
and Sela become closer.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.980
The eerie noises appear, and while they figure
out where it comes from, Kai and another crew

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.640
member, Peter, fight over Julie because of
jealousy.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.750
The fight ends right away after Peter ran
off, but he attacks Kai with a metal tool

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.519
in the dining room.

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:01.300
Christopher controls the situation but punches
Peter out of impulse.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.569
Everyone is shocked; Christopher walks out
after saying that everyone should calm down.

00:09:05.569 --> 00:09:09.290
He starts a meeting about the uncontrollable
situation lately.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.940
Christopher's authority fails, and finally,
Zac usurps power.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:17.069
He manages to persuade some members to choose
him as the leader and follow him.

00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:22.459
Most of the crew members believe that there
is an alien inside the ship that got in unknowingly.

00:09:22.459 --> 00:09:26.089
Christopher and some others investigate the
control room where surveillance records belong.,

00:09:26.089 --> 00:09:27.660
they found nothing.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.029
When Zac and Kai investigate, they are apparently
attacked by something and flee, with further

00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:34.050
archive data destroyed.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.720
When asked by the crew members what the alien
looks like, they claim that it was dark and

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.370
they couldn't see anything.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:43.500
But Sela believes that they staged the attack
so that they could destroy the records.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.330
They find footage from the monitoring centre
that shows how Zac killed Richard using an

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.269
electrical surge outside while manipulating
and distracting Kai.

00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:54.890
He just stirred up the fear of the alleged
alien for his purposes to secure the group's

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:55.920
allegiance.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.529
Meanwhile, Christopher and Sela's relationship
develops and gets to the next level as they

00:10:00.529 --> 00:10:02.569
become intimate with each other.

00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:05.850
That time, they sleep beside each other for
the first time.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:10.060
They hear a knock on their door; Zac and Kai
invite them over for a celebration, which

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.160
they accept.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.180
Again, Zac claims leadership and sets new
rules for everyone to follow.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:20.899
Christopher shows the footage of Zac's betrayal
to the crew members to prove his evil intentions.

00:10:20.899 --> 00:10:23.740
They instantly regret their decision to follow
him.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.910
Consumed with guilt and shame, Zac finds a
way out of the unwanted attention.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.779
He then reveals that his goal was to protect
the group since the alien possessed Richard

00:10:31.779 --> 00:10:34.699
and apparently had transferred over to another
member.

00:10:34.699 --> 00:10:38.779
They push each other to implicate that the
alien could possess anyone among them.

00:10:38.779 --> 00:10:41.920
This creates instant chaos because of miscommunication.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.910
Kai backs his claim and manages to direct
the group's hatred toward Peter, who has been

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.029
noticed in the past few days for his aggressiveness.

00:10:49.029 --> 00:10:51.560
Zac persuades his followers to chase Peter.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.509
They oblige as Peter finds his way to safety,
but the members get to him.

00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:59.990
They take turns throwing hits on Peter, eventually
beating him to death.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.690
Everyone comes to their sense and regret the
fact that they were mean to Peter.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.449
Zac instructs his followers to grab any object
that resembles a weapon so they are ready

00:11:07.449 --> 00:11:09.029
for a fight.

00:11:09.029 --> 00:11:12.220
Christopher and his group discussion on how
to deal with the situation.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.279
Sela reminds Christopher about the secret
compartment.

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:18.389
He tries to open it to source weapons, but
access is denied.

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:23.589
Two of Zac's members hear Christopher from
the inside, so they inform their leader.

00:11:23.589 --> 00:11:27.620
Christopher manages to get useful objects
for defence from the lab, but the group realizes

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.149
that he tried to access the secret room.

00:11:30.149 --> 00:11:33.889
With enough manpower, Zac's group manages
to access the weapons.

00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:37.040
They take what they need to start a form of
defiance in the ship.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.790
Two of Christopher's group members, Alex and
Anda, join forces with Zac as they lose faith

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.850
in Christopher's leadership.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.250
Zac welcomes them.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.730
Now armed and in total control, Zac's group
shuts power.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.420
They track Christopher, Sela, and Phoebe and
take them hostage.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.940
A brawl begins, but the three of them are
outnumbered.Sela attempts to get in Zac's

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.329
head by saying that she loves him, but it
is ineffective.

00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:04.290
Phoebe tries to persuade them to get their
acts straight to carry out their mission successfully

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.770
but gets shot by Kai in the process.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.430
Although Kai did it, Zac claims that he did
it to look powerful.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:14.050
Zac tries to shoot Christopher, but he and
Sela manage to run.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:18.519
They both hide in a small compartment where
they preserve plants in the ship to take refuge.

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:21.470
The members try to spot which section they
are in.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.449
Zac shoots the compartment, but they both
leave unharmed through another hallway.

00:12:25.449 --> 00:12:29.420
Kai attacks them while they hide, but they
fight and kill him inside the lab by injecting

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.180
something on his neck and hitting him on the
head.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.279
Zac chases them, so they decide to hide in
the airlock, put on spacesuits for safety,

00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:38.220
and open the outer bulkhead.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.740
Zac shoots the inner door, making him vulnerable
to the pressure.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.279
He is sucked by the pressure but holds onto
Sela to save himself.

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:48.459
He stabs her with a knife, but Christopher
rescues her.

00:12:48.459 --> 00:12:52.019
They both fight by the door, but Zac pushes
Christopher out.

00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:56.519
Zac's body starts to change in colour because
of the lack of oxygen levels in space.

00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:58.959
Successfully, Sela kicks him out.

00:12:58.959 --> 00:13:03.040
She cannot decide whether to close the door
or not; luckily, Christopher survives and

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.920
safely gets back to the ship.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:10.070
After Zac's death, Sela and Christopher gather
the group together to put their weapons down.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:12.639
Sela is appointed as the new chief officer.

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:16.800
From now on, the crew members want to renounce
the inhibiting drug and agree on voting for

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.709
decisions together.

00:13:18.709 --> 00:13:21.470
Everything comes back in order as Sela takes
the lead.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.970
All of them age and start to reproduce.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.009
More children run around and take over the
ship as days go by.

00:13:27.009 --> 00:13:41.439
86 years after their descent, the ship finally
reaches the target planet.
