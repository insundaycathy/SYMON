00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.160
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm&nbsp;
going to explain a horror, sci-fi,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.400
thriller film called "Land of the Dead."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.880
A long time ago, a catastrophe wiped&nbsp;
out much of human civilization.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.480
For some reason, the recently deceased had come&nbsp;
back to life and taken the lives of the living.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.800
After a few years, zombies are everywhere in&nbsp;
a small town, and they seem to remember their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.280
lives before they die. Some zombies attempt&nbsp;
to play instruments in a town square. As if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.360
they're on a date, a teenage boy zombie holds&nbsp;
hands with a female teen zombie, passing by a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.040
gas station where the zombie attendant hears&nbsp;
a bell indicating that someone is present.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.120
Upon hearing a bell, Big Daddy,&nbsp;
presumed to be a gas boy before,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.720
steps out and prepares to fill a car with&nbsp;
gas, but he realizes that there's no car.&nbsp;

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.680
At the same time, Riley and his new rookie&nbsp;
are watching Big Daddy through binoculars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.360
from a distance. Riley notices that the&nbsp;
zombies are becoming more intelligent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.960
as he sees Big Daddy signaling others.&nbsp;
Riley is part of a group that travels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.320
to small towns to collect supplies for&nbsp;
people in the last known human city.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.040
They head back to their headquarters in&nbsp;
preparation for retrieving supplies.&nbsp;

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.520
At the post, Riley and the rookie run into Cholo,&nbsp;
who also shares Riley's job. Riley warns Cholo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.760
that the zombies are thinking and that they should&nbsp;
be cautious when entering the town. However, Cholo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.000
dismisses Riley's warning and mocks them before&nbsp;
leaving. Riley's last night out is approaching,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and he doesn't want anyone to die. Cholo also&nbsp;
reveals that this is his last night out.&nbsp;

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.640
The night out begins. Simultaneously,&nbsp;
the motley crew of humans piles into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.520
their jeeps and motorcycles and&nbsp;
heads into their designations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.520
While Pretty Boy, the female operator,&nbsp;
lets off some fireworks over the city,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.360
causing all zombies to look up at the sky.&nbsp;
As their eyes are fixed on the lights,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.400
the crews can move and shoot freely throughout&nbsp;
the town without zombies noticing them.&nbsp;

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.560
However, Big Daddy is the only zombie&nbsp;
who doesn't look at the fireworks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.360
Big daddy observes the guns and tries to persuade&nbsp;
his undead companions to flee, but they refuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.120
He grabs one zombie, trying to save him,&nbsp;
but a machine gun blows its head off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.440
Still holding the zombie's head, he notices that&nbsp;
it's still looking at the fireworks. To put it out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.320
of its misery, he drops the face and stomps on it,&nbsp;
crushing its brains. Big Daddy screams with rage.&nbsp;

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.160
Meanwhile, Riley supervises&nbsp;
everyone over communications.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.480
While Riley and his mentally challenged friend&nbsp;
Charlie are heading to get medical supplies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.600
a zombie tries to attack them. Fortunately,&nbsp;
Riley notices and shoots it down. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.920
the fireworks are gone. The zombies are back&nbsp;
to their senses and become aware of the humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.080
Riley commands everyone to return to their&nbsp;
station. However, Cholo tells Riley that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.120
has to make one more stop at a store&nbsp;
where Cholo plans to steal alcohol.&nbsp;

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.440
Afterward, Pretty Boy summons the courage&nbsp;
to take their bus, the Dead Reckoning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.200
into the town to distract the zombies enough&nbsp;
for everyone to return to the station. Dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.600
Reckoning is essentially a bus, train, and tank&nbsp;
all rolled in one and is armed with metal gears,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.320
machine guns, rockets, and explosives. The truck&nbsp;
successfully terminates most of the zombies.&nbsp;

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.200
On the other hand, Cholo and his friends arrive&nbsp;
at the alcohol store. They carefully enter the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.920
shop and secure the place. Once clear, Cholo looks&nbsp;
for high-quality alcohol, which leads him into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.880
champagne section. Upon opening the refrigerator,&nbsp;
a zombie falls on him and tries to bite him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.320
Cholo pulls his spear gun from his leg&nbsp;
and blasts the zombie's brains out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.680
He takes the champagne and heads into&nbsp;
the counter to get a box of cigarettes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.840
Some cigarettes fall off the counter. While the&nbsp;
rookie reaches for cigarettes, a security guard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.760
zombie bites a chunk out of the rookie's hand.&nbsp;
The rookie screams in agony and staggers out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.720
the door. Riley and Charlie arrive at the store&nbsp;
to check what's going on. Riley immediately runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.800
toward the bitten rookie, but Cholo tells him to&nbsp;
step back because he intends to shoot the rookie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.800
While Cholo and Riley argue, the rookie snatches&nbsp;
Riley's pistol and blows his own brains out.&nbsp;

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.360
Later that night, the crew is heading back&nbsp;
to the station. Unbothered by the zombies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.360
they playfully cross the horde of zombies while&nbsp;
teasing them. Big Daddy tries to grab one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.600
bikers before they leave, but he accidentally&nbsp;
grabs his machine gun instead. He doesn't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.120
what to do with it, so he slings it over his&nbsp;
shoulder and begins walking towards the station.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.760
The following day, Cholo and his friends happen&nbsp;
to see the T.V. commercial for Fiddler's Green,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.360
an upper-class community on a hill overlooking&nbsp;
the city that has its own mall, bank,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.920
and restaurants with waiters dressed in tuxedos.&nbsp;
Riley and Charlie come, still upset about what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.240
happened the night before. Riley confronts Cholo,&nbsp;
telling him to give the rookie some respect,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.480
seeing that he still celebrates with his friends,&nbsp;
drinking the alcohol they stolen. He also reminds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.160
Cholo of his responsibilities, but Cholo tells&nbsp;
him he aspires to be in Fiddler's Green.&nbsp;

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.880
Later that day, Riley and Charlie head into the&nbsp;
city, where there is strict security surrounding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.800
Fiddler's Green. The wealthy reside there, while&nbsp;
the rest of the population are on the streets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.520
below. The exclusive community is protected&nbsp;
by electrified fences and soldiers on patrol.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.600
A stray zombie tries to climb the wall and is&nbsp;
immediately electrocuted and shot to pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.080
It is also surrounded by water, and the only way&nbsp;
to get into the city is through a bridge. Riley&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.640
visits an old man who he used to work with in the&nbsp;
slums below Fiddler's Green. He hands antibiotics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.880
to the old man's son as the boy looks sick and&nbsp;
cold. He then leaves and heads into a car shop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.560
where he expects to get a car that he would use to&nbsp;
drive away to a place with fewer people living in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.280
peace. He’s surprised to see his car is gone. He&nbsp;
rushes out to find the man who worked on the car.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.160
At the same time, Cholo also heads into Fiddler's&nbsp;
Green, confident that the owner and manager,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.960
Mr. Kaufman, will let him in. He is able to pass&nbsp;
through security and walks through Fiddler's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.960
Green's lavish mall, eventually arriving on&nbsp;
the top floor at Mr. Kaufman's office. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.960
casually greets him as he pours some champagne&nbsp;
into glasses and gives one to Mr. Kaufman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.480
Cholo tells him that he will retire with all the&nbsp;
money that Mr. Kaufman owes him for doing filthy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.280
business for him. Kaufman, however, informs him&nbsp;
that the space is limited in Fiddler's Green,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.680
and only certain people are allowed to stay there.&nbsp;
Cholo is upset as Mr. Kaufman belittles him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.240
threatening to expose his crime. Kaufman calms him&nbsp;
down as he secretly calls the security officer to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.120
send Cholo away. As Cholo and the officer leave&nbsp;
the office, the officer tries to shoot Cholo, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.440
Cholo outsmarts him and knocks the officer down&nbsp;
instead. He immediately leaves Fiddler's Green.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.480
Later that day, Riley and Charlie arrive in an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.680
underground compound filled with music&nbsp;
and gambling in search of the man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.520
They come across several booths where people&nbsp;
can interact with zombies, such as a photobooth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.800
paintball and there's even an arena where&nbsp;
two zombies fight, and people bet on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.400
Finally, Riley spots the man he’s looking for:&nbsp;
Chihuahua, a midget man who promised him a car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.840
He grabs him and confronts him about his&nbsp;
car, but Chihuahua says he'll find it soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.400
Riley puts him down, and the midget runs away&nbsp;
and signals his guards to keep an eye on Riley.&nbsp;

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.280
Meanwhile, the betting begins. To make the&nbsp;
zombies fight, they throw in a woman named Slack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.880
As she desperately tries to keep the zombies&nbsp;
off, the crowd cheers. Riley notices what's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.880
on and shoots the two zombies to save the poor&nbsp;
girl, causing the crowd to panic and rush out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.480
Aiming for Charlie, the midget mistakenly&nbsp;
gun-down an innocent man while Riley takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.960
his chance to kill him. The bullet goes straight&nbsp;
into him, but he is wearing a bullet-proof suit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.800
Chihuahua angrily gets up as Riley ruined his&nbsp;
purple suit, so when he sees an opportunity to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.120
shoot him, he fires his gun. Fortunately, Slack&nbsp;
spots the midget and saves Riley by kicking him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.200
to the ground, but the bullet grazes her arm.&nbsp;
Charlie watches the midget trying to escape and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.360
calmly aims his gun before firing a shot, hitting&nbsp;
Chihuahua dead on the head. The police arrive and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.360
demand to know what is going on. With the three&nbsp;
of them left alone, the police arrest them.&nbsp;

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.480
On the other hand, the zombies encounter a wooden&nbsp;
gate. Big Daddy sees the butcher zombie's meat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.080
cleaver and tells him to hit the gate. The&nbsp;
butcher zombie repeatedly hits it until Big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.640
Daddy can see through. A zombie appears in front&nbsp;
of the hole and notices they are upside down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.160
More zombies hang upside down with&nbsp;
target signs wrapped around their bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.640
Big Daddy screams in rage as&nbsp;
he sees the zombies struggling.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.840
Riley, Charlie, and Slack have been arrested and&nbsp;
detained. Charlie questions Slack as to why she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.080
was placed in the cage with the zombies. She tells&nbsp;
him that she wanted to be a soldier, but someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.080
thought she could have been a better call girl,&nbsp;
so she ended up on the streets. Riley informs her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.080
that she failed to respond to Charlie's question.&nbsp;
Slack then tells them that Kaufman is in charge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.400
of everything at Fiddler's Green, from betting to&nbsp;
streetwalking. She attempted to assist some people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.960
who Kaufman did not regard favorably, and as a&nbsp;
result, she was sentenced to the cage fight. Slack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.880
inquires about Riley's story, and he responds&nbsp;
that nothing terrible has happened to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.560
She claims that the zombies affected&nbsp;
everyone, which is awful. Riley isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.480
the type to engage in conversation, so Slack&nbsp;
takes a stimulant from her boot and smokes it.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.640
Afterward, Cholo and his friends decide to&nbsp;
steal the Dead Reckoning and hold Fiddler's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.360
Green for ransom. Cholo tries to pass off an old&nbsp;
permit to the soldier, but he doesn't buy it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.440
When Cholo is about to grab his gun,&nbsp;
he hears gunfire. Cholo takes his gun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.360
wondering what it is, but the soldier says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.240
there's nothing to worry about since the&nbsp;
gun fired comes from the target practice.&nbsp;

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.640
At the same time, two soldiers are playing around&nbsp;
as they randomly shoot the giant inflatable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.400
person. The shooter says that he would shoot&nbsp;
better if the other soldier would stop bothering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.240
him, which confuses the other soldier since&nbsp;
he's doing nothing. He then turns the light&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.240
behind them and searches the grounds. There's&nbsp;
no one there, but suddenly Big Daddy appears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.840
and screams at them. Cholo hears the scream&nbsp;
and asks if they're practicing yelling too.&nbsp;

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.720
Big Daddy suddenly appears with the slew of&nbsp;
zombies and knocks over a non-electrical gate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.560
Soldiers are blasting the zombies, but there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.680
too many of them. They destroy the&nbsp;
fence and tear the soldiers apart.&nbsp;

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.800
Cholo and his companions successfully take the&nbsp;
Dead Reckoning. When Big Daddy sees the vehicle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.800
he recalls what it did to the other zombies&nbsp;
and grips his machine gun tightly in his hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.800
It starts firing at the ground. He then&nbsp;
raises it and fires at Dead Reckoning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.640
He hits it, but some of his shots go&nbsp;
astray, causing a propane tank to explode,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.665
accidentally setting a zombie on fire. Seeing&nbsp;
the zombie suffering, Big Daddy kills it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.665 --> 00:08:43.120
putting it out of its misery. Big Daddy&nbsp;
then notices Fiddler's Green Tower across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.760
the lake and joins the other zombies&nbsp;
in making their way towards the lake.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.800
Once safe, Cholo reaches out to Kaufman, who&nbsp;
is surprised to see that Cholo is still alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.840
Cholo offers Kaufman a deal to give&nbsp;
him and his crew five million dollars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.920
or he will use Dead Reckoning to blow up Fiddler's&nbsp;
Green. Cholo wants the funds to be delivered to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.720
the port by midnight. Feeling distressed, Kaufman&nbsp;
orders the police to bring Riley into his office.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.200
When Riley arrives, Kaufman informs him&nbsp;
about Cholo, and orders Riley to kill Cholo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.720
In return, he gets to have his vehicle back&nbsp;
and enough weapons to last him a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.280
Riley accepts the deal and demands the assistance&nbsp;
of his friends in completing this mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.124
Kaufman seems fine with it. When Riley goes&nbsp;
back, the police immediately release them.&nbsp;

00:09:19.124 --> 00:09:20.400
Riley, Slack, and Charlie are released from&nbsp;
prison and receive weapons from the army. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.960
soldier offers Charlie a machine gun, but Charlie&nbsp;
prefers his rifle. Slack gladly accepts the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.760
machine gun instead. Kaufman is wary of Riley and&nbsp;
his friends, so he sends three soldiers with them;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:35.840
a tough guy, Manolete, a wisecracking female&nbsp;
soldier, Motown, and a hulking soldier, Pillsbury.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.360
They later proceed to the army post&nbsp;
in the hopes of obtaining the vehicle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.200
but they find it engulfed in flames and&nbsp;
in ruins. They split into two groups,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.200
where Riley and Manolete go off on their own&nbsp;
to look for keys for a jeep. While Charlie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.080
and the rest of the group gather around a jeep.&nbsp;
Riley and Manolete explore a dark supply bunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.760
They hear a dripping sound, and when they look&nbsp;
around, they find a couple of zombies munching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.160
bodies. They search further. Manolete is&nbsp;
ready to fire his machine gun at them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.000
but Riley advises him to use their&nbsp;
handguns, blasting some zombies away.&nbsp;

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.480
The other team decides to dispatch a jeep outside.&nbsp;
Charlie suddenly licks his rifle as he is aiming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.360
at something nearby. He takes aim at Slack with&nbsp;
the rifle. She panics and draws her machine gun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.200
but Charlie is actually aiming at a zombie&nbsp;
behind her. They continue to work around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.280
jeep when suddenly, Slack pulls the trigger on her&nbsp;
machine gun and aims it in Charlie's direction,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.440
but she repays the favor&nbsp;
by killing a zombie behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.240
him. However, the shot was so close to Charlie&nbsp;
that it caused his ear to slightly bleed.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.800
At the jeep, Riley and Manolete meet up with the&nbsp;
rest of the team. Once everyone is in the jeep,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.120
a decapitated zombie approaches Manolete and&nbsp;
startles him. However, the zombie's head is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.766
not totally decapitated, but it hangs behind&nbsp;
his back. The zombie screams and snaps. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.766 --> 00:10:38.240
thrusts his head forward and bites Manolete’s arm.&nbsp;
Pillsbury dispatches the zombie, and they flee.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.920
On their way, Riley discloses that&nbsp;
a homing device he placed in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.440
center of Dead Reckoning allows him to&nbsp;
track it, so he knows where Cholo is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.120
Slack asks Riley about how long Manolete&nbsp;
has before he turns into a zombie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.240
prompting him to share his story about his&nbsp;
brother who turned in less than an hour, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.720
Riley had no choice but to kill him. Slack gazes&nbsp;
at him and then turns around to kill Manolete.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.920
A little while later, Riley tells Slack, who&nbsp;
is driving the jeep, to pull over right away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.560
She does, and Charlie is now holding Pillsbury and&nbsp;
Motown hostage with a gun. Riley understands that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.000
Kaufman will most likely break their agreement&nbsp;
and has probably paid the three soldiers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.080
assassinate him and his companions once they&nbsp;
locate Dead Reckoning. Riley threatens the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.080
frightened soldiers, who immediately surrender.&nbsp;
They keep driving to find Dead Reckoning.&nbsp;

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.080
In the meantime, Mouse informs Cholo&nbsp;
that the money has not arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.240
He then shoots down a zombie who attempted to&nbsp;
enter the boathouse. When he examines the body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.480
he is attacked by some&nbsp;
zombies, and they devour him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.760
Big Daddy and the zombies are at the lake, staring&nbsp;
at the water. Big Daddy leads by jumping into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.400
water, and the zombies follow him. They manage&nbsp;
to cross the lake by walking underwater. Big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.480
Daddy slowly rises from the water as more and more&nbsp;
zombies appear, preparing to attack the humans.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.600
Once they arrive in the city, zombies attack&nbsp;
two women who are making out. A soldier tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.960
throwing a grenade, but the Butcher zombie&nbsp;
cuts off the soldier's hand , causing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.324
soldiers to fall over the grenade. It then&nbsp;
detonates, severing the soldier in half.&nbsp;

00:11:52.324 --> 00:11:52.418
On the other hand, the athlete zombie snags a&nbsp;
rifle from a terrified soldier. She has no idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.418 --> 00:11:52.516
what to do with it, which allows the soldier to&nbsp;
reach for his backup weapon. Big Daddy comes over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.516 --> 00:11:52.600
and demonstrates how to pull the trigger.&nbsp;
He switches the machine gun's target from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:52.692
the ground to the soldier's crotch, then his&nbsp;
belly, and finally his upper body. The athlete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.692 --> 00:11:52.779
zombie reluctantly abandons her softball bat&nbsp;
in favor of the rifle, which she fires at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:52.867
more humans until she runs out of ammo. The&nbsp;
instrumental zombie reluctantly submits his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.867 --> 00:11:52.960
tambourine in exchange for a crowbar, which he&nbsp;
intends to use as a weapon against the humans.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.120
At the same time, Riley and his companions&nbsp;
finally locate the Dead Reckoning. Pillsbury&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.840
knocks Motown out, earning Riley's trust. While&nbsp;
Pillsbury and Slack hide in the nearby bushes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.160
Riley and Charlie head to Dead Reckoning alone.&nbsp;
Riley and Charlie eventually talk their way into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.640
the vehicle, but Cholo and his men hold them at&nbsp;
gunpoint. Cholo draws his spear gun and places&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.240
it beneath Riley's chin as Pretty Boy prepares&nbsp;
to launch a rocket attack on Fiddler's Green.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.400
Riley is protesting because the destruction will&nbsp;
kill many innocent people in the slums below.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.520
Slack recognizes that they are&nbsp;
in danger and prepares to fire.&nbsp;

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.280
Meanwhile, Motown regains his&nbsp;
consciousness, grabs a gun, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.720
sprints over the car. A zombie attacks her, biting&nbsp;
and ripping a chunk out of her neck. Still, she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.920
manages to locate Cholo, and&nbsp;
prepares to shoot him. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.280
Riley sees her from a distance, kicking&nbsp;
Cholo out of the Dead Reckoning to save him.&nbsp;

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.400
Finally, Riley gives Cholo and Foxy&nbsp;
some guns and allows them to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.320
Pretty Boy turns Dead Reckoning towards the city&nbsp;
to save the people, and Riley takes over Cholo's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.960
crew. When Cholo and Foxy begin to walk away,&nbsp;
they come across a zombie biting Cholo's arm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.840
Cholo refuses to be shut down,&nbsp;
as he plans to do something else.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.200
He returns to the city's outskirts&nbsp;
to take revenge against Kaufman.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.600
On the other hand, Kaufman notices and hears&nbsp;
explosions in the streets below and believes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.920
Dead Reckoning has opened fire on the city.&nbsp;
However, Riley informs him that it isn't Cholo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.520
but the zombies. Kaufman then grabs a&nbsp;
couple of bags with cash and prepares to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.400
leave. There were no zombies in sight, so Kaufman&nbsp;
and his servant made their way down to the mall.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.920
The zombies and Big Daddy have arrived&nbsp;
at the mall's entrance. Trying to avoid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.520
certain death, the shoppers trample&nbsp;
each other. Big daddy finds Kaufman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.960
who shoots him but misses his head and&nbsp;
hits him in the leg and shoulder instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.840
Big Daddy yells as he pursues&nbsp;
Kaufman, who heads to the parking lot.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.400
As Kaufman's servant opens the garage door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.240
Big Daddy sneaks up on the car while he's gone&nbsp;
and begins smashing it with his bare hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.320
When the servant notices the zombie, he runs&nbsp;
away with the keys to the vehicle. When Big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.640
Daddy sees a gas nozzle nearby, he begins pouring&nbsp;
gasoline all over the car before walking away.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.840
Kaufman leaves his vehicle and searches the area&nbsp;
for Big Daddy. He takes a spare set of car keys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.560
from his bag and prepares to drive away alone.&nbsp;
Cholo, on the other hand, emerges from the shadows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.760
with his spear gun. He misses Kaufman and is shot&nbsp;
in the chest instead, but he doesn't fall. Kaufman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.000
fires more bullets into his leg until Cholo&nbsp;
gradually drops to the ground. Cholo gets back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.200
up and attacks Kaufman. Cholo is now a zombie, and&nbsp;
Kaufman is out of bullets. Before Cholo can tear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.920
out his throat, Big Daddy returns with a propane&nbsp;
tank on fire. He tosses it into the car, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.720
explodes, killing Cholo and Kaufman, with his&nbsp;
money all over the place. Big Daddy seems content.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.120
When Dead Reckoning finally arrives in the&nbsp;
city, they discover only zombies feasting on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.080
humans. There appear to be no survivors in the&nbsp;
town. Riley instructs Charlie and Pretty Boy to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:25.200
launch rockets at the zombies. Riley notices that&nbsp;
no one is moving when the smoke clears. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.720
people gradually emerge and approach them&nbsp;
and it turns out some people survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.040
They intend to rebuild the city&nbsp;
progressively but steadily.&nbsp;

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.840
Riley is still planning to travel to the North.&nbsp;
His friends want to join him and intend to follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.960
Riley. Through binoculars, Riley sees Big Daddy,&nbsp;
who is leading his zombies out of the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.640
However, he decides not to kill him because&nbsp;
the zombies, like Riley and his friends,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.720
are only looking for a place to call home.&nbsp;
In Dead Reckoning, Riley and his crew head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.280
to North and light fireworks in the&nbsp;
sky as they won't need them anymore.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.680
This story highlights the distinction between&nbsp;
three social classes fenced off from each other in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.240
an explosive apocalyptic environment. First is the&nbsp;
exploitative elite class, as represented by those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:05.120
that live in Fiddler's Green. Then, the oppressed&nbsp;
class, those that live in the slums. And finally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.200
the disorganized class, composing zombies, who&nbsp;
begin to assert their own authority in the world.
