00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.640
hello everybody welcome to my channel today i will&nbsp;
explain the recently released horror comedy film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.520
named werewolves within a vr game also came in the&nbsp;
year 2018 with the same name where people put on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.400
headset read the script of beaverfield's character&nbsp;
lie to each other one among them is a werewolf&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.480
the rest have to identify that person at the&nbsp;
beginning of the movie we see a man named dave who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.240
was standing outside his lodge then there is some&nbsp;
movement in the bushes and some things attack him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.440
29 days later we see a forest officer named finn&nbsp;
wheeler who comes to beaver field to take charge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.000
this was his punishment posting finn arrives and&nbsp;
stays at the only lodge in town now owned by gene&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.520
there he met the town's new male person cecily&nbsp;
before cecily dave was the mailman cecily was also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.680
living in the same lodge for a month this town&nbsp;
was very small where only a few people lived an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.240
oil pipeline project was going through this town&nbsp;
which was supported by many people in the town&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.760
many people were opposing it a man named sam&nbsp;
parker had come here to persuade those who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.240
were opposing it he also stayed in the same&nbsp;
lodge an environmentalist dr jane ellis also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.600
stayed at the lodge who had come to study the&nbsp;
environmental impact of the pipeline project next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.200
day cecily takes finn on a town tour where she&nbsp;
also talks about the fake rumor of jean's husband&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.200
the people of the town thought that he had run&nbsp;
away with some lady first we see devon and jacquim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.520
who were a lovely gay couple later marcus and&nbsp;
gwen then we see a couple named tricia and peter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.840
trisha had a dog chatchie which she loved more&nbsp;
than peter flirts with cecily here as he was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.800
pervert sam built a fire totem in the middle&nbsp;
of town as a midway symbol of his project&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.680
later we see finn going to a cottage outside the&nbsp;
town there lived a hunter named flint who used&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.800
to hunt illegally he didn't care about the rules&nbsp;
of the forest office or the people of this town&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.560
he threatens finn later that night we see&nbsp;
cecily and finn spending some quality night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.040
at a local bar the same night some&nbsp;
unknown thing attacked trish's dog&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.760
her dog was dead next day she goes to the lodge&nbsp;
and starts a ruckus in front of everyone all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.320
people of the town had come there as the power&nbsp;
of the town had gone out the highway was also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.600
closed due to snowfall last night the mechanics&nbsp;
from the power company were no longer available&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.280
finn goes to check the backup generators where&nbsp;
he finds someone's claw marks someone destroyed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.240
the backup generators finn here found a dead&nbsp;
body there which later turned out to be of dave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.520
jean starts crying after seeing her husband's&nbsp;
dead body as she had faith in him from day one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.040
she knew he was loyal dr ellis checks dave's body&nbsp;
she finds some animal hairs there everyone thinks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.320
it's an animal attack on hearing the name of&nbsp;
the man-eating animal finn suggests the idea of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.600
taking help from flint as he was an expert hunter&nbsp;
which does not go down well with the town's people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.800
flint was never social he lived isolated the&nbsp;
town's people were always skeptical about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.240
him they thought him as a psycho anyway&nbsp;
finn and cecily still go to flint's house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.160
flint flatly refuses to help saying that&nbsp;
he does not care he is happy that he's here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.040
flynn tries to give him a long lecture&nbsp;
on neighborhood duty community duty etc&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.680
citing mr rogers neighborhood tv&nbsp;
show as an example but nothing works&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.840
flint laughs it off while these two were talking&nbsp;
cecily found tricia's dog chatchi's collar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.960
it was lying there in plain sight naturally this&nbsp;
spooked cecily and finn they run from flint's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.800
house like usain bolt at the lodge dr ellis&nbsp;
shares her preliminary dna results with gene&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.520
she tested both the hair samples collected&nbsp;
from the dog's body and dave's body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.840
both were a match she says dna is similar&nbsp;
to a dog or a wolf but not a perfect match&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.560
this is definitely an animal attack something has&nbsp;
eaten them alive since there was no power in town&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.120
and a man eating animal was roaming everyone made&nbsp;
the decision to stay in this lodge for the night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.760
finn makes sure that there is at least one gun in&nbsp;
each room most already had their gun with them at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.520
late night something attacks trish's husband peter&nbsp;
it drags him from his bed and eats his hand alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.360
peter shouts in pain we see gwen firing in&nbsp;
the dark at something where one bullet hits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.680
peter too when all searched the place with&nbsp;
their torch light there was no one other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.440
than peter the attacker simply vanished in&nbsp;
thin air peter's hand was also covered in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:42.000
similar hairs which we saw on dave's body dr&nbsp;
ellis checks these hairs as well sam gives her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.760
a bottle of drink as she was in a visible panic&nbsp;
mode dr ellis was against sam's pipeline project&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.480
the town people were frightened they were not&nbsp;
sure how the attack could happen under the lodge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.360
finn calms everyone down and tells them&nbsp;
to wait for the final result from dr ellis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.360
dr ellis was analyzing this new sample by&nbsp;
locking herself at her room the results were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.160
again similar and inconclusive the werewolf's&nbsp;
legend was famous in this town for centuries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.720
this was an urban legend in which humans&nbsp;
turned into a werewolf on a full moon and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.600
yesterday was the full moon this large image&nbsp;
gallery was filled with werewolves paintings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.400
dr ellis now seems to believe in this legend&nbsp;
of the werewolf as she takes her gun out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.320
in panic she starts drinking heavily when finn&nbsp;
and others come to meet her she shoots at them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.240
tells them it is a werewolf anyone of you can&nbsp;
be a werewolf she was so wasted and horrified&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.600
that she was not making rational decisions sam&nbsp;
takes an alternative key from jean and enters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.840
dr ellis's room from behind apparently it had&nbsp;
an emergency back door as this was a vip suite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:53.840
then we hear three gunshots on sam's arrival dr&nbsp;
ellis commits suicide sam opens the room door as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.640
everyone was in clear shock now everyone was&nbsp;
convinced that one among them was a werewolf&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.960
they put a lamp at the center and start&nbsp;
accusing each other of being a werewolf&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.760
gwen puts forward a different urban legend&nbsp;
theory of her own here saying it could also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.040
be the work of indigo an ever-hungry beast which&nbsp;
roams around the woods in search of human flesh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.440
joaquin was from argentina he says that&nbsp;
in his country it is believed that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.840
seventh born child will become a werewolf&nbsp;
hence people used to kill their seventh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.320
child cecily thinks this is completely&nbsp;
nonsense as she was the seventh child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.320
that's when trisha angrily shouts at everyone&nbsp;
she says all the story of werewolf is rubbish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.360
one of you is a bully and murdered one of you&nbsp;
killed my dog one of you ate my husband's hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.360
one of you is doing this so that sam will stop&nbsp;
his pipeline project here gene counters her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:50.480
she accuses sam of killing dr ellis dr ellis was&nbsp;
against his pipeline project nobody knew whether&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.920
dr ellis really committed suicide or whether&nbsp;
just sam killed her since the room was locked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.320
sam here rubbishes these allegations like this&nbsp;
everyone accuses everyone of being a werewolf&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.120
all point guns at each other frustrated finn&nbsp;
shouts at everyone and calms them down he gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.560
a big lecture on community again which nobody&nbsp;
gives a damn everyone starts to leave this lodge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.120
only finn cecily and jean were left in the lodge&nbsp;
sam pulls out his hunting gear for self-defense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.520
trisha and peter were now at their home cecily&nbsp;
also had some doubts about sam so she asked finn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.800
to search his room finn and cecily search sam's&nbsp;
room where cecily finds a newspaper clipping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.960
in which the killings of grout pond and townsend&nbsp;
were mentioned apparently finn was earlier posted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.520
in the same city where these killings took&nbsp;
place finn also finds a knife from sam's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:49.520
drawer it was covered in a cloth from which the&nbsp;
diesel smell was coming diesel was used to run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.160
generators jacqueline and devon were on their&nbsp;
way home when they heard some noise in the dark&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:00.560
both run in panic and get separated later we&nbsp;
see trisha in front of devon whom she kills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.240
devin was opposing the pipeline project tricia&nbsp;
would have made a killing if it went through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.440
sam was wearing his hunting gear and was&nbsp;
searching for finn sam thought finn was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.640
a werewolf as killing were shadowing him next&nbsp;
we see jacqueline meeting finn and cecily who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:22.080
were hiding under the stairs of the lodge jacquin&nbsp;
says he and devin got separated near trish's house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.320
he asks for finn's help these three now arrived&nbsp;
at trisha's house where marcus was already there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.400
he was stealing kitchen knives to use them as&nbsp;
gloves marcus attacks finn as he was not sure who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.840
was a werewolf later he starts running away from&nbsp;
him as his wife gwenz then hits him and kills him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:46.800
he dies there at that precise moment tricia&nbsp;
arrives and kills gwen meaning everyone had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.160
gone crazy in fear tricia takes finn cecily&nbsp;
and jacqueline under the house at gunpoint&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.320
basically trisha was mad at her dog's death she&nbsp;
was taking revenge by killing all those who were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:04.160
against the pipeline project she informs&nbsp;
jacqueline about devon's death due to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.800
jacqueline angrily kills trisha with the iron&nbsp;
rod causing her head to fall into the fireplace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.440
later these three ran from trish's house&nbsp;
where sam was standing near the street corner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.200
here jacqueline grabs cecily's&nbsp;
neck and points a gun at her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:23.040
he says she is the real werewolf as she is the&nbsp;
seventh born child meaning everyone was losing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:29.520
their mind finn tries to negotiate with jacqueline&nbsp;
but he was in no mood to listen meanwhile sam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.160
shoots an arrow at finn from behind which brunches&nbsp;
his arm and enters straight into jacqueline's body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:40.320
jacquim falls down further sam grabs cecily&nbsp;
by the neck and starts blackmailing her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.400
he says that finn is the real werewolf is wherever&nbsp;
he was posted there were killings happening sam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.600
also searched finn's room and found a diesel&nbsp;
clothed knife to which vin says this is a lie as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.760
he got the knife from sam's room these two start&nbsp;
bickering at each other taking advantage of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:04.640
cecily attacks sam hits him at his knees and&nbsp;
runs away fintu attacks sam he starts beating him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.520
these two were fighting near sam's&nbsp;
fire totem while dying jaqen once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.560
again expresses his anger towards sam he fires&nbsp;
at the fire totem which causes a huge explosion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.800
sam was killed in the blast next cecily takes&nbsp;
finn to the town's only bar to treat him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.080
just then finn saw cecily's mail room where&nbsp;
several undelivered mailboxes were lined up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.960
he checks it there was an id of dave and other&nbsp;
documents finn finds that cecily was actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.240
a werewolf upon knowing that finn now knows&nbsp;
her secret cecily laughs at him innocently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.840
she says the people of this town were morons&nbsp;
she says the people of this town were morons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.640
they were fighting among themselves it was i&nbsp;
who placed the dog's collar at flint's house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:55.680
it was i who kept the knife in sam's room i killed&nbsp;
dave as i wanted his uniform of a male man there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:02.160
can be only one mailman in this town nobody doubts&nbsp;
a mailman i tried hunting in other cities but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:08.560
workload there was hectic i ate peter's hand as&nbsp;
he was a pervert cecily now transforms herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:15.040
into a werewolf she tries to attack finn but&nbsp;
the hunter flint attacks her from behind finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:20.800
a fight breaks down between these three later we&nbsp;
see gene who fires an arrow at cecily and kills it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:27.920
