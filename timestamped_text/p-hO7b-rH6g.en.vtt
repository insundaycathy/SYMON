the infection
 

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.510 align:start position:0%
the infection
and<00:07:43.680><c> thus</c><00:07:43.919><c> it</c><00:07:44.080><c> is</c><00:07:44.240><c> possible</c><00:07:44.639><c> that</c><00:07:44.800><c> ashen</c><00:07:45.280><c> sees</c>

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
there isn't really a way to bring them

the boy

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
so she can study him another possibility
 

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.990 align:start position:0%
so she can study him another possibility
is<00:07:56.479><c> that</c><00:07:56.639><c> she</c><00:07:56.960><c> actually</c><00:07:57.440><c> missed</c><00:07:57.680><c> with</c><00:07:57.840><c> the</c>
