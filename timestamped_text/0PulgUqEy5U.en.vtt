00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.640
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m&nbsp;
going to explain a Dutch family film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.880
called “Eep,” Spoilers ahead!&nbsp;
Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.160
The movie begins in a small town in&nbsp;
the Netherlands. A middle-aged man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.000
named Warre lives with his wife Tine on an&nbsp;
isolated farm, surrounded by open meadows.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.800
Warre likes to watch birds as a hobby. He&nbsp;
often goes out in the woods with his binoculars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.800
and a book about birds. One day, Warre is&nbsp;
birdwatching when he hears chirping noises nearby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.920
He goes to check for the noise and finds a tiny&nbsp;
creature lying on the ground. The creature fits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.160
in the palm of his hand. It has a body and face&nbsp;
like a human female but has wings for arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.080
Warre looks up at the sky to find&nbsp;
her mother but doesn’t see anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.320
Such a strange creature fascinates Warre,&nbsp;
so he brings her home to show his wife. 
&nbsp;

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.520
Tine is shocked to see the little girl with&nbsp;
wings. Warre claims that the bird girl might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.400
be an extremely rare species because he has&nbsp;
never read about such creatures before. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.800
makes Tine remove things from a basket on&nbsp;
the dining table and uses the basket as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.920
crib for the little girl. Tine suggests they&nbsp;
contact the police and hand the girl to them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.280
but Warre wants to wait for the girl’s parents&nbsp;
to arrive. Later, we see Tine lovingly singing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.720
a lullaby to her. Tine and Warre have no kids,&nbsp;
so they decide to take care of the little girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.600
as their own, in case no one comes to get her. 
Tine dips her finger into the water and feeds the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.800
little girl. At night, they look at the sleeping&nbsp;
child in fascination while deciding her name.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.120
Warre wants to name her birdie, but they settle on&nbsp;
the name Viegeltje. The very next day, Tine buys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.640
a Barbie doll that comes with a changeable dress&nbsp;
for Viegeltje and a tiny baby bottle to feed her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.000
Meanwhile, Warre makes Viegeltje a larger stroller&nbsp;
so they can take her outside like a normal child.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.480
But when they put her on the stroller with&nbsp;
a blanket, her wings are still visible. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.640
Tine cuts Warre’s sock and sews it into a tiny&nbsp;
poncho to hide Viegeltje’s wings. The poncho&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.760
works, and the two take their new daughter for&nbsp;
a stroll in the town. While walking, Viegeltje&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.320
makes noises which Tine thinks is her trying to&nbsp;
talk. But Warre believes that she is more bird&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.600
than a human, so she might just be chirping.
Some women from the town are delighted to see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.040
new child. Warre tells them that they have just&nbsp;
adopted Viegeltje. When asked why she is so tiny,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.200
the two end the conversation and leave. A lot of&nbsp;
time has passed, and Viegeltje has gotten bigger.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.440
She now barely fits in the dining table&nbsp;
basket. She has still not learnt to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.040
and only makes noises like a bird. One&nbsp;
day, Tine notices Viegeltje trying to fly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.640
As time goes by, she starts acting more like a&nbsp;
bird than a human. Tine is distressed at the fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.360
because she wants her daughter to be more human.&nbsp;
Despite the fact that she is different, Tine tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.640
to teach her to speak and eat with her feet. The&nbsp;
two have made a tiny crib for Viegeltje right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.200
beside their bed. But she jumps into their bed and&nbsp;
sleeps in between the couple when she is scared.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.720
One day, Tine hears Viegeltje saying the word&nbsp;
“Nini”. She thinks that the girl is calling her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.400
mama. From that day onwards, she teaches her the&nbsp;
alphabet, but Viegeltje doesn’t seem to get it.
&nbsp;

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.240
She also notices Viegeltje eating bugs from the&nbsp;
floor. Thinking that it is normal for birds to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.520
eat bugs, she serves Viegeltje worms on a&nbsp;
plate and makes her use her feet to eat it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.640
When Viegeltje cannot do it, Tine is frustrated.&nbsp;
She believes that Viegeltje can only learn manners&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.040
by copying other people around her. 
The following day, she takes Viegeltje&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.400
to a restaurant. Viegeltje sees pet birds&nbsp;
flapping their wings and does the same. Afraid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.520
of being noticed, Tine takes her to a bathroom&nbsp;
cubicle and asks her to flap her wings there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.320
She waits outside talking to a woman. When&nbsp;
Viegeltje doesn’t come out after some time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.120
Tine opens the door to see only her shoes.&nbsp;
She gets a glimpse of Viegeltje flying away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.000
through the window and yells her name&nbsp;
but to no avail. Tine goes back home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.760
still worried for her daughter and&nbsp;
tells Warre about the disappearance. 
&nbsp;

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.000
They figure that Viegeltje mustn't have gone too&nbsp;
far, so they make their way to the town to look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.920
for her. Meanwhile, we see Viegeltje flying with a&nbsp;
group of birds, having the best time of her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.760
She suddenly loses her balance because&nbsp;
of the wind and lands on someone’s bed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.880
through a skylight window. It turns out the&nbsp;
room belongs to a little girl named Loetje.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.000
Loetje is fascinated by Viegeltje’s wings and&nbsp;
asks her where she got them. The two befriend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.920
each other. Loetje’s father doesn’t have time to&nbsp;
play with her, so she finds solace in Loetje. 
&nbsp;

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.360
Elsewhere, Warre and Tine reach the town and&nbsp;
go to an airline information desk. When they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.160
do not get the information they need, they make&nbsp;
their way to a hotel to stay for the night.
&nbsp;

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.240
Meanwhile, Loetje pretends that she is also a bird&nbsp;
and takes Viegeltje to a nearby tree. Viegeltje&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.480
easily climbs up and sleeps on a branch&nbsp;
while Loetje naps on the lower branch. 
&nbsp;

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.200
Warre and Tine can’t stay at a hotel because&nbsp;
all the rooms are booked. They somehow end up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.160
coming to the same tree and sleeping underneath&nbsp;
it. In the morning, the couple meets Loetje,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.400
who tells them about a bird girl sleeping on the&nbsp;
upper branch. But before they can get to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.600
Viegeltje has already flown away. As the couple&nbsp;
tries to leave, Loetje follows them, claiming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.080
that she’ll help them find Viegeltje. They&nbsp;
get on a bus while following a flock of birds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.160
Tine doesn't want to take Loetje with&nbsp;
them because she is a lot to handle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.040
but the little girl claims that she can take care&nbsp;
of herself. Viegeltje is flying with a flock of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.280
birds but cannot keep up because of her size. She&nbsp;
lands on the roof of a church. The people see her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.160
and call the firefighters to bring her down. 
When a firefighter reaches her, he sees her flying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.320
away afar. The people assume the girl was taken&nbsp;
away by eagles. The news makes the television,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.120
and Warre sees it too. The couple then goes to&nbsp;
the firefighter’s house and try to tell him about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.240
Viegeltje being a bird. He almost doesn’t believe&nbsp;
them but tells them that the bird went south.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.240
He even offers to help them find her.&nbsp;
The group then makes their way south. 
&nbsp;

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.040
Meanwhile, Viegeltje reaches a tiny house in&nbsp;
the middle of nowhere. She is sitting at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.560
window watching some birds. When they fly away,&nbsp;
she joins them. But just then, gunshots are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.120
heard. The group follows the noise and Loetje&nbsp;
finds Viegeltje at the bottom of the well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.960
They use the fireman’s gear to go down the well&nbsp;
and see that it is just Viegeltje’s poncho. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.800
night approaches, they still haven’t found her, so&nbsp;
the group goes to a nearby hotel to stay. Tine has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.560
started treating Loetje as her own daughter. 
At night, Loetje notices a strange boy on a tree&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.920
outside her room. She joins him,&nbsp;
and the two have a nice chat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.440
Later at night, the boy is sleeping on his bed&nbsp;
and hears a noise from under it. When he checks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.560
he is surprised to see Viegeltje sleeping under&nbsp;
her bed. He remembers Loetje telling him about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.000
her so he quickly goes to call her. The two&nbsp;
return to see that Viegeltje is still there. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.640
of them get under the bed and sleep for the night.&nbsp;
Loetje is happy to have her friend back. 
&nbsp;

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.080
In the morning, the boy’s mother comes to clean&nbsp;
his room. The kids run to call Viegeltje's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.360
parents, but Viegeltje has flown away again&nbsp;
before they get to her. Now, it is time for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.480
group to continue the pursuit; however, Loetje&nbsp;
doesn’t want to leave the boy. He is the only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.240
friend she has ever had, and unlike Viegeltje, he&nbsp;
doesn’t run away. Tine understands the little girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.360
and lets her stay. The three of them continue&nbsp;
their journey but the fireman gets weak and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.160
decides to stay in a nearby shed. The other two&nbsp;
end up in a jungle where they cross a river.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.720
Warre has had enough of the pursuit and&nbsp;
tells Tine that they should rest for the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.280
They go back to the shed and sleep.
At night, the firefighter wakes up to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.720
chirping noise. He sees Viegeltje hanging upside&nbsp;
down on a tree. She has injured her wings while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.400
flying. The firefighter rescues her and dresses&nbsp;
her wound. When Viegeltje tries to fly again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.960
she is successful. In the morning, the&nbsp;
firefighter tells Tine and Warre about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.240
his encounter and assures them that Viegeltje&nbsp;
is fine. He then separates from the couple, who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:00.080
still pursue their daughter. They reach a beach&nbsp;
and see Viegeltje fly away towards the sea. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:06.480
finally realise that she has grown up and watch&nbsp;
her fly away together. The couple plans to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:12.640
a bus back home. But Warre hears a chirping noise&nbsp;
before getting on the bus. He runs toward the sea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.760
as Tine follows behind. They rescue a drowning&nbsp;
Viegeltje from the water and bring her back.
&nbsp;

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.760
In the following scene, the three are back home&nbsp;
having dinner. The couple is over the moon to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:29.360
their daughter back and celebrates by drinking.&nbsp;
But the next morning, they see her trying to fly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.400
away through the window. The couple feels bad&nbsp;
for trying to limit their daughter’s freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.160
They finally decide to let her go happily. Warre&nbsp;
and Tine take her to the meadow she was found in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:46.240
give her a last kiss and let her fly away.
