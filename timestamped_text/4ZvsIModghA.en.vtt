00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.510
- [Jacob] Any magical
historian can tell you

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.730
that the wizarding world
spans books, films,

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.280
a Broadway play, and J.K.
Rowling's unstoppable

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.113
Twitter updates.

00:00:07.113 --> 00:00:07.946
Hey, everyone.

00:00:07.946 --> 00:00:08.890
This is Jacob with "Cinematica",

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.710
and we're writing a
history lesson of our own

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.260
with a Harry Potter timeline.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.330
This video will cover
the original eight films,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.260
with a focus on the decade-long struggle

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.570
between Harry and Voldemort,

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.137
though there's a bunch
of stuff that happens

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:21.040
before the decades-long part.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.590
- I read about it in
"Hogwarts, A History."

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.990
- [Jacob] I'm sure you did, Hermione,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.020
but that means no "Fantastic Beasts"

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.990
and no "Cursed Child", thankfully.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.630
So maybe this'll be a
little less comprehensive

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.920
than "Hogwarts, a History."

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.400
But I'm sure many would agree
that might be for the better.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.140
And nevermind the
Hogwarts Express for now,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.510
'cause we're twisting our Time Turner

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.590
way back to 1,000 years
ago, circa the 900s

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.610
to around the 1300s.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.660
In the 10th century, four
of the leading witches

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.790
and wizards of England
establish Hogwarts School

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:49.930
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.200
They are Godric Griffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.440
Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.130
They each found a school
house that embodies

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.580
their respective personalities.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.990
Unfortunately, Slytherin's
personality turns out

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.520
to be bigoted fascist, so isn't long

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.010
before he mucks up the whole system.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.940
He believes that only pure-blooded wizards

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.720
are suitable for mentorship at Hogwarts,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.030
causing a fallout between him

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.060
and the other founders.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.660
He retires, but not before building

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.120
the Chamber of Secrets and
placing a basilisk inside

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.020
so that one day his heir can free it

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.400
and purge the school of
half-bloods and muggle-borns.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.740
Good, cool stuff.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.280
Such a cool thing to do, my dude.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.790
Hundreds of years later, in the 1200s,

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.640
the three Peverell brothers
come into possession

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.240
of three tools that are immensely OP.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.000
Dubbed the Deathly Hallows,
they are the Invisibility Cloak,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.040
the Resurrection Stone,
and the Elder Wand.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.890
And it's believed that
the brothers received them

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.210
from death himself.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.030
As death claims each
of the brothers' lives,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.420
the items are lost to time.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.770
Later that very same century,

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.470
the Triwizard Tournament is founded.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.010
Hogwarts participates in the tournament,

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.600
along with its fellow wizarding schools,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.480
the Durmstrang Institute and
Beaubatons Academy of Magic,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.690
which is ridiculous, since
that school is in France

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.190
and should be pronounced
Beauatons, but I digress.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.640
100 years after that, the
French alchemist Nicholas Flamel

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.580
or Nicholas Flamel I guess,
creates a massively powerful

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.840
piece of magic called
the Philosopher's Stone,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.050
which sidebar, Flamel was a real person

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.450
who lived from about 1330 to 1418,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.330
and the Philosopher's Stone
is an actual mythological item

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.880
that is actually called
the Philosopher's Stone

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.570
and is not the Sorcerer's Stone

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.360
as American audiences
were lead to believe.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.177
The copy I've had since I was a kid says

00:02:17.177 --> 00:02:18.800
"Philosopher's Stone" and this is a hill

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.130
I will gladly die on.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.690
Extra points to "Full Metal Alchemist"

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.250
for not needlessly changing the name

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.320
of the Philospher's Stone.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.870
And if you wanna watch that timeline

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.640
you can find it over
on our sister channel,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.670
Get in the Robot, sidebar over.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.466
Anyway, Flamel uses the Stone
to create an elixir of life

00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:34.920
that sustains him for hundreds of years.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.020
Its life-giving properties
are far more effective

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.310
than those of unicorn blood.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.660
He lasts longer than the
Triwizard Tournament,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.450
which ends in 1792 after
the tradition is deemed

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.920
to be too dangerous.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.150
And we very plainly see
why in "The Goblet of Fire"

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.910
but I'm getting way ahead of myself.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.210
1899.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.770
So anyway, like 100 years later, in 1899,

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.920
the young wizard, Gellert
Grindelwald is expelled

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.770
from the Durmstrang
Institute after performing

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.790
dark experiments and attacks on students.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.530
Post-expulsion Grindelwald goes to live

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.110
with his great aunt, Bathilda Bagshot

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.400
who introduces him to her
neighbor, Albus Dumbledore.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.930
The two boys cultivate a close
and complicated friendship

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.050
which later turns
romantic built on ambition

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.710
and their shared aptitude for magic.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.150
Though you'd never know
the the romantic part

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.450
if you were just watching the movies.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.700
They soon begin plotting
a wizarding revolution

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.970
by finding the Deathly
Hallows and bringing an end

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.790
to the international statute of secrecy.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.580
But Albus has responsibilities
that he's choosing to ignore.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.200
Specifically, after his mother's death,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.120
he and his younger brother
Aberforth were left

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.550
as the main caregivers to their young

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.140
and vulnerable sister Ariana.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.450
When Aberforth confronts
Albus about his dereliction

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.240
of duty, Grindelwald steps in
and uses the Cruciatus Curse

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.073
on the young wizard.

00:03:36.073 --> 00:03:37.820
Albus is horrified by the use of one

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.200
of the unforgivable curses

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.850
and the three wizards begin to duel.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.410
Ariana gets caught in the crossfire,

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.400
is struck by a spell, and dies.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.280
1926-1943.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.730
On New Year's Eve of 1926,
Tom Marvolo Riddle was born

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.320
to a witch mother and muggle father

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.390
who got mixed up in this
business against his will.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.160
Riddle's mother cast a love spell on him.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.380
Through his mom, Merope
Gaunt, he's the direct heir

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.040
of Salazar Slytherin, but his
upbringing isn't so lofty.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.050
Since his mother died and his
father's out of the picture,

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.080
he's raised at Wool's Orphanage in London.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.520
Dark happenings follow Tom.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.910
On holiday on a seaside
cave, he traumatizes some

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.980
of his fellow orphans.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.560
In 1938, Hogwarts
professor, Albus Dumbledore,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.750
who has aged pretty ungracefully

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.500
since his youth as Jude Law,
visits Tom at the orphanage.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.860
Despite the warning signs
that Tom is super evil,

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.420
Dumbledore invites him to Hogwarts.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.520
During his time at the
school, Tom becomes a handsome

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.100
and brilliant student and a favorite

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.840
of potions master, Horace Slughorn.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.180
But he also becomes a bigoted fascist

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.900
who's drawn to super evil magic.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.330
I guess it runs in the family.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.170
He spends his free time
in the restricted section

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.860
of the library researching
super evil things.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.390
After learning about his muggle heritage,

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.240
Tom tracks down and murders his father

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.350
and paternal grandparents

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.820
at Riddle house in Little Hangleton.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.900
He reclaims an old heirloom
of his mother's family,

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.630
a ring that he wears around Hogwarts.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.100
Little does he know at the
time that the ring contains

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.790
the fabled Resurrection Stone.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.140
It's never specified, but Tom
must have used the murders

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.300
of his muggle family to fashion the stone

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.070
into the first of his seven
horcruxes later down the line.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.910
In 1942, after one of
Slughorn's famous dinner parties

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:00.900
Tom stays behind.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.390
He probes the professor about
the nature of horcruxes.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.220
Back up vessels for the soul
made by killing another person.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.010
He floats the idea of splitting a soul

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.140
into seven fragments and
Slughorn is rightfully terrified,

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.140
but he doesn't tell
anyone about the incident.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.390
A year later, Tom discovers

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.850
the Chamber of Secrets' hidden entrance.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.570
He frees Slytherin's basilisk
so it can roam the halls

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.400
of Hogwarts, killing Myrtle Warren.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.040
In the ensuing investigation,
Tom blames Rubius Hagrid

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.240
for opening the chamber.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.040
Hagrid's expelled and his wand is broken,

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.990
but Dumbledore remains suspicious of Tom.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.830
Suffering under Dumbledore's watchful eye,

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.390
Tom stopped exploring the chamber

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.682
and turns his personal diary
into his second horcrux.

00:05:33.682 --> 00:05:34.910
In the following years,

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.930
Tom creates three additional horcruxes

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.300
further dividing his soul.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.860
In 1945, Dumbledore has a legendary dual

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.030
against the dark wizard
Gellert Grindelwald

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.520
that's literally a whole other story,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.010
but the main takeaway is
that Dumbledore is victorious

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.200
and seizes control of
the Elder Wand from him.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.040
But now there's a new dark lord in town.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.970
At some additional edge
lord Tom Riddle thinks

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.990
it would be cool to rearrange
the letters in his name

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.200
to make a dark lord title

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.520
and takes the mantle of Lord Voldemort.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.160
The name matches his new
super creepy appearance.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.380
The severing of his soul
drains Lord Voldemort

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.910
of his humanity, leaving
him pale and serpentine.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.440
Also he has no nose.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.740
Probably part of that whole
looking like a snake thing

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.290
but he has no nose and
it's weird and gross

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.434
but now whenever I see Ray
Fiennes I don't recognize him

00:06:16.434 --> 00:06:19.150
because I mostly know
him for having no nose.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.430
In this transformative time,
Voldemort gains a legion

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.860
of followers called Death
Eaters who help him incite fear

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.428
and discrimination in the wizarding world.

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:28.177
And basically, he's the biggest threat

00:06:28.177 --> 00:06:29.830
to the wizarding world
since Gellert Grindelwald.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.950
1970-1990.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.200
It's a period of civil war.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.010
The Order of the Phoenix,
founded by Albus,

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.240
protects the Ministry of Magic

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.660
from Voldemort's reign of terror.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.050
Elsewhere, a young muggle-born
witch named Lily Evans

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.180
is coming into her powers.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.690
She falls out of favor with
her jealous sister Petunia,

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.620
if Petunia ever favored
her in the first place,

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.370
but meets another magical
boy named Severus Snape.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.480
The two become fast friends,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.500
but their relationship is put

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.020
in jeopardy once school begins.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.130
The Sorting Hat sorts Lily into Gryffindor

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.040
while Snape is sorted into Slytherin.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.760
They're further estranged
by the marauders,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.880
a mischevious group of
Gryffindor boys who bully Snape.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.550
They're made up of Sirius
Black, Peter Pettigrew,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.300
Remus Lupin, and James Potter.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.190
All four boys are animagi,
having learned how to transform

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.640
into animals so that Lupin
wouldn't have to feel so bad

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.380
about being a werewolf which
is pretty sweet actually.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.300
James eventually starts
a relationship with Lily,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.210
and it completely alienates Snape.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.840
Though Snape is a proficient student,

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.260
even marking up a potions
textbook under the alias

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.540
of the Half Blood prince, he's lonely.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.920
I mean, he was calling
himself the Half Blood Prince

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.250
it doesn't take a genius to see

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.610
that someone like that is lonely.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.710
In his isolation he
turns to Lord Voldemort

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.050
becoming one of his Death Eaters.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.810
Conversely, Lily and the Marauders joined

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.090
the Order of the Phoenix to
stand against the dark lord.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.880
Sirius Black brother Regulus Black

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.110
also becomes a Death Eater.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.390
He's a loyal servant to
Voldemort until the Dark Lord

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.940
uses Regulus's hous elf,
Creature, for a trial run

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.090
on a horcrux challenge.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.120
Voldemort hides Salazar Slytherin's locket

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.670
in the seaside cave from his childhood

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.190
protected by a poisonous potion

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.350
that he makes the elf drink.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.590
Upon learning this, Regulus
and creature go back

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.200
to the cave and steal the locket.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.870
They leave behind a fake locket
with a hidden note inside,

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.600
presumably saying you got pranked

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.630
underneath whatever the actual note said.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.430
But Regulus is killed by Inferi.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.770
Creature takes the real locket back

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.330
to the Black Family's ancestral home

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.920
but he's incapable of destroying it.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.390
In 1979, at the height of
Lord Voldemort's powers,

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.390
Sybill Trelawney foresees his downfall.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.070
She recites a prophesy that Dumbledore,

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.977
at her Hogwarts job
interview, stating that

00:08:14.977 --> 00:08:16.597
"The one with the power to vanquish

00:08:16.597 --> 00:08:18.587
"the Dark Lord approaches, born to those

00:08:18.587 --> 00:08:19.767
"who have thrice defied him,

00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:21.730
"born as the seventh month dies."

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.950
Little do they realize
that Severus Snape is

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.760
on the other side of
the door eavesdropping.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.900
He delivers the news directly
back to Lord Voldemort

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.980
who determines that
the defiers in question

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.949
are Lily and James Potter
and that the chosen one

00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:33.290
is their son, Harry.

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.770
The Dark Lord decides to
track them down and kill them.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.810
But since Snape is
still in love with Lily,

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:39.770
he's like, oh boy,
shouldn't have said that,

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.190
so he rushes to Dumbledore
to confess his sins.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.960
They concoct a plan to
to protect the Potters

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.800
but it fails when Peter Pettigrew gives in

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.374
to Voldemort's influence
and sells them out.

00:08:47.374 --> 00:08:49.658
On Halloween 1981, Voldemort invades Lily

00:08:49.658 --> 00:08:51.690
and James's house in Godric's Hollow

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:52.680
and then murders them.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.629
And if you're doing the math here,

00:08:54.629 --> 00:08:57.150
that means that Lily and James
were only 21 when they died.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.080
And there's also a nonzero
chance that they were listening

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.900
to "Bette Davis Eyes"
when this all went down.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.570
Though Voldemort tries to kill Harry too,

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.640
the boy is protected
by love magic imparted

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.340
by his mom as she sacrifices
her life to save her son

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.690
so the spell backfires.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.870
Harry lives and Voldemort's
body is vanquished.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.007
His soul survives though,
thanks to his horcruxes,

00:09:13.007 --> 00:09:15.080
and an additional soul
fragment is imprinted

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.970
into Harry through a forehead scar.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.420
It's in the shape of the
Avada Kedavara hand motion,

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.240
that being the spell that was
used to murder Harry's family.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.880
But to the rest of us muggles the scar

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.600
just looks like a lightning bolt.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.160
Sirius Black realizes that
Pettigrew betrayed the Potters

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.480
and confronts him, but
Pettigrew fakes his own death

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.090
via explosion, implicating
Sirius of the crimes,

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.680
including selling out the Potters.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.920
Sirius is convicted and
sent to Azkaban Prison

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.890
while Pettigrew becomes a full-time rat

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.760
for the little boys in the Weasley family,

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.500
but honestly being a rat
would probably be an upgrade

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.930
for me if I looked like this at age 21.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.060
Actually I didn't look that different.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.280
I'm gonna move on now.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.790
To allow orphan Harry to grow
up as normally as possible

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.740
Dumbledore send him to
live with his Aunt Petunia

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.360
and Uncle Vernon Dursley
in Little Whinging England.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.870
They've got a son of
their own named Dudley

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.690
and they're none too happy
about having to raise

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.450
this second cursed child.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.740
It turns out that maybe
sending Harry to these folks

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.150
might've maybe, sort of,
been kind of a bad idea

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.290
since for the next 10 years

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.500
Harry grows up tormented by the Dursleys.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.340
They stow him away in
cupboard under the stairs

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.233
and keep his entire magical
history a secret from him.

00:10:12.233 --> 00:10:14.850
Meanwhile, Voldemort leads
a cursed life of his own,

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.810
surviving in a sub-spirit
state in the forests

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.980
of Albania, possessing snakes to survive.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:19.980
His followers are tried

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.700
by the Ministry of Magic for their crimes.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.840
During his trial, Igor
Karkaroff ousts Barty Crouch Jr.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.469
as a Death Eater.

00:10:26.469 --> 00:10:27.640
Crouch is sentenced to
Azkaban while Karkaroff

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.541
becomes headmaster of
the Durmstrang Institute.

00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:32.490
And Snape becomes a Hogwarts professor

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.110
and Lucius Malfoy remains the head of one

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.580
of the richest wizarding families

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.290
and is there no justice?

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.270
All of Voldemort's followers
have turned their backs

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.540
on him, but he's eventually
discovered by Quirrell,

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.260
a muggle studies professor from Hogwarts

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.780
with an unnatural interest
in super evil arts.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.269
His lack of self-worth
makes him susceptible

00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:50.641
to Voldemort's trickery, so
the Dark Lord latches himself

00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:52.580
onto the back of Quirrell's head,

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.620
concealed by a bright purple turban.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.150
It's very inconspicuous.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.880
1991-1992, Harry's first year at Hogwarts.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.906
In happier news, Harry
Potter's life changes

00:11:01.906 --> 00:11:03.520
in the summer of 1991

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.490
when he receives his
Hogwarts acceptance letter.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.020
Though the Dursley's go to the
ends of the earth, literally,

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.360
to keep Harry away from magic,

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.440
Hagrid tracks them down
and liberates the boy.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.340
He tells Harry about
his historic backstory

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.310
including the fact that
he's already a celebrity

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.230
in the wizarding world
for surviving Voldemort

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.063
and sets him up

00:11:18.063 --> 00:11:19.540
with all the back to
school supplies he needs

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.980
including a beautiful
snowy owl named Hedwig.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.380
I hope nothing happens to her.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.370
Along the way they stop at
Gringotts wizarding bank

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.730
to withdraw the Philosopher's Stone

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.730
which is to be moved to
Hogwarts for safekeeping.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.430
Once there it will be magically contained

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.440
within the Mirror of
Erised, obtainable only

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.670
by someone who is worthy.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.450
Also Harry has like a million

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:37.280
bazillion dollars in wizard money.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.590
On the Hogwarts Express
Harry meets Ron Weasley

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.760
with full-time rat Peter
Pettigrew in his lap,

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.200
though the Weasley family's
taken to calling him Scabbers,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.570
and Hermione Granger.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.950
After super rudely buying
and entire train's worth

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.810
of refreshments they're
his ride or die squad

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.440
for his entire academic career.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.640
He's sorted into Gryffindor
and becomes a quidditch jock

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.000
just like his father before him.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.620
Though the Sorting Hat
really said he could go

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.080
to Gryffindor or Slytherin,
it was kind of a toss up

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.280
since Harry has part of
the soul of an evil wizard

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.750
embedded into his forehead, you know.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.320
Meanwhile Quirrell and Voldemort learn

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.400
that the Philosopher's Stone
has been moved to Hogwarts.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.840
Using the stone's power they'd
be able to restore Voldemort

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.560
to his full form, so they
unleash a troll as a distraction

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.630
while they try to retrieve it.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.010
It turns out that the stone is
guarded by a three-headed dog

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.670
named Fluffy, and Quirrell's
two heads are no match for it.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.680
Harry and his cohorts come
to suspect that it's actually

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.580
Professor Snape that's
trying to steal the stone

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.560
so they decide to steal it before he can.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.440
Thanks to Hagrid's loose
lips, they're abel to get

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.190
past Fluffy and the other trials,

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.850
but their numbers dwindle along the way

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.810
until only Harry is left standing.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.540
Ron and Hermione are
fine though, whatever.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.020
He confronts Quirrell and Voldemort

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.390
at the Mirror of Erised which
senses his selfless motives

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.780
and rewards him with the stone.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.320
When Quirrell tries to snatch it from him

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.010
Harry disintegrates him with love magic

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.960
and Voldemort's fragmented soul flies off

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.407
to fight another day,
screaming, "We'll meet again,

00:12:45.407 --> 00:12:46.910
"Spider Man," or whatever.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.020
In the aftermath of the
incident, Dumbledore destroys

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.666
the Philosopher's Stone,
bringing an eventual end

00:12:51.666 --> 00:12:53.030
to Nichaloas Flamel's long life,

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.720
and then he totally cheats Slytherin

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.610
out of the house cup
by awarding Gryffindor

00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:00.150
with 170 house points
for, at the award ceremony

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.703
'cause the system is rigged and it's,

00:13:01.703 --> 00:13:04.000
1992-1993.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.220
That summer Lucius
Malfoy begins a campaign

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.620
to reopen the Chamber of Secrets

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.260
and purge Hogwarts of its muggle-born

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.165
and half-blood students.

00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:12.380
His house elf Dobby finds
out about the scheme

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.760
and tries to protect Harry from it.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.080
He ostracizes the boy from
Hogwarts by withholding

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.470
all of the letters from his friends

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.410
and by sealing up the
gateway to Platform Nine

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:20.940
and Three-Quarters, you know, the platform

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.510
at King's Cross that leads to the train?

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.070
With a little help from Ron's flying car,

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.120
Harry makes it to school
with only a few scratches

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.260
and a little detention.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.610
But the plan's already in motion.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.300
Lucius pawns off Voldemort's
diary, the first horcrux,

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.490
onto Ron's sister Ginny.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.970
The diary brainwashes Ginny
into reopening the chamber

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.310
and unleashing the basilisk

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.520
which traverses the halls
petrifying a handful

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.440
of the student body including Hermione.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.040
Knowing that the chamber
can only be opened

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.354
by Slytherin's heir, the school
goes into a whodunit frenzy

00:13:44.354 --> 00:13:46.978
of finding the culprit until
Ginny vanishes completely.

00:13:46.978 --> 00:13:49.720
Harry and Ron follow a
lead from Moaning Myrtle

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.330
ghost of Myrtle Warren, the
student that the basilisk killed

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.180
all those years ago.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.100
Harry and Ron venture into
the Chamber of Secrets

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.640
to find Ginny there,
only to come face-to-face

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.430
with Tom Riddle himself.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.880
Luckily Dumbledore's Phoenix,
Fawkes, delivers the sword

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.680
of Gryffindor to Harry at a crucial moment

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.581
and uses it to slay the snake monster.

00:14:05.581 --> 00:14:07.940
That super charges it with basilisk venom

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.460
which becomes important later.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.130
Then using the basilisk's fang,

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.180
Harry stabs and destroys the diary,

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.560
destroying the first
fragment of Voldemort's soul.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.611
Oh, and also Gideroy Lockhart
was the Defense Against

00:14:17.611 --> 00:14:19.420
the Dark Arts teacher that year

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.170
but you can just forget about him.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:22.210
Whatever, it's not important.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.100
He directed the first
Thor, he's doing fine.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.890
1993-1994.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.310
After spending 12 years in
Azkaban, Sirius Black learns

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.720
that Peter Pettigrew is still alive

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.750
and attending Hogwarts as a full-time rat.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.500
Sirius uses his shape-shifting abilities

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.720
to escape the inescapable prison as a dog

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.140
and then swims back to shore
to track down his old friend.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.750
Since the general public still believe

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.130
that Sirius betrayed the Potters,

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.060
they all believe that Harry is his target.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.530
The Ministry of Magic deploys
the soul-sucking dementors

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.352
to recapture Sirius
before he gets to the boy.

00:14:47.352 --> 00:14:49.550
But the dementors board
the Hogwarts Express

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.120
and feed on all of Harry's angst,

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.750
but he's saved by Remus Lupin.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.560
He's the no Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.070
and he gives Harry private lessons

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.690
on the Patronus charm, the
spell used to repel dementors.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.080
In other Hogwarts news, Professor
McGonagall gives Hermione

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.800
a rare time turner so that
she can take extra classes

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.652
which is the lamest excuse
to use time travel ever.

00:15:06.652 --> 00:15:08.727
But whatever.

00:15:08.727 --> 00:15:11.080
And Draco Malfroy harasses a
fantastic beast named Buckbeak

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.380
and gets bucked himself.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.610
And since Draco was too
rich to take responsibility

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.360
for his actions, his daddy has
Buckbeak sentenced to death.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.380
Before Buckbeak is executed, future Harry

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.610
and future Hermione appear

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:22.350
via the time turner, and save him.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.080
Before any of that happened though,

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.360
as the present-day trio helplessly watched

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.610
the would be execution,
full-time rat, Peter Pettigrew,

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.680
bites Ron and flees into the woods.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.813
The friends chase him but their
intercepted by Sirius Black

00:15:32.813 --> 00:15:35.080
who drags Ron into the Shrieking Shack.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.397
Once they're all inside Lupin joins them

00:15:36.397 --> 00:15:39.750
and explains that this has
all been a misunderstanding

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.816
as Sirius is actually just
trying to kill Ron's family pet.

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:44.418
They forcibly revert
Pettigrew back to human form

00:15:44.418 --> 00:15:46.590
and take him toward the castle.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.900
It's bad timing though
'cause it's a full moon

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.470
so Lupus goes beast mode
and messes everything up.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.740
Pettigrew escapes while
Harry and Serius are accosted

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.580
by dementors until future Harry
appears and vanquishes them

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.030
with a Patronus charm, but
present Harry doesn't know

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.600
it's his future self who
send the silvery stage yet

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.663
'cause he hasn't done it yet to him.

00:16:04.514 --> 00:16:06.562
Whatever, Sirius black is captured

00:16:06.562 --> 00:16:08.670
and then sentenced to death
so Harry and Hermione use

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:09.503
the time turner to go back in time

00:16:09.503 --> 00:16:11.490
and do all of those things
that I just explained.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:13.990
That was like the most
confusing explanation ever.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.680
I hate explaining time travel.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.770
Everybody got that?

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.820
1994-1995.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.300
Having escaped from Harry and his friends,

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.690
Pettigrew creates a
rudimentary childlike body

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.100
for Voldemort, gross.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.050
Pettigrew and proto-Voldemort take refuge

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:27.090
at the old Riddle house.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.440
Caretaker Frank Bryce
investigates the disturbance

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.840
at the abandoned manor,
so Voldemort kills him.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.160
He then turns Nagini
into the seventh horcrux.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.530
Afterword Barty Crouch Jr.
and a band of Death Eaters

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:37.990
terrorize the Quidditch World Cup,

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.320
where Harry and his friends
just happened to be.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.430
Around that time, the Death
Eaters abduct the auror,

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.910
Mad-Eye Moody, and Crouch
uses a polyjuice potion

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:45.800
to take his place.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.120
Naturally Moody becomes
the new Defense Against the

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.270
Dark Arts teacher, actually Crouch.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.730
This year the school is hosting
the Tri-wizard Tournament

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.310
for the first time in 200 years

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.560
and their pretty sure it
won't be too dangerous.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.270
Students who are over the age
of 17 can submit their names

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.130
into the Goblet of Fire
which will then select

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.220
one champion from each
of the three schools.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.360
The Death Eaters didn't get the
memo about the rules though,

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.340
so face Moody puts Harry's name in the cup

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.980
and selects him as a fourth contestant

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.327
along with the actual Hogwarts
champion Cedric Diggory.

00:17:12.327 --> 00:17:14.970
Dumbledore asks him calmly--

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.587
- Harry, did you put your
name in the Goblet of Fire?"

00:17:16.587 --> 00:17:18.120
- [Jacob] But in the end it doesn't matter

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.030
because rules, Harry is
contractually obligated to compete

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.740
just as the Death Eaters intended.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.240
The Tri-Wizard carries on

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.260
with each challenge more
dangerous than the last,

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.750
but Moody rigs it so that
Harry is guaranteed to win.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.020
The final task is to
find the Tri-Wizard cup

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.130
within a hedge maze.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.360
Kind of underwhelming after all

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.010
of the other challenges, honestly.

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.790
At the end of the maze,
Harry and Cedric agree

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.420
to grab the cup together,
but the cups been enchanted

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.680
into a teleportation
device called a Port Key

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.660
and it whisks them away to a graveyard.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.800
Peter Pettigrew and
Voldemort await Harry there.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.380
They quickly dispose of Cedric,

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.940
he's dead, but whatever,
it's cool, he's a vampire

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.140
or Batman or something.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.080
The two then use Harry

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.820
in a ritual that resurrects Voldemort.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.310
He summons all of his Death
Eaters and publicly shames them

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:58.060
before turning his
attention back to Harry.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.410
The Dark Lord initiates a duel

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.520
to prove himself superior
to his adversary.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.330
Harry whips out the only
spell he's half decent at,

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.695
Expelliarmus, which meets
Voldemort's Avada Kedavra.

00:18:05.695 --> 00:18:08.900
The spells collide in
"Dragon Ball Z" beam struggle

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.270
that frees the echoes
of Voldemort's victims.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.700
Harry's parents, Frank
Bryce, and Cedric Diggory

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:14.820
keep the Dark Lord at bay

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.120
while Harry flees the
graveyard with Cedric's body.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.340
Upon his return to Hogwarts,

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.010
Harry and the professors expose
Crouch disguised as Moody

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:24.080
and find the real one alive
trapped in a magic chest.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.180
1995-1996.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.210
Despite Harry's firsthand
encounter with Voldemort,

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.070
the Ministry of Magic
refuses to acknowledge

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.670
that the Dark Lord has
returned even though

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.040
he very much has.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.190
And he's rebuilding his army

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.870
by freeing prisoners from Azkaban.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.810
Something that the Ministry
is pinning on Sirius

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.670
and he's looking to correct the failure

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:40.830
that led to his downfall.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.070
To that end, he and the Death
Eaters are after the prophecy

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:44.460
that first predicted his defeat.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.724
Back at Hogwarts, the Ministry
designates the worst villain

00:18:46.724 --> 00:18:49.128
in the history of the Harry
Potter series, Delores Umbridge,

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:51.470
as the new Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher,

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.680
but she shares their
denial of climate change,

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.240
I mean Voldemort's return.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.140
Since she won't actually
teach her students

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.720
how to defend themselves
against the dark arts,

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.230
Harry and his friends do it instead.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.560
They start Dumbledore's
Army, a wizarding fight club,

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.100
to prepare for the inevitable battle.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.070
And for snogging, it was unavoidable.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.830
Their training pays off
when Harry has a vision

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.560
of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.790
It's a trap meant to lure them

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:13.740
to the Ministry of Magic, and it works.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.900
They find the prophecy there,

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.650
but they're hoodwinked by Lucius Malfoy.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:17.780
He threatens to kill them all

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.410
if Harry doesn't relinquish the prophecy.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.610
Before the deal is done, the
Order of the Phoenix arrives

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:24.250
led by Sirius Black, and dukes
it out with the Death Eaters.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.313
In the fray, the prophecy
shatters, and Sirius is killed

00:19:26.313 --> 00:19:28.510
by his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.180
Harry pursues her to exact his revenge,

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.510
but he's waylayed by Voldemort.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.240
The Dark Lord has the
upper hand this time,

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.730
but luckily Dumbledore
arrives to protect the boy.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.240
The two master wizards duel
in a spectacular battle

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.730
and just as it comes to a close,

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:41.170
the wizarding workday begins

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.330
and all of the Ministry
officials flood in.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.160
They witness Voldemort in the flesh

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.060
proving once and for all that he's back.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.750
Which is like the wildest
way to start your work week.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:51.440
I probably would've taken the day off.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.290
1996-1997.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.710
Following the loss of the prophecy,

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.845
Voldemort inducts Draco
Malfoy into the Death Eaters

00:19:56.845 --> 00:19:59.400
and tasks him with
assassinating Dumbledore.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.650
That would bring the Malfoy family

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.821
back into his good graces.

00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:03.654
Snape tattles to Dumbledore,

00:20:03.654 --> 00:20:04.970
but finds that the
headmaster's been cursed

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:06.850
after destroying one of
Voldemort's horcruxes,

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.120
the Resurrection Stone ring.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.820
With Dumbledore's life
already on the line,

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.653
the two of them agree

00:20:10.653 --> 00:20:12.400
that Snape should be the
one to kill Dumbledore.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.787
In anticipation of his
death, Dumbledore packs

00:20:13.787 --> 00:20:15.600
the Resurrection Stone into the snictch

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.820
from Harry's first quidditch game

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.300
to be posthumously gifted to him.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.070
Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts is filled

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.695
with teen drama and magical high jinks

00:20:21.695 --> 00:20:24.260
and more snogging, and
there's this mystery

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.650
about this Half Blood Prince bloke,

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.160
but eventually he and
Dumbledore get down to business.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.900
The headmaster has located a third horcrux

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.040
in the seaside cave from
Tom Riddle's childhood.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.720
Not realizing that the locket is a fake,

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.675
they retrieve it, barely
escaping with their lives.

00:20:35.675 --> 00:20:37.580
Upon their return to Hogwarts they find

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.080
that it's been raided by Death Eaters.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.950
Harry hides while Dumbledore face them.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.099
At the astronomy tower
Draco disarms the headmaster

00:20:43.099 --> 00:20:44.976
making him the master of the Elder Wand

00:20:44.976 --> 00:20:47.131
but he can't bring
himself to kill Dumbledore

00:20:47.131 --> 00:20:48.950
and chickens out at the last second.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.989
So one of the most infamous
spoilers of all time happens

00:20:51.989 --> 00:20:54.260
and Snape kills Dumbledore.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.840
As the Death Eaters pillage Hogwarts,

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.340
the students and teachers
mourn the headmaster's death.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.260
1997-1998.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.190
Voldemort continues his
new reign of terror.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:03.280
To keep Harry safe from it,

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.590
the Order orf the Phoenix deliver him

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:05.920
to the Weasley's home at the borough,

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.580
but there are casualties along the way.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.840
Rest in peace Mad-Eye.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.580
We hardly even knew the real you.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.790
And also, whoops, something
happened to Hedwig.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.730
Harry's determined to
continue Dumbledore's quest

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.500
for the horcruxes, but Ron convinces him

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.900
to stay for his brother's wedding.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.160
Well, their wedding gets
ransacked by Death Eaters anyway,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.480
so the questing begins.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.670
The trio heads to the Black
family's ancestral home

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:24.530
and meets Creature.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:26.300
They learn the Creature
had the real locket

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.180
but it was stolen by Mundungus Fletcher

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.030
who gave it to Dolores
Umbridge who is working

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:31.060
in the corrupt Ministry.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.680
So, like, they go and get that.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.450
For months the gang stays camped out

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.070
in the wilderness hiding from Death Eaters

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.570
while trying to destroy the locket.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:39.810
All the while, Voldemort's siege

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:41.180
of the wizarding world continues.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.170
Now turncoat Snape has even taken over

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:44.430
as headmaster of Hogwarts.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:45.560
The situation looks grim

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.230
but Snape pulls through for the good guys.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.320
He stealthily withdraws
the super charged sword

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.050
of Gryffindor from Bellatrixes bank vault

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:52.800
and deposits in within a frozen lake.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.863
Then lures Harry over
using a Patronus charm.

00:21:54.863 --> 00:21:56.810
Ron strikes the locket with the blade

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:58.820
and destroys it weakening the Dark Lord.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.560
But old Tom is feelin' all right
since he goes grave digging

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.630
and steals the Elder Wand
from Dumbledore's tomb.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:04.630
Though they have been cautious,

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.380
Harry and his friends
are captured by snatchers

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.610
and brought to Malfoy Manor.

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:09.290
Before the Death Eaters
can do their thing though,

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.440
Dobby apparates in and
jailbreaks the trio.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.933
In the ensuing battle, Harry disarms Draco

00:22:12.933 --> 00:22:15.301
so now he's the master of
the Elder Wand, keep track.

00:22:15.301 --> 00:22:16.560
They apparate away from the manor

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.550
but Bellatrix sneaks a
killing blow on Dobby.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:20.990
With four Horcruxes left to go,

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.040
Harry, Ron, and Hermione
hit up Gringotts Bank

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.720
and the Room of Requirement at Hogwarts.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.110
They destroy one of the hidden
objects using fiend fire

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:28.680
and the other with basilisk fang

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.600
from the Chamber of Secrets,

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.540
so it's all coming full circle now.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.210
And then there's more snogging though.

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:34.870
Seriously, everyone
knows that the real 'ship

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.140
is Ron and Harry.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.100
Voldemort grows wise
to the trio's questing

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.270
so he sends the Death
Eaters to raid the school.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.360
The attack becomes known
as the Battle of Hogwarts

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.739
and many great witches and wizards die

00:22:43.739 --> 00:22:45.260
in the epic confrontation

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.160
and Molly Weasley gets to
deliver her iconic line

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.280
channeling her inner Ellen Ripley.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.837
- Not my daughter, you bitch!

00:22:51.837 --> 00:22:53.860
- [Jacob] Elsewhere Voldemort
is under the impression

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.210
that Snape is the proper
master of the Elder Wand

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:57.920
since he was the one
who killed Dumbledore,

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.290
unaware that Draco became
the master beforehand.

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:02.350
So he sics his snake Nagini on him.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.368
Sidebar, Nagini used to be a human woman,

00:23:04.368 --> 00:23:07.250
but that's a whole, that's
a whole other thing.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:08.840
Through Snape's memories Harry learns

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.800
that a piece of Voldemort
lives inside of him

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.530
and that he must die to destroy it.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.780
So, like, he does that.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.017
But Voldemort's killing curse
only affects his own soul,

00:23:17.017 --> 00:23:19.390
not Harry, so the boy who lived returns

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:20.360
for the final battle.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.097
When Neville Longbottom
heroically kills Nagini

00:23:22.097 --> 00:23:24.335
and makes Voldemort completely vulnerable,

00:23:24.335 --> 00:23:26.510
the Dark Lord tries to use the Elder Wand

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:28.210
to defeat Harry, it's true master,

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:30.560
and it rejects his
spell, obliterating him.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.610
With Voldemort fully
extinguished from the earth,

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:36.000
the death eaters disband once
again and Hogwarts rebuilds.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.190
1998-2017.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:39.930
In the years following
the Battle of Hogwarts,

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:41.340
Harry becomes an Auror and brings

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.471
the corrupt Ministry of Magic
back to its former glory.

00:23:43.471 --> 00:23:45.310
Not bad for a high school dropout.

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:47.130
He marries Ginny Weasley
and they have three

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:48.830
ridiculously named children together.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.780
Likewise, Ron and Hermione
marry with children

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.780
and pick up lofty government
jobs at the Ministry.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.250
So it's a happy ending all around.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:55.083
All is well.

00:23:55.083 --> 00:23:58.350
And then the cursed child
happened but let's, let's not.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:00.240
I've been your host Jacob
and thanks for watching.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.080
What was your biggest
accomplishment in high school?

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.470
Did you ever stop a
decades-long reign of evil?

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:06.200
Or did high school just feel like one?

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.230
