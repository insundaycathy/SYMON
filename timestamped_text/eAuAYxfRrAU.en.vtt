00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.320
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.129
Today’s movie is a timeless love story with 
love, letters and a mailbox.

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.130
This is The Lake House.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.600
The movie starts off with a woman named Kate Forrester

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.180
leaving a lake house, putting her things in

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.840
her car all except a letter that she leaves
in the mailbox.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.820
As she drives away in autumn, a man named
Alex Wyler checks out the lake house in winter.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.640
That night, he moves in, taking the letter from
the mailbox as he does so.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.260
It’s from Kate who welcomes the new tenant
to the house and politely asks that the new

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.600
tenant forward any mail that might have accidentally
been sent to the lake house,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.800
since she’s moved to Chicago.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.080
And she ends it with a PS, apologizing for
the pawprints on the dock

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.700
and the box in the attic to which Alex is left wondering

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.000
"What pawprints? What box is she talking about?"

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.440
The next day, Alex is painting the railings.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.180
But as he’s painting, a dog runs through
his paint tray, running into his house,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.380
making paw prints on the dock.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.070
In Chicago, Kate is eating with her mom at
Daley Plaza.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.080
It’s a hot and noisy Valentines Day and
as they are eating lunch, a bus runs into

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.650
a man and Kate rushes to save him.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.720
But we find out that she failed to save him,
and after a talk with her boss

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.300
her boss suggests that she take some days off

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.640
so she goes to the Lake House with her dog Jack.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.040
She checks the mailbox for mail and takes
out a letter.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.630
It’s from Alex, who tells her that she’s
mistaken.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.290
According to Alex, the house has been abandoned
for years and he thinks that maybe she was

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.070
writing the letter for someone else.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.590
He ends the letter, asking her how she knew about
the pawprints.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.840
She’s a little upset with him in her next
letter.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.340
No.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.480
She meant to write to whoever was moving into
the lake house.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.760
She used to live there and since she has moved.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.600
And she’d like it very much if he sent her
any mail at her new address in Chicago.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.280
Oh and he’s wrong about the whole house
was empty for several years thing.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.800
It’s 2006 and someone was living there before
her.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.220
And Alex is just confused by the letter, this time

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.970
What does she mean saying its 2006?

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.960
Alex goes to Chicago to reunite with his brother,
Henry.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.260
Who is an architect working for their workaholic
father, Simon.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.799
The two brothers catch up and Alex tells Henry
all about the lake house and his new dog

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.400
which is the same dog that made the paw prints.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.860
After the reunion, Alex goes to Kate’s address,
to deliver a letter, and we find out, that

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.040
the building is still under construction.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.599
He goes back to the lake house and leaves
his letter in the mailbox: telling her that

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.690
her home is still under construction and he
points out that she got the year wrong.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.980
It’s not 2006.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.620
It’s 2004.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.629
But Alex is a man talking to a woman so of
course he’s wrong!

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:53.730
She scrounges around her apartment until she
finds a photo dated April 4th, 2004 (04/03/2004).

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.960
Supposedly Jack the Dog didn’t like the
late snow that spring.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.159
So Kate decides to play along with Alex, warning
him that “If you really are in 2004, you’re

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.670
gonna get some late spring snow.” and she
gives him a scarf to keep him warm.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.950
Alex thinks she’s just being ‘cute’
and chuckles at her prediction and doesn’t

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.160
believe a word.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.440
Until he turns around and sees the first fall
of snow and he’s awestruck by the weather

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.750
and that last letter from Kate.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.319
The next morning is pretty-chilly but Alex
still goes out and leaves a letter in the

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.540
mailbox.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.049
When Kate pulls out his letter from the mailbox,
it reads “Can this be happening?”.

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.890
And as he’s walking back inside, Alex is
surprised to see the mailbox’s flag go up.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.580
There in the mailbox, that had Alex’s letter
minutes ago, is an envelope.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.989
From Kate, reading “Why not?”.

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.480
Neither of them see anyone deliver a letter,
but their mailboxes somehow get letters.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.099
Without anyone delivering them.

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:54.060
So just to be clear: Alex is in
the year 2004 and Kate is in the year 2006.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.010
It seems like the mailbox is a portal between
2 separate dimensions, 2 timelines:

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.100
where it’s either 2 years in the future
or 2 years in the past.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.400
and using this, they are able to send each other letters

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.640
as well as as a scarf.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.280
Both to and from the future or the past, so!

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.139
This movie uses 2 different timelines where
people are able to talk to each other.

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.889
Let’s see if this theory holds true, and
 nail down the rules this movie follows.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.370
Back to the movie.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.000
So, Kate and Alex decide to properly introduce
themselves to each other.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.370
She’s a doctor and he’s an architect and
through the letters they have some playful

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.760
interactions and learn more about each other.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.060
Like in one letter, they talk about the paw
prints, and by coincidence they realize that

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.540
they both have the same dog.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.200
In fact, Kate tells Alex the dog’s name
is Jack and for some reason the dog seems

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.860
to respond to the name after Alex calls her.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.130
There’s this one time when Alex gives
Kate a map of Chicago with a route to follow.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.470
She ends up next to a building where Alex
had spray-painted message to her.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.830
There’s also this one letter to Alex, where
Kate mentions that she misses seeing the trees,

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.560
that grow around the lake house.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.200
So, Alex plants a sapling at the place where
Kate lives in the future.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.310
And we see, in the future, Kate go back home
one day while it is raining and then suddenly,

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.310
the tree is there.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.310
Now fully grown.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.339
Did you see that?

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:10.850
The moment Alex plants the tree, it pops up in the future.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.140
Kate sees this and she’s confused by it

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.460
because she remembers that the tree not being there

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.080
What does this mean?

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.570
Well, this means that the first theory was wrong.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.780
It seems like this movie has one timeline where the past affects the future.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.260
So if you plant a tree in the past, it grows up, becoming fully-grown in the future

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.500
which makes sense

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.130
But then why does Kate
remember the tree not being there?

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.780
Stay tuned, because we are gonna find out
what’s happening here.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.680
In another letter from Kate, she mentions
that she lost a book: a copy of Persuasion

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.930
by Jane Austen at the train station in the
past.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.790
She asks him if he can get it for her and
so, Alex goes there, and he sees Kate there,

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.800
and she’s with her then boyfriend. Morgan

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.180
She says goodbye, never noticing Alex, and
leaves her book and Alex tries to return it:

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.180
Running after her.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.520
He doesn’t make it in time.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.040
But through the windows of the train, they
make eye contact and this is the first time

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.240
that they have ever seen each other.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.440
After the train station thing, he asks her
out on a date.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.670
Kate asks him to call her on July 10, 2006.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.490
The day she’s writing the letter.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.380
When coincidentally the phone rings!

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.770
And it’s Morgan, Kate’s Ex-boyfriend.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.810
They go out that night and Morgan and Kate
start arguing.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:22.810
Why?

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.540
Because of some random guy that Kate kissed
years ago at some party.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.935
Back in the past, Jack the Dog runs away,
so Alex and Mona

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.980
(a women who is obsessed with Alex)

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.440
chase after the dog.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.560
Alex and Mona find Jack at a house, where
they meet Morgan who at this given moment

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.260
is Katie's boyfriend in 2004.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.200
They have a brief chat and Alex mentions to
Morgan that he’s been living at a lake house.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.220
To which Morgan is like

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.560
"That's very interesting, my girlfriend is really interested in a place near a lake, as well y'know?"

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.160
"Oh and speaking of my girlfriend, we're having a party with her tonight. Why don't you guys come over?"

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.660
"Whose your girlfriend?"

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.320
"Kate."

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.100
So of course, Alex goes with single goal in mind: to find Kate

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.860
In 2006 at the bar, Kate is drinking on her
birthday and here she has a heart to heart

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.000
with her boss.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.020
Kate tells her about Alex and how the
one guy she truly wants to be with

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.520
is the one she never can be with.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.900
Back in the past, Morgan introduces Kate to
Mona and Alex and when Kate goes out for some

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.940
fresh air, Alex follows her.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.110
They have a small talk, and it's a nice little moment between the two of them.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:30.000
After that they share a dance and a few little
kisses under the moonlight until Morgan and

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.720
Mona catch them making out.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.500
As Kate is drinking, it all comes together:
Alex was the guy that Kate had kissed at a

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.880
party years ago.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:44.500
Alex is the guy who Morgan is angry at and she's shocked that she hadn't put it together until now

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.880
Sometime after the party, Alex gets a phone call

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.330
It’s about his dad, Simon.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.980
He goes to a hospital in Chicago to see his
dad where he learns what happened.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.850
His dad had a heart attack, but he’s alive
and Alex stays the night with his dad.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.630
In the future, Kate is going through the archives
where she finds out that that Alex’s dad

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.630
has died.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.580
As Alex goes back to the lake house, he gets
a call, and now he finds out that his dad

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.560
has died and he spends his time at the lake
house grieving but he’s ready to move on.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.980
Sometime later, Alex decides to something
a little crazy: He wants to meet Kate, and

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.540
together they set up a dinner date.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.770
2 years in the future for Alex, and tomorrow
for Kate.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:24.290
They’re preparing, it’s ready, she comes
all dressed up, and orders a glass of wine

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.680
and she waits.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.080
and she waits.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.280
But no one shows up.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.740
There’s no sign of Alex anywhere and Kate
is absolutely devastated.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.600
In her final letter to Alex,

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.740
Kate tells him to stop writing to her and to leave

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.639
her alone because she’s realized that this
relationship just won’t work out.

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:46.240
and Alex argues to try again but she’s not having
it.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.800
Life isn’t a story where you always get
the chance to meet someone, Alex.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.550
Life is random and its fragile

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:57.589
But he continues to write to her waiting for
the chance that maybe, maybe she’s changed

00:08:57.589 --> 00:08:59.899
her mind and she hasn’t.

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:04.880
In the future, Kate starts dating Morgan again,
she’s fully dedicated to moving on and for

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.380
her life’s better.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.779
Soon, Alex himself moves on: after Jack runs
away, Alex puts the letters from Kate in a

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.840
cardboard box that he puts in the attic.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.240
This is same box that Kate mentioned at the
beginning of the film; in her letter.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.829
That wasn’t there when he got there, but
was there because he left it there.

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:28.860
He leaves the lake house, driving over to
Morgan’s office and gives Morgan the keys

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.860
to the Lake House.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.420
After Alex drives off, Jack the dog shows
up and is taken in by Morgan.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.920
Alex moves on from Kate and moves in with
his brother, in a Chicago apartment where

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.939
Alex begins redesigning the lake house.

00:09:39.939 --> 00:09:43.890
2 years later, in 2008, Morgan and Kate live
together

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.480
That Valentine’s Day, in 2008 Kate and Morgan go to meet an architect

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.860
Henry Wyler, Alex’s brother

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:56.180
At same time in 2006, the Wyler brothers leave
their apartment and while walking, Henry reveals

00:09:56.199 --> 00:10:00.699
his plan for Valentine's Day and then Alex
remembers one of Kate’s letters.

00:10:00.699 --> 00:10:06.160
She mentioned that there was something important
that happened on Valentine’s Day in Chicago

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.050
and he rushes back to the Lake house

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:12.139
At the architect’s office, Kate spots a
concept piece of the lakehouse and asks Henry

00:10:12.139 --> 00:10:13.139
who drew it.

00:10:13.139 --> 00:10:14.730
He replies that his brother did.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:15.730
Did you know him?

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.100
She tells him she did and asks if there's
any way she can get in touch with him.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:24.209
And we find out that he died 2 years ago,
on Valentine’s Day, in an accident at Daley

00:10:24.209 --> 00:10:25.209
Plaza.

00:10:25.209 --> 00:10:29.319
Kate remembers what happened 2 years ago on
Valentines Day: the bus crash!

00:10:29.319 --> 00:10:33.949
So, Kate rushes to the lake house hoping to
warn him not to leave the lake house today

00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:38.790
because Kate figures out that it was Alex
who died that day in 2006.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.420
Kate frantically writes one final letter:
confessing her love for Alex and begging him

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.209
to stay away; don’t go.

00:10:44.209 --> 00:10:47.199
Wait 2 years and meet her at the lakehouse, please.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.100
So just to be clear: Alex is dead.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.780
He’s been dead since 2006.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:57.540
That’s why he didn’t call her and why
he wasn’t at the dinner date: he was dead

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:01.470
the whole time but we’re gonna
see something that changes our understanding

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.420
of how time works in this movie.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.230
So stick around.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.850
Alex goes to the attic, opening the box full
of letters that she sent.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.870
He’s looking for the last letter that she
ever sent to him.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.660
Because in that letter Kate mentions that

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.900
she was at Daley Plaza in 2006 on Valentine's Day

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.899
He knows where Kate is now and this might
be his chance meet her.

00:11:20.899 --> 00:11:26.040
Alex goes to the plaza and when he sees Kate,
he starts to cross the road as the bus starts

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.589
moving.

00:11:27.589 --> 00:11:28.589
As for Kate?

00:11:28.589 --> 00:11:31.100
She’s crying and hoping that he got the
letter in time.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.639
Hoping that he’s still alive.

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:38.329
And then we see a familiar truck and a man
exits: it’s Alex!

00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:40.699
He rushes out to to hold her in his arms and
kiss her.

00:11:40.699 --> 00:11:45.649
They are finally reunited, and the movies
ends with them arm-in-arm, walking into the

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:46.649
lake house.

00:11:46.649 --> 00:11:48.880
You’re probably wondering what
just happened, right?

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.300
If Alex was the man who died on Valentine’s
Day, how come he's still alive in the end?

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.120
The only thing that makes sense to me is that
Alex and Kate can change history

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.540
and when they do so, they 'jump' timelines.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.700
This is most obvious at the end

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.860
where Kate writes the letter that saves Alex's life

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.200
the letter causes both of them to jump to a timeline

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.640
where Alex never died and

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.960
in this new timeline: Alex lives, waits 2
years, and then goes to the lake house.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.670
For him: he never died.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.670
For Kate?

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:19.460
She remembers that he did which is why she’s waiting at the lake house

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.440
Her letter changed the timelines for both of them

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.740
and she’s waiting for the changes to take effect.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.605
So I've given you 3 theories, right?

00:12:25.605 --> 00:12:29.700
And believe conclusively that this movie uses multiple timelines to explain

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.860
how time travel works. But that's just what I think,

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.020
I really want to know what you guys think so leave your ideas and theories in the comments down below

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.160
With that being said, thank you so much for
watching.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.520
Ladies and gentlemen.
