in happiness david seeks consultation from ephraim&nbsp;
they are both at a firing range when he breaks the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.200
news ephraim is confident that the issue will&nbsp;
be resolved smoothly they decide to ship the&nbsp;&nbsp;

berettas to jordan and from there it can make its&nbsp;
way to the u.s military base his and david host a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.160
small dinner party with their friends one of them&nbsp;
warns david about being affiliated with ephraim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.600
saying that he is unstable suddenly ephram storms&nbsp;
to their house because david did not pick up his&nbsp;&nbsp;

of an urgent matter ephraim tells him that their&nbsp;
weapons were seized in jordan by the customs the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.640
frustrated captain santos calls that he wants to&nbsp;
nullify their contract this means the end for them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.520
ephraim tries to get emotional with captain santos&nbsp;
but he hangs up on him while they come up with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.160
solution is overhears their conversation and gets&nbsp;
mad at david for lying to her and being an arms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.800
dealer david defends the business saying that they&nbsp;
are just middlemen and what they do is perfectly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.680
legal ephram interrupts them and informs david&nbsp;
that they should fly to jordan as soon as possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.040
they arrive to jordan and get straight to&nbsp;
business david rarely gets to travel so he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.680
takes split seconds to glance at the city they&nbsp;
meet with other smugglers to get help in getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.720
permits to transport the weapons a kid helps&nbsp;
them by being a translator in their negotiations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.600
ephraim bribes the locals 1 400 to&nbsp;
release the shipment on their behalf&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.080
for three days they hear nothing from the&nbsp;
smugglers and their business is running on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.040
the word of an eleven-year-old translator ephraim&nbsp;
and david thinks that the smugglers rip them off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.800
while discussing about it they receive a call and&nbsp;
the plan goes on they are provided with a driver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.920
named marlboro to transport them in the cargo&nbsp;
into iraq the trio starts their journey with their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.880
truck loaded with high-end weapons they drive&nbsp;
at night which according to their driver is much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.800
safer they come across border patrol officers who&nbsp;
interrogate them the soldiers point guns at them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.840
but they instantly calm down and let them go when&nbsp;
marlboro bribes them with cigarettes david feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.880
so much different than what he did months ago as&nbsp;
a massage therapist and rethinks his life choices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.600
they stop at a gas station in fallujah where&nbsp;
david wakes up and doesn't see marlboro&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.160
he checks if he is inside the building but he&nbsp;
finds a dead body at the abandoned place instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.280
he rushes to the truck to wake ephram up and&nbsp;
inform him about the dead body ephraim says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:29.120
it is normal to see that in a war zone at the&nbsp;
moment marlboro is siphoning gas for its usage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.680
david receives a call from iz who appears to&nbsp;
forgive david for lying to her even though she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.880
is highly bothered by it meanwhile he sees a&nbsp;
group of vans approaching with men firing guns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:45.200
at them david panics so he honks the horn to alert&nbsp;
ephram and marlboro he struggles to start the car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.320
but it eventually accelerates thinking that he&nbsp;
will get left behind marlboro runs after the truck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.680
and loads it with gas as they escape the trio is&nbsp;
saved when a u.s chopper comes to their rescue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.760
forcing the mercenaries to stop shooting&nbsp;
they excitedly shout in celebration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.960
they arrive safely at the military base where&nbsp;
captain santos is impressed that they survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.640
the infamous triangle of death they ask a soldier&nbsp;
to snap a picture of them for remembrance purposes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.880
they head to the accounting department of the base&nbsp;
where bundles of cash surround the room which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.840
approximately 12 billion dollars the agency&nbsp;
pays them a large sum of money amounting to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.960
2.8 million dollars then they are escorted by&nbsp;
the military to the airport and leave baghdad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.320
the company lands bigger and more money-making&nbsp;
deals as days go by they both buy matching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.440
expensive cars and luxurious apartments their&nbsp;
lives seem to go as planned even better that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.840
feels like a dream david even burns all the bed&nbsp;
sheets which was a failed venture in the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.040
ralph throws a celebration because of big&nbsp;
returns in his investment in the company&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.400
he even increases his original investment by&nbsp;
10 million dollars a expands and employs more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.840
people to work with as they upgrade their&nbsp;
office to a more professional location&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.800
at this point they optimize all the facets&nbsp;
of the business to bring it to the next level&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:05.200
david is now a father to baby ella he balances&nbsp;
the life of being an arms dealer and a father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.920
the company eyes on a chance at the afghan deal&nbsp;
which will be their most significant so far&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:15.200
the u.s government posts a massive order worth&nbsp;
300 million dollars which requires 100 million&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:21.840
rounds of ak-47 ammunition and net a 100 million&nbsp;
profit if pursued this will be a's biggest deal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.720
david and ephraim head to vegas x which is&nbsp;
a convention for the latest warfare weapons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.160
although a's name is not that famous the duo&nbsp;
sees this as an advantage they put up a more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.480
professional front but they slowly lose hope&nbsp;
because being part of the afghan deal means that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.520
they should reshape the company at the casino&nbsp;
david encounters the legendary henry gerard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.520
he calls ephrem to accompany them for drinks they&nbsp;
all meet each other and have a quick meeting about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:53.280
access to massive unused weapon depots in albania&nbsp;
henry has all the supplies to fulfill a's afghan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.880
deal which gives them a great chance for the price&nbsp;
henry sells the ammunition at 10 cents per round&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.000
which is an ideal price for a ephram agrees&nbsp;
despite his friends discomfort with working with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.320
man on a watch list he continues to persuade david&nbsp;
like he always does but he still seems unconvinced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.720
the following morning they sealed the deal but&nbsp;
they want to see the merchandise on site before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.760
they officially work with henry they travel to&nbsp;
albania to secure the ammunition and check if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.320
the deal is legitimate a driver brings them to the&nbsp;
site where a group of soldiers welcomes them with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.360
a banner and they continue to tour them around&nbsp;
the warehouse it is filled with piles of weapons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.720
both old and new which is a storage for the&nbsp;
albanian army they see the containers of bullets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:40.640
totaling to 126 million rounds david and ephraim&nbsp;
are amazed by the abundance of it in the warehouse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.120
they open a case of 40-year-old bullets&nbsp;
and ephram impulsively makes the deal after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.400
testing the ammunitions outside they make the&nbsp;
bid to the us military and within five months&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.680
they land it successfully ephraim breaks the&nbsp;
news to david while having a picnic by the beach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.640
they embrace each other out of excitement to&nbsp;
pass all government processes they fabricate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.040
a's accounting going back three years they&nbsp;
meet with high-ranking officials to finalize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.560
the deal in illinois as they negotiate&nbsp;
the duo is overconfident about their offer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.360
the board reveals to them that their prices were&nbsp;
meager compared to their competitors efrem learns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.080
they severely underbid their competitors by 53&nbsp;
million dollars causing him to be in a state&nbsp;&nbsp;

of rage at home is becomes extremely tired of&nbsp;
david's lies about his job and dirty deals the&nbsp;&nbsp;

tension in their relationship starts to surface&nbsp;

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.320
she gets tired of being worried about david and&nbsp;
his whereabouts when he goes on a business trip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:42.160
david persuades her to stay but she refuses after&nbsp;
finding bundles of cash hidden around the house in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.040
their main office ephram uses drugs more often the&nbsp;

miami preparing the shipment in albania david&nbsp;
discovers that all the rounds originated from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.120
china this stems from a problem because chinese&nbsp;
ammunitions are illegal to a u.s embargo&nbsp;&nbsp;

concern and leaves them to deal with the issue&nbsp;
