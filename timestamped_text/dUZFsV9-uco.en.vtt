This is Movie Shortens.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.250
Follow us today to the movie titled: Lifechanger.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.760
Be aware, there are spoilers!

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.990
At a hotel room, Emily wakes up from a hangover.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.849
There is a dry corpse next to her, but Emily
stays calm with it.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.940
She looks around her body and notices a knife
wound in the stomach.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.749
Just then, she chops the body in pieces and
puts them in some garbage bags.

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:24.730
Emily brings them to a local barn.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.609
These bags are then burnt down.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.060
She then buries the ash in a hole that she
dug before.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.149
At a cafe, Emily practices introducing her
name and learns about herself.

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.170
While having a smoke at home, Emily is interrupted
by James, her boyfriend.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.380
He confronts where she has been and why she
left him no texts for three days.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.440
He had to call the police to find her.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.470
Now that Emily has come back, James needs
to inform the police.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.719
Knowing that the police may bring more troubles,
Emily tries to seduce James, attempting to

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:53.910
distract him.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.690
However, James refuses her and insists on
calling the cops.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.370
Emily stabs him in the neck right away with
a cork.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.010
His body is wrapped up and hidden in the basement.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.700
Emily quickly cleans up the blood on the floor.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.863
Emily then intakes antibiotics and becomes
deep in thought.

00:01:07.863 --> 00:01:12.520
The following day, Emily is disappointed knowing
that her body begins to rot.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.110
She doesn’t expect the rot would appear
that early.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.640
Later, a detective named Ransone knocks on
the door.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.360
Seeing Emily at home, Ransone is surprised.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.070
He asks to meet with James, but Emily says
he’s not with her.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.630
Emily then invites Rasone in for a coffee.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.380
When Emily sits next to Ransone, she suddenly
holds his hands tight.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.250
Somehow, his body is sucked dry and the bones
are cracking.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.680
Just then, Emily has turned into Ransone.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.880
To get rid of the dry corpse, Ransone breaks
it into pieces with a hammer.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.400
He then pours the petrol around the house.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.890
Ranson runs into a delivery man at the front
door.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.140
He takes the food without paying the man.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.850
The delivery man warns Ransone that the house
is on fire but he just drives off the road.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.490
On the way, Ransone reveals that he needs
to rely on antibiotics to stop the infected

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.910
tissues and cocaine to delay the rotting.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.110
He passes by a drug dealer and takes some
drugs for himself.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.940
Just after, Ransone snorts all of them.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.060
Getting out of the car, Ransone pats a dog
as if they were friends long ago.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.280
He enters a bar and looks for someone.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.200
As he sees a young woman sitting alone, Ranson
orders a Gin and Tonic, asking the woman if

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.200
she wants one.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.319
The woman is very surprised that Ranson knows
her only favourite drink.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.450
Ranson makes jokes that he is a psychic.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.590
The woman is Julia, and Ransone meant to see
her in the bar at the beginning.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.719
The two spend the night talking and drinking
with so much fun.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.159
While kissing, Ransone encounters acute pain
in the stomach.

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.269
He scares Julia away right after that.

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.420
It turns out Emily’s wound remains on this
new body.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.689
This never happened to him before.

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.349
He manages to walk along the street while
holding the severe injury.

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.670
Seeing a couple talking in the car, Ransone,
using the police badge, orders the woman to

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.930
get out.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.530
Ranson then tells the man, who is Sam, that
he has to kill him or he’ll die.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.090
Sam fights with Ranson in the car, leaving
his fate unsure.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.329
Later at night, Sam appears and takes a bag
out of the car.

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.299
While using the hammer to destroy the corpse
inside, his wife, Mary calls in.

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.510
He returns home with her after that.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.010
However, the two don't get along, revealing
an unhappy relationship.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.260
The following day, Sam is still painful in
the stomach just like Ransone experienced

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.260
last night.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.370
He refuses to join the two children and Mary
for family breakfast, saying that he has to

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.959
work early today.

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.290
Arriving at work, Sam hits on the receptionist
named Rachel, who was also the woman in the

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.150
car with him last night.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.530
It reveals Sam tried to harass her, but Ransone
arrived in time and saved her.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.280
Sam begins his day as a dentist as usual.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.790
At lunch time, Sam comes across Julia again.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.060
He immediately gets in a taxi and asks to
follow Julia.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.430
As the driver is a woman, she refuses his
request, saying stalking is inappropriate

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.430
and illegal.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.019
Helpless, Sam gets out of the taxi.

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.840
He heads to the cinema and enjoys fun time
alone.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.659
He returns home and joins his family for dinner.

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.700
Seeing the children and Mary have some jokes,
Sam only thinks about his original family

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.239
in the past before he changed from one to
another body over years.

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.879
He leaves the house and sits at the same bar.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.790
As he predicted, Julia comes and talks to
him.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.980
She tells him that she saw him last night
with a young girl.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.480
Sam admits that his marriage is in trouble
and he just wants to have some new fun.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.140
Julia reveals that she was married and had
a son.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.330
Their boy, Taylor, died from severe illness
when he was only three.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.220
This put a strain on their relationship for
a long time.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.090
One night, her husband surprised her with
a romantic night.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.570
Julia thought it would be a good chance for
the two to make up after everything.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.840
The day after, Julia woke up and her husband
vanished without any trace.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.720
She never gets to meet him again.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.770
Seeing Julia cry, Sam buys her another drink,
trying to comfort her.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.140
In the toilet, Sam finds that his body begins
to rot.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.970
He says goodbye to Julia and goes to a motel
alone.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.760
He intakes some coke again.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.760
As he wakes up, he realizes the blisters appear
half of his body.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.870
He must seek out a new host in order to aid
him on a mission of survival as soon as possible.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.690
He calls Rachel saying that he does not feel
so well.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.470
He wants to apologize to Rachel about last
night.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.480
Rachel shows up at the motel.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.440
She reluctantly knocks on the door.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.970
Before entering, she warns her boss that she’ll
leave if he did the same thing as last night.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.200
Rachel sees Sam lying on the bed and has no
reaction.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.590
She slowly approaches to check on him.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.100
Within several minutes, Sam is now turned
to Rachel’s body.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.290
She takes some antibiotics and looks at the
sucked corpse on the bed.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.950
The following day, Rachel collects the bags
and burns them down at the barn, exactly as

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.680
what Emily did earlier.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.300
Rachel is caught by a woman.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.540
She quickly drives off to the workplace and
takes some more antibiotics jars.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.300
Coming home, Rachel intakes more pills, hoping
to last longer in this new host body.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.710
At night, she drives to the bar again and
pats the dog friend.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.630
Rachel enters the bar and approaches Julia
right away.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.690
Julia can recognize Rachel from the night
she was with Sam.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.860
Julia says that she has a good memory of faces,
even random ones.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.110
The two have so much in common, and it brings
them to a very fun lady night.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.060
Julia then gives Rachel her card so she can
find and talk to her anytime.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.090
Later, Rachel ignores a man who tries to hit
on her and eyes on Julia, who meets up with

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.090
an artist man in the bar.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.690
Just then, Rachel sees her on TV for being
the main suspect of the breaking in the barn.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.250
Rachel leaves the bar with the talkative man.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.750
The two have some fun and coke after that.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.180
As the man gets high and turns violent, Rachel
fights him back.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.690
She then chases and stabs him to death.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.640
Seeing the cops arrive at the building, Rachel
immediately runs away.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.990
She ends up hiding in an abandoned house and
stays overnight there.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.000
The next morning, Rachel wakes up and sees
the skin rotten.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.680
However, she needs to spy on Julia and the
man in the bar last night.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.920
When the two of them say goodbye, Rachel follows
the man to his house.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.720
Jealous, Rachel then shows up at the man’s
door and soon hosts inside the man.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.590
He is Robert, a writer.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.390
Next, Robert makes a phone call and confesses
his feelings to Julia.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.320
He wants to see her again at Julia’s place
tonight.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.110
That night, the two set up a very romantic
date.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.380
Julia admits that there is something very
familiar about Robert, but she can't explain.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.330
As the two have some fun, Julia touches on
Robert’s wound, which remains from his previous

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.330
hosts.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.800
He ignores it and brings her to a passionate
night, which Robert has waited for so long.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.750
The two later fall in love and become a loving
couple.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.730
Robert later returns to his house and handles
the body that he hid earlier.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:32.270
One morning, Julia sees the news about the
mysterious death of six people in town.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.440
Robert wants to change the channel, advising
Julia not to watch this depressing news.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.990
She becomes emotionals and tells Robert that
they are strangely ones that she talked to

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.990
in the bar.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.130
Robert embraces and tells Julia that he won’t
let anything bad happen to her.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.440
At night, Robert sees blisters on his hand
and suddenly has pain in the abdomen again.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.830
A moment later, he walks out and decides to
confess everything to Julia.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.740
He tells Julia that he is Drew, a life changer.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.300
He doesn’t know what he is and if there
are more in the world like him.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.270
What he does know is that he accidentally
took over his mother’s body, thus killing

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.800
her and also any life lessons she may have
imparted since 1954.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.160
He never cares for the people’s lives he
destroys.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.650
It’s a simple matter of kill-or-die.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:17.680
Each time he drains life from someone, he
takes everything they have.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.950
Julia thinks Robert is out of mind and wants
to leave him.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:25.200
Drew reveals that Julia’s husband, who abandoned
her in the past, is actually him.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.480
Although he keeps changing to other people,
his love for her never changes.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.880
Julia freaks out at what Drew just said.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.669
She draws a taser and attacks Drew on the
floor.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:38.729
Drew holds Julia’s hands to stop her and
accidentally drains her body.

00:08:38.729 --> 00:08:43.709
In the last scene, Drew, who is now Julia,
cries over her dry body, saying sorry for

00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:45.230
what he has done.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:50.279
Several days later, Drew finally accepts his
fate and literally lays down to die.

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:52.420
Strangely enough, he is instead reborn.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.260
He finds himself in the shape of a fully grey-haired
man.
