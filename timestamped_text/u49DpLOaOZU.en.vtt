00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.390
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.560
Today I'm going to explain a horror and thriller
film called “The Belko Experiment."

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.999
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:07.999
Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:11.920
&nbsp;
In the busy streets of Bogota, Mike Milch,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.370
an employee of Belko Industries, makes his
way to work after being stopped by a vendor

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.060
who sells handmade dolls.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.720
To drive the vendor away, he buys one from
him.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.160
Also on the way, his workmate Barry Norris
arrives at the headquarters of the company

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.880
in Bogota, Colombia.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.789
Belko is a nonprofit organization that facilitates
American companies in South America in the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.830
hiring of American workers.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.830
A stricter group of security replaces the
company’s Colombian guards, who conduct

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.830
the inspection that day.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.780
The unfamiliar guard asks Barry to hand over
his I.D., to which he abides.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.180
Then the guard checks the trunk of his car
to continue security measures when a local

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.120
employee from behind is sent home.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.390
Barry asks about it, but the guard completely
ignores him.&nbsp;

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.850
&nbsp;
After the strict inspection that morning,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.980
the ones who got through it go about their
workday.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.630
The office is just like any other; employees
are assigned in sections, and the busy hours

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.899
start as usual.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.239
A new employee in the company named Dany Wilkins
starts her first day, so Vince, a higher executive,

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.250
gives her a brief walk-through of the company.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.339
He also asks Dany if she has been to the doctor
to have a tracker implanted in the base of

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.420
her skull.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.250
All employees have trackers placed in their
heads for the higher executives to assure

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.049
their safety and monitor them due to the high
number of kidnappings in Colombia.

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.850
After their short meeting, Vince officially
welcomes her to the company.&nbsp;

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.720
&nbsp;
In the office, an employee named Leandra Florez

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.840
is constantly harassed by Wendell Dukes, their
workmate, who always makes her uncomfortable.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.659
That day, he stares at her while she works
at her station; she notices him and messages

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.310
him to stop staring.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.290
Before her mood worsens, Mike makes her laugh
by showing her the doll he bought earlier

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.590
and displaying it on her desk as a gift.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.299
The two are currently in a relationship, as
Leandra is in the process of getting divorced.&nbsp;

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.670
&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Dany finds extreme pressure in

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.880
the company, given that she is a new member.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.030
The supervisor gives her an excessive workload
which shocks her.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.100
After the supervisor leaves, she becomes acquainted
with Roberto and Leota, who have been employees

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.180
at Belko.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.729
They also introduce her to Bradley, who is
a good-looking workmate of theirs.

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.310
Before entering his office, Mike talks to
Terry, another colleague, who informs him

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.229
that the workplace isn’t as packed because
the local workers were sent home.

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.210
Weirded by it, Mike notices a guard with heavy
equipment from his office window.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.070
He is curious to find the reason for the security
replacement, so he calls Evan Smith, the head

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.760
security guard who also has no idea behind
it.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.840
Out of nowhere, a voice on the intercom asks
all employees to lend him their attention.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.950
The voice announces that there are currently
80 employees inside the building and that

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.370
in 8 hours, most of them will be dead.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.030
According to him, their chances of survival
will increase if they follow his orders.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.010
Mixed emotions are felt by people in the office,
as some think it is some prank, and to some,

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.250
it is disturbing.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.440
The first task that the voice says is to “murder
any two of your fellow employees within the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.480
next half hour, how they are killed or how
they are chosen to be killed is of no consequence.”

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.080
The voice adds that they will face repercussions
if there are no two dead bodies in the next

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.129
30 minutes.

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.620
As a higher executive, Brent heads to the
control room to check who is responsible for

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.989
the announcement but finds that the room is
empty.

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.531
In a slight panic, one of the employees says
that all the telephone lines are dead, but

00:02:56.531 --> 00:02:58.090
Barry helps the others calm down.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.771
At Mike’s section, he instructs his subordinates
to evacuate the floor calmly, but Keith, one

00:03:03.771 --> 00:03:06.959
of the employees, assumes that the announcement
is just a practical company prank.

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:07.959
Mike says that it is possible, but for safety
measures, they should still leave the floor.

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.010
As one employee makes her way to the elevator,
Mike tells her to take the stairs instead

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.190
because it would be less risky.&nbsp;

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.170
&nbsp;
A woman in the lobby tries to run outside

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.430
of fear, but metal enclosures appear and cover
the whole building.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.970
Sunlight is blocked, and the entire building
turns slightly dim as the employees realize

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.569
that something more serious is going on.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.569
Terry tries to contact the police, but the
signal is also cut off, leaving them more

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:24.569
scared.

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.950
At the moment, Belko looks more like a prison
than an office building; the once lively working

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.519
space has become a secluded and dangerous
place.

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.540
All of the employees gather in the lobby,
where Evan is currently receiving all the

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.340
complaints and blame, but he repeatedly says
that he is just as clueless as they are.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.410
Two maintenance men, Bud and Lonny, make their
way to the lobby as well, where Mike asks

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.620
them if it is possible to cut through the
metal enclosures, to which he replies that

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.870
they could give it a try.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.630
Meanwhile, Barry enters the lobby, and in
an attempt to calm everyone down, he says

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.790
that the building is safe and that someone
is having fun playing a prank.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.849
Keith and his friends make their way to the
roof to know more about the situation, where

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.659
they see Marty and his friends smoking, completely
unbothered by the situation.

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.079
The annoyed Leandra warns them about the company
finding out, while Keith realizes that the

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.020
building is in the middle of nowhere, surrounded
by greens and animals.&nbsp;

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.810
&nbsp;
Bud and Lonny try to melt the metal back in

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.370
the lobby, but they are unsuccessful at it;
they even have difficulty identifying what

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.880
kind of metal it is.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.950
In the corner of the room, Mike expresses
his concerns to Barry and Wendell about the

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.080
situation not being a prank but a rather dangerous
one.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.310
According to him, the cell signal, the metal
walls, and the new guards from that morning

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.220
are signs that they are being set up.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.440
Barry says that his conspiracy will cause
further panic and continues to dismiss his

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.440
thoughts.&nbsp;

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.410
&nbsp;
On the rooftop, the group spots a guard by

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.160
the entrance, and they try to call his attention
to ask for help.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.790
However, the guard is completely unbothered
by their calls for help and continues to sip

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.550
his drink in a sinister way.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.940
Marty approaches them to say that they should
chill and relax because it may be a psychological

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.480
test conducted by the company.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.160
As he speaks, one of his friends feels a painful
sensation in her head, and in a split second,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.540
her head explodes, causing her instant death.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.780
The sight of it puts everyone in a state of
panic, and Marty realizes that he should be

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.780
scared indeed.&nbsp;

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.410
&nbsp;
In the lobby, another employee explodes before

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.730
a man shouts that someone is shooting at them.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.470
All the other unharmed employees take cover
and hide in the rooms after another one explodes.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.630
In an attempt to be safer, some even take
the elevator.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.230
Puzzled by the situation, Barry examines one
of the dead bodies and discovers that bullets

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.410
are not the cause of the deaths but an explosion
from inside their heads.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.350
Mike thinks that the trackers implanted in
their heads are explosives that could be used

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.540
to control them.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.890
Mike storms to the bathroom to try and cut
his using a box cutter, only for the voice

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.070
to speak and command him to stop trying to
take it out, or they will detonate it on their

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.070
own.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.390
All bloody, Mike stops at the last second
as Leandra begs him to stop.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.190
Mike’s secretary, Peggy, stitches up his
wounds while Wendell follows Leandra to the

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.940
kitchen to annoy her again.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.800
He acts in a predatory manner, which she is
sick of, making her walk away.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.160
While hiding in a room, Terry and another
employee find hidden cameras in the frame

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.350
and ceiling, realizing that the ones responsible
for the scheme have been watching them way

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.350
before.&nbsp;

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.270
&nbsp;
A concerned Evan sits by the lobby when Barry

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.500
approaches him to hand him a bottle of water.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.600
He tries to talk his way for Evan to hand
him the keys to the armory, where guards keep

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.090
their weapons.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.590
Completely aware of his intentions, Evan refuses
to give Barry any authority to enter the armory

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.880
despite being his boss.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.150
Meanwhile, Dany hides in the basement when
Bud and Lonny make their way down to further

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.480
inspections on how they could control the
power.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.010
The voice communicates again through the intercom,
reminding everyone that the game is serious,

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.090
and it is up to them to follow or not, at
the expense of their lives.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.410
It further says that cameras should not be
dismantled, and the trackers should remain

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.580
in their heads.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.540
If any of them break the rules, their life
will end abruptly.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.060
Seventy-six employees remain alive at the
moment.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.080
According to the voice, it is demanded that
the employees kill 30 among them within two

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.500
hours through any means necessary, or 60 will
be killed.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.400
Everyone is unsafe at the moment, and they
all begin to panic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.440
&nbsp;
In the basement, Lonny sobs out of fear, and

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.650
as Bud tries to approach and comfort him,
he pushes him away, thinking that Bud would

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:39.650
hurt him.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.340
He begins to get paranoid as the game progresses,
causing him to doubt his friend.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.100
In the company kitchen, Wendell gathers sharp
weapons, which causes a commotion among the

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.100
group.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.400
It pauses when Barry enters the room to try
and control the situation, but they continue

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.330
to grab the knife and walk away.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.150
Back in the basement, Lonny is freaking out
as Bud tries to assure him that they will

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.440
stick together.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.840
Bud gets too close to him, and Lonny reacts
by hitting Bud in the head with a wrench,

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.330
leaving a massive dent in Bud's head as he
dies gradually.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.870
Unknowingly, Dany witnesses the murder of
Bud as Lonny cries beside him out of regret.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.500
Moments later,&nbsp; Lonny notices Dany from a
distance and tries to stop her from telling

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.770
anyone, so he grabs her, and in the act of
self-defense, she kicks herself back, which

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.780
causes Lonny to hit his head into a metal
bar, killing him.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.470
Dany looks at him in horror but runs away
after realizing what she has done.&nbsp;

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.080
&nbsp;
Multiple employees argue on which course of

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.810
action to take in the cafeteria, causing them
to split into two factions.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.470
One is led by Mike, who thinks that there
should be no killings, and one led by Barry,

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.650
who wishes to follow the directions to save
himself from being detonated.&nbsp;

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:40.740
The group consists of him, Terry, and two
other employees: Antonio and Bradley.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.090
The four of them use a blowtorch to burn off
the lock of the armory to have access to weapons

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.250
when Mike, Leandra, and Evan find out about
their plan.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.300
They try to stop Barry’s group, but they
are confident of getting a hold of the weapons.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.460
Desperate to put an end to their plan, Evan
takes out a gun and points it at the group,

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.390
but he relents and lets them continue.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:00.440
Mike takes Evan's gun and shoots the blowtorch
tank before he leaves with Leandra and Evan.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.770
It triggers the group to avenge Mike for stopping
their evil plan.&nbsp;

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.940
&nbsp;
In a tight race with time, Mike’s group

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.900
tries to hang banners from the roof to let
people outside know that they are being held

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:08.900
hostage.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.810
However, guards stationed at the entrance
shoot at them mercilessly, but they continue

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.930
their attempt.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.690
Keith is hurt in the process as one of the
bullets hits his hand.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.910
The voice demands them to stop hanging up
signs, or their explosives will go off.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.340
Determined to get help, Mike continues to
put another banner, but other employees restrain

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.370
him from straying him away from harm.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.680
They eventually give up and go back inside;
Mike tells Leandra that the government might

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.530
be behind the killings, but she assures him
that it is not.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.780
While they make their way down, Barry’s
group ambushes the group in the stairway,

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.280
pushing Mike and killing Evan, giving them
a chance to take his keys to the armory.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.820
They gather weapons before selecting people
and putting them all in one common area.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.140
The employees hiding in the basement even
get captured by Bradley; he sees Dany hiding

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.820
in one corner but lets her stay there out
of sympathy.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:48.950
She feels relieved more than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.590
&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Mike gains consciousness and sees

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.950
poor Evan, who has now bled to death.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.610
Just as he gets up, Wendell captures and brings
him to the lobby along with the others.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.690
Barry and his group begin to group people
according to whether or not they have kids

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.760
or are over the age of 60.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.990
Everyone fears the situation; Terry tries
to talk to Barry, but he is determined to

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.300
kill thirty people as they are down to 20
minutes before the deadline.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.340
He randomly picks people to be executed, and
when one man refuses, Wendell shoots him three

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.340
times, causing a big commotion.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.550
The noise from the lobby alarms Dany, urging
her to do something to help her friends upstairs.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.880
She walks along a hallway, where a staircase
leads to the lobby.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.170
After seeing the situation upstairs, she goes
back to the basement, which serves as her

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:27.170
safe space.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.030
&nbsp;
Barry chooses Mike to be part of the ones

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.720
they would execute; he makes them all kneel
facing the wall as Antonio puts music on the

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.720
radio.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.260
He shoots the people one by one as Wendell
keeps track of the number of lives taken.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.590
Just as Mike is about to get shot, Dany shuts
down the power, causing the lights to turn

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:41.590
off.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.880
The employees quickly run for cover as Barry
and his group start firing, killing several

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.250
more people.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.880
Inside an elevator, Roberto tries to climb
on the elevator shaft; upon the doors being

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.280
opened, he sees Dany alone, so he calls her
for them to team up.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.390
The whole building is in complete chaos, as
everyone is desperate to survive.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.390
For some time, they forget that they are in
a game because their colleagues are hunting

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.390
them down.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.490
Bradley gets ganged up by a group of workers
in the basement, while Antonio gets stabbed

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.870
by Peggy in a brawl by the staircase.&nbsp;

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.580
&nbsp;
In a disturbing tone, the voice announces

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.320
that only 29 people are killed, which means
that they are short with one life, and in

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.330
two minutes, 30 more will die.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.940
Barry and his group scour through the rooms
to kill one more.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.320
Terry looks for someone he could shoot down;
little does he know, Leandra is hiding under

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.440
a table.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.120
When he passes by, she uses a knife to cut
his leg, causing him to accidentally let go

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.120
of his weapon.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.730
Ready to beat him to death, she stops after
his pleas for her to spare him.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.460
Unfortunately, the voice announces that the
time is over and that 31 employees will now

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.640
be eliminated.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.950
To Leandra’s horror, she witnesses Terry
explode while other employees start to die

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.570
one by one as well.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:39.110
Their faces are filled with fear and uncertainty,
as they are left with no choice but to hope

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.180
for their safety.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.250
In a control room, a person operates a machine
that controls who gets to live and who dies,

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.380
which means that their fate lies in a single
button that has their name.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:51.510
As people explode, Marty stands still, saying
that everything is just a product of his imagination,

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.510
and cries.&nbsp;

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.730
&nbsp;
After the random selection, the explosions

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.040
stop, and the voice continues to let the surviving
players know that the last stage of the game

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.060
will start.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.610
Whoever has killed the most people will be
allowed to live; the tally is announced: Barry

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.810
with 11 kills, Wendell with seven kills, Vince
and Dany with one kill each.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.610
With this, Barry’s group continues to hunt
down employees and start killing them off.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.990
Barry’s secretary tries to seduce him in
the lobby just so she could be saved, but

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.110
instead of comforting her, Barry breaks her
neck instead after saying that he would not

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.560
waste a bullet on her.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.910
He then enters the elevator, where Dany and
Roberto are hiding.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:24.230
After noticing their voices, he shoots in
their direction but misses.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.920
Barry presses a button to go to the top floor;
Dany manages to jump out of the shaft, but

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.360
the poor Roberto gets left behind and is crushed
to death in his attempt to escape.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.630
This causes the elevator to shut down, which
entraps Barry inside.&nbsp;

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.480
&nbsp;
Leandra finds collecting the un-exploded trackers

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.050
from the heads of people who have died by
other methods.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.120
They tell her that they plan to use them to
blow up the wall, which she thinks is a good

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.120
idea.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.490
She uses another intercom to let Mike, who
is hiding in a locked office, know that she

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.670
needs him and that she is on the first floor.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:53.529
Mike decides to come to Leandra’s rescue;
as he comes downstairs, he finds Liezl, a

00:11:53.529 --> 00:11:55.890
cafeteria lady, and brings her with him.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.510
Moments after, Leandra finds Wendell butchering
an employee, which triggers her to kill him

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.860
after months of him harassing her in the office.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.940
Unfortunately, Marty and his friend get shot
after trying to help Leandra reach Wendell.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:11.000
She manages to grab the ax and kill him brutally,
leaving the final six survivors: Vince, Mike,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.920
Barry, Dany, Leandra, and Liezl.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.680
When Leandra and Mike reunite, she shows him
the explosives that Marty has collected, but

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.160
out of nowhere, Liezl gets burned to death
after Vince throws a bottle of lit gasoline

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.160
on her.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.150
The two run away after being chased by two
men, but in the process, Leandra gets shot.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.570
Barry shoots Vince and Dany, who just got
out of the elevator shaft, to keep up with

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:30.570
his tally.&nbsp;

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.720
&nbsp;
With her dying breath, Leandra proclaims her

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.300
love to Mike after he brings her to an empty
room.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.240
She falls unconscious, which causes Mike to
be in a fit of rage.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.440
He starts a brutal fight with Barry, in which
Barry gets the better of him at first.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.100
After some time, Mike fends Barry off using
a tape dispenser, which ends in Mike bludgeoning

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.310
Barry to an awful death.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.280
He looks at him with hate and lands his final
hits, making him the sole survivor.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.370
The voice announces him as the winner, and
two guards bring him out after they unseal

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:55.370
the building.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.529
Mike’s body is about to give up on him,
but the two guards force him to enter a hangar

00:12:58.529 --> 00:12:59.980
next to the building.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.170
In there, he comes face to face with the owner
of the voice, who says that they're part of

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.690
an international organization that studies
human behavior unfettered by conventional

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:07.690
concepts.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.670
As he and his colleagues begin to interview
Mike about his emotional and mental state

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:15.020
after the experiment, Mike notices a panel
of switches corresponding to the eighty employees.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.260
He then reveals to the voice that he planted
the trackers that Marty collected on the guards

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.890
and the owner of the voice, which means that
they could explode.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.850
Quickly, Mike runs to flips every remaining
active switch except his own, making the trackers

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:25.850
explode.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:26.850
The guards get killed, and the owner of the
voice gets wounded before Mike grabs a gun

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:27.850
and kills the remaining scientists.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.090
The owner of the voice attempts to appeal
to his moral beliefs, but Mike kills him out

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.140
of anger.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.360
In a state of shock, he leaves the hangar,
slightly relieved.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.550
Suddenly, multiple monitors reveal that the
experiment is conducted in various buildings,

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.710
showing that Mike is just one of many sole
survivors from similar experiments, being

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:42.330
watched by another group.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.990
All of a sudden, another voice announces:
“End stage one.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.250
Commence stage two.”

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.510
The experiment is far from over, and what
seemed to be the worst is only the beginning

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:49.530
of something more vile and evil.&nbsp;
