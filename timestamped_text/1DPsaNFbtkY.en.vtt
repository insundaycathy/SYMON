00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:13.040
12 feet down imagine you're trapped in a public&nbsp;
swimming pool sounds kind of fun right wrong even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.560
though it has the same appeal as being locked into&nbsp;
a christmas warehouse in the following movie it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.440
a little different mind you that this movie is&nbsp;
based on a real story so before you murder me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.680
please refer to my disclaimer in my pinned comment&nbsp;
and with that said let's get it on this is Bree&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.280
the sister of a former sugarhead about to get&nbsp;
married and more or less a stable person she looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.240
good she has a career going on and her handsome&nbsp;
husband proposed to her just a few weeks ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.320
much other than her sister Jonna as mentioned&nbsp;
she is an addict and therefore of course she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.840
unstable she just got out of rehab but it seems&nbsp;
like she failed because there was a syringe in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.680
her car and she does what every other addict&nbsp;
does blaming her problems onto other people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.240
with that said say no to drugs kids please unless&nbsp;
they're legal or they're green anyway they meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.680
up at the local swimming hall for a swim the&nbsp;
pool normally closes at 7 pm but today it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.120
friday before the holiday weekend and so they&nbsp;
closed much earlier our girls didn't expect it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.240
and so they bugged out hurry out of the water&nbsp;
pack their stuff and leave but before they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.000
do so Jonna sees the engagement ring of Bree lying&nbsp;
at the ground of the pool it's pretty remarkable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.040
to see the tiny thing on the ground of a pretty&nbsp;
deep pool i mean i struggle reading stuff on my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.040
laptop without eyeballing my girlfriend who sits&nbsp;
180 degrees next to me but regardless of all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.640
that Bree tries to recover her ring that's all&nbsp;
good and stuff but the pool is about to close&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.440
perhaps she should have told the guard first&nbsp;
before heading back into the water the ring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.840
is stuck firmly and she can't get it out even&nbsp;
with the help of her sister she can't release it

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.120
yeah um well that could have been avoided&nbsp;
by walking 20 meters over and let john know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.160
to hold up a second but let's rewind that okay&nbsp;
let's have a look at what happened here losing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.440
your jewelry in a public pool is something most&nbsp;
people can relate to it just happens to every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.800
one of us and if we're honest you just shouldn't&nbsp;
wear any important or expensive jewelry within&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.000
such a place the only thing worse than wearing&nbsp;
your giant diamond ring in a public swimming pool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.600
is to stuff it into your bag and leave it on&nbsp;
a bench nearby i mean what you gotta have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.160
lot of faith in humanity to do that not me&nbsp;
though heck i don't even leave my grocery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.880
cart out of sight when shopping she could have&nbsp;
easily just left her expensive stuff in her car

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.040
so our two girls end up being stuck below the&nbsp;
fiberglass cover of the pool that sucks but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.160
have about half a meter left to breathe the pool&nbsp;
is heated which is great and there are various&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.280
floating lane ropes around as well that is great&nbsp;
because if you're stuck in there for a few days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.400
you are very happy to have something that you can&nbsp;
rest on now if you are in this position then what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.200
can you do well first of all we have to admit&nbsp;
that it's already bad to be stuck in a position&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.680
like that but the only thing worse than being&nbsp;
there is being stuck with an unstable person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.320
which uh every addict kind of is now before you&nbsp;
bash me because you think i'm bashing an addict i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.520
don't i should think her behavior is unnecessary&nbsp;
and makes this whole situation a lot worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.160
and you really don't want that in this situation&nbsp;
right i mean imagine dying and the person next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.120
to you just keeps on talking [ __ ] no thanks&nbsp;
but for now let's look at the broader situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.880
first it's holiday weekend right so it is likely&nbsp;
that nobody will come in for the next three days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.280
and you better get this into your head your&nbsp;
only hope therefore is that either a janitor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.480
will notice you or the police comes in checking&nbsp;
after someone has made your disappearance public&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.640
since this place was the last place you visited&nbsp;
there is a good chance someone will come and check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.840
these are two realistic options but none&nbsp;
of them require any action on your side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.640
and while it's reassuring to know that you may be&nbsp;
rescued by a third force you should still try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.000
find a way out of there yourself anything else&nbsp;
would be a waste of your time the first thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.200
they do which i think is a great idea is checking&nbsp;
the fiberglass cover and see if there is a way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.400
break out of there now knowing fiberglass is quite&nbsp;
elastic and given the water you don't really have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.120
a ground to push yourself up from it doesn't&nbsp;
look like that could actually work but if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.920
want to give it a chance your best shot will be&nbsp;
near the center of the cover what you could try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.520
is releasing all but one of those lane ropes put&nbsp;
them side by side and see if the buoyance force&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.200
is strong enough to carry you if so try to lay on&nbsp;
it and press against the fiberglass with your feet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.800
while the other person stabilizes the raft you may&nbsp;
be able to build up enough force to break through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.320
if not then well at least you have tried and since&nbsp;
you have left one rope aside you still have one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.840
to rest on during your time down there which is&nbsp;
important because i believe removing those from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.280
their fixture is difficult but putting them back&nbsp;
on probably even harder if not impossible to begin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.080
with our girls don't do any of that and look&nbsp;
for an alternative bree has the brilliant idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.560
to remove the filter frame on the ground of the&nbsp;
pool and use it to break through the fiberglass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.240
that's a pretty smart idea not gonna lie yet they&nbsp;
don't commit to it because well jonah's opinion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.080
seems to matter which is a bad thing because&nbsp;
you see the main issue that i have with her is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.200
her negativity the main problem of an addict is&nbsp;
the lack of responsibility and so being stuck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.640
with an irresponsible person means that you are&nbsp;
pretty much on your own so to conserve my energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.440
i wouldn't even bother communicating my plans to&nbsp;
the other person i would just do whatever the hell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.800
i want to do without her in my mind because&nbsp;
if you invite opinion of a negative person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.840
you literally invite negativity into your brain&nbsp;
and in this situation this is more than just bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.160
we need to check all the sales and edges&nbsp;
maybe there's a weak spot somewhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.520
i agree with Bree here i would circle the pool and&nbsp;
check if i can find anything that can be useful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.880
is anything that i wear useful any jewelry&nbsp;
any ropes attached to your swimsuit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.160
in this environment everything not fixed becomes&nbsp;
valuable and often coming up with a plan is easier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.320
when you know what you have at your disposal&nbsp;
the ring on the ground would be the first one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.360
that i would recover and here is why we can see&nbsp;
those screws holding the fiber plates together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.400
all over the place they're around 10 screws&nbsp;
per each fiber plate if you can just find one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.800
of those screws being loose enough to screw it&nbsp;
off i am pretty sure you will be able to push up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.840
one of these tiles and considering they're&nbsp;
around 75 plates making up the whole cover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.560
there are on 700 screws you could try your&nbsp;
luck on oh well that's that's great because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.400
first of all you have something to do while&nbsp;
you're down there and statistically speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:50.000
it's a very promising strategy and the ring could&nbsp;
possibly be used as a tool to unscrew the screws

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.960
but for now let's screw all of that and let's see&nbsp;
what's happening next in the movie well this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.600
Diana she is the lovely janitor of this place she&nbsp;
is an ex-convict but we don't judge people's pasts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.680
here right we only judge people based on their&nbsp;
present well she just got fired a few hours ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.320
i haven't shown you but she tried to&nbsp;
steal 20 bucks from a lost and found purse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.160
yeah that was a dumb move sister but not just that&nbsp;
but she's also on parole she really didn't think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.320
that through now considering she's a next con&nbsp;
she's definitely she definitely has some issues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:36.880
right so i guess we can conclude that as an&nbsp;
ex-convict she is probably an outcast in society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:42.720
she is probably emotionally unstable as well plus&nbsp;
she's definitely lacking any sort of authority&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.720
well until now and that is a point right&nbsp;
underdogs are suckers for positions of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.240
power and power in the hands of crooks becomes&nbsp;
abusive very quickly i mean just look at politics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.920
so Diana ends up blackmailing the two girls with&nbsp;
the phone she has found in bree's purse now before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.200
we turn the tables there is one minor thing i&nbsp;
haven't mentioned yet Bree is diabetic and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.320
is desperately in need for her shot if she doesn't&nbsp;
get one soon she will run the risk of passing into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.600
a coma and in this situation we can assume that&nbsp;
that will kill her i am telling you this because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:21.200
there is a clear hierarchy of priorities here the&nbsp;
first one is getting bree to have her insulin shot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.320
and only second is to get out of there hear&nbsp;
me out on this if we consider the worst&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.760
possible case here which is they aren't able&nbsp;
to escape the pool before the weekend is over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.960
then not much would happen it would certainly&nbsp;
not kill them it would suck and it is certainly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:43.120
dangerous but pool water isn't that toxic so you&nbsp;
can safely drink that for what it's worth you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.400
surviving without water is possible for about 3&nbsp;
days but having so much water available you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.520
easily survive much longer in fact they would&nbsp;
have no problem surviving as long as necessary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.400
until the pool opens its doors again and with the&nbsp;
lane ropes available you could even put together a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:04.800
raft to sleep on i'm telling you this because well&nbsp;
have a look "i have your phone and it's blinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.880
looks like it needs a password" what do you&nbsp;
do in the situation give her the pin and in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.480
return ask for being released or tell her to&nbsp;
[ __ ] off well if you had to choose between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.840
both you should pick number two because there is&nbsp;
rarely anything good coming from being blackmailed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.840
and that is the point here why would she release&nbsp;
you when you could just report her afterwards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.720
she can't take that risk she is on parole now i&nbsp;
get that you don't know that but it doesn't change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.280
anything if you get blackmailed into giving&nbsp;
something of value to someone explicitly for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.160
being freed then you would certainly report&nbsp;
that person afterwards right so unless the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.640
person who blackmails you is a complete idiot&nbsp;
there is no way that you will be released&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.760
and knowing that gives you an edge so hear me&nbsp;
out first of all i would give her my phone or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:58.560
whatever she asks for only in return of my insulin&nbsp;
shot because my first priority is to survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:04.240
and second the person blackmailing me has no&nbsp;
disadvantage in passing me the syringe right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:09.440
once i got it i would continue as follows Diana&nbsp;
obviously looks out for material gain she seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.280
to be in a bad situation so i would sympathize&nbsp;
with her first i mean i haven't bought Chris&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:19.200
Voss negotiation class but the 1 billion times i&nbsp;
have seen that youtube ad was enough for me to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.080
prepared i would let her know that i understand&nbsp;
her circumstance and that we both could benefit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.680
from the situation i would make sure to be sincere&nbsp;
about it any fake tone in my voice and we are done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.480
the goal of a blackmailer is to get as much&nbsp;
as she can while not being at a disadvantage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:40.080
since your biggest threat is not to be freed her&nbsp;
biggest threat lies in being caught by the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.520
so i would try to lure out the good person within&nbsp;
her telling her how lucky i am to have her around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.480
i would let her know that without her i would&nbsp;
have died and that she is a hero saying stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.840
like that either works or it doesn't if it doesn't&nbsp;
that means that she is probably not into it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.120
because of an emotional reward but solely in&nbsp;
it for the cash and if that's the case then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.400
i would have to decide do i want to give this&nbsp;
cheeky bastard what she wants or will i just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.680
shut down and just stay within the pool until it&nbsp;
opens its doors again well the choice is up to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.800
you but whatever you do and i will tell you what&nbsp;
i would do you should not do what our girls do

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.840
what the hell that's like the worst thing&nbsp;
you can do and it serves no purpose other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:31.760
than agitating your punisher and unless you're&nbsp;
okay with being killed then this is a bad idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:37.280
especially when you aren't the only person in this&nbsp;
position that's just selfish jesus Jonna must have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.160
thought oh the situation can't get worse well i&nbsp;
don't know where she's from but man i don't think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.920
there is any situation that can't get worse and&nbsp;
as we can see the next move from Diana is turning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:54.320
off the heat and turning on fresh chlorine flow&nbsp;
yep not only are you stuck in a public pool but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.200
now you're also freezing your ass off while&nbsp;
slowly being intoxicated by a poisonous gas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:05.840
great thanks Jonna at this point not just is&nbsp;
it more uncomfortable to be in there but you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:11.760
will also not survive until Tuesday unless Diana&nbsp;
frees you and that is bad because i don't think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:18.160
she likes you anymore you are in deep trouble my&nbsp;
friend and you have failed every chance you got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.920
and you kept making things worse you need a talent&nbsp;
for that at this point your future is in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:29.600
hands of an ex-convict that you have stabbed five&nbsp;
minutes ago it doesn't take a genius to figure out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:35.600
that you have made the wrong decisions more than&nbsp;
just once plus in my opinion the worst thing is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.960
Bree still has not received her medicine yet the&nbsp;
girls just didn't negotiate well they have just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:46.000
viewed themselves as the victim without concluding&nbsp;
that they too have the power it may didn't seem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.360
like it but i assure you that is the case there&nbsp;
were multiple chances our girls had at the very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.920
least they should have not agitated Diana that way&nbsp;
they would have remained in a heated pool until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.440
the holidays came to an end and with having cash&nbsp;
on bank accounts having phones and other valuables&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.480
at hand they could have easily negotiated a&nbsp;
deal for getting Bree's medicine especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.680
when saying the following sentence look Diana&nbsp;
just turn up the heat and pass me my medicine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.720
and when you're at it please get us some food as&nbsp;
well then take my core on everything that's inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:22.000
and get the hell out of the country we survive and&nbsp;
you have the time to escape i mean think about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.320
if you were Diana and one of the girls&nbsp;
would have told you to give you her car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.960
in return of the insulin in her purse would&nbsp;
you have done it of course you would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.200
the trade-off would it be completely in your&nbsp;
favor that's a no-brainer because if i were the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.000
blackmailer and i had to carve my victim i would&nbsp;
jump in there and get myself to Mexico faster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.200
than you can call me gringo that's for sure but&nbsp;
for some reason the girls didn't think that far&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.880
so what would have you done in this situation how&nbsp;
would have you managed to get out of there let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:56.320
me know your strategy oh and by the way the&nbsp;
movie ended in a happy end Diana ultimately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.200
didn't kill anyone she just desperately needed&nbsp;
some money to solve her own struggles which i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.960
guess we can understand granted though um her&nbsp;
way to get there was uh was a bit questionable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.760
but eventually she came around so that's a&nbsp;
good thing in the end she freed them bree&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:17.040
got her shots and everyone survived there&nbsp;
you go thanks for watching as always peace
