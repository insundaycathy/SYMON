00:00:06.426 --> 00:00:07.818
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.994
today I'll show you a fantasy comedy-drama film: "Heart and Souls" 

00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:14.922
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:15.258 --> 00:00:20.682
in San Francisco, 1959, a pregnant mother is going to deliver her baby soon

00:00:20.778 --> 00:00:23.226
so her husband sends her to the hospital by car

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.218
at the same time, four different strangers are living their ordinary lifes in San Francisco

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:32.106
here is a single mom (Mom) singing a song to her children before leaving for work 

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:35.250
at the theatre, a would-be opera singer (Singer) fails his audition 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.634
because of nervousness, and again ruins the hiring opportunity 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.471
the third person is a waitress (Waitress) who works in a bar 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:43.487
but pierces her boyfriend's heart right then

00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:46.703
as she hesitates and finally rejects his wedding proposal

00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:48.287
she wants to change her mind later

00:00:48.335 --> 00:00:51.263
but only to find her heartbroken boyfriend has left the bar 

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.815
lastly, a burglar (Burglar) is paid to con a set of old and precious stamps

00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:57.599
which a naive boy inherits from his grandfather  

00:00:57.743 --> 00:01:01.871
condemned by his own conscience, he wants to steal the stamps back from the client 

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:03.455
and return them to the boy

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:08.639
unfortunately, the client notices him, so he escapes the house as quickly as possible

00:01:08.927 --> 00:01:13.343
since he fails to retrieve the stamps, the boy calls him a bastard in disappointment

00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:17.711
frustrated, he stops a green trolleybus that passes by late at night

00:01:18.047 --> 00:01:22.799
on the bus, he meets Mom who is rushing to work, Singer who backs out his audition

00:01:23.138 --> 00:01:25.730
and Waitress who wants to patch back with her boyfriend 

00:01:25.874 --> 00:01:30.434
at this time, the bus driver (Driver) is distracted by an attractive girl in another car 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.130
and accidentally drives the trolley bus off the overpass    

00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:37.970
sometime later, the four passengers crawl out from the trolleybus 

00:01:38.018 --> 00:01:41.666
only to realize that they are already killed in the car accident 

00:01:42.194 --> 00:01:44.978
the pregnant mother and her husband are also nearby

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.098
pulling over on the roadside to avoid the collision 

00:01:48.386 --> 00:01:51.890
surprisingly, their son Thomas is born in the car right at that time

00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:55.394
among those onboard, Driver has ascended to heaven 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.714
while the four passengers are called back halfway to attach to the newborn fat baby 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.025
for some unknown divine reasons, the four of them are tasked to accompany 

00:02:04.025 --> 00:02:05.666
and look after the fat baby

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.164
the baby Thomas can see them and often talk to them, but no one else can

00:02:10.404 --> 00:02:14.196
therefore, his such behaviors look really strange in his parents' eyes 

00:02:14.532 --> 00:02:16.452
years later, as he enters school

00:02:16.596 --> 00:02:21.156
the way he chats with the four invisible ghosts often puts him under the spotlight  

00:02:21.444 --> 00:02:26.724
soon, Thomas gets into trouble as he cheats money for horse betting, instigated by Burglar

00:02:26.868 --> 00:02:30.372
this case even brings the Child Protection officer to his parents 

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:34.788
Thoma's father decides to send Thomas to a psychiatric center for rehabilitation 

00:02:34.932 --> 00:02:37.860
so as to prevent Thomas from more pains and harms

00:02:38.148 --> 00:02:41.172
the four friends decide to disappear from Thomas' life 

00:02:41.412 --> 00:02:45.108
even with Thomas begging them to stay with him, they are determined to go 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.428
traumatized by their departure, Thomas only manages to pull through it 

00:02:49.572 --> 00:02:51.348
by years of psychological treatment  

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:55.908
years later, Thomas has grown into a heartless vice president of a renowned bank 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.604
he hates to make or maintain connections with any people around him 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.932
even though he has a smooth sailing in career, his hormone relationship is in a total mess 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.580
he refuses to go any further with his long-time girlfriend Anna 

00:03:08.724 --> 00:03:13.044
when Anna invites him to meet her parents, Thomas intends to reject her 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.387
Thomas' unreasonable reactions make the four ghosts worry 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.027
just when they debate about what is right for Thomas' life

00:03:19.123 --> 00:03:23.491
a green trolleybus passes through the wall and stops right before them

00:03:23.635 --> 00:03:27.523
actually, this trolleybus is to transport ghosts to their next life 

00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:31.219
to their surprise, Driver alights from the bus to greet them 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.731
in fact, to redeem his own sins of carelessly ending four innocent lives

00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:39.043
Driver needs to repeat this task for 500 years  

00:03:39.283 --> 00:03:42.547
the four former passengers also learn that as they die accidentally

00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:46.339
they should have the privilege of completing one unfinished business 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.131
sadly the angel in charge of such matters does not inform them

00:03:50.275 --> 00:03:52.339
so they are kept waiting in vain 

00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:55.315
the quartet is angry about losing the precious opportunity 

00:03:55.411 --> 00:03:58.147
so that they continue to complain and grumble 

00:03:58.387 --> 00:04:02.467
Driver finally allows them to fulfill their last wish before boarding the bus 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.307
everyone is thrilled for such a golden opportunity except Singer 

00:04:06.451 --> 00:04:10.819
at once, they return to Thomas and make all kinds of stunts to grab his attention

00:04:11.011 --> 00:04:14.083
their persistence finally earns the overreaction of Thomas 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:18.979
in shock, he loses control of his car and crashes it into the side of the road

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:24.259
when Thomas regains his consciousness, he quickly recognizes them as his old friends

00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:27.043
but having been through countless sessions of psychotherapy

00:04:27.283 --> 00:04:29.683
he cannot believe their existence is real 

00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:35.347
coincidentally they chance upon a schizophrenic patient who is a medium for spirits

00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:39.187
her testimony reaffirms Thomas that he is not hallucinating

00:04:39.523 --> 00:04:42.595
moreover, Thomas discovers that the four ghosts have never left him 

00:04:42.691 --> 00:04:45.667
but seen him through the ups and downs all these years    

00:04:45.955 --> 00:04:50.803
he feels very irritated for having no personal space with the four of them around 

00:04:50.947 --> 00:04:53.971
hence, he refuses to help them with their last wish 

00:04:54.115 --> 00:04:58.579
soon, Thomas is discharged from hospital and returns to his piles of work 

00:04:58.771 --> 00:05:01.507
but the quartet does not let him go easily 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.971
instead, they follow him wherever he goes and even disturbs him during his meeting 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.147
Waitress first enters Thomas' body to taste the joy of being alive 

00:05:10.387 --> 00:05:15.043
she dances around with Thomas' body, making him look totally female-hormone charming

00:05:15.235 --> 00:05:18.211
Thomas' colleagues can't bear to see him turning so weird 

00:05:18.355 --> 00:05:21.907
as Waitress takes her leave, Burglar immediately takes over 

00:05:22.003 --> 00:05:26.611
under Burglar's control, Thomas begins to flirt with the deputy director of finance 

00:05:26.755 --> 00:05:30.787
knowing his career will be doomed, Thomas starts to fight against the Burglar 

00:05:30.883 --> 00:05:33.475
and manages to drive Burglar off his body 

00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:37.075
in exchange for his peace, Thomas gives in to the four of them 

00:05:37.123 --> 00:05:40.051
and agrees to help them rectify their unfinished lives 

00:05:40.195 --> 00:05:43.459
Burglary cannot wait to retrieve the stamps for the boy 

00:05:43.603 --> 00:05:48.019
he brings the rest to the client's residence and glues his spirit to Thomas 

00:05:48.115 --> 00:05:52.099
while the client is taking a shower, Thomas swiftly grabs the stamps 

00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:56.659
however, when he is about to leave, a black hound suddenly darts out 

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:59.779
in terror, all of them flee to the second floor 

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:02.467
while Thomas manages to escape the aggressive hound

00:06:02.563 --> 00:06:05.923
he is faced with the client who just walks out of the bathroom

00:06:06.163 --> 00:06:09.907
but Burglar who lives within Thomas, remains absolutely composed 

00:06:10.003 --> 00:06:13.027
and even reprimands the client for robbing the stamps 

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:15.379
before the client realizes what is happening

00:06:15.427 --> 00:06:18.307
Burglar breaks out from the window with the stamps 

00:06:18.403 --> 00:06:21.859
to his shock, previously, he could easily jump over to the adjacent building 

00:06:21.907 --> 00:06:24.211
but now that building is demolished 

00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:27.427
he fumbles a little but lands on the lawn safely 

00:06:27.523 --> 00:06:30.979
due to his illegal parking, he is dealt with a traffic police 

00:06:31.027 --> 00:06:34.435
who finds Thomas to be in arrears for a high parking fee 

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:39.283
though Thomas wants Burglar to keep silent, Burglar hails insults and curses at the police

00:06:39.427 --> 00:06:41.635
which gets Thomas arrested in the end  

00:06:41.827 --> 00:06:45.571
after settling the payment, Thomas is reminded of his date with Anna 

00:06:45.667 --> 00:06:48.451
Anna is agitated for Thomas' lateness at first

00:06:48.595 --> 00:06:51.523
but soon, she accepts Thomas' sincere apologies

00:06:51.763 --> 00:06:55.027
following the date, Thomas visits the stamps' true owner 

00:06:55.075 --> 00:06:58.675
and returns the $100,000 worth item to him 

00:06:58.963 --> 00:07:02.755
the boy, who is now a father, is overjoyed to see the stamp again

00:07:02.851 --> 00:07:05.923
everyone rejoices to see Burglar's wish come true 

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:09.955
while they are celebrating, there comes the green trolleybus to fetch Burglar

00:07:10.243 --> 00:07:12.739
Burglar wants to spend more time with his friends

00:07:12.835 --> 00:07:15.715
but he is drawn into the bus by an unknown force 

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:19.891
he bids farewell to Thomas and prepares for the next phase of his life 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:23.395
the second mission is to find Mom's three children 

00:07:23.731 --> 00:07:26.179
back then, when the single mom passes away

00:07:26.275 --> 00:07:29.395
her three children are adopted by three different families

00:07:29.635 --> 00:07:32.851
but the details for adoption are kept highly confidential 

00:07:32.947 --> 00:07:36.979
clueless, they have no choice but to visit Mom's previous house 

00:07:37.027 --> 00:07:40.915
over there, Mom discovers that her good friend just stays nearby 

00:07:41.203 --> 00:07:43.363
Thomas then visits the friend on her behalf 

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:46.867
and is told that Mom's two daughters are adopted by the same family

00:07:46.963 --> 00:07:50.035
but her youngest son's location remains unclear 

00:07:50.275 --> 00:07:53.827
considering that her daughters might have some ideas about where their brother is

00:07:53.923 --> 00:07:55.843
they move to meet the daughters 

00:07:56.083 --> 00:07:59.395
however, a heavy traffic jam jeopardizes their plan  

00:07:59.587 --> 00:08:05.251
due to such unforeseeable inconvenience, Mom volunteers to give priority to Singer's wish

00:08:05.539 --> 00:08:07.939
since the show tickets are sold out at the theatre

00:08:08.035 --> 00:08:12.547
Thomas sneaks in by seducing the security guard with the spirit of the charming Waitress

00:08:12.835 --> 00:08:17.875
however, no matter how prepared he is, Singer cannot overcome his stage fright to sing 

00:08:18.211 --> 00:08:22.003
in order to get rid of Singer's fear, Thomas asks all the audience to stand up 

00:08:22.099 --> 00:08:24.547
and sing the national anthem together with Singer

00:08:24.643 --> 00:08:28.867
owing to the encouragement of Thomas and the audience, Singer makes his debut 

00:08:29.203 --> 00:08:32.035
his soothing heavenly voice calms down the audience 

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:37.987
moved by his beautiful singing, the jazz musician goes the extra mile to accompany him by guitar

00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:41.683
their wonderful performance creates great excitement among the audience 

00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:44.899
right at this time, the green trolleybus stops on the stage

00:08:45.043 --> 00:08:47.251
implying that it is time for Singer to go 

00:08:47.587 --> 00:08:50.467
Singer happily says goodbye to his ghost friends 

00:08:50.803 --> 00:08:55.123
and extends his appreciation to Thomas before embarking on a brand new journey 

00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:59.395
unfortunately, Thomas is arrested for disrupting the stage performance

00:08:59.587 --> 00:09:03.763
at the police station, he again meets the same officer who claims payment from him 

00:09:03.955 --> 00:09:08.179
after Thomas is bailed out, he bumps into Anna outside the police station 

00:09:08.323 --> 00:09:12.307
actually, Anna is among the theatre audience to witness Thomas' performance 

00:09:12.595 --> 00:09:15.043
she is quite upset that Thomas has lied to her 

00:09:15.283 --> 00:09:18.547
the two have a fierce argument, and Anna leaves in a fury 

00:09:18.739 --> 00:09:21.955
as time is pressing to resolve issues for Mom and Waitress

00:09:22.339 --> 00:09:24.403
Thomas decides to appease Anna later 

00:09:24.835 --> 00:09:29.347
the sad thing is his car crashes with the policeman's car when he tries to back it 

00:09:29.587 --> 00:09:33.283
adding to the tension, they see the green trolley coming in their direction

00:09:33.475 --> 00:09:36.307
to give Mon the luxury of time to see her beloved children

00:09:36.403 --> 00:09:38.563
Waitress is willing to go first  

00:09:38.803 --> 00:09:43.315
on the other hand, the policeman hugs his daughter and sings her the nursery rhymes

00:09:43.507 --> 00:09:48.979
Mom is struck by his singing, for it is the very song Mom composed for her youngest child 

00:09:49.267 --> 00:09:54.691
urged by Mom, Thomas calls the policeman by his name and informs him about his late mother

00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:59.107
despite much confusion, the policeman acknowledges that he calls the right name 

00:09:59.347 --> 00:10:03.715
to gain his trust, Thomas reveals the residential address of his two sisters 

00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:07.603
the policeman is unaware that his late mother is standing right beside him 

00:10:07.747 --> 00:10:09.811
and feels so proud of her son

00:10:09.955 --> 00:10:12.067
seeing her son's career and family success

00:10:12.163 --> 00:10:16.051
Mom goes into Thomas' body to gives her son a goodbye hug 

00:10:16.195 --> 00:10:20.707
fulfilling her last wish, Mom boards the green trolleybus in contentment 

00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:24.499
in order to resolve the misunderstanding of Waitress' boyfriend

00:10:24.643 --> 00:10:29.395
Thomas writes a letter in imitation of Waitress' handwriting and plans to speak with him

00:10:29.683 --> 00:10:33.763
but the green trolleybus appears again, warning them that time is short 

00:10:33.955 --> 00:10:37.555
to finish the task, Thomas races against time to the destination 

00:10:37.747 --> 00:10:40.483
but the trolleybus arrives at the farm ahead of them 

00:10:40.579 --> 00:10:43.699
Thomas persuades Driver to spare them a little more time 

00:10:43.843 --> 00:10:45.043
once permission is granted

00:10:45.139 --> 00:10:49.651
Thomas hastens to approach the farm owner to inquire about Waitress' boyfriend

00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:53.779
to their dismay, her boyfriend just died of an illness seven years ago 

00:10:54.019 --> 00:10:56.035
watching Thomas arguing with Driver

00:10:56.131 --> 00:11:01.123
Waitress is reminded that Thomas and his girlfriend are making the same mistake as she did

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:05.779
she then realizes her true mission should be helping Thomas earn his true love

00:11:06.019 --> 00:11:08.563
such a realization frees her from her guilt 

00:11:08.659 --> 00:11:11.395
and Waitress sincerely asks Thomas to cherish Anna

00:11:11.635 --> 00:11:16.339
owing to her earnest prayers, God grants her a favor to hug Thomas physically 

00:11:16.531 --> 00:11:20.563
thanks to Waitress' friendly advice, Thomas decides to have a heart talk with Anna  

00:11:20.803 --> 00:11:23.875
he plucks up his courage to tell Anna why he rejects her
