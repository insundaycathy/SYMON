00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.560
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m&nbsp;
going to explain an American monster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.520
adventure film called “L0ve and M0nster.”&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.080
The movie begins as Joel Dawson narrates to us&nbsp;
the current state of the world. He says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.040
his life was normal; like any of us, until the&nbsp;
end of the world. It all started when a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.120
asteroid named Agatha 616 was heading straight to&nbsp;
earth. Humanity came together, and sent several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.480
rockets to destroy the asteroid before it hit&nbsp;
the earth, and succeeded. The asteroid was gone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.040
however, the rockets were destroyed too. The&nbsp;
radioactive material in the rockets rained&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.240
back into earth...causing all cold-blooded&nbsp;
animals to mutate. So now there are huge ants,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.640
roaches, crocodiles, lizards, and many other huge&nbsp;
animals who attack humans. The animals immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.320
started killing people. And within about a year,&nbsp;
95% of the human population was wiped out.
&nbsp;

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.080
The ones who survived hid in bunkers, caves,&nbsp;
and panic rooms. The surviving humans have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.720
been living in such places for the last seven&nbsp;
years, and one of them is Joel. He lives in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.080
bunker with other members. The tiny place doesn’t&nbsp;
provide room for privacy, so Joel complains about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.720
two of the members having sex right beside&nbsp;
him, as he pretends to sleep. Joel tells us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.240
that everyone in the bunker is a couple, except&nbsp;
for him. Their first baby was born last summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.160
They have established their own lifestyle vastly&nbsp;
different from how it was outside the bunker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.040
Joel’s day-to-day life includes milking the&nbsp;
cow and cooking food. They have a “hunting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.200
party” every month, in which some members of the&nbsp;
group go up and bring whatever food they can. 
&nbsp;

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.960
Joel writes letters to Aimee, his girlfriend&nbsp;
before he lived in the bunkers. That day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.760
Joel is practicing hitting targets when the lights&nbsp;
in the bunker start to flicker. Everyone starts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.440
pack their weapons to go out. A mutated animal is&nbsp;
in the area. Joel asks them if they want his help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.080
but the group tells him to stay in the bunker.&nbsp;
He is a liability for them, because Joel cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.680
fight. The team then leaves to find and kill the&nbsp;
animal. Joel and a few others stay at the bunker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.920
They monitor the group through a device, and see&nbsp;
that one of the team is killed by the monster.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.880
Joel gets a crossbow and goes to help them.&nbsp;
One animal has slipped into the bunker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.160
Joel sees it and freezes. Although he has plenty&nbsp;
of chances to kill it, he doesn’t move at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.080
The animal is about to attack him, when&nbsp;
the others from behind him kill it.
&nbsp;

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.000
Cut to seven years ago, the day the asteroid was&nbsp;
destroyed. Joel and his girlfriend Aimee are in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.440
car hanging out. He draws a picture of Aimee,&nbsp;
and she gives him a box of colors as a gift.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.640
As they kiss, the emergency alarm goes off in the&nbsp;
city. Just then the pieces of rocket fall back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.400
onto the city creating huge explosions. The two&nbsp;
drive back home quickly. After they had come home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.280
Everyone was packing their bags to leave for&nbsp;
a safe place. The two hug for the last time;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.560
separated that day, and have not met ever since.&nbsp;
She lives in another colony a few miles away.
&nbsp;

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.200
Seven years later, Joel still has the&nbsp;
box of colors that he uses to draw the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.320
monster animals on his notepad. . That day,&nbsp;
Joel speaks to her through a radio system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.760
The two talk about the letters that&nbsp;
Joel writes to Aimee every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.000
But the call cuts off midway. Others from the&nbsp;
team mourn the death of their team member. 
&nbsp;

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.240
Suddenly, Joel asks the team about Aimee’s colony.&nbsp;
It turns out that it is only eighty-five miles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.080
away. It takes seven days to reach there. Joel&nbsp;
is determined to find Aimee this time. The team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.800
members are surprised because they know Joel&nbsp;
cannot fight. They try to persuade him to stay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.480
but he packs his bag with all the necessities&nbsp;
and leaves the bunker for the first time. 
&nbsp;

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.000
He looks at the map, but cannot figure out&nbsp;
anything in it. He even can’t tell what direction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.840
is west. So, Joel takes a chance and heads in a&nbsp;
random direction. He walks for a while...thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.200
that the journey is not as bad as he expected it&nbsp;
to be. On his way, he encounters several monster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.600
eggs, but tries to stay positive. He finds&nbsp;
a frisbee on the ground and keeps it with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.880
him. Just then, he hears a noise nearby. The&nbsp;
team members had advised him to run and hide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.560
instead of fighting the creatures. So, Joel goes&nbsp;
into a nearby house. It is empty as expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.000
Curious, he opens the fridge and sees a creature&nbsp;
there; he immediately rushes back outside. 
&nbsp;

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.160
He ends up in front of a small pond. A tentacle&nbsp;
peeks out of it. Joel freezes like he does when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.920
he is scared. Suddenly, a huge mutated frog&nbsp;
comes out of the pond. But Joel doesn’t move.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.120
It attacks Joel with its tongue making him&nbsp;
fall to the ground. A dog jumps on top of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.320
him out of nowhere. Just as Joel is about to&nbsp;
run, the frog catches his legs with its tongue,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.600
and drags him towards them. The dog saves Joel&nbsp;
from the frog, and they both run to a nearby van.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.800
It seems to be the dog's home. Joel notices&nbsp;
“boy” written on the ceiling and figures that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.160
it is the dog’s name. That night, he stays&nbsp;
with Boy in the van. The following morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.720
he draws the dog in his notepad, thanking him for&nbsp;
saving his life, and continues his journey. 
&nbsp;

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.200
Boy follows him with his owner’s dress. It is the&nbsp;
only way Boy can still be close to his owner. Joel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.000
keeps the dress in his backpack and starts walking&nbsp;
with Boy. The two become best friends on their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.040
journey. Boy protects Joel from eating poisonous&nbsp;
berries and other dangers, while Joel tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.200
everything about his life. One day, as they walk,&nbsp;
Joel falls into a pit. The pit has several burrows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.480
inside it. A worm monster called the sand gobbler&nbsp;
comes out from one of the holes and attacks him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.040
Just then, two survivors throw him a rope and&nbsp;
bring him out of the pit. Several worm monsters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.000
attack him as he climbs up. The survivors are&nbsp;
a man named Clyde Dutton and his eight-year-old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.720
friend, Minnow. Minnow throws an explosive in&nbsp;
the pit and kills the rest of the monsters. 
&nbsp;

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.880
As the two strangers continue their journey, Joel&nbsp;
and Boy follow them for safety. It turns out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.960
Minnow’s father and Clyde’s son were killed by&nbsp;
a monster, and they have been together since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.240
then. The duo is heading towards the north now,&nbsp;
where fewer monsters live due to the cold climate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.680
and higher elevation. Joel decides to be with&nbsp;
them until they have to part ways. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.560
everyone freezes as they come across a huge snail.&nbsp;
Clyde makes Joel take his shirt off and gives it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.160
to the snail. His shirt had the smell of sand&nbsp;
gobblers in them, which attracted other monsters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.600
Now the snail will spread it through the&nbsp;
jungle and help them confuse the monsters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.920
The snail slowly leaves. Minnow teaches Joel that&nbsp;
like the snail, some creatures are actually nice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.640
You can tell by their eyes. For the next two&nbsp;
days, they teach Joel to shoot a crossbow in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.120
the right direction and other survival skills.&nbsp;
Joel draws every monster they come across.
&nbsp;

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.800
The day finally comes when they have to part ways.&nbsp;
Minnow insists he come with them to the north,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.240
but Joel has to find Aimee. Clyde gives Joel&nbsp;
a grenade as a parting gift. As Joel and boy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.720
continue heading west, Boy suddenly feels&nbsp;
something is wrong and hides. Joel tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.360
to bring him out. But before he can, he&nbsp;
is attacked by a huge centipede monster,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.920
like the one he had encountered in the bunker.&nbsp;
This time, Joel manages to point his crossbow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.640
at him, but freezes right after. The monster&nbsp;
throws him away with its tail and surrounds Boy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.920
Joel lies on the ground...thinking of the day&nbsp;
his parents died. With much determination he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.960
gets up and shoots at the monster, killing him.&nbsp;
He finally saves Boy, and the two celebrate.
&nbsp;

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.240
That night, they stay at a motel where&nbsp;
they encounter a talking robot named Mavis.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.360
The robot has 51 minutes of battery left. Joel&nbsp;
asks her if she has a working outlet that he can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.120
use his radio on. Mavis offers her remaining&nbsp;
battery to him. Joel finally contacts Aimee,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.760
who is worried about him. She tells him that&nbsp;
her colony is leaving for a new place very soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.760
They have found another group of survivors&nbsp;
who plan to take them somewhere safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.840
Before she can tell him where they&nbsp;
are going, the power runs out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.800
Joel brings Mavis outside and talks to her about&nbsp;
his feelings. The robot shows him the picture of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.600
his family through its database. She plays a song&nbsp;
for them, when suddenly her battery dies. 
&nbsp;

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.960
Boy and Joel continue their journey the&nbsp;
following day. As they walk, they encounter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.360
a Queen Sand-Gobbler. Clyde had warned them&nbsp;
about her being the most dangerous of them all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.520
The queen attacks them and chases them through the&nbsp;
woods. Joel and Boy hide by a river. However, Boy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.880
gets scared and starts barking, giving away their&nbsp;
position. Boy’s owner’s dress falls into the river&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:08.000
which makes him get out of hiding. The queen finds&nbsp;
their location, but before she can attack them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.640
Joel uses the grenade to kill her. He&nbsp;
falls into the water before the explosion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.320
When he gets out of the water, he finds&nbsp;
several leeches latch onto his body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.000
He screams at Boy for giving away their location&nbsp;
earlier. Saddened, Boy runs away from him. 
&nbsp;

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.840
Joel now walks alone, but the leeches seem to have&nbsp;
poisoned him with something. He gets lightheaded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.360
and starts to hallucinate. Just then, a group of&nbsp;
people appears before him. He opens his eyes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.960
see Aimee in front of him. Aimee is surprised&nbsp;
to see him too. The two kiss, but Joel falls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:44.800
unconscious soon after that. When he wakes up, he&nbsp;
is in a bunker. Aimee greets him, as it turns out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.440
that he had kissed an old man earlier. The two&nbsp;
are talking, when Aimee is called by another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.480
older woman. After her parents died, Aimee has&nbsp;
been in this colony taking care of the elderly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.520
people there. She is the head of the colony as&nbsp;
the elders depend on her. They live on a beach.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.880
Joel goes outside and sees the beautiful view.&nbsp;
Several people are packing to leave the place.
&nbsp;

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.080
Another group of survivors had approached&nbsp;
Aimee’s colony. Their leader, Cap,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:15.040
had promised to take them to a safer arena, so&nbsp;
now they are packing to leave. Joel meets Cap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.320
who is preparing for a party at night. Cap brews&nbsp;
his own beer which is the attraction of the party.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.600
Later that day, Aimee confesses she is glad to&nbsp;
see Joel, but has no romantic interest in him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.160
She has grown into a different person now and&nbsp;
is mourning the death of a close one, suggesting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.880
that she was together with someone else all&nbsp;
these years before he died. Joel is devastated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:40.160
and apologizes to her for not asking before coming&nbsp;
to see her. Aimee assures him that it is okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.280
and invites him to join their colony. However,&nbsp;
Joel decides to return back to his colony and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.840
contacts them through the radio. His friends are&nbsp;
happy and surprised to find out he is alive. 
&nbsp;

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.480
They inform him that the bunker is no longer&nbsp;
safe for them, and that they are planning to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.080
leave soon. The phone cuts off midway. Joel then&nbsp;
notices the berries and beer kept beside him by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.720
one of Cap’s friends. He sees that the berries&nbsp;
are poisonous, the one that boy had warned him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.680
about earlier. Joel realizes that Cap and his&nbsp;
crew are planning to poison the other survivors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.960
He goes out to tell Aimee but&nbsp;
she is too drunk to understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.240
Just then, someone hits him on the head and&nbsp;
he falls unconscious. The following morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.960
Joel wakes up to him tied up on the beach.&nbsp;
The others are in the same condition. Cap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.880
reveals that he and his crew are actually&nbsp;
pirates who raid colonies for food and fuel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.680
He summons a crab monster rigged with a makeshift&nbsp;
electric collar to eat the colonists. 
&nbsp;

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.800
They also use the crab to tow their yacht. As the&nbsp;
crab attacks them, Amiee frees herself and Joel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.280
She runs to fight the crew and leaves&nbsp;
Joel to fight the monster crab. Aimee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.480
fights with the girl member of the crew. Joel&nbsp;
surprisingly manages to push the crab over. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.600
Cap electrocutes the crab and it hits Joel making&nbsp;
him fall unconscious. The crab then walks towards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:57.920
Joel as he retreats. Just then, Boy comes to his&nbsp;
aid. As Dana aims to shoot Boy, Aimee hits her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:03.520
making her shoot the crab instead. Cap’s crew runs&nbsp;
to the boat and gets back on their yacht. The crab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.240
is about to kill Joel when he looks at its eyes&nbsp;
and notices that it is actually a friendly animal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.360
It had gone wild because Cap electrocuted it.&nbsp;
So, Joel shoots at the chain that electrocutes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.760
it which makes the crab docile again. 
It leaves the beach and goes to Cap’s yacht to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.240
kill all of them. Later that day, Joel packs&nbsp;
his bag to get back to his colony to help them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.200
He gives his book of monsters to Aimee as a&nbsp;
parting gift, and they kiss their goodbye.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.160
We see Joel survive the seven-day journey back to&nbsp;
the bunker with Boy. He finally meets his friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.760
again. They too decide to head to a safe place in&nbsp;
the mountains. On the radio, Joel inspires other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.200
colonies to come out to the surface...proving that&nbsp;
life outside is still possible. In the end, we see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.480
many colonies head towards the mountains to live&nbsp;
a better life. Clyde and Minnow are already there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.640
while Joel and Boy are also heading towards the&nbsp;
mountain, trying to survive the next journey.
