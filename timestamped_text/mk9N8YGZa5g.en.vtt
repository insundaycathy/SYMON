00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.680
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain a comedy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.800
family, and sci-fi film called "Flubber."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.000
A ringing alarm clock wakes up Professor Philip&nbsp;
Brainard. He tries to turn off the alarm but hits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.640
a button instead, and a trash bin launches into&nbsp;
the sky and lands precisely by the curb. A machine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.760
prepares his breakfast: brewing coffee, cooking&nbsp;
eggs, pancakes, and bacon all at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.640
A robot named Weber serves the plate of breakfast&nbsp;
and greets Philip. Weebo accompanies Philip at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.200
table. They talk about the news concerning the&nbsp;
closure of the university he works in. Philip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.600
plans to save the school by inventing a new energy&nbsp;
source. They go through his schedule for the day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.960
and Weebo displays a wedding that Philip&nbsp;
intends to go to but seems to have forgotten.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.440
Dr. Sara Jean Reynolds fits her&nbsp;
wedding dress while answering a call.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.720
She talks to her colleagues about how this&nbsp;
time around, Philip can't miss the wedding.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.800
Philip enters an art class, not&nbsp;
realizing that he's in the wrong room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.240
He discusses Newton's Law of Gravitation,&nbsp;
but he doesn't seem to notice the gravity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.040
of what's happening in front of&nbsp;
him. They look at him judgingly;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.960
Philip is still oblivious and even finds a&nbsp;
connection between the naked models and physics.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.400
He finally realizes when the blackboard&nbsp;
reveals that this is another professor's class.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.760
Outside, Sara calls Philip, admiring his&nbsp;
goofiness. His awkwardness further shines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.240
as when Sara’s friend mentions the wedding, he&nbsp;
replies by congratulating her. Sara feels kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.800
annoyed that Philip doesn't remember. She reminds&nbsp;
him that today is their wedding. She asks him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.720
promise that he'll be there and says that this is&nbsp;
her last try at marrying him. If he doesn't show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.400
up, it'll be apparent that Philip's incapable of&nbsp;
loving something other than his books and gadgets.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.560
Philip works with a complex array of&nbsp;
chemicals and lab equipment. Wilson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.720
enters the room and asks Philip what&nbsp;
he's doing. Philip tries to act friendly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.800
but the underlying conflict is evident in how&nbsp;
they interact. Wilson talks about the news of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.720
the university closing. Philip asks him to&nbsp;
leave, which prompts Wilson to ask about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.040
what happened to their friendship. Philip says&nbsp;
that he grew tired of him stealing his ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.240
Wilson rebuts that he wouldn't have been able&nbsp;
to do anything with it because of how bad his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.800
memory is—calling him a genius in the lab but a&nbsp;
moron in everything else. Wilson announces his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.120
plan to steal his fiance. Philip wishes him good&nbsp;
luck and winks as he leaves a laughing Wilson.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.320
At home, Philip tries his shirt and vest on while&nbsp;
chatting with Weebo. He catches a glimpse of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.840
computer and sees an equation that causes&nbsp;
a eureka moment. Philip finally discovers a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.560
breakthrough and immediately works on it. Weebo,&nbsp;
feeling ecstatic, cancels the wedding for him.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.480
Philip goes down to his laboratory, and after&nbsp;
a few adjustments and double-checking, drops a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.320
strand of his hair to act as an organic catalyst&nbsp;
to the brewing chemicals in the container.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.440
They distance themselves from the&nbsp;
contraption before activating it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.040
He pushes down on the device, and&nbsp;
after a moment, everything explodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.440
A stained Weebo laughs at the surprised Philip. He&nbsp;
cleans up his glasses to see the mess he created.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.280
Sara looks out the church's window&nbsp;
with tears falling down her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.880
Wilson smiles as he realizes Philip himself&nbsp;
is the one that sabotaged his wedding.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.800
The night comes, and Philip is&nbsp;
frustrated with his failed project.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.000
As he climbs the steps, steam&nbsp;
starts spewing out of the container.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.880
Philip turns back to take a closer look. He&nbsp;
carefully opens it up, and Flubber, a green blob,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.360
jumps out. Philip tries to touch it using his bare&nbsp;
hands, and the slime oddly communicates with him.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.480
He tries to figure out what Flubber is. It's&nbsp;
malleable, able to shapeshift, and prone to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.120
tickles. Philip stretches Flubber like a child&nbsp;
playing with a new toy. He drops Flubber, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.480
it bounces. It separates into three, and Philip&nbsp;
performs a circus act while Weebo watches in awe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.521
She takes a picture of them, capturing this&nbsp;
special moment in his life while still not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.521 --> 00:03:15.520
realizing that he's neglecting the special woman&nbsp;
in his life—the camera flash aggrevatesFlubber.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.160
The slime bounces all over the&nbsp;
place, but Philip dodges it.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.840
The slime travels through the basement&nbsp;
doors and the two rush after it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.040
They observe as it bounces around the&nbsp;
neighborhood, leaving destruction on its path.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.360
Flubber enters a home and separates into&nbsp;
countless pieces causing more mischief.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.120
They submerge into black ink and bounce all over&nbsp;
the place, instantly painting a masterpiece.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.480
Flubber is an extremely smart entity&nbsp;
that seems to be indestructible.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.240
With a baseball glove,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.080
Philip finally catches Flubber. Flubber&nbsp;
overpowers Philip and knocks him out cold.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.240
Wilson leans on his car outside the&nbsp;
church, waiting for Sara to exit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.480
She recognizes him, and they reconnect. He&nbsp;
comforts her and offers to give her a ride home.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.600
Wearing a hazmat suit, Philip and his squad handle&nbsp;
a radioactive isotope and place it in the lead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.320
containment unit. He carefully slides it under&nbsp;
a container where Flubber rests. Philip explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.320
to Weebo what he's doing, and all she can do is&nbsp;
agree with every complex idea he throws her way.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.600
The experiment aims to control Flubber’s erratic.&nbsp;
A sudden alarm interrupts them, Philip finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.680
remembers his wedding. Weebo tries to convince&nbsp;
him that he can't leave as the experiment isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.080
finished yet. Philip says that he can't miss this,&nbsp;
but Weebo explains that he's already a day late.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.560
Sara’s working in her office, and Philip&nbsp;
enters the room. He tries to explain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.760
but Sara says there's no need for&nbsp;
it. She gave him three chances,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.440
but with each one, he left her hanging&nbsp;
at the altar. Philip shows her Flubber,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.440
thinking that will make her forgive him.&nbsp;
She ignores him, but Philip doesn't give up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.600
He tries to show Sara how Flubber can save&nbsp;
the university. Philip confidently says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.600
he'll jump through the window and bounce back up&nbsp;
with the help of Flubber. As he readies himself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.920
Flubber rips the back pocket, and he falls.&nbsp;
Sara doesn't care at all and breaks up with him.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.160
Philip’s student, Bennett, comes home and rushes&nbsp;
to his father, Chester Hoenicker. He says that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.160
got kicked out of the basketball team and flunked&nbsp;
chemistry. Chester asks his henchmen how'd that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.640
happen. They said that his professor either forgot&nbsp;
or didn't understand them when they talked to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.320
His father commands the henchmen to find something&nbsp;
that'll convince Philip to change his son's grade.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.760
The henchmen arrive at Philip's house. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
Philip's busy performing another experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.520
The henchmen observe him through a window.&nbsp;
Philip applies a cream mixed with crystallized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.520
Flubber material to the golf ball. He drops&nbsp;
it, and the ball bounces around just as how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.600
Flubber did before. It coincidentally hits&nbsp;
one of the henchmen, leaving him disoriented.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.320
He repeats the process with a bowling ball.&nbsp;
It goes flying once again and hits the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.560
henchman. They lay there with red bumps on&nbsp;
their head. Philip fills a spray bottle with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.160
the mixture and squirts some on the floor&nbsp;
outside. The henchmen attempt to leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.880
making a run for it, but are surprised&nbsp;
when the ground flings them up.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.960
In his garage, Philip makes some&nbsp;
modifications to his automobile.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.960
He gets in the vehicle and takes his decked-out&nbsp;
car for a ride. He and Weebo float through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.040
neighborhood, smoothly sailing while they&nbsp;
jam out to the radio. After some twists,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.440
turns, and loops, they stop to admire the&nbsp;
night's sky. Philip turns off the ignition,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.880
and they start to fall. Philip then&nbsp;
starts the car back up right on time.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.200
Philip hovers above Sara's home to see&nbsp;
her and Wilson drinking wine on the porch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.960
As he's about to leave, Wilson leans&nbsp;
in for a kiss. Sara turns her cheek,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.960
and Philip sighs in relief. They plan to attend&nbsp;
a basketball game between their two schools.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.520
Back at the mansion, the henchmen explain to&nbsp;
Chester what happened. They say that Philip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.600
took his balls and rubs some cream on them.&nbsp;
Philip's balls bounce and hit their heads.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.400
Chester doesn't believe a word they're&nbsp;
saying, so they reveal their injuries.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.040
Philip and Weebo return home. She tries&nbsp;
to comfort him, but he says that he wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.920
to deal with it alone as this problem&nbsp;
isn't something a robot can understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.320
After a while, Weebo is seen mixing and&nbsp;
matching women's faces on the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.080
She dresses the character up, names her&nbsp;
Sylvia, and clicks on the create button.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.080
Weebo projects a hologram of Sylvia, and&nbsp;
through her, Weebo tries to kiss Philip.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.480
He suddenly awakens, and Weebo rushes down to&nbsp;
delete any trace of what she did. She feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.640
embarrassed as she positions herself to look like&nbsp;
she's been charging the entire time. Philip wakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.240
her up and says that he just got an idea; he&nbsp;
plans to bring Flubber to the basketball game.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.800
He brings a basketball with him along with a&nbsp;
spray bottle filled with the Flubber mixture.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.760
He sprays the ball and proceeds&nbsp;
to do some tricks with it. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.880
he does the same to the bottom of his shoes&nbsp;
and weighs himself down with a sack of sand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.600
Philip jumps and reaches the scoreboard. He&nbsp;
practices and almost gets slammed by his anchor.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.600
With Weeber and Weebo’s, Philip produces&nbsp;
Flubber tacks that'll help their basketball&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.360
team win against their opponents. He hopes&nbsp;
that this shows Sara that Flubber works.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.320
Philip is about to head out and reminds&nbsp;
Weebo to take care of the house and not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.720
cause any commotion. She assures Philip that&nbsp;
nothing will happen on her watch. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.920
as he drives off, she lets out a chuckle&nbsp;
indicating that she's planning something.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.600
In the locker room, Philip applies&nbsp;
the Flubber tacks onto the bottom of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.280
the shoes. The game starts, and they look&nbsp;
like kids up going up against grown men.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.920
Back at the garage, Weebo opens up the containment&nbsp;
unit of Flubber, and it comes rushing out.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.800
At the basketball game, the opponent takes&nbsp;
a commanding lead. Philip sits behind Sara&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.800
and Wilson. He cheers for the team and&nbsp;
blows his air horn next to Wilson's ear.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.760
Chester, Bennett, and their henchmen&nbsp;
sit courtside, watching the game.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.240
Philip rubs his hands with the Flubber-cream&nbsp;
mixture. He puts his palms together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.440
then accidentally hits two people&nbsp;
behind him. The team heads out;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.800
Philip shakes their hands one by one,&nbsp;
transferring the Flubber powers to them all.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.920
The ball is inbounded up high and to everyone's&nbsp;
surprise. A boy rises and snatches it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.440
He passes it to his teammate, and he&nbsp;
dribbles the ball at incredible speeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.680
Big Lawrence drives to the rim but falls as his&nbsp;
defender gets on his way. As his butt touches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.720
the floor, he gets launched up and faceplants on&nbsp;
the backboard. The ball, however, circles the rim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.480
and falls in. Everyone is in shock as the entire&nbsp;
team leaps through the court and scores again.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.280
The boy shoots the ball on the free-throw line;&nbsp;
it ends up bouncing back and forth both rings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.200
eventually going through the hoop. An overjoyed&nbsp;
Philip celebrates by hitting Wilson's head.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.400
The game proceeds, and Philip’s&nbsp;
school’s team is near winning.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.000
A player sitting on the bench notices the tack on&nbsp;
the shoes. He takes them off, which alarms Philip.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
He rushes to the team before the kid removes&nbsp;
any more of it. Philip gives him a pep talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.400
and cleans the bottom of his shoes. He throws the&nbsp;
towel, and it conveniently lands on Wilson's face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.320
Philip tells him that no matter what, he has&nbsp;
to jump or else he'll fail him in his class.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.800
The clock runs down, and an opponent&nbsp;
shoots an open jumper. The boy jumps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.400
and grabs the basketball. He somersaults&nbsp;
his way to the other side of the court,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.760
scoring the buzzer-beater. The game&nbsp;
ends with Philip’s school winning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.240
The crowd celebrates, and Sara leans in for a&nbsp;
hug with Philip, but Wilson interrupts them.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.800
Chester deduces that Philip has&nbsp;
something to do with what happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.160
and his henchmen support his theory.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.240
Sara and Wilson leave to continue&nbsp;
their date. Philip barges in and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.960
asks to talk to Sara alone, but Wilson refuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.840
An enthusiastic Philip admits to Sara that&nbsp;
it was Flubber that won them the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.400
He thinks that this will win her over, but she&nbsp;
just acknowledges him, showing no feelings at all.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.600
On his way home, Chester sees Philip's flying car.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.760
A sad Philip enters his home. He opens up to&nbsp;
Weebo about how much he regrets not caring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.360
more about his relationship with Sara.&nbsp;
Philip attributes his absent-mindedness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.560
to the fact that Sara takes up every&nbsp;
space in his brain and his heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.480
Feeling hopeless, he accepts that he has&nbsp;
lost Sara. Weebo tells him not to give up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.920
but Philip thinks that this is the best for&nbsp;
Sara, saying she deserves someone better.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.160
Weebo reflects and gathers the strength&nbsp;
to bring Philip and Sara back together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.760
She arrives at Sara's home and tries to&nbsp;
enter through the window. Sara notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.360
her outside and invites her to come in.&nbsp;
Weebo shows Sara a recording of their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.960
conversation earlier. Her eyes sparkle&nbsp;
when he hears how much Philip loves her.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.040
Sara appears in Philip's room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.640
and they kiss passionately. A&nbsp;
fulfilled Weebo gives them privacy.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.000
The two ride the flying car and talk about&nbsp;
how Flubber can help save the university.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.080
Philip suggests that they produce shoes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.720
but Sara says it’s the flying cars&nbsp;
that will fetch them a fortune.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.480
They return to the garage, and&nbsp;
Chester and his goons greet them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.720
He opens up the hood and sees the mechanism&nbsp;
behind the flying car. Chester offers them a deal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.560
but Philip asserts that they have no intention&nbsp;
of selling him the car. They give up a chance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.840
for the university's debt to be forgiven,&nbsp;
and Chester leaves with nothing in his hands.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.480
The car flies through the fields and arrives at&nbsp;
the Ford headquarters. A receptionist enters a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.800
man's room and asks if he's interested in seeing&nbsp;
Philip's car design. He refuses to meet but then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.840
hears a honk from outside his office. Philip and&nbsp;
Sara greet him and shows him a for-sale sign.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.000
Chester's henchmen break into Philip's home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.760
Weebo finds them looking for something in the&nbsp;
basement, destroying equipment in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.160
One of the henchmen sees Flubber. Weebo comes&nbsp;
rushing in, knocking one of the henchmen out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.080
She then hides and carefully calculates her&nbsp;
attacks. The other henchman makes a run for it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.080
but Weebo hunts him down with ease. She sees&nbsp;
the other standing and rushes towards him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.840
only to be met by a baseball bat, knocking&nbsp;
her out. The henchmen then take Flubber.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.880
Philip and Sara return to Philip’s ransacked&nbsp;
home. Philip tries to call Weebo, but she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.280
doesn't answer. He notices that Flubber's&nbsp;
gone and finds Weebo. His eyes tear up as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.440
he tries to talk to her. Weebo can't speak,&nbsp;
but she signals that she knows they're there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.120
Philip holds her in his hands and assures her&nbsp;
that she'll be alright. Philip says that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.040
just needs to make repairs, and she'll&nbsp;
be back to normal. However, deep down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.960
he knows the damage is too severe, and his&nbsp;
words only act as a means to comfort her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.160
Weebo turns off, and Philip bids&nbsp;
farewell to his creation and best friend.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.520
On his porch, he asks Sara what happens to the&nbsp;
soul of a machine. She replies by asking if he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.440
can fix her. Philip says that he can make repairs,&nbsp;
but he can never bring back the Weebo they know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.480
and love. He says that Weebo was special; she's&nbsp;
the only one of his creations with a personality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.240
Sara realizes something; she asks if Philip&nbsp;
remembers the word that flashed on Weebo's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.160
screen just as she turns off. He recalled&nbsp;
that the work begins with the letter S. There,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.320
on the computer, they watch Weebo in the form&nbsp;
of Sylvia saying a message she left for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.720
Weebo says that on the computer is a file of&nbsp;
her complete design. She blows Philip a kiss,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.080
saying that she hopes that he can love her&nbsp;
daughter just as much as she loved him.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.400
The two fly off to Chester's mansion for a&nbsp;
meeting. Philip agrees to sell him Flubber.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.880
However, Chester clarifies that there isn't any&nbsp;
reason to buy something already in his possession.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.680
Philip tries to say that he's the&nbsp;
only one who knows how to use Flubber,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.520
but Chester replies that he already has&nbsp;
someone working on that. Underneath the chairs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.680
Philip and Sara’s shoes have Flubber tacks.&nbsp;
Chester makes a counteroffer; he proposes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.360
he'll accept Philip's deal, but everything Philip&nbsp;
invents will belong to him for the next two years.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.120
Philip agrees. They make their way to&nbsp;
Flubber while the car engine starts.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.120
The flying vehicle floats above them&nbsp;
and parks itself adjacent to the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.320
What meets the two is Wilson.&nbsp;
Like a vulture, he sits idle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.800
always ready to sweep in and take&nbsp;
advantage of Philip's innovations.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.200
Philip shows them the Flubber-cream mixture.&nbsp;
He and Sara rub some on their hands,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.720
saying they need it to handle Flubber.&nbsp;
Philip reaches for something in his pocket,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.800
and the henchman stops him and grabs it for him.&nbsp;
It's a squirt gun that Philip intends to use to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.400
lower the container’s temperature. Chester&nbsp;
instructs his henchman to give it to him;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.560
he misinterprets it and starts squirting liquid&nbsp;
into Philip's face. Chester reiterates and says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.000
to give the squirt gun to Philip's hand; the&nbsp;
simple-minded henchman shoots Philip's hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.400
Philip stands there all wet and can't help&nbsp;
but smile. The henchman finally realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.160
and hands him the squirt gun. He opens&nbsp;
the container and talks to Flubber. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.160
car outside readies its light and points it&nbsp;
toward the room. Flubber becomes restless,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.000
and Chester commands his goons to get Philip.&nbsp;
He jumps to get out of the way, and the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.320
knock each other out. Wilson grabs hold of&nbsp;
Sara's arm, but she punches him repeatedly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.400
knocking him out. They play around with the goons&nbsp;
before eventually catching Flubber, which Sara&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.640
then throws at Chester. Flubber ricochets into&nbsp;
Wilson’s mouth, and he starts moving funnily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.960
as Flubber bounces inside him. Flubber exits&nbsp;
through his behind, and Wilson passes out.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.360
The next day, the newspaper front page&nbsp;
features Philip saving the university.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.040
At the chapel, Philip and Sara are finally&nbsp;
getting married. The priest pronounces them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.400
husband and wife, and Philip kisses the bride&nbsp;
through a video call with Weebette’s help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.880
They then ride the flying car to the reception.
