00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.400
If you woke up in a house being filled with
poison gas and were told to follow a trapped

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.810
treasure hunt to find the antidotes, what
would you do?

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.780
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
Jigsaw’s latest victims, see if we can make

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.309
better decisions, and ultimately attempt to
beat the traps in, Saw 2.

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.470
Think you can do better, let us know in the
comments!

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.700

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.380
Have a movie you’d like me to cover, reply
to this comment!

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.890
If you haven’t seen my video on Saw 1, go
check it out to see how all of the pain and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:59.059
suffering in this sequel could have been prevented.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:59.070
Alright, let’s see if we can outsmart Jigsaw
and his traps, again.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.130
We start out following a guy named Michael.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.350
His name isn’t important because he probably
won’t be with us for very long.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.009
Michael cranks the standing mirror over to
see why his eye hurts so fricking much.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.930
The results are inconclusive, but it’s definitely
not a stye.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.730
The TV turns on and an evil Dr. Phil tells
him that his career as a police informant

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.340
is over unless he proves himself worthy.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.930
The rules of the game are as follows..

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:38.280
The 
funny thing about the key he needs, is that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.010
it’s located in the clear jelly-like core
of his eyeball.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.040
This takes the phrase, ‘snitches get stitches’
to an entirely new level.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.110
Man, this makes Amanda seem lucky.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.780
She got to scalpel someone else.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.820
Michael has to scalpel himself.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.870
Jigsaw doesn’t provide a demonstration for
this trap, but I think it’s pretty clear

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.080
what will happen when this nail filled mask
slams shut.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.090
Michael’s first course of action is to scream
for help, which beautifully reverberates around

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.120
the concrete basement he’s entombed in.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.200
The wire attached to his head contraption
isn’t helping the claustrophobic feeling

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.900
of being in here, so he yanks it off.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.790
Unfortunately, this triggered the spring-loaded
clock.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.370
Based on the ticking sound, he’s got 60
seconds.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.570
You can make cupcake baking stressful by adding
a timer.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.349
This guy’s head is inside a nail filled
venus fly trap with seconds before it closes.

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.750
He better be able to think clearly under stress.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.019
The first thing he sees is a little box on
the ground next to him, which has a scalpel

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.019
in it.

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.540
You could take the scalpel as a bad sign,
or cringe at the thought of slitting your

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.970
eyeball open like a Pokeball, but at least
you have the scalpel.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.010
It could be worse.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.959
Jigsaw could have left him with nothing and
forced him to dig his fingers into his eye

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.409
socket and rip his eyeball out to get the
key.

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.170
Michael can’t muster up the nerve to dig
through his eye before his time runs out,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.940
and his game ends.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.780
Let’s rewind and see what Michael could
have done to beat this trap without performing

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.370
surgery on himself.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.990
Right off the bat, he shouldn’t have yanked
the wire out which initiated the countdown

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.540
and caused his stress levels to go nuclear.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.430
I think this is a reasonable error he could
have avoided.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.970
When Jigsaw was talking about the ‘spring-loaded’
timer on his death mask, Michael had felt

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.989
around and located a circular device with
a glass face which was attached to the wire.

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.309
He could also have confirmed this by using
the mirror.

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:28.150
It’s not a stretch to think that in order
for a ‘spring-loaded’ timer to be activated,

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.219
something holding the spring-loaded has to
be removed.

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:35.189
It should have been obvious that it was the
wired pin inserted into the timer.

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:38.889
The next move would be to try to figure out
a way to dismantle the pulley system which

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.029
could pull the wire and set the trap off.

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:45.180
Even with the trigger disarmed, you’d still
want to get the bear trap off your head in

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.990
case it was set off somehow.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.619
Using the mirror and feeling around, he’d
see that this head contraption was mounted

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:55.259
on a leather harness with a waist band and
shoulder straps secured by padlocks.

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.849
The device looks like a single piece design
that was slipped over his head.

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:03.009
What also makes me think that, is that the
key he needs to find unlocks the padlocks

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.050
on his harness, not the device.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.370
He could use the scalpel to cut the straps
and lift the device off over his head.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.569
If Michael had pulled the pin and started
the timer by accident, I still think he could

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.649
have cut the leather straps off in time to
slip the device off before it snapped shut.

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:22.080
If I’m wrong and it is a two piece design
that was tightly fitted around his neck and

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.520
couldn’t be lifted off, well, then that
sucks, especially if he’s on the clock.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.169
His only option besides getting the key is
to jam the device by either shoving the flimsy

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.149
toolbox in between the levers by his neck,
or put the metal stool over his head.

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:40.939
Bear traps can exert up to 1000 pounds of
pressure, so I'd go with the stool and not

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:42.249
the thin metal box.

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:46.610
Michael circumventing this trap by jamming
it or cutting himself loose might not be enough

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.389
to beat it if he’s locked in a concrete
cell.

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.789
Jigsaw usually requires his victim to sacrifice
their pound of flesh in order to be free’d,

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.099
so the door may not be opened for him until
he obtains the key.

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:01.879
Digging through his vitreous humour to find
the key to the door is still a last ditch

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:02.879
move.

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:06.610
I’d try to wait a few days before putting
myself under the knife in hopes that someone

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:07.610
found me.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.180
Turns out, this was a good call.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.939
Michael’s body was found by county asbestos
cleaners a day or so later.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:18.289
Detective Allison Kerry is the lead on the
case, but she brings Detective Eric Matthews

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:20.629
in because Michael was his informant.

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:25.580
Or I should say, they think the body was his
informant based on the writing on the ceiling

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:32.539
and the video tapes.

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:37.979
Eric is able to identify the body as his informant
based on a tattoo, so Allison pries further

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:41.779
to see if he has any idea who would be capable
of engineering all this.

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:43.319
Eric’s no Jim Gordon.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:48.129
He’s completely unmotivated to take on this
case with the backdrop of his crumbling family

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:51.240
life, even after being called out by Jigsaw
himself.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.009
Back at the police station, Allison’s reviewing
the tapes trying to find clues.

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:59.959
She’s not very good at her job, so she ropes
Eric in to take Jigsaw’s bait in hopes that

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:01.649
she can catch a lead off of it.

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:06.610
Look, I’m no detective, but does following
a serial killer's clues ever really help you?

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.270
They wouldn’t have given you a clue if they
thought it’d lead to them getting caught.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.939
Eric wakes up in the middle of the night when
he’s suddenly hit with the realization that

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:18.759
Michael’s device had the logo of the abandoned
Wilson Steel factory on it.

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:23.039
Obvious bait, but Eric think’s he’s more
clever than he actually is and calls Allison

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:24.039
with the news.

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:28.919
Allison should know from investigating Jigsaw’s
previous victims that he isn’t stupid and

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:32.649
wouldn’t leave clues out like this unless
he wanted them to show up at the factory and

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:34.490
play another one of his games.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.550
What would I do if I was Allison?

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.020
Not go into the factory.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.610
Has Allison already forgotten what happened
to Detective Tapp and Sing?

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.029
Besides being dangerous as hell, you’re
just playing into his hand.

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:48.479
I would get the blueprint for the factory
and stake out all the exits.

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:50.919
Jigsaw wants us to run into his funhouse.

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:52.969
He wants us to play his game.

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:57.129
By playing hard to get, Jigsaw might emerge
from hiding in order to tempt our attention

00:07:57.129 --> 00:07:58.129
again.

00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:02.429
Again, Allison’s a sitty detective with
no leads so far, so she’s perfectly fine

00:08:02.429 --> 00:08:05.199
letting Eric walk right into a trap.

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:08.970
At least they got a warrant and called in
a SWAT team instead of bum rushing in like

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.439
Detective Tapp and Sing did in Saw 1.

00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:20.069
The SWAT team makes entry, but as expected,
the factory is trapped.

00:08:20.069 --> 00:08:24.119
The other SWAT operators apparently didn’t
hear the buzzing sound of the metal fencing

00:08:24.119 --> 00:08:30.659
being electrified or thought it was just the
sound of the lights.

00:08:30.659 --> 00:08:36.610
The rest of the SWAT team pushes through to
the second floor and finds Jigsaw doodling

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.539
out some new trap designs while eating Cheerios.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:44.080
They cuff him up and Eric rolls in to drop
the one-liner he was practicing on the drive

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.879
over.

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:51.279
This just show’s Eric’s naivety and why
he shouldn’t be on the case.

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:55.680
When taking down the evil mastermind is this
easy, and they are that calm when apprehended,

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.550
you should be wondering how you’re getting
played instead of getting cocky.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.279
Jigsaw tells Eric that instead of going straight
to a jail cell, he’ll hang out here while

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:07.279
Eric deals with the problem in the room across
from them.

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:10.920
Right about now it should be hitting them
that they fricked up coming here.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.149
The SWAT team captain tosses a pipe to the
fencing to make sure it’s not electrified,

00:09:15.149 --> 00:09:17.930
which is a good call considering what happened
earlier.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:22.850
Eric and Allison enter and uncover a bunch
of monitors displaying Jigsaw’s latest victims

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:23.850
in a trap.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:33.580
One of those victims is Daniel, Eric’s son.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:37.080
What happened to the United States does not
negotiate with terrorists.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.230
Throw this demented cancer patient in a hole
and throw away the hole.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.029
He thinks he has leverage because he thinks
he can get you to play his game.

00:09:44.029 --> 00:09:49.399
Villains like Jigsaw orchestrate their escapes
by throwing victims at the police as distractions.

00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:51.310
The way to end it is by not negotiating.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:55.040
You just take the L on those victims and eliminate
the target.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.529
It’s not the most political move, but it
stops this sit dead in its tracks and heavily

00:09:59.529 --> 00:10:03.899
disincentivizes future terrorists because
it’s no longer an effective strategy.

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:07.149
It’s like John Wick dome shotting Santino
in the Continental.

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:11.439
If Allison wanted to take the trophy home
on the Jigsaw case, this is the out of the

00:10:11.439 --> 00:10:14.650
box thinking that Jigsaw would not expect
whatsoever.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:18.680
Of course she’d have to take charge and
pull Eric off the case ASAP before Jigsaw

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:24.040
got Eric too emotionally invested, because
in this situation, taking the L on the victims

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.720
means his son might die.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:30.029
Eric calls his son’s phone number and Jigsaw
tells him to leave a message after the beep.

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:32.990
Yep, it’s confirmed, his son’s in deep
sit.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.500
But everyone needs to take a deep breath here.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.350
Jigsaw’s trying to get everyone tilted.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.779
Let’s think this through.

00:10:38.779 --> 00:10:43.399
From Allison’s investigation of all of Jigsaw’s
previous cases, she would know that he often

00:10:43.399 --> 00:10:48.800
speaks with loaded phrases that are more literal
than they seem, so Eric needs to be relaying

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.040
everything he hears Jigsaw say to Allison,
especially things like this..

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:59.370
This completely contradicts what he just said
moments earlier.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.920
About Daniel having 2 hours before the poisonous
gas breaks his tissue down and floods his

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.170
lungs with blood.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.790
The 2 hours thing is bothering me for another
reason too.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:08.790
There are 7 victims in the trap on the monitor.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.220
Jigsaw says that he hasn’t checked the monitors
in a bit, but he thinks they have about 2

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.050
hours left before they are dead.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:15.240
This is a tight timeline.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.240
Too tight.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.759
I don’t really buy that Jigsaw put the victims
in there, and timed the police arrival perfectly

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:24.329
so that there was 2 hours remaining before
the gas killed the victims.

00:11:24.329 --> 00:11:27.189
He even put a clock in there with 2 hours
counting down.

00:11:27.189 --> 00:11:31.620
If Eric hadn’t had his revelation quickly
enough, hesitated a little, or the police

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.839
just didn’t gear up and make it to the factory
as quickly as they did, the victims would

00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:39.040
all be dead and the meta game involving Eric
wouldn’t work.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.160
The counter-points would be that Jigsaw had
the gas flow on a remote, and triggered it

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.580
when the police showed up.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.579
Or that he had help that triggered it when
the police showed up to the factory.

00:11:47.579 --> 00:11:51.899
It does make sense that he had help, a late
stage cancer patient wouldn’t be able to

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:54.720
snare 7 people and drag them into a trap room.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.779
These both still don’t explain the incredibly
coincidental timing of when they showed up

00:11:58.779 --> 00:12:03.439
to the factory, and when the victims woke
up, found the cassette tape, and started progressing

00:12:03.439 --> 00:12:04.439
through the trap.

00:12:04.439 --> 00:12:07.060
For all they know, this isn’t real time
footage at all.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.589
They need to bring in a computer forensics
team to start investigating the feed and broadcasting

00:12:11.589 --> 00:12:16.189
location, which they do, as well as bring
in a bomb squad team to help the SWAT team

00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:20.769
turn this factory inside out looking for anything
useful, which they don’t do.

00:12:20.769 --> 00:12:24.779
Apparently everyone thinks sitting on their
asses watching Jigsaw’s reality TV is going

00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:25.939
to solve the case.

00:12:25.939 --> 00:12:30.779
Jigsaw tells Eric that he just wants to talk
to him alone, which Eric reluctantly agrees

00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:31.779
to.

00:12:31.779 --> 00:12:40.220
He does sneak a radio in too so Allison can
listen in.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.329
With Jigsaw in their custody, how could he
possibly ensure the safety and security of

00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:48.430
Daniel by sitting here talking with Eric when
Daniel’s in a trapped house being filled

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.720
with poison gas with 6 other desperate strangers.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.319
The most reasonable answer is he can’t.

00:12:54.319 --> 00:12:58.680
Even if Jigsaw technically didn’t specify
whether Daniel would be dead or alive when

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.240
returned, he still couldn’t ensure that
his corpse was in a ‘safe’ and ‘secure’

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.240
state.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.290
Based on the previous cases Allison is aware
of, Jigsaw has honored the rules of the games

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:12.949
he’s created, even if he lies or double
speaks about some aspects, and winning is

00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:13.949
an option.

00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:18.579
So if winning is an option for Eric, then
technically the only way for Jigsaw to ensure

00:13:18.579 --> 00:13:24.259
the conditions and availability of the prize,
AKA Daniel, is to already have Daniel in a

00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:25.680
safe place somewhere.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:30.009
The fact that the time coordination between
Eric and Daniel’s game is highly implausible,

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:35.139
and outcome coordination of Daniel’s game
is near impossible would make me very suspicious

00:13:35.139 --> 00:13:36.769
that this is pre-recorded footage.

00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:40.779
And the longer Daniel survives in the game
on the monitor, the higher the probability

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:42.449
that this is pre-recorded.

00:13:42.449 --> 00:13:47.249
They could also try to bluff Jigsaw by confronting
him about how they ‘know’ it’s pre-recorded,

00:13:47.249 --> 00:13:51.990
that the screen feed is paused or stuck, that
Daniel is dead and they are taking him to

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.990
jail now.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.259
Jigsaw can’t see the monitors, so if he
expressed that he knew anything it’d be

00:13:56.259 --> 00:13:57.259
suspect.

00:13:57.259 --> 00:14:01.370
The interesting thing about this game is that
Jigsaw is in police custody.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:05.680
If Eric puts on some beethoven and kicks his
feet up, Daniel will be returned to him and

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.240
Jigsaw would go to jail.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.930
Seems like an outcome Jigsaw would want to
avoid, but he might not care because he’s

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.480
almost dead, and whoever is helping him will
continue his legacy.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.180
Still, not exactly a preferable way to go
out.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.750
Nor is it interesting.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.560
Jigsaw has demonstrated that he knows Eric’s
shady off the books tendencies.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.180
If I was Allison, I’d anticipate Jigsaw
baiting Eric into doing something stupid to

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:32.249
get his son back, which will entail wittingly
or unwittingly helping Jigsaw escape.

00:14:32.249 --> 00:14:36.529
How could Eric possibly walk out of here with
Jigsaw without them being able to follow?

00:14:36.529 --> 00:14:40.569
Well, if they paid attention, secured the
blueprints for the building, and properly

00:14:40.569 --> 00:14:45.870
secured the area, they’d know that Jigsaw
is sitting in a utility elevator.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.680
Convenient that he’d want to remain there
for the duration of the game.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.379
I wouldn’t bag Jigsaw right now, or let
him know that I knew his plan.

00:14:52.379 --> 00:14:56.209
Daniel could still be anywhere, so we need
Jigsaw to lead us to him.

00:14:56.209 --> 00:15:00.540
We start following the 7 unlucky contestants
in the trap house being filled with poison

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.540
gas.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.009
Well, they don’t know that yet.

00:15:03.009 --> 00:15:07.069
While they definitely aren’t in jail, they
are being held captive with a camera watching

00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:08.100
their movements.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.059
Daniel graciously points out that those types
of cameras don’t have sound.

00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:16.850
A woman named Amanda, who we’re all familiar
with, wakes up with a look of horror and panic

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:17.949
on her face.

00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:21.899
She immediately starts running around checking
every nook and cranny until she finds the

00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:23.829
infamous cassette recorder.

00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:26.370
Not exactly a subtle move on her part.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.119
Now everyone knows that she knows what’s
going on.

00:15:29.119 --> 00:15:31.079
She hits play on the cassette recorder..

00:15:31.079 --> 00:15:48.699
He then goes on to say that several antidotes
are hidden around the house, 1 of which is

00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:50.089
in the safe in this room.

00:15:50.089 --> 00:15:54.720
He says they each have the combination numbers
for the safe written on the back of their

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.819
minds, and the order of the numbers can be
found over the rainbow.

00:15:57.819 --> 00:16:03.279
I don’t see any rainbows, but maybe there’s
a box of lucky charms with instructions inside.

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:07.959
Jigsaw also says that once they realize what
they have in common, they will better understand

00:16:07.959 --> 00:16:09.010
why they are here.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.620
For this clue, X marks the spot.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.240
Finding out what they have in common doesn’t
sound like it leads to an antidote, so this

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.790
is a waste of time.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.759
There’s no point in covering your mouth
with clothing or anything like that.

00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:25.640
Nerve gas vapor can permeate your skin, so
clothing or a paper mask won’t stop it.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.709
Amanda should know from helping Jigsaw set
up traps and being a previous victim that

00:16:29.709 --> 00:16:32.250
his phrasing is loaded and often literal.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.449
She should be checking the back of their heads
&amp; necks for numbers.

00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:38.101
This is later revealed to be where Jigsaw
hid the numbers.

00:16:38.101 --> 00:16:39.101
It shouldn’t be too hard for Amanda to figure
out that the numbers were colored, and with

00:16:39.101 --> 00:16:40.101
7 victims in the trap and 7 letters in the
ROYGBIV acronym, this is how the combination

00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:41.101
is ordered.

00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:43.579
The vault only contains 1 antidote based on
Jigsaw’s message, so she needs to be secretive

00:16:43.579 --> 00:16:47.449
about collecting the others’ numbers, and
then she needs to get herself alone with the

00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:49.519
vault so the others don’t fight her for
it.

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:53.050
Amanda doesn’t seem to have learned much
from her time with Jigsaw.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:55.410
That or she’s not actually a victim here..

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:58.270
Xavier picks up a letter on the ground with
a key attached to it.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:02.600
It says, do not attempt to use this key in
the door to this room.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.709
Neglecting Amanda’s warnings, Xavier tries
to unlock the door with the key while Gus

00:17:06.709 --> 00:17:10.300
looks through the peephole.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.970
Okay.. let’s not break the rules from now
on.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.339
This trap was odd.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:17.920
Why was the gun aimed through the peephole?

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.730
It's extremely unlikely that someone would
be looking through the peephole while they

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.699
or someone else simultaneously unlocked the
door.

00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:28.370
It would make more sense to aim the barrel
of the gun through the doorknob so that the

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:31.500
bullet was directed straight into the person
trying to open it.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:36.300
The other victims start questioning Amanda
as to how she knew about the rules, the tape,

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.300
and Jigsaw.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.190
Amanda tells them that she’s played one
of his games before.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.790
Yah, I'd neglect to mention that I was Jigsaw’s
apprentice too.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:47.659
Everyone buys her half of the story, and starts
turning the room inside out trying to find

00:17:47.659 --> 00:17:49.820
the key to the vault with no luck.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.720
The door to the room suddenly opens by itself.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.850
It appears to have been on a time delay.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:58.740
They all start dispersing through the house
looking for clues, but the more intelligent

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.880
victims are also grabbing weapons.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.610
These antidotes are sparse.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:06.150
Unless this herd gets thinned out a lot, there
won’t be enough for all of them.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.440
It should go without saying that they should
be treading very lightly and using extreme

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.950
caution when manipulating any objects unless
they want to end up like Gus.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.049
That means not fixing crooked picture frames.

00:18:17.049 --> 00:18:21.730
Jesus dude, that’s one of the most well-known
types of booby-traps out there.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:26.230
Xavier tries using the spiked bat to break
down the door labeled exit, but it’s metal

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.230
reinforced.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:31.080
Gee, I'm shocked that the door labeled exit
wasn’t actually an exit.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.549
I do think Xavier has the right idea.

00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:36.100
He’s just thinking a little too in the box.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.190
This is an entire house, not a tiny concrete
room.

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:44.330
I highly doubt the entire building is covered
in metal barricades, more likely they just

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.690
cover the weak points like windows and doors.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:51.419
The 7 of them with access to weapons and tools
should be able to knock down a wall or break

00:18:51.419 --> 00:18:54.029
through the weaker ceilings within 2 hours.

00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:57.980
If they attempted this, they’d want to blind
the cameras too, just in case their captor

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.900
was watching and decided to up the gas flow
for breaking the rules.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:06.409
Laura finds a door leading down into the basement,
where they find another cassette tape stuck

00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:11.570
in a doll with a note for Obi.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:20.510
Welp, Obi’s dead.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:27.529
There’s no way the others let him walk out
of here after hearing that and Laura’s witness

00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:29.480
testimony of Obi abducting her.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:34.220
Obi tries to save his own ass by volunteering
to go into the furnace to get the needles,

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.320
saying that he gets one if he makes it out.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.770
I know nobody wants to volunteer to go into
an obviously trapped furnace, but putting

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:45.309
two antidotes in the hands of the sociopath
who kidnapped all of you isn’t a good idea

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:46.309
either.

00:19:46.309 --> 00:19:49.570
And really, if you don’t get those antidotes,
you’re dead anyways.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:53.190
Jonas questions whether or not they should
even be getting and sticking themselves with

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.190
these needles, and up until now I'd have agreed
with him.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:00.080
But with everyone starting to collapse and
cough up blood, I don’t think they have

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.080
a choice.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.691
Before going in they should check for gas
lines and shut them if possible, jam the door

00:20:04.691 --> 00:20:08.880
open and have someone hold his feet ready
to pull him out if sit goes south, as well

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.429
as check for any additional engineering that
was done to the furnace.

00:20:12.429 --> 00:20:17.400
They know from Gus and the peephole cannon
that Jigsaw uses rather unsophisticated mechanics

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.919
that they need to watch for.

00:20:18.919 --> 00:20:22.890
Like this obvious pulley right next to the
door that Obi completely misses.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:27.919
Again, I wouldn’t have sent a selfish bastard
like Obi in, but since they did, they might

00:20:27.919 --> 00:20:31.289
as well ensure his safety so he brings back
the antidotes.

00:20:31.289 --> 00:20:34.570
Obi finds the antidotes dangling from chains
hanging on the ceiling of the furnace.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:35.570
This guy’s like Marv from Home Alone.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:36.570
Harry, I’ve reached the antidotes.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.380
When he goes to pull the second antidote,
instead of carefully pulling the syringe from

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:45.390
the chain, he just yanks the chain connected
to the pulley and wire connected to the door

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.429
pulls it shut and ignites the furnace.

00:20:47.429 --> 00:20:52.600
God damn this was so obvious it hurts, but
this was the same dipsit who fixed the crooked

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.409
picture frames in a booby trapped house.

00:20:55.409 --> 00:21:00.670
There’s a nozzle across the flames that
says twist me, which based on the tapes is

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.850
a method for extinguishing the flames.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:07.140
Obi’s too much of a botch to take the hit
and twist the nozzle, so he goes up in flames

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.890
along with the antidotes.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:16.900
The others break the back window and Obi manages
to squeeze his head and arm through, but it’s

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:17.900
too late.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.230
Obi is dust and ashes from the neck down.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:23.559
They check to see if that was the hand holding
the needles, but nope.

00:21:23.559 --> 00:21:28.010
To be fair to Obi, the antidotes weren’t
ranking high on the priority list at the time.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.700
Everyone’s really starting to succumb to
the effects by now.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.350
They’ve already burned away an hour and
still haven’t gotten any antidotes.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:38.429
Xavier and the others find a semi-stuck door
and try to force their way in.

00:21:38.429 --> 00:21:42.480
I swear, the nerve gas must be affecting their
vision, because I don’t know how they don’t

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.940
see the pulley and wire right above the door.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:49.420
He forces it open, pulling the pin on the
clock on the door across the room which shows

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.010
4 minutes counting down.

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:55.110
Muscles runs over and tries to open the metal
vault door with his bare hands.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:59.060
This guys the living embodiment of the saying,
when all you have is a hammer, everything

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.159
looks like a nail.

00:22:00.159 --> 00:22:16.460
Jonas finds the cassette tape with Xavier’s
name on it and pops it into the cassette recorder.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.250
After finishing the tape and realizing their
mission, they only have 2 minutes left to

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.850
find the key in the needlestack.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:26.960
Jigsaw wants us to jump in and start hand
digging for it, which is a terrible method.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.419
Shuffling the needles around is far too slow.

00:22:29.419 --> 00:22:33.730
I’d have two people with shoes grab the
crate and baby carriage and start bucketing

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:34.760
out the needles.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:39.410
By dispersing the needles over a greater area
and removing them from the pool, others can

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:42.180
more easily sift through them and check for
the key.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:46.340
Meanwhile, another two people can use the
spiked bat and shovel that Amanda was previously

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.929
holding to fish around.

00:22:47.929 --> 00:22:51.659
This chain gang isn’t in a cooperative,
team-first mindset.

00:22:51.659 --> 00:22:55.940
Xavier grabs Amanda and throws her into the
pit of needles, presumably because she was

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:01.049
a junkie and would be the most comfortable
with the situation.

00:23:01.049 --> 00:23:08.380
Everyone’s yelling at him for being an asshole,
which he is, but at least he acted.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.700
None of you botches were doing anything.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:15.500
Once Amanda gets past the initial shock factor,
she starts scrambling around and miraculously

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.750
finds the key which conveniently has a glow
tube attached to it for visibility.

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:24.460
She tosses it to Xavier who fumbles the key
at the 10 yard line, causing the door to be

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:28.120
locked, the antidote to be lost, and all Amanda’s
work to be in vain.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.960
They’ve lost every antidote so far, their
time’s running out, and their chance of

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.350
securing more antidotes is slim.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.179
Even if they get another antidote, it’s
not enough for all of them.

00:23:37.179 --> 00:23:39.900
It’s time for plan B, which is busting through
the wall.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:43.870
Xavier of all people correctly guesses the
solution to the number riddle.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:47.639
I’d have guessed that the combo had something
to do with them all being prisoners, like

00:23:47.639 --> 00:23:49.500
their cell or inmate numbers.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.600
Nope, Jigsaw just sharpied the number on the
back of their necks.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.940
Gus has a red number 2 on his neck.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.169
Now he just has to get everyone else's number.

00:23:57.169 --> 00:24:02.269
Jonas wants to help, but with only one antidote
in the vault and Xavier’s test-rage kicking

00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:03.880
in, peace was never an option.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:09.789
Jonas has some moves, but not enough to keep
him alive.

00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:13.500
Jonas’ number is a yellow 16.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.730
Xavier’s lucky that Obi popped his head
out of the furnace, but even if Obi turned

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:21.090
to ashes, he might still be able to brute
force the last number in time.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.990
Obi’s number is a green 11.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:25.850
I hope he’s writing these down.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.299
The others are oblivious to this and still
trying to find clues.

00:24:29.299 --> 00:24:33.519
As Laura chokes to death on her vomit, she
points out the X crack in a glass picture

00:24:33.519 --> 00:24:34.519
frame.

00:24:34.519 --> 00:24:38.090
Behind it is a picture of Daniel with his
Dad, the man who put them all in prison with

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.260
planted evidence.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.470
As expected, nobody really cares too much.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:44.580
It’s not like Jigsaw hid an antidote inside
Daniel.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.860
Addison decided that she couldn’t trust
them, so she braves a new trap room by herself.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:52.960
There’s a plexiglass box hanging from the
ceiling with two holes in the bottom and an

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.960
antidote inside.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.179
There’s also a note with a cassette tape,
but she doesn’t have the player so she won’t

00:24:58.179 --> 00:24:59.600
be getting any hints.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.250
Addison’s immediate action is shoving her
hands into the boxes holes without any inspection,

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.679
testing, or caution.

00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:10.380
Never stick your hands in unfamiliar holes,
that’s just common sense general life advice.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:14.159
She should have used a foot of the wooden
chair behind her to stick in the hole to test

00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:17.200
it, or just visually checked it from the top
and bottom.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.309
Then she could use the stick to keep the blades
up while she ‘carefully’ pulled the antidote

00:25:21.309 --> 00:25:23.090
out from the plunger side.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:27.500
Once her hand is inside the box, she tries
to grab the antidote, but tugged on the capsule

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.190
which separated it from the plunger and released
the contents.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:32.809
Another antidote down the drain.

00:25:32.809 --> 00:25:39.330
When she tries to pull her hand out, the blades
cinch in and trap her wrist.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:44.010
I think she could squeeze her other hand into
the same whole and push the blades up with

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:45.309
her fingers to free her hand.

00:25:45.309 --> 00:25:49.370
If it’s too tight, maybe she could shove
her belt up into it or something.

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:53.511
Addison’s not the smartest tool in the shed,
so she shoves her other hand in the other

00:25:53.511 --> 00:25:56.190
hole to grab the empty syringe capsule.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.960
Must be the poison affecting her.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.230
Writhing is just going to make things worse.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:04.210
She might be able to shove her arms in further
and hold up the opposing side’s blades to

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:08.470
get one arm free, then get her remaining arm
free using the methods we already mentioned.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.070
But yah, at this point she’s pretty stuck.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:15.980
She doesn’t realize Xavier’s on a murdering
rampage yet, so from her POV calling for help

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.769
is the best option now.

00:26:17.769 --> 00:26:21.690
Xavier arrives with no intention of helping,
and pulls her hair back to get her number.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:22.690
Green 9.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:26.360
Amanda discovers Jonas’s caved in skull
and hears Xavier yelling to find them.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.510
He’s already hell bent on killing them,
but Daniel dropping the picture sure as sit

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:31.510
didn’t help.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.679
In Xavier’s chase he finds Laura’s body
and collects her number too.

00:26:34.679 --> 00:26:37.500
Amanda and Daniel wedge the door shut against
Xavier.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.279
It seems like they are stuck until Amanda
finds a secret basement door.

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:45.230
They escape through it and wind up in a dead
end, which also happens to be the bathroom

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:46.440
from Saw 1.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.080
Adam didn’t age too well, nor did Zep or
Lawrence’s foot.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.200
Xavier chases them down, but before he kills
them for their numbers Amanda hits him with

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.120
the big Q. How will he get his own number?

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.720
This distracts Xavier into cutting his neck
skin off to get it, which opens an opportunity

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:08.860
for Daniel to saw his carotid artery open.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.720
That was the same Saw Lawrence used on his
foot.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.720
Nasty.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.750
Xavier really should have killed them before
the self-surgery.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:19.130
Sidenote, Xavier made it pretty damn far without
dying from the poison.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:20.130
Dude was a tank.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.080
Amanda and Daniel on the other hand, never
showed any symptoms.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:28.159
I don’t think a nerve gas was being pumped
in, I think everyone was poisoned except Amanda

00:27:28.159 --> 00:27:29.159
and Daniel.

00:27:29.159 --> 00:27:32.820
Makes sense, Daniel has to live for Eric’s
metagame to work.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.679
Amanda not being poisoned, however, is extremely
suspicious.

00:27:36.679 --> 00:27:41.649
Back in the factory, Eric loses his mind watching
all this go down and tries to beat his son’s

00:27:41.649 --> 00:27:42.970
location out of Jigsaw.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:47.480
Allison, this is what Jigsaw wants, why haven’t
you talked sense into Eric.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:52.380
Again, the fact that Daniel is still alive
means that the probability of this being pre-recorded

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.070
is very high, otherwise Jigsaw’s meta game
falls apart.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.850
Jigsaw says, “game over”, and that he
will take Eric to Daniel on the condition

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.440
that nobody follows them.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.380
And there it is, Jigsaw’s brilliant escape
plan.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.480
Eric hit’s the elevator button which takes
them to the underground garage where his getaway

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.500
car is parked.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:14.179
Allison was just completely gobsmacked by
this wholly unpredictable move.

00:28:14.179 --> 00:28:19.029
There was just no way of anticipating that
Jigsaw had an escape plan or could have known

00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:20.679
he was sitting in an elevator.

00:28:20.679 --> 00:28:24.440
Eric should have grabbed the radio before
leaving so he could let the SWAT team know

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.250
his location after Jigsaw spills the beans.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:32.000
Right after their escape, the tech team gets
a lock on the location the broadcast was originating

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
from.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.279
Jigsaw leads Eric to the house, and Eric hops
out and heads inside without taking literally

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:38.950
any precautions.

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:43.159
He should have brought the radio or used his
cell phone to call in his location now that

00:28:43.159 --> 00:28:44.159
he arrived.

00:28:44.159 --> 00:28:48.000
He should have cuffed Jigsaw to the car, knee-caped,
or killed him right there.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.230
Why Eric in all his rage didn’t kill Jigsaw
once they arrived is beyond me.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:57.019
I get that Eric thinks he’s on a time crunch,
but waiting 5-10 minutes for SWAT to get there

00:28:57.019 --> 00:29:00.840
seems reasonable given the danger Jigsaw’s
trap houses pose.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.880
The police show up to the house where the
broadcast was originating from, except it’s

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.600
not the house the victims were in that Jigsaw
led Eric too.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.389
It was a proxy house that was serving up old
footage.

00:29:11.389 --> 00:29:15.460
The timer hits zero and buzzes open a vault
in the corner of the room.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.850
Inside is little Daniel, breathing through
a mask.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:21.399
I’m going to assume that he didn’t make
a peep this whole time because he was breathing

00:29:21.399 --> 00:29:24.190
in sleeping gas until the timer hit zero.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:27.470
Still, nobody checked what the countdown timer
was hooked up too?

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:31.450
Are the bomb and geek squad they brought in
really that fricking incompetent?

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:35.240
Eric makes his way down into the basement
where Xavier’s body has been rotting for

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.240
days.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.770
If only he brought his radio or someone called
him with the news that Daniel was safe.

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.330
It looks like there is someone in the tub
in the back of the bathroom.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:47.400
In his approach, he stupidly holsters his
weapon and gets within jump-scare distance.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.400
Why.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.400
Just why.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:56.630
Eric’s stupidity finally catches up with
him.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:30:00.220
What is with pigmask abducting people with
the worst strategy imaginable.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:04.880
You’re going to hide in a tub, in the trap
house that Eric thinks his son was murdered,

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.679
with dead bodies everywhere, with a pig uniform
on, in hopes that he holsters his gun and

00:30:09.679 --> 00:30:12.960
gets close enough to you so you can stab him
with a syringe.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.899
Eric wakes up chained to the wall with a cassette
tape next to him.

00:30:15.899 --> 00:30:18.620
At this point do you even need to listen to
the tape?

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.590
You have to realize you’re an idiot who's
completely fricked himself.

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:25.590
He hit’s play and Amanda basically tells
him it’s game over and he’s going to rot

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:31.940
in the bathroom like Adam.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:36.039
The movie ends with Jigsaw chuckling at the
thought of Eric getting played like a fiddle.

00:30:36.039 --> 00:30:40.320
Let’s recap the pivotal points where different
decisions could have altered who lived and

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.320
died.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.649
Breaking out of the house was an option in
my opinion.

00:30:43.649 --> 00:30:47.659
Then they could all hit up the hospital and
reveal the location of Jigsaw’s base.

00:30:47.659 --> 00:30:51.529
Gus looking through the peephole was unnecessary
and unlucky.

00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:52.820
He was always dead.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:57.139
Obi’s death was entirely preventable, and
they could have secured two antidotes.

00:30:57.139 --> 00:31:01.789
Xavier not seeing the pulley above the stuck
door was pretty dumb as well.

00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:05.160
They could have secured another antidote,
leaving three in need.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.509
Addison’s trap was also entirely beatable.

00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:08.890
That’s another antidote.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.679
Xavier wouldn’t have been so aggressive
and desperate with all these antidotes, and

00:31:12.679 --> 00:31:14.990
with his brains, they’d have secured one
more antidote.

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.990
Interestingly, there’s only 5 antidotes.

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.990
This somewhat confirms my suspicion that Amanda
and Daniel were never poisoned.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.990
This all seems well and good, but I doubt
the antidotes were effective.

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.990
Like the overdosed man in Amanda’s first
game, they were merely pawns in Amanda, Daniel,

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:19.990
and Eric’s games.

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.990
So all of them were dead no matter what.

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.990
If the detectives weren’t morons they would
have deduced that there was a high probability

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:24.200
of the game being prerecorded, checked what
the countdown timer was linked to, turned

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:28.620
the factory inside out, got the blueprints
to the factory, realized that Jigsaw was sitting

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:33.490
in an elevator, and anticipated Jigsaw’s
game likely involved an escape plan involving

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:36.240
Eric, Jigsaw likely wouldn’t have been successful.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:41.179
If Eric had radioed in his location, the SWAT
team would have raided the actual house, taken

00:31:41.179 --> 00:31:44.340
down Amanda and Jigsaw, and saved Eric’s
life.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:48.159
Even if Amanda fled, there’s substantial
evidence that points to her being connected

00:31:48.159 --> 00:31:49.159
with Jigsaw.

00:31:49.159 --> 00:31:53.289
Her being involved and surviving two games
means she has recurring ties to him.

00:31:53.289 --> 00:31:57.640
Daniel’s negative toxicology reports and
Amanda surviving with him to the end without

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.700
showing any symptoms is indicative that she
wasn’t poisoned either.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.700
As a detective you have to ask why.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:07.600
All said and done, I think we could have beaten
the traps from Saw 2.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.320
Thanks for watching, and remember, be a good
person and value each day you’re alive.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.079
Or you might end up in a psychopath’s torture
dungeon.
