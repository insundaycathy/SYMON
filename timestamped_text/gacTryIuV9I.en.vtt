00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.579
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:06.789
Today I'm going to show you a mystery, action,
crime film called “Minority Report.”

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:07.789
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:10.140
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.850
In the year 2054, three oracle-like beings
called pre-cognitives or precogs appeared.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.820
The precogs have the ability to see glimpses
of the future in visions and can see hours

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.460
to even days ahead.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.490
An experimental branch of crime-fighting called
the Department of Precrime is created, and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.850
they use the precogs in stopping murders before
they occur.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.190
John Anderton is chief of the precrime division
and personally leads a task force responding

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.170
to potential murders.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.130
When the precogs have a vision of a murder,
the visuals are transferred to a screen where

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.790
the task force analyses the footage to determine
the time and place of the murder.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.440
Every time a crime is confirmed to happen,
two wooden balls are produced containing the

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.170
names of the victim and the perpetrator.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.430
John arrives at the department and gets the
first assignment for the day, a murder perpetrated

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.290
by a man who has caught his wife having an
affair.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.190
John sifts through the image, trying to determine
the location of the crime.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.000
With careful deduction and attention to detail,
John finds where the married couple is living.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
As they were preparing to disembark, Danny
Witwer comes in from the Justice Department

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.940
to do an inquest on the precrime department
to look for any potential errors or flaws

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.530
in the system.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.970
John and the team get into choppers and arrive
at the neighborhood.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.720
John makes a last-minute analysis to pinpoint
the couple’s house.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.080
After identifying the correct house, he rushes
in, barely making it in time and arriving

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.549
just before the man stabs his wife.

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.330
As John reprimands the perpetrator, the rest
of the team burst in through the roof and

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.830
they arrest the man.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.310
They place a technological halo on the man,
rendering him catatonic.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.970
Back at the department, Danny notices the
precogs having another vision of the same

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.040
crime that John had just stopped.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.579
A cop explains that the precogs would sometimes
have similar visions called echoes.

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.829
The technician, Wally, then simply deletes
these echoes.

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.150
That night, John goes for a jog and finds
his drug dealer.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.560
He gets his fit and heads back to his house.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.430
He plays a holographic recording of a young
boy, his son Sean.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.960
John appears saddened and takes his drugs.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.439
He plays another hologram of his wife Lara,
someone he clearly misses dearly.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:15.719
The following day, Lamar Burgess, the department
director talks to John, expressing his concern

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.359
about the inquest from the Justice Department.

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.999
He warns John to keep watch on Danny as he
could be a potential hurdle for the department’s

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:23.999
progression.

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:27.809
At the main office, Danny chats with a few
precrime cops while one of them explains the

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:29.959
process of the precogs and precrime.

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.879
Danny argues that the department isn’t really
arresting criminals as the crimes are never

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.109
committed but John tells him that the precogs’
visions are an absolute certainty.

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.840
Danny then reveals that he’s there on behalf
of the country’s attorney general and that

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.059
the whole operation would now be under his
supervision.

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:49.329
The group heads into the precog chamber where
the caretaker Wally immediately protests their

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.329
presence.

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.239
He explains to them that the precogs are extremely
sensitive and that they’ll have to be very

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.239
quiet.

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.079
Wally explains to Danny that the pond where
the precogs are submerged not only serves

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.919
as their main source of nutrients but also
amplifies their abilities.

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:08.549
The three precogs, Arthur, Dash, and Agatha,
are kept in a dream-like state, never too

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.329
awake, and never too asleep, as this has the
best potential for their abilities.

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.239
Agatha is the most gifted among the three
but all of them are needed to create the best

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.980
prediction of the future.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.280
Each of the precogs receives a vision stream
and is combined.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.291
Danny explains that the precogs may be the
next huge step for humanity and he’s there

00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:30.439
to make sure the process is bulletproof, with
no room for any error.

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.700
The group leaves and John remains, staring
at Agatha.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.120
Agatha suddenly wakes up and grabs John, hugging
him.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.599
She asks him in a whisper if he can see and
John looks at the screen to see a vision of

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.340
a man drowning a woman.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.419
Agatha slips back into the water and Wally
rushes in to help Agatha.

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.400
Curious to know about what Agatha showed him,
John heads to the containment room where the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.209
prisoners are kept in a catatonic sleeping
state.

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.189
He asks to see Agatha’s visions of drowned
victims and finds old precrime footage for

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.489
Anne Lively.

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.640
The murder had been prevented and the suspect
is still being kept in the facility.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.349
The survivor Anne Lively was a drug addict
and John finds her location is unknown.

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.999
He heads to Lamar and tells him about what
happened.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:14.279
Lamar brushes it off and changes the subject,
talking about how he’s heard reports that

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:18.500
John has been seen in shadier parts of the
city, alluding to his drug addiction.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.520
Lamar also brings up the importance of precrime
and how it could change the country if brought

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.420
to a national scale.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.199
Danny arrives at John’s apartment and sees
substances and evidence of his drug abuse.

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.090
He also sees Sean’s hologram recording.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.509
Back at the department, a new name appears
from the precogs: Leo Crow.

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.030
John analyzes the footage immediately.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.349
As he scrubs through the image, he’s mortified
to see that it’s him who’s supposed to

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:43.780
kill Leo.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.400
Before the other technician sees, John grabs
his name on the ball and swipes away the image.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.349
Distraught, John tries to review the image
trying to see if there’s some sort of error

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.520
but the more he reviews the image, the more
he sees that there is no mistake.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.009
He will indeed kill Leo.

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.710
Wally from the precog chamber sees the image.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.360
He understands that he’ll have to sound
the alarm, but since John has been nice to

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.320
him, he’s willing to give him a few minutes
to escape.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.539
On his way out, John runs into Danny in the
elevator.

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.199
Danny tries to confront him about what he
found in John’s apartment but John holds

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.490
him at gunpoint and escapes.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.240
On the highway, John calls Lamar telling him
he thinks Danny set him up.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.211
The crime makes no sense as it’s supposed
to happen in 36 hours and he doesn’t even

00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:25.320
know who Leo is.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.430
John’s car gets overwritten by precrime
and he has to jump off.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.909
The precrime team prepares to hunt John and
Danny wants to take over the operation.

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.409
He tells Lamar that John’s apprehension
is now his concern as he’s performing an

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:39.750
investigation on the department.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.820
While John tries to make his way through a
mall, he realizes that the retinal scan makes

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.620
him an extremely easy target to find.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.069
Retinal scans at almost every door and entrance
quickly identify anyone walking through.

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:55.710
In the subway, precrime officers find John
and he makes his way to an alley.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.120
Precrime cops are easy to swarm him but John
tries to escape.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.050
Even with jetpacks, John still outmaneuvers
and outsmarts the cops.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.099
He runs into Danny and the chase leads them
to a car manufacturing plant where John and

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:08.919
Danny get into a scuffle.

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.120
John falls into the assembly line and ends
up getting trapped inside a car.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.870
As the car finishes assembly, John drives
off in it, leaving Danny and the rest.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.199
John heads to the precog’s creators, Iris
Hineman.

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.759
He asks Iris if the visions can be faked.

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:28.190
Iris laughs and tells John that the precog’s
creation was a complete accident.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.699
She was, in fact, trying to heal them but
instead turned them into precogs.

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.659
The precogs, as it turns out, come from drug
junkie parents.

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:40.229
They were only the three survivors out of
a number of children who were born with severe

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:41.669
brain damage.

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:45.650
As Iris studied them, the children started
having nightmares of murders.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.610
They realized that these were glimpses into
the future.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.439
The point still stands, however, that the
precogs’ visions are real.

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:57.460
Iris says that the precogs are never wrong,
but adds that they may sometimes disagree.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.069
Iris explains that most of the time, all three
of them see the same vision but once in a

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:04.590
while, Agatha would see a different future.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.990
These, so-called, minority reports are immediately
destroyed upon detection as precrime can’t

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.159
have a system that would instill doubt.

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:16.120
This indicates that alternate futures are
possible, and not all murder suspects could

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.120
have actually committed the crime.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.669
John is dumbfounded by this revelation as
it would make the precrime system collapse.

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:27.499
John now decides to try and find his alternate
future, his minority report, where he doesn’t

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:28.560
kill Leo.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.550
The report still lies within Agatha.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.900
Danny and the precops are analyzing the visions,
trying to find out what John is going to do

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.900
next.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.199
Danny predicts John would still try to prove
his innocence.

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:43.090
John finds his way to an underground surgeon
and has his eyes replaced so that he won’t

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.270
get identified when he makes his way into
the department.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.930
After the procedure, John has to keep his
eyes covered as it still needs time to heal.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.999
John falls asleep and has a dream about his
son Sean.

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:58.680
In his dream, John and Sean are having fun
at a public pool, playing games.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.389
They contest with each other who could hold
their breath the longest underwater.

00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:04.810
When John surfaces, Sean is gone.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.569
He tries looking for him in the crowd but
Sean is nowhere to be seen.

00:08:08.569 --> 00:08:12.840
John wakes up screaming Sean’s name and
stumbles his way to the kitchen.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.509
Precops arrive at the building John’s staying
at and send robotic spiders to scan the eyes

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:18.409
of everyone in the building.

00:08:18.409 --> 00:08:21.999
John hears the announcement and tries to block
the spiders from entering his room but the

00:08:21.999 --> 00:08:23.960
spiders find a way in.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.710
He then goes to the bathroom and tries to
submerge himself in a bathtub to hide but

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.590
the spiders still find him.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.269
The spiders electrocute him, forcing him to
have his eye scanned.

00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:36.709
He pries his bandage open and painfully tries
to open his eyes.

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:40.450
A spider scans his eye and it reads him as
a different person.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.630
At the precrime department, Danny is still
analyzing the footage of the precog vision

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.680
and he sees there’s a woman in the room
with John and Leo.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.241
John makes his way into the building through
maintenance corridors and arrives at the precog

00:08:51.241 --> 00:08:52.320
chamber.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.589
Danny recognizes the woman in the vision as
Agatha and realizes John is coming to get

00:08:56.589 --> 00:08:57.589
her.

00:08:57.589 --> 00:09:01.100
John orders Wally to rewind the visions but
Danny and the team arrive.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.800
Danny smashes the window but John drains the
pool, grabbing Agatha, and escaping down the

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.890
drain.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:11.100
John drives with Agatha and he tries to ask
her about the vision of him killing Leo but

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.160
she responds incoherently.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.649
John then heads to a virtual reality hub and
finds Rufus.

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:20.970
At the virtual reality hub, they plug Agatha
in and she shows them the vision of Leo and

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.029
John.

00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:26.270
The vision plays out the same way as before,
ending with John shooting Leo.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:30.570
John then asks Agatha if he has a minority
report but Agatha answers no.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.630
John learns that he is indeed supposed to
kill Leo.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.370
Agatha once again shows the vision of a drowned
woman and the killer.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:42.010
John and Rufus watch but before the killer
reveals himself, precops arrive.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:46.000
John and Agatha have to escape again, making
their way through a crowded mall.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.860
They find themselves at the building where
John would kill Leo and see there is only

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.430
12 minutes before the designated time.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.889
John and Agatha enter the building and make
their way up to the room where the murder

00:09:55.889 --> 00:09:58.220
would supposedly take place.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.430
John examines the room and sees a bed full
of pictures.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.980
He approaches it and sees it full with pictures
of children.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.720
He finds a string of photographs showing Leo
and Sean together.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.320
John realizes that him murdering Leo is no
accident at all.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.889
He accepts his fate and when Leo arrives,
John attacks him.

00:10:14.889 --> 00:10:17.740
Leo admits to killing Sean and John pummels
him.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.509
John then pulls out his gun and points it
at Leo.

00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:25.199
He is about to pull the trigger, but stops
and instead places Leo under arrest.

00:10:25.199 --> 00:10:29.170
John cries as he reads Leo his Miranda Rights
but Leo looks puzzled.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.889
Leo asks if John is going to kill him and
John answers no.

00:10:32.889 --> 00:10:36.970
Leo then admits to John that somebody contacted
him and paid him and his family if he allows

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.420
John to kill him.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.889
He says that he was released from prison and
that a lot of money will go to his family

00:10:41.889 --> 00:10:43.829
if he gets John to kill him.

00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:46.699
John is confused and asks Leo about the pictures.

00:10:46.699 --> 00:10:49.899
He admits they were fake and starts begging
John to kill him.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:53.930
The two get into a scuffle and John ends up
accidentally pulling the trigger and shooting

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.000
Leo, fulfilling his destiny.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.970
He and Agatha then flee.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:03.490
Danny and the team catch up, and Danny immediately
recognizes the scene as being too convenient.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:07.830
He argues there is too much evidence at the
crime scene and immediately suspects something

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:08.830
awry.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:12.860
Danny meets with Lamar and tells him he feels
going after John is the wrong decision.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:17.670
Danny shows Lamar two copies of Anne Lively’s
murder; one from precrime, and the other from

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.630
the virtual reality hub.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:24.210
He compares the two, and shows Lamar that
there are small differences in the two footages.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.710
He suspects that the two visions are two completely
separate crimes made to look similar.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.700
The technician would have figured it was only
an echo and would have deleted it.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.841
Danny suspects that for this to happen, someone
would just have to hire someone else to kill

00:11:36.841 --> 00:11:38.089
Anne Lively.

00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:41.899
The precogs would detect it, and precops would
swoop in to prevent the crime and take the

00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:43.380
suspect away.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.820
The mastermind could then come in, dress the
same way, and do the exact same crime.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:52.220
The precogs might detect it but a technician
would probably think it an echo and delete

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.220
it.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.589
Lamar nods understandingly, then pulls out
a gun and shoots Danny.

00:11:56.589 --> 00:12:01.140
Danny finally realizes who’s behind everything
but can only stare as Lamar closes in and

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.819
shoots him in the head.

00:12:02.819 --> 00:12:05.920
John arrives at his ex-wife Lara’s house
to hide.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.910
Unbeknownst to John, Lara had called Lamar
letting him know that John had arrived with

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:10.910
Agatha.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:15.829
John and Lara talk by the pier, and John finally
realizes why he had been set up.

00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:17.839
It was all about Anne Lively.

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:21.770
Agatha then tells John about seeing Sean's
possible future from his adolescence up to

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.420
his early adulthood.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.839
John and Lara listen intently, breaking down
in tears.

00:12:26.839 --> 00:12:30.319
Agatha then reveals to John that Anne Lively
is her mother.

00:12:30.319 --> 00:12:34.040
Before Agatha could reveal her mother’s
killer, precops arrive and capture John.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:39.279
In his house, Lara and Lamar speak and in
an attempt to comfort Lara, Burgess accidentally

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:43.360
reveals himself as the killer by disclosing
details about the crime only the killer would

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.360
know.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:49.650
As Lamar prepares for his celebratory banquet
dinner, Lara heads to precrime to free John.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.649
After finishing his congratulatory speech,
Lamar receives a phone call and is shocked

00:12:53.649 --> 00:12:55.120
to hear it’s John.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.639
John reveals Lamar’s plan by streaming the
video of Anne Lively’s death at the banquet,

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:02.329
and the entire crowd sees Lamar as the killer.

00:13:02.329 --> 00:13:06.300
In the department, the precogs see a vision
of Lamar killing John.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.860
Lamar then comes face to face with John and
is now left with a choice: kill John and prove

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.940
that the precogs work, or don’t shoot John
and disprove the precogs.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:20.540
Lamar then decides to shoot himself, and as
the precops arrive, Lamar falls to the floor.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.259
Time passes and the precrime division is placed
on permanent hold.

00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:28.310
John and Lara cradle one another, finding
meaning in the future, hoping it would still

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:29.400
hold something for them.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:35.259
The precogs are removed from the Department
of Precrime and placed in a safe environment

00:13:35.259 --> 00:13:45.899
where they could live the rest of their lives
in peace.
