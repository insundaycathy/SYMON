sitting down the table he screams worth

00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:51.569 align:start position:0%
being and then it changes I think that's
 

00:15:51.569 --> 00:15:53.210 align:start position:0%
being and then it changes I think that's
just<00:15:51.630><c> a</c><00:15:51.750><c> continuity</c><00:15:52.319><c> error</c><00:15:52.500><c> with</c><00:15:52.800><c> the</c><00:15:52.889><c> editors</c>

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
just a continuity error with the editors
 

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.430 align:start position:0%
just a continuity error with the editors
they<00:15:53.730><c> need</c><00:15:53.970><c> a</c><00:15:54.000><c> clean</c><00:15:54.300><c> shot</c><00:15:54.630><c> and</c><00:15:54.990><c> I</c><00:15:55.079><c> think</c><00:15:55.259><c> that</c>

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
they need a clean shot and I think that
 

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.749 align:start position:0%
they need a clean shot and I think that
was<00:15:55.529><c> the</c><00:15:55.620><c> best</c><00:15:55.769><c> one</c><00:15:55.980><c> they</c><00:15:56.100><c> had</c><00:15:56.279><c> for</c><00:15:56.699><c> the</c>

00:15:56.749 --> 00:15:56.759 align:start position:0%
was the best one they had for the
 

00:15:56.759 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
was the best one they had for the

00:15:58.639 --> 00:15:58.649 align:start position:0%
opening then they just cut back and
 

00:15:58.649 --> 00:16:00.110 align:start position:0%

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
