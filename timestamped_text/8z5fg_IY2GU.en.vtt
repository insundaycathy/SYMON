00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.550
Story Recapped here.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.640
Today, I'm going to show you a fantasy romantic
drama film titled Edward Scissorhands.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.080
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.070
Watch out and take care!

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.419
One snowy evening, a little girl asks her
grandmother about the legend of the snow.

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.789
The grandmother tells her that it was a very
long story, but the girl can't doze off.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.520
The grandmother starts the story about scissors.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.820
Indeed the story was a long one, as the grandmother
reminisces what happened a long time ago.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.550
There lived a famous inventor in the town
who made numerous inventions.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.720
The most peculiar thing he invented was a
male figure with scissors for a hand, but

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.540
what's even odder is he gave him a brain for
conceiving and a heart for feeling.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.660
Sadly, the inventor passed away even before
he completed the figure.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.830
The figure is named Edward.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.000
One sunny day, a woman in purple coordinates
pays a visit to all the women's houses in

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.430
town to sell her line of cosmetics.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.550
The saleswoman desperately ends up in Edward's
ghastly-looking mansion uphill.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.370
Surprisingly, the estate had a breathtaking
landscaping sight.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.710
She knocks in the front door, which she opens
by herself.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.110
She took the horrifying stairs and searches
for the house's owner.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.150
Her search takes her to the attic with a damaged
roof, and she sees several memorabilia in

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.420
one of the portions of its walls.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.370
Hearing silent noises, the saleswoman looks
back and sees a dark silhouette in the corner

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.720
of the attic.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.940
She seems to have discerned the figure.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.240
Frightened in daylight, the saleswoman takes
a step back, but the figure gently approaches

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.320
closer.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.450
Not realizing the woman's disposition, Edward
reaches his hands out to her.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.430
The woman, thinking that he was harmless,
curiously eyes him and asks him about his

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.850
parents.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.340
Edward innocently claims that his father did
not wake up one day.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.560
She attempts to lightly touch Edward in his
face using cotton with an astringent.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.850
The woman drives Edward to her home.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.320
When the two reach home, Peg takes him to
the living room where all the family pictures

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.800
are placed.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.320
Edward falls innocently in love at first sight
of her daughter's photo.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.479
Peg takes him to another room where she asks
Edward to change his clothes.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.940
Edward goes through the things in the room
and accidentally makes a hole out of the water

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.940
bed.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.130
He finds trouble getting himself dressed.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.810
Peg eventually goes back to Edward's room
and helps him redress.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.510
Outside the house, the nosy neighbours gather
after seeing Peg with another man in her car.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.110
Later that night, Edward joins the family
for a dinner where they never took their eyes

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.310
of him for fear and amusement.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.840
Edward awkwardly fumbles over the food with
his disfigured hands.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.060
Peg tucks Edward to bed that night, where
Edward sleeps warmly.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.430
The next day, while the husbands in the neighbourhood
leave for work, Peg spends her time concealing

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.200
the scars on Edward's face.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.030
Peg's husband takes his time trimming the
plants in the backyard when Edward walks in

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.940
and forms another plant into a dinosaur.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.599
Edward bobs another set of plants that made
Peggy and her husband happy.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.160
But a woman appears in their backyard, claiming
Edward came straight from the pits of hell.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.750
The woman runs away when Edward approaches
her.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.380
Meanwhile, Peg opens their front door after
the doorbell rang.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.780
Apparently, the neighbourhood is growing curious
about their family's visitor that they insisted

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.510
on an afternoon barbecue feast.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.070
Edward helps Peg prepare for the feast by
chopping the ingredients.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.080
Peg opens a can of pineapples that made Edward
storm off of his consciousness.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.849
He daydreams about his father's invention,
where several machines run through to make

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:12.900
him dinner.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.930
His late father enjoyed his inventions so
much that he came up with the idea of inventing

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.239
a man with the hands of scissors.

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.260
The Bogg family hosts the barbecue feast in
the backyard, where the neighbours gasp in

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.010
awe and admiration of their well-trimmed garden.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.310
The men discreetly bully Edward, but one man
appears and tells him to never let anyone

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.820
regard him as handicapped for being different.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.010
The women bring their food bowls and alternately
feed Edward, who can't hold a spoon without

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.680
making a cut.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.761
That night, Edward daydreams again to a day
in the mansion's laboratory where his father

00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:45.500
reads him boring stories and funny poems.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.670
Just outside, Kim arrives with her boyfriend's
gang from a camping trip.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.739
Kim goes into her room with all her stuff,
lights up the lamp and screams after seeing

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.300
Edward from her mirror.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.670
Edward, who was equally as terrified to death
as she was, pins and cuts the water bed.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.600
Kim runs nervously to her parent's room, where
Peg calms her down.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.599
Bill takes Edward to another vacant room,
offers him some rum and complains about what

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.860
happened to her daughter when she started
becoming a teen.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.109
Edward takes the rum with a straw, which made
him feel immediately intoxicated.

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.299
Wanting the two to be friends, Peg introduces
Kim to the drunk Edward, who collapses to

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.120
the floor from shock.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.199
The following day, Esmeralda, one of Edward's
fans, invites him to creatively trim her garden.

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.180
After forming a couple of swans, she offers
him a glass of lemonade which he declined

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.470
with a vomit.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.330
After trimming Esmeralda's garden, Edwards
goes to Kevin's class.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.409
Kevin proudly shows how Edward can create
paper art with his bare hands.

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.800
That night, the family is having dinner with
Kim's boyfriend and one of her friends.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.710
While Edward is carefully slicing a chunk
of beef meat, the family happens to discuss

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.479
that Edward is not charging people money for
his gardening services.

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.870
The awkward Edward mistakenly throws the sliced
piece to Kim's lap, which made her very angry

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.870
that night.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.539
Apart from trimming the plants, one of his
clients discovers that Edward can actually

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.059
groom her poodle.

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:07.900
Surprisingly, the neighbourhood queued along
with the Bogg's backyard with their pets while

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.699
some of his fanatics, ask him to style their
haircut.

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.849
Peg is also enthusiastic that she had him
cut her hair too.

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:18.059
One day, Edward heads to the market with one
of her clients.

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:22.119
There, he witnesses how Kim and her boyfriend
share a sweet kiss.

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:25.979
Apparently, his client breaks him from the
lonely trance to have him sharpen his scissors

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.289
in a shop.

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.210
His client drops him home, where Kim and her
boyfriend waits in despair as they're both

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.330
locked out without a key.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.719
Edward opens the door quickly without scratching
it.

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:40.509
Edward has been invited with Peg to a television
show where the crowd asks him about surgeries

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.979
and salon and landscaping business.

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.529
One lady asks him about having a girlfriend.

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:50.340
The clueless Edward mindlessly reaches out
to a microphone stand where he gets electrified.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.540
He falls backwards.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.409
Kim, who is watching the show with his boyfriend
and younger brother, falls unnecessarily worried

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:57.979
over Edward.

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.339
The following day, Esmeralda takes Edward
to the beauty salon, which she proposes to

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:04.169
purchase for his business.

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.250
She shows him around the salon, where she
intends to seduce him.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.710
Esmeralda rides on Edward and starts to take
off her clothes.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.439
Luckily for the clueless man, the dressing
chair collapses backwards.

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:18.759
Edward leaves the salon without the disappointed
Esmeralda.

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:22.490
Edward rushes to a pizzeria where the Bogg
family is waiting for him.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.589
He narrates where the salon was and how Esmeralda
took off her clothes in front of him in the

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:29.770
backroom, making the family uncomfortable
and shocked.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.199
Bill breaks away from discomfort and tells
Edward that he'll be needing a bank loan to

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:35.279
get his business started.

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:39.629
Peg accompanies Edwards to the banks, where
his loan gets declined after the banker discovered

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:44.259
that he has no social security number, no
credit history, and no collaterals.

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:48.770
Unfortunately, the bank does not recognize
client testimonials to lend his business some

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.770
amount.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.750
However, they advised him to build his credit
score first before coming back again for the

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:54.750
loan.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.539
Meanwhile, Jim and Kim are arguing about using
Edward to steal from his parents.

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:02.229
Jim somehow tricked Edward to steal with them.

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:07.169
Even though Kim refuses to use the poor Edward,
she joins his gang to break into Jim's house.

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:10.120
They used Edward's hands to pick the locks
in the place.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.539
Unfortunately, the alarm system detects and
locks him up.

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:17.809
The gang leaves the clueless Edward to be
arrested by the police officers.

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:21.840
Peg and Bill head to a detention facility
after hearing Edward's misfortune.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.300
The prosecution eventually frees Edward under
the grounds of mental incapacity.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.530
His lawyer argues that Edward was isolated
for the majority of his life, which immensely

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.679
caused his lack of judgement and morality.

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:36.779
The news breaks out in the neighbourhood,
which made his fanatics doubt Edward's intention

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:39.879
in helping them with their gardens and hairstyles.

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:44.990
When Peg and Edward reach home after the dismissal,
a swarm of journalists chase after them.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.300
Kim realizes how chaotic the situation has
become and explains to Edward how hard she

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.849
tried to persuade Jim to take him back from
his parent's house.

00:07:52.849 --> 00:07:56.749
She feels awful telling Edward that it was
Jim’s parent's house, but Edward went off

00:07:56.749 --> 00:08:00.020
anyway because she was the one who told him
to break into it.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.649
Jim breaks their conversation but feels unapologetic
and passes the blame to Kim, who walks out

00:08:04.649 --> 00:08:05.909
on him.

00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:10.060
Edward goes mad at the sight of Jim and Kim
that he leaves scratches along the wall.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.919
Bill leaves an ethical lesson to Edward, who
chooses a seemingly sweet but wrong answer.

00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:19.589
Meanwhile, the former fanatic Esmeralda spreads
a rumour in the neighbourhood saying Edward

00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:23.240
once attempted to cut her with his hands,
but she luckily escaped.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.330
With the rumour, the rest of the former fans
decide not to attend Peg's invitation for

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.009
Christmas dinner.

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:32.880
On a Christmas night, Peg and Kim are preparing
the Christmas tree.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.030
Kim goes and sees a wintery sight outside
their home.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.710
Edward is working on a breathtaking ice sculpture.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.820
Kim is dancing around the presence of snow
when Jim shouts over and startles the poor

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.820
Edward.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.030
He accidentally scratches Kim's palm.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:51.020
While Peg brings her daughter inside for a
cure, Jim pushes Edward out of Bogg's yard.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.200
Kim goes back outside and breaks up with Jim
after losing sight of Edward.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.720
The furious Edward walks away from the town,
tearing his jumpsuit and some plants apart.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.250
A neighbour reports what Edward did to the
police, who appears minutes later, searching

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.310
for Edward at Peg's house.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:10.080
Peg and Bill leave to search for Edward in
the middle of the town, but Edward returns

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.930
to their home alone after seeing a police
car.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.970
Kim embraces the lonely Edward, who dozes
again into another daydream where the inventor

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.750
gave him a fake pair of hands.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:23.920
In his dream, he cut off the fingers and the
palms after his father falls dead to the ground.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.870
He woke up from the trance again, scared that
he might make a cut on Kim.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.140
Meanwhile, Jim and his drunk friend drive
off the town towards Kim's house.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.180
On the way, the drunken men nearly hit Kevin.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.290
Edward jumps to save him from the car, but
he ends up cutting Kevin in the face.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.520
Jim assumes that he was assaulting Kevin.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.680
The whole neighbourhood goes outside after
hearing the commotion.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.530
The police officer chases Edward, who flees
back to his mansion at the top of the hill.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.020
Peg begs the angry mob to let Edward go.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.150
The police officer fires his gun thrice to
fool the people that Edward is dead, but the

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.970
sceptical and curious crowd also advances
to the mansion.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.020
Kim follows Edward to the old, dark mansion.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:07.110
Little did she know, Jim follows her tracks
to the attic and attempts to murder Edward.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.630
Kim stops Jim by knocking him to the ground
and pointing Edward's blades to his neck.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.170
Jim pushes her over, which made Edward boil
in a fury.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.230
He stabs him with one of his blades and leaves
him to fall on the ground outside.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.790
Kim confesses that she loves Edward.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.700
When the mob reach the mansion, Kim fools
them that Jim and Edward both died in a duel

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.980
showing Edward's fake hand cadaver.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.800
The crowd retreats back home forlornly.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.650
The grandmother ends the story by telling
the little girl that she was Kim.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.630
She never saw Edward again.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.550
She believes Edward is an immortal who never
ages.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:44.210
In Kim's late years, Edward still spends his
time in the mansion, carving ice sculptures,

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:52.140
which he remembers having Kim dance around
the snow he has made.
