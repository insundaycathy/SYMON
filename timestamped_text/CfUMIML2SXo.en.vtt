00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.149
Welcome to Movie Shortens.

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.350
Follow us today to a movie titled: It came
from the desert.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.280
Be aware, there are spoilers!

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.870
In 1951, a meteorite, carrying a mysterious
DNA, fell to the Earth.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.820
The DNA was used to conduct Secret experiments
on ants and spiders through a military laboratory.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.090
However, the facility soon became overrun
by the mutated giant ants.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.070
They killed all of the soldiers during an
outbreak.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.359
Meanwhile outside of the base, there are two
mining workers planning to steal copper from

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.540
the facility.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.070
Their greed is soon extinguished by the bloodthirsty
ants.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.460
The two men get killed tragically as they
enter a cave.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.970
Elsewhere in a nearby town, a mechanic named
Brian is obsessed with “The Eradicator”,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.680
the film-star of a long running franchise
about bug-killing.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.150
He fantasizes about being like the hero one
day.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.650
Just then, his best friend Lukas enters, informing
Brian that he just won a big competition.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.010
The two teens are both brilliant motocrossers.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.960
To celebrate, the friends are heading into
the New Mexico desert for a weekend of racing

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.170
and partying.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.370
They’re happy in their own little world
and ignore the missing persons posters that

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.510
are popping up around town.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.670
They invite Brian’s secret crush, Lisa who
is clever and brilliant.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.540
Along the way, Lukas gives private time to
Brian and Lisa.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.540
Lukas takes his dirtbike out which has been
attached to the back of the car.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.840
Lukas and two friends make an incredible race
through the desert.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.400
The desert party looks like a fantastic time.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.450
Lukas and Brian have a drink from a friend
who’s created a cool homemade alcohol dispenser.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.040
During the party, Brian feels too shy to speak
to Lisa and has troubles with showing his

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.040
feelings.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.159
Lukas tries to push him to work up the nerve
to approach her.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.350
However, a guy interrupts Brian just before
he can make his move.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.509
Disappointed in himself, Brian leaves the
crowd and starts to wander away.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.740
Later, Lukas joins him attempting to cheer
him up.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.970
At the edge of the cliff, Brian complains
about littering to Lukas, then he finds a

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.520
secret cave just below.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.330
They find the way down and finally get to
an abandoned facility.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.950
Seeing that the fence is broken, Lukas can’t
resist the temptation to explore the area.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.390
Though Brian thinks it is not a good idea
to do so.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.390
During this time, Lisa ventures out to find
the two boys.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.879
In the facility, Lukas becomes more curious
and begins poking around in some abandoned

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:22.879
rooms.

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.499
Brian becomes timid, and repeatedly tells
Lukas to head back to the party.

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:32.639
As the two enter into a lab room, they find
it covered in some web-like texture.

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.959
Lukas reaches his hand towards what looks
like a cocoon on the floor as he notices it

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.049
is gelatinous and has a disgusting smell.

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.689
As the two become nauseous, they notice a
camera on the ceiling.

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.040
Suddenly, a loud noise is heard.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.670
As they return to the big room, they come
across a gigantic ant, which quickly scares

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.810
them away.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.569
The two hide in a kitchen.

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.819
Right at this time, Lisa makes a phone call
to Lukas.

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.840
The two explain to Lisa what they have seen
and ask her to find others to assist them.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.309
However, as he begins to explain the way to
the facility, his phone runs out of battery.

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:12.980
Worried and tense, Lukas and Brian decide
to fight back the creature to get out of the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.980
base.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.840
Unfortunately, a shelf falls down, creating
a noise, this draws a monster into the kitchen.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.980
The boys hold their breath, attempting to
hide from the huge ant.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.079
Just then, it leaves as is it finds nothing.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.169
The two share a quick joyful moment as Lukas
opens a beer.

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.909
However, the ant again is triggered by a smell.

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.729
It rushes back into the room chasing the boys.

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:40.669
Seeing Lukas is nearly attacked, Brian distracts
the creature, luring it to follow him to the

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:41.939
front door.

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:45.719
He quickly closes the door, hoping to block
the ant behind it.

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:49.860
However, the mutant ant manages to grab Brian
with one of its long legs.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.920
Lukas tries to pull Brian back.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.109
In the middle of the tension, Lisa comes in
to rescue them by stabbing the animal to death

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.340
with an axe.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.340
For now, they realize the gelatinous substance
found earlier is actually the blood of ants.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.999
This will send the signal to attract other
ants.

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:08.809
As predicted, more of the mutant creatures
gather around the dead ant.

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:14.430
The trio flee away and end up in an observatory
room, where they find footage from a scientist

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.689
named Renard.

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:20.239
He briefs anyone who watches this video about
the secret experiment that’s happened in

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.239
the past.

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.580
He reveals that the mutant ants require ethanol
to mate and to reproduce.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.199
The friends must race back to the party, before
the ants get loaded on their booze and unleash

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.770
a wave of terror upon the town.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.090
At the party, everyone is watching and shouting
out to a stripper.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.090
A young man runs back to the bar to get some
more beer, then notices a beer container being

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.500
dragged away.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.590
He slowly checks on it and finds an oversized
ant killing the beer.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.710
The man is then smashed in the head, killed
by the ant.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.980
It turns out the party has drawn the attention
of the giant beasts.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.319
They quickly invade the racing party goers
and attack them.

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:59.800
A few escape on their dirt bikes.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.759
Others manage to run away in the chaos while
a few of them choose to hide in their vehicle,

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.020
but they can’t fight against the onslaught
of the oversized ants.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.669
When the trio come back to the party, they
find that no one has survived.

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.610
They get into a car and try to get back to
town to alert the authorities.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.620
Suddenly, an ant attacks them from behind.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.510
The friends quickly jump on their bikes and
ride away.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.669
Brian and Lisa share a bike as Lukas rides
alone.

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.580
As Brian is about to jump over a gap, Lisa
stops him saying it’s too dangerous.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.879
For the first time, Lisa has a chance to express
her true feelings for Brian.

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:41.270
It turns out Lisa also has a crush on Brian
and no one else as Brian was afraid of.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.699
This makes him really happy, but it doesn’t
last too long.

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.110
Lisa is then captured by a giant ant.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.099
Lukas arrives, giving Brian a ride to find
her.

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.850
They approach a dark cave, eventually leading
to the ants nest.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.099
They realize that the ants have wrapped their
prey up in the webbing, just like mummies.

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:03.830
Brian finally finds Lisa’s web and tries
to awaken her, but the cocoon appears to be

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.780
tough and hard to break.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.249
Just then, some beasts appear as they see
their food is being stolen.

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:13.949
A number of gunshots are heard and the ants
are killed from a mysterious shooter.

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:19.169
They soon realize it is Dr Renard, who first
appears on the video they watched in the military

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:20.169
lab.

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:24.979
He tells the two friends that to cut open
the cocoon, they must use a specialized tool,

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:26.870
which is now back at the base.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.710
Later, he joins Brian and Lukas to go back
to the facility, attempting to rescue their

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.960
friends as quickly as possible.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.360
On the way, Renard gives the boys a map showing
a secret defense system.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.199
Unfortunately, he is stabbed by a beast before
he can give further explanation.

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.370
Brian and Lukas are terrified and run away.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.210
The two decide to dodge and fight back against
the mutants as time is running out.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.740
Following the map, they learn that the weapon
won’t fire at an individual, it is only

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.219
designed to fire at a pack of monsters.

00:06:57.219 --> 00:07:02.540
They eventually find a secret way to get to
the prototype weapons, using a switch designed

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.900
in the form of a beer.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.669
They also explore the tool designed to cut
the cocoons and protect themselves with special

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:09.669
armor.

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:14.460
In the back of the base, they find two dirt
bikes, which seemingly match perfectly with

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.680
their outfits.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.060
The two head back to the nest right away.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.690
By using the special tool, they cut off the
webbing and release their friends, including

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:23.690
Lisa.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.370
Lukas decides to stay in the cave to rescue
others.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:32.680
Brian takes Lisa first, attempting to lure
the colony of ants towards the prototype weapons.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.599
As expected, the weapons fire at the ants
and destroy them all.

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:41.600
The couple is satisfied with the plan, thinking
that they have eliminated all the beasts.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.409
However, the queen ant suddenly appears at
the top of the mountain.

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:48.419
Brian quickly rides off, avoiding the attack.

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:52.849
At the edge of the cliff, Lisa now encourages
Brian to jump the gap.

00:07:52.849 --> 00:07:57.130
With a sweet kidd, Brain is able to make it
to the other side.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.979
As the bike plunges into the canyon, the couple
find an abandoned car and decide to flee with

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:02.979
it.

00:08:02.979 --> 00:08:07.559
However, the giant queen manages to hold off
the car by releasing her web.

00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:11.870
Lisa has no choice but to draw the weapon
opening fire at the queen.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:17.099
A perfect shot to the head, the beast wails
in utter pain and dives off into the cliff.

00:08:17.099 --> 00:08:22.090
Luckily, Brian and Lisa jump out of the car
before it is pulled along with the beast.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.490
The queen is then destroyed in the explosion.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.150
Lisa and Brian give a long kiss, cementing
their win.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.550
Meanwhile back in the nest, Lukas has successfully
rescued the others.

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:36.899
He lights the whole nest on fire, eliminating
the beasts’ eggs.

00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:39.210
The group returns to the party to celebrate
their victory.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:45.160
Unbeknownst to them, the creatures are escaping
out of another secret room deep inside the

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.360
military lab.
