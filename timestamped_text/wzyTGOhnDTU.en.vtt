00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.140
Welcome to Movies Explained, today we're looking
at, Annihilation. A woman is sitting on a

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.390
chair with people looking from outside the
glass. Three men dressed in white protective

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.000
gear are questioning her. The man asks that
what did you eat and what rations she had

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.720
for two weeks. He reveals that you have been
inside for four months. The woman says she

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.279
doesn’t know anything. The man interrogates
her about what happened to Radek, Josie, and

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.230
other people as they were together. She gives
them the same answer again, “I don’t know.”

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.710
Scene shifts to a class. Professor Lena is
teaching the students about cells and their

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.379
evolution. She tells them that all cells were
the extension of one cell. 4 billion years

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.079
ago, a single organism existed on the plane
of the earth and universe. It became 2, then

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.379
four, then 8, and so one. She then shows a
tumor cell of a female patient in her early

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.890
30's from the cervix. She tells them they
will be observing tumors cells in vitro and

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.180
autophagic activity in their classes. She
is leaving for home when Dan stops her and

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.560
asks her to join Sara for a garden party.
She says she already has plans that day. Dan

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.860
tries to convince her, but she tells him she
has to paint her bedroom so she can't come.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.710
Dan tells her that it has been almost a year.
You are allowed to go to a barbeque. It is

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.570
not a betrayal and disgrace to his memory.
She leaves and comes to her house, where she

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.860
cries by looking and the picture of his husband,
Kane. She starts painting their bedroom when

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.520
a man comes from behind, which is Kane. Lena
is astonished upon his arrival. She hugs and

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.880
kisses him.
She shares her concern with Kane that no one

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.799
knew about his unit. His partner also knew
as little as she did. Lena tries to ask Kane

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.270
what the mission was about; was it covert?
Kane has no answer and says I don't know;

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.049
maybe the mission was covert. She keeps on
questioning him about where was the mission?

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.100
Where was your base, and what about the rest
of the unit. Kane has no answer to her questions.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.780
Lena says that you have been gone for more
than 12 months, and I don't know is not the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.819
kind of answer I deserve. She then asks him,
that how did you get home? He tells him I

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.599
was outside the room, I saw you, and I recognized
you and your face. Kane drinks water, and

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.280
his condition starts to deteriorate. Lena
calls the ambulance. While they are in it,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.200
heading to the hospital when Special Forces
stop them and take them to Area X.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.379
Lena wakes up in a room feeling the hangover
from the sedative injected into her. A woman

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.540
comes in and tells her to sit. Lena asks her,
who are you. She gives Lena some water and

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.030
tells her that I am doctor Ventress and I
am a psychologist. She insists on knowing

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.019
where she is and where her husband is. Dr.
Ventress tells her that you served in the

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.940
military for seven years. Lena cuts her and
says that I am a professor from John Hopkins.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.720
She asks Dr. Ventress for Kane again. Dr.
Ventress doesn't answer her question. Instead,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.959
she counters questions and says, when did
Kane come back home? Did he tell you what

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.800
happened to him, or he contacted you at any
point? Lena says no, he didn't. Dr. Ventress

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.440
keeps directing questions towards Lena. In
the end, when Lena says I am not answering

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.230
your questions now; it's your turn. Dr. Ventress
tells her that her husband is extremely ill.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.500
His multiple organs are failing, and there
is massive internal bleeding. Lena guesses

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.659
that he must be in contact with some radiation
or virus. She insists Dr. Ventress tell her

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:37.220
what happened to Kane so that she can help
him. Dr. Ventress takes her out and shows

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.830
her the thing they call The Shimmer.
Dr. Ventress tells Lena that they have many

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.700
theories about this thing. It started three
years ago when Blackwater National Park got

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.549
surrounded by something people call the Shimmer.
The event was classified. We sent people,

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:58.010
animals approached the place from sea and
land, but nothing ever came out. The boundary

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.010
of the Shimmer is expanding. She also tells
her that they evacuated the areas close to

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.100
it under the pretense of chemical spills,
but this protection will not last long, and

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.700
the site will grow to what it was. Lena says
that nothing comes back, but something did,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.370
to which Dr. Ventress says yes. The scene
goes to the ICU, where Kane is on a ventilator.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.940
Lena cries and says that he is dying, isn’t
he? Dr. Ventress tells her that we have to

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.759
decide what to do with you, Lena. Lena asks
her that you are not going to let me go home,

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.940
to which Dr. Ventress says, that do you want
to go home? Lena says no.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.080
The scene shifts, and Kane and Lena are lying
on the bedside by the side. Lena says to Kane

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.990
that you are thinking about his next mission,
to which he says I am looking at the moon.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.070
It is weird to see it in the daylight. Lena
says God made a mistake. Kane corrects her

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.120
and says he doesn’t make mistakes; that
is the key to be a god. Lena says he does.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.180
She starts explaining to Kane about the cell
that it doesn’t grow old it becomes immortal.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.630
It keeps dividing but never dies. They say
aging is a natural process, but actually,

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.139
it is a fault in our genes. She then directs
a question towards Kane that where are you

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.030
heading this time. She says something is strange
about this one. Kane asks her why she feels

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.103
this way, to which she says that the silence
around you is louder than usual. Kane smiles

00:05:14.103 --> 00:05:15.103
at her and says I know we will be under the
same hemisphere. Lena looks at her with suspicion

00:05:15.103 --> 00:05:16.103
and says, what does this mean. He explains
that you will step outside in the garden and

00:05:16.103 --> 00:05:17.103
look at the same stars like me. They both
laugh and make love.

00:05:17.103 --> 00:05:19.550
Lena is standing alone when a woman comes
to her and makes an introduction. Anya takes

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.520
her to her friends, and they all greet Lena.
Cassie Sheppard, Josie Radek make their introduction.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.729
While they are drinking, one of them asks
her that is this your first day at Southern

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.100
Reach. Lena counters the question and says,
you have been here for a long time. Josie

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.410
tells her that she is a physicist, testing
magnetic fields around the boundary, and has

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.440
been here for two months. Cassie tells her
that she is an anthropologist, Anya’s a

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.560
paramedic. They ask Lena for her story. She
tells them that she is a biologist. Anya and

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.740
the others tell her that they were making
guesses about her that she is from law enforcement,

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.780
single, etc. They then reveal to her that
they are going inside the Shimmer in four

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.190
days, and the team of scientists will be lead
by Dr. Ventress. Cassie tells her that all

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.330
the previous units that went in the Shimmer
were military, and now it is time for the

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.690
scientists to go. Lena asks them, that what
do you think happened to the people there?

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.030
Anya tells her that there are two theories.
One is that something kills them, and the

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.890
second is that they become crazy and kill
each other. They then talk about a military

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.700
guy who came out, a sergeant. They are talking
about Kane, but Lena doesn’t tell them her

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.139
connection to him.
Kane is kept in intensive care and is in quarantine.

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.470
Lena comes to see him and sits close to him.
She says I am so sorry. I know what I have

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:37.090
to do now. Dr. Ventress asks her that you
didn’t tell the women about you and Kane.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.569
Lena says that it would complicate things.
Lena then asks Dr. Ventress that why she is

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:46.120
going in the shimmer? She reads the mission
statement, to which Lena says that your mission

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.020
statement is not like this one. Dr. Ventress
tells her that I have selected volunteers,

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.050
sent teams inside, and watched them never
return.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.420
I watch the shimmer grow closer, and I want
to know what is happening inside. Lena agrees

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.420
with her and says she wants answers too. Lena
reveals her intention of joining them in the

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:08.389
expedition. She says I can't do anything from
here. I have to go in. The man appears again

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:12.990
and says that you requested to join a mission
with no survivors, and the only one that came

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.669
out was barely surviving. Lena says that I
owed Kane this, and so I went in.

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:22.811
The team enters the Shimmer. Lena has a vision
of her affair with his colleague Dan. She

00:07:22.811 --> 00:07:28.139
wakes up inside a camp, unzips it, and goes
outside. Anya and Cassie are searching for

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:32.590
the food rations. Lena says that she is a
little disoriented. They all tell her that

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.860
they also don’t remember setting up a camp,
and we remember nothing after entering the

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.139
Shimmer. Cassies says that the food depletion
indicates that we have been inside for at

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:46.580
least 3 to four days. Lena says in shock that
this is not possible. They check for signals,

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:52.229
but they find none. They are in Shimmer with
no comms, no radio, and no compass. Dr. Ventress

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:57.610
says that this was all expected after three
years of radio silence. They pack their stuff

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.139
and start moving.
They find a swamp, and Lena looks at the flowers

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:05.970
and says that it is strange. They are different,
so you wouldn’t know they are from the same

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.940
species but are growing from the same branch
structure, so they have to be from the same

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.750
species. They all start collecting different
samples. Suddenly something grabs Redek inside

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.500
the small hut by the water. Lena and others
follow her and help her to get out of it.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.140
There is a splashing and growling sound. They
all point a gun at the water. An alligator

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.840
comes out, and they start shooting it multiple
times. It is not affected by a single bullet,

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.970
but after some shots, it finally dies. Lena
opens its mouth and checks it. She says that

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:38.789
something is making changes in the genes.
Dr. Ventress guesses it may be a crossbreed,

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:42.289
but Lena thinks it can't be between different
species.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:46.660
Lena tells the man about the mutations that
were subtle in the beginning and got corrupt

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.420
as she got close to the light. The man asks
him that were there hallucinations? Lena says

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:56.820
that I wonder that myself, but everything
was shared. It was not always like a nightmare

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.000
sometimes; it was beautiful.
All of them are traveling in a boat when Cassie

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.200
asks Lena about years in the military. She
says, what you wear around your neck, to which

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:11.370
Lena replies, my husband. Cassie says that
everyone here is damaged goods. Anya is an

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:16.740
addict. Josie tried to take her own life while
Dr. Ventress had no friends and no family.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.300
She then tells her about her daughter, whom
she lost to leukemia. They find the headquarters

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:26.630
of the last team. They go in, drop their bags
and go looking around. Lena finds a board

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:31.040
with the names of the soldiers from the previous
expedition. Some of the names were crossed.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.820
Dr. Ventress finds a sealed plastic bag with
a memory card. They play the video and see

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:40.610
Kane carrying a field operation. Kane cuts
the man's stomach, and something is moving

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.870
in his intestines. Anya says that this can’t
happen. They conclude that all the people

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.910
went mad. All of them start arguing. Josie
says that I don't want to stay here. Lena

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:53.950
sees a dream of Kane leaving for the mission.
He says I love you and leaves. Lena wakes

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.681
up and goes to check on Dr. Ventress.
Dr. Ventress tells her the plan and says that

00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:03.630
it was good not to tell them about Kane. I
am not sure how they must have reacted. Lena

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:07.750
asks Dr. Ventress that why she volunteered
for a suicide mission? She says you are confusing

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.050
self-destruction with suicide. They are talking
when the lights go off, and they hear some

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:15.510
noises. They take a look at the fence and
find out something crossed it. Suddenly something

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:20.850
takes Cassie and disappears. In the morning,
everyone is scared. Anya says that we are

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:25.511
attacked twice, we should go back, but Ventress
says we have to reach the lighthouse. She

00:10:25.511 --> 00:10:29.800
argues that we have pictures, data, graphs,
and everything we should go. Lena says that

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.709
the best route to reach out is to go to the
base. The man asks Lena that you lied to her.

00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:39.769
He says you made decisions to which Lena says
Ventress did. The man said that you knew she

00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:45.540
was never coming back and she had cancer.
She said I guessed. I wanted to continue.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:51.180
Lena guesses that Cassie can be alive. She
goes to check out and finds her dead body.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:56.640
They find a place to camp. They see flowers
growing in human shape. Anya says it doesn't

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.180
make any sense. Josie tells her it does. She
explains her theory that the shimmer breaks

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:06.290
light waves. The signals are not gone; they
scramble. She further tells them that shimmer

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:12.029
is like a prism it refracts everything, not
just waves but all kinds of DNA. They find

00:11:12.029 --> 00:11:16.550
a house, secure it and go to take some sleep.
Lena wakes up in the middle of the night and

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:23.210
finds mutations in her blood. Anya points
a gun at her and ties Lena, Ventress, and

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:28.290
Josie to a chair. She says that Lena is a
liar, and she killed Cassie. She is crying

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:36.930
and venting when Cassie's voice comes, and
Anya follows. The mutant bear comes and kills

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:44.399
Anya before they kill it. Ventress leaves
for the lighthouse. Josie is scared and says

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:50.200
that Cassie's voice in the creature; Josie
says to Lena that you want to fight this thing.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:58.959
Ventress wants to face it; I can't do both.
She goes and becomes a human flower. The man

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:05.600
said all of them disappeared why didn't you.
She says I knew I had to come back; they didn't.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:14.790
Lena goes into the lighthouse. She finds a
camera and plays the video. Kane says that

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:19.801
I thought I was a man, had a life, and people
called me Kane. I am not sure anymore. He

00:12:19.801 --> 00:12:29.340
says the man behind the camera finds Lena
and blows a grenade, and dies. The man comes

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.830
and is an alien who assumes Kane's identity.
Lena finds his remains there. She goes down

00:12:32.830 --> 00:13:03.570
the hole and finds Ventress saying some words.
Ventress becomes a glowing structure 

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:12.260
that absorbs a drop of blood from Lena's eyes,
creating an entity that mimics Lena. She runs

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:20.089
and goes out of the hole. The entity follows
Lena, and Lena is unable to escape. She hands

00:13:20.089 --> 00:13:31.389
a grenade to the creature and flees. The creature
touches Kane's remains and ignites the lighthouse.

00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:35.079
The shimmer fades as she runs.
The man tries to get some details from Lena

00:13:35.079 --> 00:13:40.480
about the alien and says, " Do you remember
its form, to which she replies no. The man

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:46.320
says that it came here for a reason. It was
mutating and destroying everything. Lena disagrees

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.699
and says it was making something. She gets
to know that Kane's condition stabilized after

00:13:50.699 --> 00:13:56.780
the shimmer went down. Lena wants to see him
and asks that you are not Kane. He replies

00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:04.161
I am not. Are you Lena, and she says I don't
know? Both of them hug each other, and their

00:14:04.161 --> 00:14:05.300
irises shimmer, and the movie ends.
