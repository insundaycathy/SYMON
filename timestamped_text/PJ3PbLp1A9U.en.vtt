i think the season as a whole probably
has<00:11:38.720><c> been</c><00:11:38.880><c> one</c><00:11:39.040><c> of</c><00:11:39.200><c> the</c><00:11:39.279><c> weaker</c><00:11:39.600><c> ones</c>

00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
has been one of the weaker ones
 

00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:41.910 align:start position:0%
has been one of the weaker ones
