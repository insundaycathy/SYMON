what's the truth out of this marriage I
mean<00:11:27.460><c> the</c><00:11:27.580><c> marriage</c><00:11:27.820><c> was</c><00:11:28.000><c> basically</c><00:11:28.390><c> built</c><00:11:28.690><c> on</c>

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:28.930 align:start position:0%
mean the marriage was basically built on
 

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
mean the marriage was basically built on
a<00:11:28.960><c> bunch</c><00:11:29.230><c> of</c><00:11:29.350><c> lies</c><00:11:29.590><c> it</c><00:11:29.830><c> sounds</c><00:11:30.160><c> like</c><00:11:30.340><c> so</c><00:11:30.640><c> I</c>

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:31.390 align:start position:0%
a bunch of lies it sounds like so I
 

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
a bunch of lies it sounds like so I
suspect<00:11:32.290><c> this</c><00:11:32.410><c> just</c><00:11:32.860><c> goes</c><00:11:33.460><c> into</c><00:11:33.730><c> the</c><00:11:33.820><c> kids</c>

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:34.030 align:start position:0%
suspect this just goes into the kids
 

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.850 align:start position:0%
suspect this just goes into the kids
vision<00:11:34.870><c> of</c><00:11:35.020><c> their</c><00:11:35.170><c> parents</c><00:11:35.560><c> and</c><00:11:35.650><c> everything</c>

vision of their parents and everything
 

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
vision of their parents and everything
so<00:11:36.250><c> this</c><00:11:36.430><c> could</c><00:11:36.640><c> be</c><00:11:36.670><c> something</c><00:11:36.790><c> again</c><00:11:37.300><c> where</c>
