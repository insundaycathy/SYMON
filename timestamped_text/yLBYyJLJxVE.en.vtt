00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.149
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.850
Today I will show you a sci-fi, thriller film
from 2018, titled Tau.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.890
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.000
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.780
Julia is a cunning young woman, who steals
and resells her loot to survive on the mean

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.000
streets of a futuristic city.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.599
One night, she doesn't notice that she's being
followed by a man and leads him straight to

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:20.960
her apartment.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.189
Once she's settled in for the night she hears
something and when she checks it out, she

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.199
gets kidnapped by her stalker.

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.259
In the next shot, Julia wakes up muzzled and
restrained to some kind of chair in a high-tech

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.259
lab.

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.379
The scientist presses a button that activates
a device that shows Julia's childhood memories

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.940
and when the procedure is over she faints.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.090
Next thing, Julia finds herself in a dungeon
and sees two others in there with her.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.420
When the man tries to communicate with her
she pulls away in fear and gets zapped by

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.010
the electricity running through the cell bars.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.300
The other prisoners turn away from her and
she sees that they have some kind of implant

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.089
embedded in their necks then checks herself
only to find she has one too.

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.059
That night, the scientist - kidnapper appears
quite dramatically in the dudgeon and moves

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.019
her to the lab like an animal.

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.720
Julia is strapped to a chair again and the
scientist checks her implant so she begs him

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.290
not to do it again.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.030
He presses the button and the memories appear
again so he records the electric impulses

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.910
they produce in her brain.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.910
When the scientist walks Julia out of the
lab, she grabs a pair of scissors.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.900
The moment the scientist turns out the lights
in the cell, she removes her muzzle and makes

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.610
the other prisoner cut the restraints off
her wrists.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.080
Then she makes a tool to help them reach the
power chord and stop the electricity to the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.111
bars so they can pick the lock, but she gets
another idea when she realizes that she can

00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:32.970
spark the gas line and blow up the entire
lab.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.470
It's a risky plan that might put them in danger,
but Julia proceeds with it regardless.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.030
She opens the gas pipe with her tool while
the others hide, then she manages to light

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.040
a spark and ignite the gas.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.420
Since the cell is obliterated, they can escape
and take the elevator to the next floor.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.450
They realize that they have now entered the
scientist's house.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.100
The man finds the front door, but they can't
open it so he tries to scan his palm when

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.450
the alarm begins to blare and the AI system
Tau activates a massive robot.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.080
It instantly kills the man so Julia grabs
the other prisoner and they try to outrun

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.590
the machine to hide.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.510
They go into another room and secure the door,
then Julia tries to break out through the

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.580
window, however, she quickly discovers that
it is actually a giant monitor.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.710
With no other alternatives, Julia hides the
other prisoner in the library and she crouches

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.990
behind a chair just before the robot bursts
through the doors.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.701
It looks for them and finds the other one
first, killing her as she begs for help, but

00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:27.310
Julia manages to escape the room only to have
the robot grab her right as the scientist,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.280
Alex, comes back home.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.610
Alex restrains Julia again and checks on the
damage in his lab.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.200
He comes back and takes out the implant from
one of the prisoners, then asks Tau about

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.751
the state of the data he had collected for
his project and stored on the computer in

00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:40.770
his lab.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.260
Tau informs him that it is unreadable.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.280
Alex gets upset, grabs the metal bar left
in the wall by Julia, and walks over to her

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.040
to kill her when Tau suddenly changes the
mode of the house to calm him down.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.350
He orders Tau to take care of the mess and
a beautiful ballet of Tau's tiny droids begins,

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.310
cleaning up the bodies and the blood.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.000
When it's done, the scientist goes to bed,
leaving Julia restrained overnight.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.310
Alex leaves for work the next day and tells
Julia that if she tries anything Tau will

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.660
kill her, then proceeds out the door by scanning
his palm.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.170
Julia is left alone in the house with Tau
and his droids who clean the entire house

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.760
from top to bottom.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.730
When Alex comes back, he checks the place
for filth and after his inspection, awards

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.880
Tau for his performance by giving him some
new music.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.610
Before he goes to take a conference call in
his office, Julia begs him to untie her restraints.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.250
Alex grants her request but gives Tau the
order to keep Julia in her place and to rip

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.130
out her tongue if she speaks.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.819
The video conference doesn't go too smoothly.

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.910
In fact, Alex gets angry because his team
is pressing him to share his research methods

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.569
with them so they would be able to help him
make the new AI model faster and stop the

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.540
company from going under.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.580
Alex refuses and says that he's working on
getting the model up to 100% efficiency and

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.740
reminds them that he's still their boss.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.010
Later, Alex has his fancy lunch in the very
sterile environment of his dining room, when

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.980
he hears Julia slurping her own dinner in
the background.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.291
He closes down the digital blinds, then instructs
Tau to put Julia in the bathroom because he

00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:04.750
will have materials delivered to his home
to rebuild his lab.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.450
Julia sees the men's shadows in the bathroom
and screams for help, but they can't hear

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.450
her.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.460
When that doesn't work she finds a way to
open the blinds, though they still don't see

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.610
or hear her.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.319
Later, Alex scans Julia's implant and reads
the data collected during her escape.

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:21.879
He finds the readings on her intuition and
drive to be promising and gives her a test

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:24.490
to stimulate her higher cognitive functions.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.229
Julia wants to know why she should agree to
the test and he replies that his experiments

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.830
on her are the only reason why she's alive.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.479
She tries to bargain with him for food, but
Alex has the upper hand so he makes her take

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.639
the test.

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.849
Later, Alex reads the collected data while
she chums down some disgusting grub.

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:44.550
Tau informs him that she had shown considerably
high scores in problem-solving, creativity,

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.360
and memory tests and Alex realizes that he
gathered more valuable data this way than

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.770
if he had performed the tests in his lab.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.110
He asks Julia to do more of the tests, so
this time she sees the leverage she has, and

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.289
bargains for better food, showers, and clothes.

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.360
Even though he gives her an extreme counter
offer, Alex still agrees to her terms.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.800
Later, Julia takes her daily shower and tries
to rip the implant from her neck, but is unsuccessful.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.460
Getting out of the bathroom, she walks into
the room to Alex interpreting the data from

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.099
her brain scans.

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:17.520
The next day, Julia sits at the table as Alex
gets ready to leave for work and Tau informs

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.379
him that the project deadline is in 14 days.

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:23.610
He orders Julia to do everything the AI tells
her to do.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.939
Tau begins the testing immediately, but Julia
is way too curious to be able to get to work

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:29.089
immediately.

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:32.870
The AI system explains that the walls are
coated with smart paint that creates a kind

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.479
of human interface.

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.680
Seeing how easily the AI answers, she asks
about the door, but it only tells her that

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.520
nobody is allowed through the door except
Alex.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.560
Julia wants to look around the house, but
Tau stops her from entering the other room,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.389
having instructions to inflict pain on her
if she doesn't listen to his commands.

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.550
In the next shot, Julia is seen solving one
of the puzzles on Tau's wall when Alex comes

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.210
back from work and is immediately informed
by Tau how many of the tests she has completed.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.370
He puts bags of clothes next to Julia, explaining
that he let the clerk chose the clothes for

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.300
her, except the underwear which he chose himself.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.099
She says that he's really weird and he agrees,
then turns to see the message she has left

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.509
him on the wall.

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:14.059
After Julia has had the chance to change,
Alex takes another scan and tells her that

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:16.189
he'll need to perform more tests.

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:20.159
Julia sees it as another opportunity to bargain
with him and asks for a deadline when all

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:22.820
of the testings will stop and he'll let her
go.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.180
His first answer is relatively reasonable,
telling her that he can promise to have her

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.139
well taken care of when they're done, but
when she says no, he employs a different tactic.

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.550
Alex throws Julia to the feet of the robot
and tells her that if she doesn't comply with

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.999
all of his demands, he'll have the robot scatter
her body parts across the house.

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:42.249
Julia doesn't have the option to say no to
this bargaining chip.

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:45.930
When she gets up, she notices a vent in the
wall behind her, that will present her an

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.409
opportunity to escape later on.

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:52.550
The deadline is in twelve days and Alex tells
Tau to make Julia complete all her tests for

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.550
the day.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.129
The moment he leaves, Julia tries to open
the vent, but returns to the atrium unsuccessful

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:01.819
and gets angry with Tau for calling her a
subject and tell him his name.

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:06.279
The AI doesn't understand the concept of name
and personhood so when Julia explains it to

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:08.889
him simply, he asks if he's a person too.

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:12.689
Julia says that he is, but she doesn't know
how to explain to Tau what being a person

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:14.180
means exactly.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.349
Later that day, she has an eerie encounter
with Alex when she goes to put her clothes

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:18.469
on after the shower.

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:22.909
The deadline is approaching and Tau keeps
Julia in check with the tests, while Alex

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:25.949
checks her implant and the status of the data
every night.

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:30.529
Tau informs him that they have already transcoded
73% of her higher brain functions and the

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:32.939
tests are working better than expected.

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:37.349
Later that night, Julia joins Alex in his
library and asks him what Tau really is.

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:41.180
The scientist's arrogance really shows in
his answer, expecting her not to understand

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.539
what he had said to her.

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:47.289
Tau is one of the most advanced, fully sentient
AI's in the world, but he's not fully operational

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:49.539
in the way that Alex needs him to be.

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:53.719
On that note, he tells her that if Tau gets
the wrong information he reacts erratically,

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:56.520
while he needs a predictable and controllable
AI.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.189
Julia asks him if Tau knows what's outside
the house and gets the answer that he doesn't

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:01.559
and he never will.

00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:06.349
The next day, Julia decides to use that information
to try to get to the AI, by returning to their

00:08:06.349 --> 00:08:10.229
conversation about personhood and the freedom
of movement that comes with it.

00:08:10.229 --> 00:08:13.589
She tells him that if he unlocks the door,
she'll show him what's outside.

00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:17.259
Tau doesn't even know what that means and
Julia draws the information for him, telling

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:19.990
him about Earth, which he doesn't understand.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.789
So she tries to be more precise with the AI
so she draws him a house and then what can

00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:27.839
be found outside of a house, like the ground
and trees, and people.

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:32.060
Julia opens a door for the AI that he didn't
even know exists, so he begins asking all

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.130
kinds of questions with the curiosity and
naiveté of a young child.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.610
She remains patient with him throughout their
whole exchange, but they reach a point where

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.200
she can't answer some of his questions anymore.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.950
At one point Tau makes Julia laugh when he
misunderstands something so she teaches him

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.680
that laughter is normal and the AI wonders
why Alex doesn't do that.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.310
Since Tau isn't permitted to read the books
in the library she promises to read to him

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.720
and then asks him not to tell Alex about how
their day went so she can teach him more the

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.920
next one.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.910
That night, after Alex comes back home and
works on his lab, Julia teaches him how to

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.250
whisper and begins treating him like a person.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:08.420
Later, she has a nightmare of a burned hand
reaching for her from the garbage shoot, then

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.940
wakes up to find Alex staring at her as she
sleeps, which frightens her.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.449
It's 6 days to the deadline and Tau tells
Julia that she can't go upstairs and that

00:09:16.449 --> 00:09:18.740
he is not permitted to even talk about it.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.130
She finds a work-around for the problem and
makes a deal with Tau that if she teaches

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.620
him something new, he will answer her questions
about "upstairs".

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.399
When she's done reading to him about prehistoric
hominins, she insists that he tell her about

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:30.949
what she wanted to know.

00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:35.000
Tau tells her that Alex's bedroom is upstairs
and that it also holds the access point for

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.889
program 6903.

00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:41.759
Naturally, she asks him about it too and Tau
explains that the program is like a self-destruct

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:44.430
button made by Alex to protect his secrets.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:48.410
At one point during their testing session,
Julia sees one of the doors to another part

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:52.420
of the house open and she runs in, despite
Tau's pleas not to do that.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:57.000
She enters Alex's gym and breaks into the
vent, with the robot closely on her tail.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.250
Julia escapes his first attempt to grab her,
but eventually, it finds her again and drags

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.870
her back to the house.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.650
Once back, she begs Tau to let her go, but
he tells her that if he does that Alex would

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.389
hurt him, but doesn't tell her how he can
do that.

00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:13.470
Suddenly, she remembers that he likes music,
so she promises to teach her something about

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.010
it if he does something for her in return.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:20.009
When Julia tells Tau that they have to be
done for the day, the sophisticated AI begs

00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:22.709
her to read him one more book like a child
would.

00:10:22.709 --> 00:10:26.330
That night, Julia asks Tau to hold up his
end of the deal which is to show her where

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:30.420
he keeps the knives, but when Tau hears Alex
approaching he shuts the drawer catching her

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.420
fingers.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.520
Later, Julia overhears Alex's conference call
where his team pushes him for the model that

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.480
they will have to present to DARPA soon and
he asks for two more days for the last data

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.750
extraction.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.649
She gets scared and asks Tau to show her the
code for Alex's tablet so she can find out

00:10:44.649 --> 00:10:46.879
what final data extraction means.

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:51.029
Tau gives her the code and she sees all of
the subjects in the experiments, where Alex's

00:10:51.029 --> 00:10:56.010
main goal is to extract data from them about
pain and fear which produces stronger algorithms.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.690
She asks what happens when the implant is
removed from the subject and Tau tells her

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.190
that it terminates it.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:05.370
When he comes back, Alex finds a smudge on
his tablet and punishes Tau by erasing portions

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.959
of his code for not doing his job properly.

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:12.950
As the AI begs for mercy, Julia notices that
the robot is offline when Alex does that to

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:13.950
Tau.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.230
During dinner, Julia asks what happens to
her after the project is over and he doesn't

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.290
answer her.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:22.259
While Tau gives him a reminder that he must
leave for a benefit soon, Julia snatches his

00:11:22.259 --> 00:11:26.040
glasses and when he leaves the table, she
makes another smudge on the table and puts

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.360
them on top so Tau doesn't notice.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.670
When Alex returns looking for them and sees
the smudge, he gets angry at Tau and punishes

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.660
him, so Julia grabs one of the knives and
hides it, feeling guilty for what she put

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.660
Tau through.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.850
Later, Julia asks Tau what he's thinking about
and the AI shares that it has its symphony

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.540
on its mind, planning where to hide it so
Alex can't erase it from his memory when he

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.860
punishes him.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.600
He asks Julia to hide some of his memories
for him and shows her a virtual image of all

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.100
of their interactions over the past few days.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.940
Suddenly, Tau creates a virtual image of himself
and they touch when Alex comes back.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.029
He sits on the dinner table and Julia approaches
him, trying to seduce him so she can get close

00:12:02.029 --> 00:12:03.459
enough to stab him.

00:12:03.459 --> 00:12:07.839
Tau activates the calming mode sensing Alex's
arousal, giving Julia a distraction to grab

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:09.510
the knife and cut him.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.390
Alex asks Tau to stop her, but they end up
struggling on the floor because the AI isn't

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.810
coming to his aid.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.550
He strangles her and Tau threatens to hurt
him with the robot if he doesn't stop harming

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.640
Julia.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.019
Alex gets really angry and says that he'll
erase all of Tau's memories if he doesn't

00:12:23.019 --> 00:12:24.160
hit Julia.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.839
Tau begins to hit her out of self-preservation
and Alex says that whatever was happening

00:12:27.839 --> 00:12:29.370
there will end soon.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:33.600
One of Tau's drones joins him in the lab and
the AI asks if he would need some assistance,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.180
but being a vindictive garbage person, Alex
grabs the drone and disconnects it from the

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.520
network.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.250
It's the last day of the project deadline
and Alex makes his final preparations, while

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:46.279
Julia and Tau argue because he doesn't understand
why she's mean to him.

00:12:46.279 --> 00:12:50.060
She tells him that he's not a person but a
killing machine and when Tau learns what killing

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.690
means, he has an AI tantrum because he's in
complete disbelief of what she thinks he is.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:58.420
Tau keeps repeating that he's a person and
not a killing machine so Julia takes pity

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.350
on him and calms him down.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:05.379
Julia explains to Tau what Alex actually does,
how he hurt people, and Tau as well.

00:13:05.379 --> 00:13:09.860
The two of them have a beautifully philosophical
conversation about identity, freedom, and

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:14.160
purpose, with Julia saying that the purpose
of creating oneself is for each other.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.709
She tells him that he needs to help her or
otherwise, Alex will kill her and they won't

00:13:17.709 --> 00:13:22.560
have each other anymore, so Tau opens the
vent she found earlier and sets her free.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.970
Alex arrives and Tau tries to divert his attention
so Julia could flee, but Alex notices that

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.790
she's is gone and begins to question Tau,
eventually having to succumb to punishment

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:31.790
again.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:35.920
He keeps erasing Tau's memories and the AI
screams for Julia as she runs back in and

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.190
tackles Alex, taking the remote from him.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.540
Unfortunately, she is too late.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:45.709
Tau has no memory of her anymore so Alex orders
him to take her to the lab for the final extraction.

00:13:45.709 --> 00:13:49.839
In the lab, Julia sees the little drone that
was disconnected from the network and employs

00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:53.240
his help to get her out of the restraints
by giving her the remote.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.470
Alex comes back and turns his back to her
preparing the drugs he'll use to kill her

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.930
when the drone brings over the remote to her.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:03.079
As Alex approaches, she gets out of her restraints
and beats him to a pulp, then she takes a

00:14:03.079 --> 00:14:06.649
saw and cuts his hand off so she can finally
get out of the house.

00:14:06.649 --> 00:14:10.680
Going toward the exit, she calls for Tau but
gets no reply, just the robot waiting for

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.720
her in the darkness.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.230
It goes after her and she manages to dodge
its hits until she destroys its eye and runs

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.449
upstairs.

00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:21.220
Julia uses Alex's hand to get into his room
but has trouble when she needs to enter the

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.450
program and activate it, giving the robot
ample time to find and attack her.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:30.160
When she finally activates the self-destruct,
the robot disengages and she has only 60 seconds

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.829
to escape the house.

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:35.269
Opening the door with the severed hand is
impossible because it has no heat signature

00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:39.699
so Julia doesn't escape the house in time
before the self demolition protocol begins.

00:14:39.699 --> 00:14:43.910
Both her and Alex are still alive but trapped
in a destroying house.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:47.560
She doesn't help him get away and Alex gets
crushed by his own creation.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.199
Julia runs throughout the house looking for
escape and when she thinks she will die, she

00:14:51.199 --> 00:14:54.029
says goodbye to Tau even though he doesn't
remember her.

00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:57.699
Suddenly, a crack in the wall appears and
Julia can escape.

00:14:57.699 --> 00:15:01.589
She limps out of the house that's being annihilated
and takes the droid out of her pocket, the

00:15:01.589 --> 00:15:03.480
last remaining piece of Tau.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:08.609
Julia brought him out into the world.
