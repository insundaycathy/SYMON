00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.160
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain an action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.240
horror, science fiction, and thriller film called&nbsp;
"Morgan." Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.960
Through the view of a surveillance camera, Dr.&nbsp;
Kathy Grieff enters a secured room and prepares&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.840
lunch. She calls Morgan, an artificial being with&nbsp;
synthetic D.N.A, and invites her over for a meal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.920
As Kathy sits down, Morgan&nbsp;
examines her own hands curiously.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.680
Out of nowhere, Morgan pushes aside the plates&nbsp;
on the table, jumps on it, and proceeds to stab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.080
Kathy. Luckily, two other doctors come&nbsp;
inside to intervene and sedate Morgan.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.000
To further analyze the incident, SynSect, a&nbsp;
genetic engineering company, decides to consult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.320
with an expert. A risk management specialist named&nbsp;
Lee Weathers receives a call demanding her urgent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.920
response as an emergency happened in the company.&nbsp;
After a long drive, she arrives at a rural area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.560
where Ted Brenner, the project manager, welcomes&nbsp;
her. Ted offers her a tour of the whole place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.680
but she politely declines, saying&nbsp;
that they should get down to business.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.600
In the room, Lee meets Dr. Amy Menser, Morgan's&nbsp;
behaviorist, and discusses their work field. Amy's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.080
friendliness is turned down by Lee's strict and&nbsp;
severe demeanor, cutting their interaction short.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.720
Later, Lee comes down to the kitchen and meets&nbsp;
the team nutritionist, Skip Vronsky. Afterward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.840
Ted accompanies her to Kathy's room, where her&nbsp;
recovery is being monitored. Lee asks if she could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.960
have a moment in private with Kathy to discuss&nbsp;
the attack’s nature immediately. Kathy is in a bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.080
state as her eye is still patched, but she claims&nbsp;
that she looks worse than she feels. According to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.960
her, Morgan used to be happy and gentle until the&nbsp;
company decided to lock her inside the secluded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.920
room. Despite Morgan being the reason behind&nbsp;
her wound, Kathy still holds her in high regard.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.960
Lee then meets Dr. Simon Ziegler, who leads&nbsp;
the project known as "L-9." He explains the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.160
nature of the project and its creation and how&nbsp;
synthetic D.N.A and nanotechnology are combined.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.960
After two failed experiments, their successful&nbsp;
one so far is the creation of Morgan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.600
Because of the rapid growth rate of the organism,&nbsp;
Morgan could already walk and talk after a month&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.800
of her so-called "birth." According to Simon,&nbsp;
Morgan is everything they have hoped for—a hybrid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.080
biological organism that can think and feel. After&nbsp;
Morgan's first birthday, she already looks like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.280
a grown young woman. After, Simon shows Lee the&nbsp;
incident footage and adds that Morgan was allowed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.400
exposure to the outside world at a young age,&nbsp;
which the others think was a mistake. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.160
he still thinks that the project is gearing in&nbsp;
the right direction with enough conditioning.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.120
Lee is toured inside Morgan's room to meet&nbsp;
her personally. In the line of recent events,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.960
Lee is kept outside the room for&nbsp;
protection. Morgan is polite and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.520
friendly during their first meeting, and she&nbsp;
even apologizes repeatedly for hurting Kathy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.360
claiming that it was unintentional.&nbsp;
After the ones in charge of her leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.840
Morgan recalls a fond memory of her and&nbsp;
Amy in the woods. Apart from everyone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.920
she feels most comfortable with Amy, who&nbsp;
treats her more like a sister than a prototype.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.960
At dinner, Lee joins the team for a meal and meets&nbsp;
other members: Doctors Darren and Brenda Finch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.920
who are a couple, and Dr. Lui Cheng, whom&nbsp;
Morgan considers as her "mother." Lee is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.400
pleased to meet Lui as she thinks highly of her,&nbsp;
and they even converse in the latter's language.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.000
She explains that her job is to assess&nbsp;
risk against the company's profit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.120
and she refers to Morgan as an object&nbsp;
rather than someone who has feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.720
On the table, they also discuss a similar&nbsp;
project in Helsinki, in which prototypes killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.480
21 researchers. To the team's defense, Simon says&nbsp;
that Morgan is much more advanced than the others.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.240
After the meal, Lee browses through old videos of&nbsp;
Morgan to assess her behavior, but the computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.520
glitches. To her surprise, Morgan looks directly&nbsp;
at her intently through the surveillance camera,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.200
but she pays no mind to it. Later that night, Lee&nbsp;
and Skip share a conversation over some drinks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.840
He tells her that he and Amy used to have a fling&nbsp;
in the past, which Amy overhears from a distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.120
Skip makes a move and kisses Lee not long after,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.480
but he apologizes for it right&nbsp;
away, and the two say good night.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.760
Meanwhile, Amy walks over to Morgan's room&nbsp;
to spend some time with her. She disables&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.560
the cameras before approaching Morgan's cell to&nbsp;
remind her about the psychological test tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.360
Amy assures her that everything will turn out&nbsp;
fine as long as she stays true to herself. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.160
two of them lay their hands on the glass as an act&nbsp;
of sisterly love and affection. To ease Morgan's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.720
worries, Amy tells her about the beautiful Lake&nbsp;
Navar, a place where she'll take her someday.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.120
Morgan gets a flashback of her and Amy out in the&nbsp;
woods on one sunny day. Not far from their spot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.120
Morgan sees an injured deer impaled on&nbsp;
a branch and approaches the poor animal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.840
After caressing it, Morgan suddenly breaks&nbsp;
its neck as an act of mercy, which shocks Amy.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.680
The day of Morgan's psychological analysis arrives&nbsp;
and is to be conducted by Dr. Alan Shapiro.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.800
He is supposed to sit outside the room while&nbsp;
examining Morgan, but he thinks that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.360
interaction will be pointless. Claiming that&nbsp;
it is his job to build trust with the subject,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.640
Alan decides to enter the room despite the team's&nbsp;
warnings. He sits across Morgan and is surprised&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.960
that she knows his name and the reason for his&nbsp;
visit. The first question Alan asks Morgan is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.280
the reason behind her sadness, to which she&nbsp;
replies that it is about the incident with Kathy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.080
At this point, Alan takes note of Morgan's&nbsp;
remorse after doing something terrible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.960
He then questions Morgan about her life inside&nbsp;
the room and how she feels about being locked up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.920
When Morgan says that she is pleased, he throws&nbsp;
more questions that slightly make her tearful.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.920
In the middle of their conversation, Morgan&nbsp;
fires questions about Alan's daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.120
whom he seldom sees, a topic that catches&nbsp;
him off-guard. Alan loses his cool and starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.120
raising his voice at Morgan while asking how&nbsp;
she would react if he recommended the doctors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.840
terminate her. Unexpectedly, Morgan sheds&nbsp;
a tear and reaches her breaking point after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.960
Alan's pressuring words. Morgan looks at her hands&nbsp;
and pushes Alan against the wall, lunging at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.280
She bites hard into his throat and rips&nbsp;
a chunk out, leaving the doctor bloody.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.080
The team is alerted by the commotion, and&nbsp;
Darren attempts to sedate Morgan once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:09.040
However, Morgan uses Alan as a shield and advances&nbsp;
at Darren, whom she knocks to the ground. When Lee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.120
tries to calm her down, the lights go out,&nbsp;
and Morgan escapes in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.200
Lee quickly grabs a tranquilizer to prevent her&nbsp;
from escaping. Outside, Morgan feels sunlight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.320
for the first time in months and sees Amy waiting&nbsp;
for the evaluation results. With her face caked in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.200
blood, she feels a sense of comfort upon seeing&nbsp;
Amy but is abruptly swept when Lee sedates her.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.160
Inside the lab, Morgan regains consciousness&nbsp;
and apologizes for her actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.880
The team of doctors debates on what to do&nbsp;
with her and what is best for the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.480
Cheng is certain of terminating&nbsp;
Morgan, but Simon persuades her not to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.280
as it will waste their years of work. Once they&nbsp;
reach the final decision of getting rid of her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.080
Simon sadly walks away, disappointed by the&nbsp;
verdict authorized by Lee. The whole team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.560
gets emotional upon preparing the termination&nbsp;
procedure, as Morgan has grown close to their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.360
hearts and has been a part of their daily routine.&nbsp;
Morgan tearfully pleads with everyone in the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.800
to not kill her, even calling Cheng "mother," but&nbsp;
she coldly says that she is not her mother. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.160
sedating Morgan, Cheng apologizes for failing&nbsp;
her and walks away. While she lays unconscious,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.320
Darren prepares the lethal injection but&nbsp;
changes his mind and leaves the lab with Brenda.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.240
Without the medical team in sight,&nbsp;
Lee decides to do it herself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.640
but Ted stops her from doing so. Lee hits&nbsp;
him in the face and holds him at gunpoint,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.680
but Amy shoots her with a sedative, causing&nbsp;
her to doze off. As she regains consciousness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.120
she finds herself locked inside&nbsp;
Morgan's room while Ted stands outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.520
Lee commands him to let her out before the&nbsp;
higher-ups arrive, but he ignores her. 
 &nbsp;

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.080
Amy, Ted, Brenda, and Darren gather supplies&nbsp;
to get Morgan out of the lab safely. Amy tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:50.080
to wake Morgan up, but she is too weak to respond,&nbsp;
so Darren tries to sit her down. However, Morgan's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.360
personality shifts and she headbutts Darren in&nbsp;
the face. While he is on the ground, Morgan grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.080
the lethal injection and sticks it in Darren's&nbsp;
chest, ultimately killing him. Ted holds a gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.280
to her face in an attempt to stop her, but Morgan&nbsp;
manages to grab the pistol and shoots him instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.680
The wounded Ted makes his way back to Morgan's&nbsp;
room, but she shoots him again as Lee watches.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.720
In an intimidating manner, Morgan turns to Lee&nbsp;
to say that she feels like herself now that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.120
is free. She cuts the conversation short and&nbsp;
leaves Lee locked inside the glass room. 
 &nbsp;

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.640
Outside, Brenda instructs the clueless Skip to&nbsp;
be ready to leave while she loads the supplies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.440
in the car. When Skip sees Amy walking&nbsp;
alongside Morgan, he senses that something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.000
is amiss and runs back to the building to&nbsp;
look for Lee. As Brenda reunites with Amy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.920
she asks about Darren's whereabouts, but&nbsp;
Amy could not utter any word at the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.520
Morgan points a gun at Brenda from behind, but the&nbsp;
doctor fights back and gets into a brawl with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.840
However, Morgan's strength remains unmatched,&nbsp;
eventually beating Brenda to death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.920
Amy is lost for words, but Morgan&nbsp;
assures her that she is safe with her.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.520
Hungry for revenge, Morgan makes her way back&nbsp;
to the house, where she sees Kathy, who tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.160
to approach her in a friendly way. However,&nbsp;
Morgan kicks her in the head until she dies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.600
Meanwhile, Lee manages to escape by climbing to&nbsp;
the top of the glass ceiling and breaking it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.320
Outside, she sees Skip, still shaken by the&nbsp;
devastating deaths occurring in the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.840
and instructs him to grab a weapon.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.200
While Cheng makes a video confession of the&nbsp;
incident during Morgan's psychological analysis,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.920
Morgan enters her room and walks toward her.&nbsp;
After Morgan gives her a kiss on the forehead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.880
Cheng is suffocated to death, and her murder&nbsp;
is caught on camera. In another room, Lee sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.640
the lifeless Simon hung from a cabinet,&nbsp;
an act that Morgan has also carried out.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.240
Upon discovering Cheng's corpse, Lee inspects&nbsp;
the room for any signs of Morgan, who emerges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.040
from one of the corners to attack her. Both of&nbsp;
them get into a brawl, taking turns throwing each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.080
other across the room. As the fight progresses,&nbsp;
they accidentally throw themselves outside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:53.200
window and land where Amy's car is parked. 
 
Skip tries to stop Morgan, but she knocks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.080
down and drives out of the area. Determined to&nbsp;
catch Morgan, Lee gets in her car as well and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.040
prompts a blood-pumping car chase through the&nbsp;
woods. While driving, Morgan manages to bump&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.760
Lee's car enough times for her to crash into&nbsp;
a big tree. Though Amy begs for her to stop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:13.120
Morgan continues to drive, utterly unmoved by&nbsp;
the destruction she has caused. To Lee's luck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.000
she survives the crash and is rescued by Skip, who&nbsp;
claims to know where Morgan and Amy are headed.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.800
In the vast forest, Morgan and Amy find their&nbsp;
way to Lake Navar, a journey they awaited for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:28.800
so long. Despite Morgan's claims not to harm her,&nbsp;
Amy remains vigilant and keeps a weapon with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.960
Upon arriving at their destination, Morgan&nbsp;
sheds a tear of joy over the breathtaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.360
view of the lake. For the first time in&nbsp;
her life, she feels more alive than ever,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.200
experiencing the true freedom she craves.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Meanwhile, Lee grabs Skip's rifle and&nbsp;
goes to the woods to kill Morgan herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:50.080
She fires a shot, grabbing Morgan's attention, who&nbsp;
also decides to return to the woods and fight her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:56.080
When Lee gets a sight of Morgan, she fires a shot&nbsp;
but misses. From behind, Morgan catches up on Lee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.800
and initiates another brawl in the middle of the&nbsp;
forest. After numerous punches are thrown at each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.360
other, Morgan pushes Lee to a trunk where she&nbsp;
gets impaled by a branch, just like the deer. 
 &nbsp;

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.080
To Morgan's surprise, Lee follows her back&nbsp;
to the lake and pushes her into the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.840
She then proceeds to hold Morgan underwater until&nbsp;
she drowns to death and leaves. Lee plants another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.840
kill by grabbing Amy's weapon effortlessly&nbsp;
and shoots her before she kills Skip as well.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.320
The company head, Jim Bryce, discusses the&nbsp;
incident to other board members and declares&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.120
the project involving Morgan a failure. One&nbsp;
of his associates asks about Lee Weathers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.000
to which Bryce replies that she is perfect.&nbsp;
After carrying out her mission successfully,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.080
Lee goes to a local restaurant and looks at&nbsp;
her hands—a gesture similar to Morgan's. 
 &nbsp;

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.640
Unexpectedly, Morgan and Lee have far&nbsp;
more in common than what is portrayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.600
Their same gestures and superhuman strengths&nbsp;
demonstrate that Lee was once a prototype as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.120
It turns out Lee is just on an&nbsp;
undercover duty to monitor the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.080
project and test Morgan's abilities against&nbsp;
hers. It insinuates that just like Morgan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.640
she is also bioengineered to carry out special&nbsp;
missions that she can successfully ace on her own.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.640
With the associates discussing Lee's&nbsp;
perfection, it is proven that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.560
is a successful product of their modern&nbsp;
technology and is their best asset so far.
