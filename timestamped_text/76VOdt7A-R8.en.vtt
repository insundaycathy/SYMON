00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.120
If you found an abandoned mall in the middle
of a zombie apocalypse, what would you do?

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.839
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
the survivors, see if we can make better decisions,

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.559
and ultimately attempt to beat the zombie
hordes in, Dawn of the Dead.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.100
If you think you have a better way, let me
know in the comments!

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.310
We start out following Nurse Ana, talking
to a doctor about a man who for some reason

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.529
needed a head X-Ray when he was only bitten
on the hand from a bar fight.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:28.529
Suspicious.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.320
Ana gets back home in the morning, and finds
her husband drinking beer and watching TV.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.850
It seems like movie characters always find
a way to miss the emergency news, but back

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.460
in 2004 nobody had iPhones.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.289
If the alert is only being broadcasted on
your TV, there’s a good chance you’re

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.370
gonna miss it and find out there’s an apocalypse
the hard way.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.050
Louis wakes up to that rollerblader girl standing
in the bedroom doorway.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.399
Who the hell is that nonchalant about waking
up to a random neighbor child standing in

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:56.399
their bedroom?

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:19.870
I’d be on full alert self-defense mode.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.690
Talk about going 0-100 real quick, you were
just waking up from your peaceful slumber

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.270
and bam, some psycho child broke into your
house, ripped your husbands neck out with

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.950
her teeth, and now he’s bleeding out on
your bed seconds away from death.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.970
This clarifies the saying, police are minutes
away when seconds count.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.960
Time to clock back in Nurse Ana.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.930
Looks like his carotid artery was ripped open,
meaning he has seconds before losing consciousness,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.750
and will be dead in a few minutes.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:58.580
There’s really nothing she can do, especially
since it was torn open by a bite.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:12.069
Ana got super lucky that she was able to slip
out of his grasp, grab the keys, dive into

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.650
the bathroom while closing the door, and not
knock herself unconscious by banging her head

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.049
off the bathtub.

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.379
Having a window in your bathroom was also
super lucky.

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:34.370
Had that been a windowless bathroom, Ana’s
side to this story would be over.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.260
As stupid as this was, I can’t 100% fault
her for it.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.329
She just had her entire reality flipped upside
down and smashed into pieces within seconds.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.530
It’s not hard to imagine that her mind might
attempt to return to normalcy considering

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.459
how unreal this situation is.

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.739
Ana narrowly escapes through the window by
blindly back kicking Louis in the head.

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.770
I guess adrenaline turns you into a Krav Maga,
Parkour expert.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.080
Judging by the truck in the driveway, Louis
was probably a lineman who worked similar

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.459
late shifts, so I partially rescind my judgement
of his morning drinking.

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.260
See, some of you guys think I'd be more likely
to survive in these situations.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.569
But this type of overthinking would get me
killed way too often.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.650
Pretty much everything is fricked as far as
she can see.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.099
Explosions, military helicopters, everyone
attacking each other.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.739
Ana manages to not fumble and drop the keys
when getting into her car, which is impressive

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.379
considering your fine motor skills are going
to be severely impaired.

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.060
She finally gets the emergency radio broadcast.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.520
They are providing instructions for evacuation
centers.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.879
Yah, the government set up evacuation centers
in a few hours?

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:39.879
Bullcrap.

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.329
Realistically they’d just tell everyone
to shelter in place.

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.750
That’d be a reasonable thing to do, but
not for Ana anymore.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.249
At least she doesn’t live in that nearby
city.

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:52.760
So all this chaos just happened to you, you
are sitting in your car and the radio is dispersing

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.769
hopium about an evacuation center that surely
is overrun.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.540
Where do you go, what do you do.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.349
Well, I definitely wouldn’t be stopping
for anyone or anything.

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.409
A car is the only thing between you and death
right now.

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:11.319
It’s a good thing she’s driving a Toyota
Corolla, very reliable car, apocalypse approved.

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.819
She lives in a suburban area near Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.230
Since Ana has no family, and her house is
compromised, i’d say heading to the Horicon

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.540
National Wildlife Area which is 60 miles away
would be a good idea.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.190
The onset of the apocalypse was extremely
fast, too fast for an evacuation to commence.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.450
The local onramps and highways should still
be accessible.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.740
She should have enough gas to get to Horicon,
but remember, 55-65 mph is the sweet spot

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.370
for fuel efficiency, you do not want to have
to get out and start pumping gas.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.300
There will be far less people there, and you
could band up with hunters and fishers in

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.370
the area to hold out and obtain food.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.080
The riskiest part is making it to the highway
and getting there without someone crashing

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:12.010
into you or shooting you to steal your car.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.950
Stopping your car with zombies and people
all around you, and keeping your doors unlocked

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.010
probably wasn’t the smartest move.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.720
Hope you can find a good samaritan or someone
else who did the same dumb shat you did so

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.940
you can jack their car..

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.480
I love how reporters are always continuing
to try to cover the disasters even when it

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.780
is indisputably clear that it’s the apocalypse,
nobody is watching TV anymore, and they need

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.940
to put the camera down and save themselves.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:41.710
Ana wakes up after getting knocked unconscious
by the airbag.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:52.280
I already like this guy, but he should have
already pumped the shotgun.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.610
He either didn’t have a round in the chamber,
or he just pumped out a fresh round for no

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.610
reason.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.870
Kenneth and Ana run into some other survivors
who open fire on them.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.040
This is why you want to get away from other
people.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.810
The shooter just gave away their position
to all zombies in at least a half mile radius.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.740
He’s jumpy, trigger-happy, and inaccurate.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.770
Not the kind of person I want to be traveling
with.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.150
I’d also grab that bike in the background.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.720
You can go 2-3 times as fast as if you were
running, and with far less energy.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.090
Trying to run away from uninhibited sprinting
zombies is pretty much impossible.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.450
The shooter’s girl is also pregnant, which
is 100% going to be an issue.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.220
They mention that they are going to the mall
right across from them.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.690
The YouTube channel, Zombie Survival Labs,
has a great video on the pros and cons of

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.250
holding up in a mall in a zombie apocalypse.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.720
Basically, malls are terrible, because they
are amazing.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.350
You have food, supplies, space, open vantage
points, security, and food and supplies in

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.610
nearby shops.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.270
The problem is that everyone will be going
there or is already there, and the chances

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.860
that you will have first dibs on it and be
able to secure it before either zombies or

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.230
other survivors come busting in is slim to
none.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.410
Our protagonists are on foot and surrounded,
so they don’t really have much of an option.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.220
At minimum, getting off of ground level will
enable them to survive for now.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.800
Obviously the first priority is to assess
the security of the place, and whether or

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.060
not it’s defensible.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.570
It’s also probably a good idea to wash the
blood off your hands and face, you don’t

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.290
want to subconsciously itch your eye with
zombie blood on your fingers.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.360
The windowed doors are not good, but as long
as they are locked it should give you time

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.960
to reinforce them.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.700
Like we saw with Ana in the beginning, the
zombies are only going to break in if they

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.810
know you are there.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.930
They need to get into the security office
to obtain the keys so they can lock the doors

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.900
while picking up weapons along the way.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.750
Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like there
is a gun store in this mall.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.430
In the movie, they get pretty lucky that all
the doors are already locked.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.500
If not, Andre would’ve been in trouble.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.220
This was pure luck, and without going for
the keys, they couldn’t have ensured that

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.360
the doors were locked.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.210
Once you have the keys, grab a map of the
building layout, or snag a fire/tornado map

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.590
to locate where the entrances are.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.530
If there is only one set of keys you’ll
need to stay together.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.830
But if there are multiple sets of keys, I'd
suggest splitting up into groups of two.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.370
Ana and the cop.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.370
Andre and Michael.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.830
And have Luda hideout in a gated shop.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:16.620
It’d also be good to grab some walkie talkies
so you can communicate with each other when

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.030
splitting up to lock the entrances.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:23.020
Splitting us is important, because covering
ground quickly is a priority.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.830
Zombies are everywhere, and if they make it
inside, it's game over no matter what.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:31.090
Two person groups are important because two
people can overcome a rogue zombie much more

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.289
effectively than by themselves.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:33.289
Main entrances need to be locked first, then
auxiliary ones.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:37.279
The entire time i’d be keeping a backup
escape route in mind, though there aren’t

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:38.340
many options.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:42.110
If a group of zombies burst into the store
from anywhere, they would only be able to

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.159
shoot a handful of them.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:47.290
They don’t know the layout well, they can’t
risk running into a dead end, and with the

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.999
pregnant wife they can’t run far or fast.

00:08:49.999 --> 00:08:53.970
If they need to run, their only options are
to hunker into a nearby store and drop the

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:59.610
security gate, which only helps them survive
that moment, but long term they are dead.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.730
Locking all the entrances is their only chance.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.620
Once all the entrances are locked up, you
need to turn the windowed doors and areas

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.660
into cover and concealment.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.699
Concealment, so they don’t see you inside,
and cover, to prevent them from breaking in.

00:09:12.699 --> 00:09:17.709
Painting or taping up curtains would be a
quick way to block the windows.

00:09:17.709 --> 00:09:21.420
After blocking the windows, you’ll have
some breathing room which you can use to ensure

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.879
there aren’t zombies inside the mall.

00:09:23.879 --> 00:09:28.290
I'd go room by room, sector by sector, and
clear the entire mall of zombies.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.339
It’s not a huge mall, so it shouldn’t
take too long.

00:09:31.339 --> 00:09:37.779
Making a loud noise to bait the zombies into
the open isn’t a bad tactic.

00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:48.140
But you’ll still need to make sure a ninja
zombie isn’t lurking in the bathroom stall.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.139
Once the building is secure, then you can
spend more time reinforcing and barricading

00:09:52.139 --> 00:09:56.790
the doors, I'd find bicycle locks or chains
to wrap around the door handles.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:01.620
Then use any wood or metal to place over the
doors or windows, then build in braces that

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.959
push up against it.

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:07.660
Next, start bringing food, water, ammo, medical,
and other necessary gear to the rooftop.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.889
Ideally, you’d move everything you need
up to the roof.

00:10:10.889 --> 00:10:13.329
Water is going to be the most immediate issue.

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:16.020
Setting up rain catchers on the roof is a
good idea.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.100
Rainwater is pretty safe to drink, but you
can boil it if you want to be sure.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.149
They also should collect as much water from
faucets as they can before the electricity

00:10:24.149 --> 00:10:25.519
and pumps go out.

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:28.540
There should be a good supply of bottled water
in the mall too.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.059
They should have enough water to avoid going
Bear Grylls mode, not that that’s an effective

00:10:33.059 --> 00:10:34.389
survival tactic anyways.

00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:37.000
The Rooftop is basically their Alamo.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.210
There are only a couple entrances, and the
doors are made of steel.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.820
These are boots on the ground zombozos.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.529
They aren’t doing any wall climbing stuff
like in WWZ, so we don’t have to worry about

00:10:46.529 --> 00:10:47.529
that.

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:49.769
It’s the most secure, defensible location
they have.

00:10:49.769 --> 00:10:52.920
The rooftop also provides more escape options.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.149
You can rope or ladder down from any side
of the building, evac choppers can spot you

00:10:57.149 --> 00:11:02.200
and pick you up, your radios and SOS signals
will travel further, and you can better find

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.850
and communicate with any other potential survivors
in the vicinity.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.670
Securing the stairwell leading to your rooftop
Alamo is also important.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:14.129
Even just reinforcing the doors with door
jams and security bars will prevent them from

00:11:14.129 --> 00:11:17.329
bursting through to the rooftop if they make
it inside the mall.

00:11:17.329 --> 00:11:21.949
You might want to think of an evac plan, where
if the mall became compromised for whatever

00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:26.860
reason, like a fire was started or Danny McBride
ate all your food, you aren’t completely

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.860
screwed.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.420
My evac plan would be to drive to the Horicon
Wildlife Preserve.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.699
To get there, I'd rig up an escape vehicle
from a mall bus or vehicle in the underground

00:11:35.699 --> 00:11:36.699
parking lot.

00:11:36.699 --> 00:11:40.149
I’ll talk more on the escape vehicle setup
later.

00:11:40.149 --> 00:11:44.310
Once you got your sick zombie proof mall set
up, you’ll wanna figure out how much food

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.560
and water you need, versus what you have.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.209
It’s reasonable to assume these zombies
have a rage virus rather than being spawns

00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:52.760
from hell or something.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:59.319
Which means they have realistic physiological
needs and respect the first law of thermodynamics.

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:04.360
Their bodies use energy which can be depleted,
they have to have a functioning circulatory,

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.360
respiratory system, and nervous system which
keeps them alive.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.129
If this is the case, you don’t need much
food at all.

00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:14.710
Which is a good thing, because let's be honest,
none of these people are Mark Watney.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.019
Nobody will be setting up a sustainable potato
farm on the roof.

00:12:18.019 --> 00:12:21.190
You don’t even need to wait for the zombies
to die of starvation.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:25.519
They will all die of dehydration within days
from just standing out in the sun.

00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:30.019
As long as you have some rain catchers and
Evian, you can put out a lawn chair and stay

00:12:30.019 --> 00:12:31.379
sippin while they wilt away.

00:12:31.379 --> 00:12:35.970
Then you can pick off the stragglers, start
scavenging and rebuilding society.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:40.250
You will still have to be careful of zombies
that were chilling in cold dark areas, because

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.649
they could survive much longer without water.

00:12:42.649 --> 00:12:46.519
To be safe, you might want to wait about a
month before raiding houses.

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:50.910
In addition to dehydration, zombies will also
likely die from infection.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.819
The vast majority of zombies were initially
infected from bite wounds.

00:12:54.819 --> 00:12:59.629
The severe infections and septic shock caused
by these wounds would eventually kill them.

00:12:59.629 --> 00:13:03.850
The other good news is that the virus only
affects humans, so there will be plenty of

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.329
wildlife to hunt to satisfy your long term
food needs.

00:13:07.329 --> 00:13:09.980
Let’s continue with what the characters
did.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.750
Michael screws up badly by opening that door.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:17.930
He should have stayed on the mission to lock
all the doors as priority numero uno, then

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.199
gone for help.

00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:23.350
Haphazardly trying to clear out zombies by
himself is not a good strat.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:39.300
The club was dumb to swap crowbar for, but
you can’t argue with his results.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.309
Officer Kenneth and crew get distracted by
the commotion, and a ninja zombie attacks

00:13:43.309 --> 00:13:44.540
them from behind.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.230
Kenneth whacks the zombie off Luda, then gets
tackled into the fountain.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:53.709
Ana snags the shotty and blind hipfires, making
an accurate hit on the zombie and saving Kenneth’s

00:13:53.709 --> 00:13:54.709
life.

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:56.430
She must have had her lucky charms this morning.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.980
I think you should give your shotgun back
to the cop now.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:02.980
They hop into the elevator to get to high
ground, and get a warm welcome by the security

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.889
staff when the elevator opens.

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:07.589
The mall cops should have disabled the elevator.

00:14:07.589 --> 00:14:12.399
You want to limit any chances that a zombie
could bump into the level 2 button, walk in,

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:13.399
and kill everyone.

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:14.910
I wouldn’t have given the guns up.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.540
But that’s a hard situation to de-escalate.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:21.930
Side note, not that they had options, but
revolvers are terrible in a zombie apocalypse.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.990
They are slow to reload and have low capacity.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.240
Same with shotguns.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.230
Single stack pistols are better because they
are quicker to reload, but they also suffer

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.679
from low capacity.

00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:43.209
If I was the security, I'd check them for
bite wounds and quarantine them.

00:14:43.209 --> 00:14:47.240
Let me give an alternate take here, since
I tend to assume the more realistic zombies

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.879
like in 28 weeks later.

00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:52.759
The shoot them in the head trope is probably
derived from the fact that the human body

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:55.709
can withstand a lot of non-critical hits.

00:14:55.709 --> 00:14:59.529
Since zombies don’t feel pain and are in
full adrenaline rage mode, they will keep

00:14:59.529 --> 00:15:02.679
coming until they receive a critical hit like
a headshot.

00:15:02.679 --> 00:15:07.050
This doesn’t necessarily mean zombies can’t
be killed with non-headshots though.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:11.580
I also think it’s funny that we’re always
told to destroy a zombie’s brain, but a

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.439
zombie is essentially a mindless killing machine.

00:15:14.439 --> 00:15:17.790
I get the brain is a good target, I just think
it’s ironic.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:22.240
On the news we also hear that Fort Pastor
is secure, with search and rescue teams searching

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.310
for survivors.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:26.439
It’s not a real base, so who knows how far
away it is.

00:15:26.439 --> 00:15:30.310
At this point, holding out and signaling from
the roof is their best option.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.980
The survivors finally start clearing and locking
down the mall, putting up SOS signals, and

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.209
tossing the dead bodies off the roof.

00:15:37.209 --> 00:15:39.809
They hear some gunshots coming from across
the street.

00:15:39.809 --> 00:15:44.519
There’s another survivor, Andy, held up
in a gun store 4 or 500 yards away.

00:15:44.519 --> 00:15:47.899
A military chopper flies by, but doesn’t
stop for them.

00:15:47.899 --> 00:15:51.779
The chopper might not have seen them, but
it also might be full of survivors or low

00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:52.779
on gas.

00:15:52.779 --> 00:15:56.629
I’d have fired some rounds off into the
air to get it’s attention if I was Andy.

00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:59.959
If they knew the direction of Fort Pastor,
they may be able to know if it’s headed

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.379
back to base or not.

00:16:01.379 --> 00:16:06.129
If it’s flying away from the base, then
it should come back this way, if it doesn’t..

00:16:06.129 --> 00:16:07.639
Maybe something bad happened.

00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:12.019
The worst case scenario is that the chopper
was fleeing from the overrun base.

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:16.569
In the live report on the news a bit ago,
we saw them unloading a transport truck with

00:16:16.569 --> 00:16:17.720
bloody survivors.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.619
It’s possible they turned into zombies.

00:16:20.619 --> 00:16:34.519
Everyone heads back inside for the night and
reflects on loved ones lost.

00:16:34.519 --> 00:16:39.449
The next morning the rookie security kid goes
to do some routine tasks and make some coffee.

00:16:39.449 --> 00:16:41.420
I would not use the elevator.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.550
Way too risky.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.069
You have no idea what’s on the other end
of those doors.

00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:49.569
If a ninja zombie runs at you, good luck getting
the elevator doors to close in time.

00:16:49.569 --> 00:16:52.709
Meanwhile Ana and crew are still locked up
by CJ.

00:16:52.709 --> 00:16:57.449
Why did CJ lock them up on the first floor
when there are stores with gates on the second

00:16:57.449 --> 00:16:59.009
floor, where it is way safer.

00:16:59.009 --> 00:17:03.239
Outside, a couple wild boys in a shipping
truck are driving around the parking lot going

00:17:03.239 --> 00:17:08.169
postal on the zombies.

00:17:08.169 --> 00:17:14.860
Ana’s team wants to help, but CJ’s a stubborn
prick.

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:19.550
I get that bringing in strangers is dangerous,
but with your guns and numbers you can effectively

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.250
secure and quarantine them.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.100
You have enough food and could use the help
killing zombies.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.699
Michael and Kenneth jack the guns and flip
the script on CJ’s crew.

00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:33.120
The outsiders spin the truck around and reverse
into the loading gate, smart move.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.210
Andre and Michael run outside to help the
drivers and holy shat, they must be ex special

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:41.730
forces with how easily they are headshotting
everyone left and right under extreme stress

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:42.830
and pressure.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.750
Whoah whoah, absolutely no way that lady in
the wheelbarrow is coming in.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.970
I hope we aren’t going to entertain the
BS that the protagonists are oblivious to

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.600
what zombies are.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.460
They really need to implement a decontamination
procedure to check all the new people for

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.820
the zombie virus.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:03.130
The cop tries to leave to go find his brother
at Fort Pastor, despite the truckers saying

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.809
that everyone there is dead.

00:18:04.809 --> 00:18:09.110
But Kenneth has a change of heart when he
sees poor Andy, stuck out there all by his

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.110
lonesome.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.019
Jesus this guy has a bite too.

00:18:12.019 --> 00:18:15.640
Nobody checked the newcomers out at all, this
is going to end badly.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:20.120
This lady looks like a special mutant type
of zombie, like the bloater bile launcher

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.460
in video games.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:26.270
As a nurse, or anyone with common sense, get
some PPE on and get your hands out of her

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:28.179
face and bodily fluids.

00:18:28.179 --> 00:18:36.990
You wanna stick your fingers in her mouth
for a dental inspection too?

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:44.850
Ana dodges fate yet again.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.210
After that, I'd take the gun from the security
kid.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:51.190
I’m sorry, but if you have the only gun
and you run and leave everyone in danger,

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:54.050
you don’t deserve it.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.910
No. shat.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.630
Doesn’t take a doctor to figure that out.

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:03.700
Ana, that was literally what caused your husband
to die, you saw that exact thing happen in

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.700
the beginning.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.340
Ana and Michael have a dispute about executing
whoever is bitten.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.770
Killing anyone with an open wound is only
going to cause mass conflict, distrust, and

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.320
resentment which will lead to revenge killings.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.269
The infection typically takes hours depending
on the wound.

00:19:18.269 --> 00:19:22.380
All you have to do is lock anyone with an
open wound in a gated store.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:27.309
If they turn into a zombie, blast them, if
not, you avoided murdering someone for no

00:19:27.309 --> 00:19:28.309
reason.

00:19:28.309 --> 00:19:31.460
The guy with the bite wound on his hand will
be zombified in hours.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.399
Amputating his arm won’t work either.

00:19:33.399 --> 00:19:35.809
Blood circulates through the body way too
fast.

00:19:35.809 --> 00:19:40.860
A drug administered in the arm reaches the
brain within a few seconds.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.000
The virus has already spread throughout his
entire body.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.799
Even if it would stop the virus, field amputations
are incredibly lethal and hard to perform

00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:49.799
correctly.

00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:53.899
In the civil war, the mortality rate for amputations
was extremely low (high).

00:19:53.899 --> 00:19:58.669
1/3rd of people died from the surgery, and
half of those people who lived through the

00:19:58.669 --> 00:20:00.590
surgery, died from infection later.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.049
I’d say they are under worse circumstances.

00:20:03.049 --> 00:20:08.289
They have no medical equipment or supplies
beyond aspirin and bandaid, and Nurses aren’t

00:20:08.289 --> 00:20:09.510
trained to perform amputations.

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:13.309
They really need to think about where they
are quarantining and executing people.

00:20:13.309 --> 00:20:16.120
You’re getting their infectious fluids everywhere.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.639
Blowing someone’s brains out on a perfectly
good bed or couch that someone could have

00:20:19.639 --> 00:20:21.269
slept on is stupid.

00:20:21.269 --> 00:20:24.399
And why not have Kenneth close the gate in
front of him.

00:20:24.399 --> 00:20:26.950
Why lock himself in with someone infected.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.570
If 1 thing gets tripped up, your dead.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.799
If you aren’t paying attention, the dude
throws something at your head and attacks

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:36.510
you because he doesn’t want to die, the
gun misfires, etc.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:48.399
You want at least 2 degrees of separation
between you and death.

00:20:48.399 --> 00:21:03.450
Cool, now go check out Andre's wife who was
cut in an altercation with a zombie, and the

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:16.789
trucker’s leg that was injured from something.

00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:19.710
The standoffishness would be alarming.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:23.350
Especially considering what we know about
bites and her close call with the zombie.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:27.090
Not checking in with each other to measure
each other’s conditions is a mistake.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:31.940
I’ve mentioned before that the importance
of entertainment in the apocalypse is underestimated,

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:39.110
and I gotta say, the mall is a good choice
to fulfil this need.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:49.200
Who’s who with a hunting rifle looks fun.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:54.080
For some mysterious and unpredictable reason
the mall ran out of power, and nobody thought

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.590
to scavenge the generators earlier on.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:00.809
Now they have to go into an uncleared, zombie
filled parking garage in darkness.

00:22:00.809 --> 00:22:09.470
Good going guys.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:13.710
Before they embark on their suicidal journey,
Kenneth shows Michael how to take the safety

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.480
off his gun, which is inspiring as hell.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.260
I’m glad the guys I'm rolling out with don't
know how to use their guns.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.360
Kenneth being a former Marine should have
conducted a weapons 101 training course in

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:28.690
their spare time, so when shat goes down they
actually know how to use the gun.

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:31.580
Shouldn’t have just fricked off for the
past few days huh.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:35.240
It’s also worth pointing out that when fighting
in low light conditions, you never want to

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.950
have your light permanently on because it
gives your position away.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:43.100
You want to use quick taps when assessing
and engaging areas or threats.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:57.250
You also want to move along the wall to reduce
the areas a zombie could attack you from.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.510
What the hell.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.130
Now we have to deal with circ de soleil zombies.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.910
All hell breaks loose and the securitas kid
dies a horrific death.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:09.240
It’s hard to tell what is going on, but
it appears they made it into a gated gas station

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.929
in the underground parking garage of the mall.

00:23:11.929 --> 00:23:13.370
That makes complete sense.

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:17.289
Kenneth runs out of ammo, which was stupid,
he should have brought spare ammo.

00:23:17.289 --> 00:23:20.440
Thinking back, he racked his shotgun when
making his entrance.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.580
This chambered a round, but also freed up
space in the tube.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.720
He could have loaded another round in.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.419
Depending on the shell, this gives him 5+1
capacity.

00:23:29.419 --> 00:23:30.870
Whereas he only had 5.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:36.710
So he only anticipated needing to fire 5 rounds,
optimistic.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:41.651
This is why I don’t like shotguns, low capacity
and unless you’re jerry miculek with an

00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:49.950
extended tube and a speed loader, you’re
gonna get stampeded before you can reload.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:24:05.269
It’s a damn good thing CJ had a lighter
to set the gas on fire.

00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:10.130
Luda’s childbirth doesn’t seem to be going
so well, I blame Andre for being a poor midwife.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:14.179
That’s true love, I’d have capped my girlfriend
a long time ago.

00:24:14.179 --> 00:24:18.140
The granny shows up for the baby shower, and
unloads on the zombie mom.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:37.769
Andre doesn’t take this so well and blasts
Norma.

00:24:37.769 --> 00:24:41.320
If I was the granny, seeing Andre’s mental
state and the zombie.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.470
I’d have blasted him first, then the zombie.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:48.380
Ana assesses that the granny wasn’t bitten,
so she won’t become a zombie.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:52.620
Can you really know for sure, and do you really
want to just assume that with everything that’s

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.620
going on.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.620
I know I don’t.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.789
Double tap all of them, including the zombie
baby.

00:24:57.789 --> 00:25:01.860
These recent events seemed to break the group's
morale on holding out in the mall until help

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:28.700
arrives.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:33.350
The glaring issue here, is that the marina
is essentially in the heart of Milwaukee,

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:36.190
which has a population of 600,000 zombies.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:41.490
You have to drive through all of that to get
to the boat, whereas with Horicon, the population

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.760
gets sparser as you get closer.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.780
Secondly, the boat takes time to start up
and push off shore, which is a problem when

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.500
a hundred thousand zombies are sprinting at
you.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.250
Thirdly, you don’t know if the boats were
jacked or destroyed in the chaos.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.250
The islands aren’t a bad idea though.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:00.351
You can easily eliminate all the zombies on
the island, fish for food, and you’re far

00:26:00.351 --> 00:26:03.550
enough away from shore that other zombies
won’t know you’re there.

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:08.260
Who knows if these zombies can swim though,
if so, a few miles off shore might still be

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.260
dangerous.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.909
If you were dead set on boating to an island
in the middle of the lake, at least drive

00:26:12.909 --> 00:26:16.659
to a remote area of shoreline and row to the
island.

00:26:16.659 --> 00:26:20.250
Rowing 5-10 miles isn’t difficult.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.899
They have to do something though.

00:26:21.899 --> 00:26:25.990
It's almost been a week, and the zombies haven’t
died or shown signs of deterioration from

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:27.210
dehydration.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:31.139
For some reason, these zombies don’t seem
to have any physiological constraints.

00:26:31.139 --> 00:26:35.460
That means they can’t stay in the mall and
outlast the zombies, they will just starve

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.460
to death.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:40.460
I think they should try a different option
before going to either Horicon or the marina.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:44.950
In both of those options, you have to leave
the comfort, security, and supply rich mall

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:50.159
to wade through thousands of zombies for a
utopia you don’t know even exists.

00:26:50.159 --> 00:26:55.279
They should stay put, and implement a shape,
clear, hold, build military strategy.

00:26:55.279 --> 00:27:00.090
Shape, means to identify the nature and strength
of the enemy threat in a given area.

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:04.299
After the outbreak, Ana hopped on the highway
and drove away from the city, she most likely

00:27:04.299 --> 00:27:07.380
ended up in a more suburban area like Brookfield.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:12.520
This is about a 5x5 mile area with a population
of roughly 30,000 people.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:16.639
The number of zombies hanging out at their
mall looks to be around 5-10 thousand.

00:27:16.639 --> 00:27:20.000
Clear, obviously means to eradicate the zombie
infestation.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.580
This is the fun part, it’s like the Dead
Rising game or Dying Light, but more realistic.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:58.539
Since the zombies can’t be killed by attrition,
it must be done with violence.

00:27:58.539 --> 00:28:05.090
With 20-50 rounds of ammo per box, 6 boxes
high and 8 boxes across with 32 rows of ammo

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:08.289
shelf, that’s around 50,000 rounds of ammo.

00:28:08.289 --> 00:28:14.059
If he’s got ammo in the back or any surplus
of 22lr ammo, that’s gonna be a lot higher.

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:18.419
22lr is probably the most efficient round
for this job, and if you have one of these

00:28:18.419 --> 00:28:21.230
stacks lying around, you’re gonna be just
fine.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:25.899
That’s over 125,000 rounds, just right there.

00:28:25.899 --> 00:28:31.340
You could kill the zombie crowd in front of
the mall 25 times over, with just that stack.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:36.370
A 22lr aimed down at the zombie heads from
the rooftop will definitely destroy the brain.

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:40.740
In some cases, the bullet has enough power
to penetrate the skull, but not enough to

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:41.900
exit out the back.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:46.279
So the bullet just ricochets around inside
the skull turning the brain into soup.

00:28:46.279 --> 00:28:50.960
I know Andy is getting hungry, but I don’t
recommend sipping the juice out of those coconuts.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.880
A rifle round could be heard from a few miles
away, but with only 30,000 people within a

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:59.720
few miles of them, killing the zombies won’t
attract any more than that.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.690
Personally, I’d save the ammo as much as
possible.

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:07.009
They should be able to kill a significant
amount of zombies with molotov cocktails or

00:29:07.009 --> 00:29:09.529
homemade napalm using gas and styrofoam.

00:29:09.529 --> 00:29:13.330
The mall is made of brick so it shouldn’t
be a problem, still wouldn’t hurt to have

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:15.830
some fire extinguishers and water nearby.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:20.929
A dishonorable mention for the adrenaline
junkies would be the Crane Corps strategy

00:29:20.929 --> 00:29:22.679
in the Great Wall movie.

00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:26.379
I highly, highly don’t recommend this.

00:29:26.379 --> 00:29:31.059
But you could use a pulley system to bait
the zombies over then repeatedly drop heavy

00:29:31.059 --> 00:29:32.669
weights onto their heads.

00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:43.679
Or just throw bricks like Kevin McCallister
in Home Alone.

00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:48.379
Once you’ve eliminated close to the population
of the city, you can progress to the holding

00:29:48.379 --> 00:29:49.799
phase.

00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:52.419
Reinforce the security of the mall and the
gun store.

00:29:52.419 --> 00:29:54.779
Close any gaps in your bases defenses.

00:29:54.779 --> 00:29:58.289
Set up snare and noise maker traps for zombies.

00:29:58.289 --> 00:30:02.330
Generally just ensure that you can maintain
your controlled territory now that the initial

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:03.590
threat is gone.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:08.389
With the local threat identified, eliminated,
and your position reinforced, you can start

00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:10.240
building out sustainability.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:16.009
Set up clear systems for supply rationing,
animal traps, sewage disposal, firearms training

00:30:16.009 --> 00:30:21.720
for all survivors, how and where to raid and
scavenge, as well as decontamination of newcomers

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.799
and people returning to the mall from raids.

00:30:23.799 --> 00:30:28.549
I’m not sure how much food they have left,
how many animals they could trap, or how much

00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:31.970
non-perishable food they could raid from nearby
stores.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.440
Raiding is exceptionally dangerous too.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:39.370
Since dogs are unappetizing to zombies, and
they’re a popular pet, there should be lots

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:42.389
of them available and eager to come to you
if you get hungry.

00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:45.529
Yes it’s fricked up, but it is the apocalypse.

00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:51.750
Your alternative is attempting that home grown
potato farm, or an even less appetizing option.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.929
Food can be quite abundant if you just know
where to look.

00:30:54.929 --> 00:30:56.770
I’m not saying it’s the first choice.

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.789
I’m saying it’s worth a shot if you’re
going to die anyways.

00:30:59.789 --> 00:31:05.129
Cooking over 140 degrees should kill any pathogens,
which should make it safe to eat.

00:31:05.129 --> 00:31:07.450
You’re going to want to order this meal
well, well done.

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:08.450
No pink.

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:11.940
I know I know, Prions and the Creutzfeldt–Jakob
disease.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:16.029
But if you only eat muscle tissue you’ll
have less of a chance of getting infected.

00:31:16.029 --> 00:31:20.440
And even if you do, the time from infection
to death is 30-50 years long.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:24.880
I’d say that’s worth it when your only
other option is starving in 3-5 months.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.429
I still think driving out to Horicon is the
next move.

00:31:28.429 --> 00:31:32.879
Hunting wildlife in the open is far less dangerous
than raiding houses and stores.

00:31:32.879 --> 00:31:37.510
You’re also less likely to come across deranged
or malicious survivors.

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:42.340
At least now you have a fallback base at the
mall if Horicon or the marina is swarmed with

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.340
zombies.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:47.929
If you want to take back the world and start
repopulating it: shape, clear, hold, build,

00:31:47.929 --> 00:31:49.450
repeat is your best option.

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:54.389
There are enough guns and ammo in each city
across America to kill all the residents many

00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:58.769
multiple times over, so removing the zombies
shouldn’t be too tall of an order.

00:31:58.769 --> 00:32:03.049
With our protagonists crippled morale, they
outfit the war busses to head for the marina

00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:06.220
in a last ditch suicidal attempt at salvation.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:10.049
Even though we would have thinned the zombie
herd out, it’s still a good idea to uparmor

00:32:10.049 --> 00:32:11.890
and upgun your vehicles.

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:15.830
In the mall crew’s case, there are still
around 10 thousand zombies outside.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:16.830
They won’t have to run through all 10 thousand,
just a slice of them.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.230
They are on the right track with the snow
plow, but it needs to be pointier.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:24.549
You want to avoid zombies piling up in front
as much as possible, and snow plows aren’t

00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:26.730
meant for piercing as much as pushing.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:31.139
The plow should be low enough to the ground
that zombies can’t fall underneath the bus

00:32:31.139 --> 00:32:34.649
and muck the tires up or reduce the bus's
traction on the road.

00:32:34.649 --> 00:32:38.460
Likewise, welding skirts around the side of
the bus to prevent zombies from falling down

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.220
in front of the rear tires is also important.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.750
Not as extreme as this, but you get the point.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:48.249
It is a colossal mistake to weld pieces of
metal to the sides of the busses.

00:32:48.249 --> 00:32:51.320
All they are doing is giving zombies something
to grab a hold of.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.210
The chainsaw idea is cool, but you wouldn’t
need them if you didn’t create handholds

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:58.529
for zombies to climb onto the bus in the first
place.

00:32:58.529 --> 00:33:02.629
Chainsawing zombies is going to be spitting
infectious blood up everywhere.

00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:06.150
The additional lights are good, because with
the power grid out, it’s going to be dark

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:07.279
as shat at night.

00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:10.529
Hopefully you don’t have to drive at night,
but it’s better to be prepared for it.

00:33:10.529 --> 00:33:14.049
Barbed wire on the roof is better than nothing,
but it’s not going to slow the zombies down

00:33:14.049 --> 00:33:15.049
much at all.

00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:18.470
shat, zombies would probably grab onto it
as another handhold.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:20.600
Meanwhile, Andy is getting hungry over there.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.450
He’s a skinny fella, but he’ll last 5
more days.

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:27.309
There won’t be any severe muscle atrophy,
and he’s not going to be a weak cripple

00:33:27.309 --> 00:33:29.629
by the time they make their escape to the
marina.

00:33:29.629 --> 00:33:33.570
There is no point in risking the biscuit to
get him a sammy right now.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:38.220
Andy is about 4-5 hundred meters away at least,
and surrounded by zombies.

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:42.840
Carrying food over with an RC car sounds good,
but cheap store bought ones only have a couple

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.200
hundred feet of signal.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:48.290
A potato gun also sounds good, but it’d
have to be extremely powerful.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:52.559
DIY ones only have a range of 50-100 yards
or so.

00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:56.080
My vote is to kill all the zombies then go
pick him up.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.200
Instead, they send the dog over with food,
which surprisingly works.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.640
The problem is the ground level pickup.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.390
Andy screws up and gets zombified because
he didn’t shut the door quick enough or

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:09.240
have his gun ready to blast the nearby zombies.

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:13.619
Nicole goes completely insane and drives the
truck over to Andy’s gun store to rescue

00:34:13.619 --> 00:34:14.700
her dog.

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:17.129
This is a mind blowing level of stupidity.

00:34:17.129 --> 00:34:22.620
Dog’s are completely ignored by zombies,
you literally saw Chip walk through the entire

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.470
horde, he will be fine.

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:27.800
She didn’t even know Andy was bit when she
drove over there.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:32.000
Everything was going according to plan as
far as she knew, and she still freaked.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.059
Now she’s stuck in a closet with Andy trying
to kill her, causing the mall crew to attempt

00:34:36.059 --> 00:34:41.419
a hasty rescue, even though abandoning her
dumb ass is also a perfectly good option.

00:34:41.419 --> 00:34:43.909
Their new plan is to use the sewer system.

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:48.530
On the approach to the sewers there is a self-locking
fire door, and they need someone to be ready

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.319
to open it when they come back.

00:34:50.319 --> 00:34:53.869
Of all people, Steve is enlisted for this
vital job.

00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:58.540
Steve would be better placed in the coffee
shop, he will 100% screw you over.

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.420
Why not have Ana, Glen, or Monica do it?

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:05.510
The rescue team navigates the sewer system
to get close to the gun store, but they end

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:09.410
up having to pop out in the middle of the
street filled with zombies to make a run for

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:10.410
the store.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:14.910
Apparently nobody thought to stop by one of
the mall stores and throw on a leather jacket

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:16.900
and gloves to protect against bites.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.200
Hell, most of them are just rocking tank tops.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.130
Instead of the sewer approach, I'd have driven
one of the busses up to the shipping truck

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:29.050
driver door, climbed over to the store, hopped
through the gate, killed Andy, thrown Nicole

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:32.770
off the roof, then killed all the zombies
and headed back to the mall.

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:37.330
If they are going to use the sewer route where
they have to traverse open ground filled with

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.650
zombies, I'd have tried employing a form of
zombie camouflage.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:45.090
It sounds like a cheesy gag in a crappy horror
movie, but if you think about it, it could

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:46.090
work.

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:48.780
How do zombies differentiate between humans
and other zombies?

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.700
It has to be based on a mix of scent, sound,
motion, and behavior.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:56.990
If you can spill some zombie guts on your
clothes, make awful moaning noises, and work

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:59.569
a limp, you might be able to fool the zombies.

00:35:59.569 --> 00:36:00.980
It would at least buy them some time.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:07.579
You could also try it in a situation where
you are trapped by a zombie horde, it’s

00:36:07.579 --> 00:36:11.880
better than dying.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:20.500
I don’t know how nobody died.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:31.130
The crew finds the zombified Andy, and Kenneth
gives him the 870 police special.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:35.079
Everybody reloads their guns and runs back
outside to the sewer so they can get back

00:36:35.079 --> 00:36:36.079
to the mall.

00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:37.390
What’s the rush?

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:42.680
Obviously this building is secure, just catch
some z’s, kill all the zombies in the morning,

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:43.849
then head back to the mall.

00:36:43.849 --> 00:36:48.730
If you’re going to run back outside right
now, at least grab some AR15’s.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:51.349
No competent gun store won’t have them stocked.

00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:57.420
Much higher capacity, much quicker to reload,
easy manual of arms, and soft recoil.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.450
Perfect for rapid accurate headshots.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:04.579
At minimum, ditch the revolvers for double-stack
magazine fed pistols.

00:37:04.579 --> 00:37:06.430
Reloading is when you are most vulnerable.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:09.480
So I'd be tempted to roll out like Noah MacManus
or Neo.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.020
Don’t need to reload if you have more guns.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.800
They scramble into the sewer, and Tucker falls
breaking his leg.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:21.910
CJ drags while tucker shoots, but there’s
too many of them.

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:31.610
Whaddya know, Steve screws them over by leaving
the door shut and locked, luckily Ana opens

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.450
it before they get overrun.

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:36.880
Nobody is able to get the doors shut so the
zombies come pouring into the mall.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:41.920
Well, now the marina or Horicon are your only
options since your poor decisions cost you

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.920
the mall.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:47.059
They scream for everyone to get to the elevators
and to the garage so they can bust out in

00:37:47.059 --> 00:37:48.059
their war busses.

00:37:48.059 --> 00:37:50.990
I hope nobody was in the bathroom while this
all went down.

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:53.950
I take that back, I hope Steve was in the
bathroom.

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:56.140
Nope, Steve was by the bus with the keys.

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:59.410
That scumbag was probably trying to take off
without everyone.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:01.560
I would have knee-capped him and left his
ass.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:06.550
The busses get bogged down in the horde, probably
because the snowplow isn’t diverting the

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:07.640
zombies well enough.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:27.280
CJ comes in with the propane tank bomb to
thin’em out a bit.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.670
That was really fricking cool.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:32.660
I'm glad they used flare with the propane
tank, shooting it without the flare as an

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.550
ignition source wouldn’t cause it to explode.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:37.910
And it’d be harder to find it in the horde
of zombies.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:40.780
They peel out and start making their way to
the marina.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.390
One zombie managed to hang onto the bus though.

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:46.970
Yah, attaching railings all over the bus wasn’t
a good idea.

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:50.690
Monica shouts to drive faster, which is a
terrible idea.

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:54.750
Yes you want to drive fast enough that the
zombie hordes can’t surround you, but you

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:58.180
don’t want to go too fast and wreck your
only means of survival.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:02.520
Michael’s chainsaw idea wouldn’t have
been necessary if they didn’t create zombie

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.520
hand holds.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:12.300
It wasn’t good in theory, and it’s especially
not good in practice in a rowdy bus.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:23.760
Kenneth’s panic driving sends the bus into
a roll.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.920
Luckily Michael see’s this in time and backs
up to rescue them.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:30.820
Steve leaves Kenneth hanging and gets attacked
by the zombie holding onto the bus.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.089
How did Glen die?

00:39:32.089 --> 00:39:34.270
He chainsawed Monica and the bus flipped.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:38.010
He could’ve banged his head off of something,
but you don’t know if he was just knocked

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:39.150
out or dead.

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:40.930
Hope they took a pulse on him to make sure.

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.280
It’d suck if he woke up in the bus alone
with everyone gone.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.849
Ana goes back for Steve's body to grab the
keys to the boat.

00:39:47.849 --> 00:39:52.720
Why on Earth did they leave the most important
item of their mission in Steve’s hands?

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.840
And why was nobody aware that Steve had the
keys.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:59.010
Everyone should know who the key-bearer was
in case they get killed.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:03.280
I also hope you guys got an exact location
and description of his boat.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.220
They narrowly escape and make it to the marina
but they are already getting swarmed.

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:10.010
The timing is going to be tight getting off
shore in time.

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:27.800
CJ buys them some time by making a last stand
and nuking them with another propane bomb.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:32.140
Michael stops everyone to tell them he got
bit back when Ana went for the keys.

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.840
Dude, not a good time.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:38.490
You have hours until you’re a zombie based
on how long it took Frank to zombify.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:42.430
Just get in the boat and we’ll deal with
you later, or push us off and make a last

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:43.630
stand like CJ.

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:47.450
The zombies just stand around and wait for
Michael and the group to say their heartfelt

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:49.630
goodbyes before he kills himself.

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:53.150
The rest of the survivors escape and flee
to the island in the lake.

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:57.570
Stupidly, they parked the boat and ran onto
the island without checking it out first.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:01.640
They should have coasted around the perimeter
of the island, and killed as many as possible

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.760
from a distance.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:07.119
There should only be hundreds of people on
the island, they easily could have killed

00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:10.319
them all, but instead ran ashore and got overrun.

00:41:10.319 --> 00:41:11.319
The movie ends.

00:41:11.319 --> 00:41:14.000
Let’s see who would have lived, and who
would have died.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.220
The infection spread extremely fast and took
everyone by surprise.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.390
Luis was unsavable.

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:24.099
They got lucky that the mall was empty and
already locked up, but really any high ground

00:41:24.099 --> 00:41:26.609
with access to water should have worked.

00:41:26.609 --> 00:41:30.660
Realistically, all the zombies should have
died from dehydration within a week.

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.440
So nobody else would’ve died.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.200
Unfortunately, these zombies aren’t affected
by this.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.270
Luda got infected, as well as the big lady
and Frank.

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:40.060
They were all unsavable.

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:43.420
Not securing the generators when they had
power on was stupid.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:48.220
This forced them to find it in the dark parking
garage filled with zombies, which led to Bart’s

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:50.520
unnecessary death via ninja zombies.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.380
They should have kept a closer eye on Luda
and Andre.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:56.820
Letting people go off on their own where you
can’t check their condition was a bad call.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:01.200
I don’t think Andre would have taken his
wife and babies execution easily though, and

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:05.080
he likely would have died or been killed by
the others in a confrontation anyways.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:11.900
Norma should have shot Andre before Luda after
seeing his mental state.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:16.150
Andy should have killed all the zombies near
the doggy door before picking up the food,

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.579
ensuring his survival.

00:42:17.579 --> 00:42:21.481
After that snack, the mall crew and Andy easily
could have killed off all the zombies in the

00:42:21.481 --> 00:42:25.660
area with the ammo and weapons available,
then brought Andy back to the mall before

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:27.079
heading off to the marina.

00:42:27.079 --> 00:42:32.170
Nicole was an idiot and drove over there,
so they needed to rescue her too, I guess.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:36.610
Once they got there, they should have stayed,
used the ammo to kill all the zombies, then

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:38.500
headed back to the mall in the morning.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.790
This would have saved Tucker’s life.

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:45.910
Using Steve to guard the sewer door was idiotic
and the delay before Ana opened the door enabled

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:49.819
the zombies to breach the mall, forcing them
to leave without preparing.

00:42:49.819 --> 00:42:53.910
If they didn’t add handholds to the busses,
there wouldn’t be zombies they needed to

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:59.760
chainsaw off, and Glen wouldn’t be in the
position to accidentally saw Monica in half.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:04.840
This event arguably caused Kenneth to crash,
leading to Steve, Glen, and Michael’s deaths.

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:09.549
The marina was a bad option because getting
off shore is almost impossible without being

00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:10.549
overrun.

00:43:10.549 --> 00:43:15.319
It was almost inevitable that CJ or someone
would have had to sacrifice themself to stem

00:43:15.319 --> 00:43:16.770
the tide of zombies.

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:21.220
If they had gone to a remote area and rowed
to the island or to Horicon, this wouldn’t

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:22.490
have been the case.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:26.940
They should have rowed around the island,
picking off the zombies before heading ashore.

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.619
There shouldn’t be more than a couple hundred
zombies to kill.

00:43:29.619 --> 00:43:32.839
Kenneth, Ana, Terry, and Nicole, all would’ve
lived.

00:43:32.839 --> 00:43:37.200
The dog chip was never in danger, so he’s
doin just fine.

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:40.599
I think we could have beat the Zombie Horde
in Dawn of the Dead.

00:43:40.599 --> 00:43:46.190
Thanks for watching, and remember, all you
need to survive a realistic zombie apocalypse

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:49.890
is some shelter and a pack of San Pellegrino.
