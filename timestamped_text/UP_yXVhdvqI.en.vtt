00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.470
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.759
Today, I'm going to explain an action, adventure,
drama film called “Dawn of the Planet of

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:06.809
the Apes.”

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:08.099
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.870
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.530
Several years ago, Gen-sys labs developed
a virus known as ALZ-113 to test on chimpanzees.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.820
This caused them to show aggressive behaviors
that then led to a major incident at the Golden

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.949
Gate Bridge where the chimpanzees had a standoff
with the police.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.619
The standoff resulted in the chimpanzees’
escape and disappearance in the woods.

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.679
The virus, dubbed as "The Simian Flu," was
accidentally exposed to humans, which slowly

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.860
became a pandemic that led to a massive population
decrease, possibly on the verge of human extinction.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.900
Many years later, the chimpanzees have now
become apes and have evolved to develop communication

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.360
methods and even form their own civilization.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.050
They can now band together, hunting food in
large numbers and even showing active consciousness

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.670
towards one another.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.370
Caesar is the leader of their tribe.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.900
His son, Blue-Eyes, joins him on the hunt.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.410
After a successful hunt, they go home riding
horses with their spoils.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.940
The civilization of the apes has taken the
form of a tribal system deep in the woods.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.110
They have an education system for learning
how to read and write alphabets.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.250
They have murals, wood-constructed structures,
weapons for hunting, and even know how to

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.640
light a fire.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.430
Upon reaching home, Caesar witnesses his wife
giving birth to his second son and tells Blue-Eyes

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.880
about it.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.171
Caesar and the brown ape, who was teaching
younglings earlier, named Maurice, have a

00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:21.170
reminiscent conversation of the achievements
of their civilization.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.750
Maurice then brings up the topic of humans,
whom Caesar had close relationships with in

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.620
the past, asking him if he still thinks about
them.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.510
Caesar replies that he sometimes does.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.140
Caesar explains the difference between the
two creatures: humans destroy each other while

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.890
apes unite as a family.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.479
Caesar wonders if humanity has become extinct,
to which Maurice responds by telling Caesar

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.310
that they haven't seen humans since the last
decade.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.550
One day two apes are on their way home from
hunting when they encounter a man.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.760
The man, intensely terrified at the sight
of the apes, pulls out his gun to threaten

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.330
the apes and shoots one of them.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.400
The gunshot angers the whole tribe, prompting
them to travel to the site to take action.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.830
It turns out that the man is not alone; with
him are six more people.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.740
After the tribe of apes arrive and surround
them, the person leading the group, Malcolm,

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.670
declares that they originally meant no harm.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.340
Malcolm, at the sight of Caesar, feels something
off about the apes.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.260
After a short, intense gaze with the humans,
Caesar shouts and tells the group to leave.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.360
The group of apes chases them away, scaring
one of the humans enough for them to drop

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.370
their bag.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.750
Maurice picks up the bag and hands it over
to Caesar.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.100
Caesar commands one of his apes, Koba, and
two of his subordinates to follow the humans

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.940
to where they are settled.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.600
Malcolm and his men reach a quarantine checkpoint
where their leader, Dreyfus, and a few soldiers

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.600
are settled.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.430
They immediately report to Dreyfus about the
situation regarding the dam.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.800
Malcolm tells Dreyfus that the dam, the reason
they were up there, is good enough to generate

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800
power.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.770
However, there is another problem.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.930
On the way back to the settlement, the group
tells Dreyfus about the apes and their evolution.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.620
Dreyfus tells them that they tell no one,
as it would potentially cause mass panic.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.090
Ellie, Malcolm’s wife and a former doctor,
explains that the few humans left alive are

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.770
genetically immune to the virus.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.959
Malcolm, Dreyfus, and the others reach the
settlement.

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.930
Meanwhile, Caesar and the apes have a meeting
about the situation with the humans.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.470
Some apes want to go to war since the humans
drew first blood, but Caesar wants a diplomatic

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.430
way of dealing with the situation, saying
that they will lose what they have built if

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.780
they go to war.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.879
After the meeting, Koba tells Caesar about
his unpleasant experience with the humans

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.670
and insists on showing their superiority and
strength.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.680
This prompts Caesar and the tribe to get on
their horses and march into the human settlement

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.230
to declare an announcement.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.790
When the apes arrive, the humans are visibly
alarmed, but their curiosity prompts them

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.610
to gather at the gate to meet the tribe.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.250
Caesar, without hesitation, declares that
he doesn’t want to go to war but is prepared

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.420
to fight if they deem it necessary.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.959
Caesar issues a warning before the tribe leaves,
returning the dropped bag, telling the humans

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.599
never to return.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.300
Now the humans are in a state of panic, anxious
about the potential threats the apes pose

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.300
to them.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.030
But Dreyfus sympathetically delivers a speech
to reassure them that they will find a way

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.280
to live through it and find another source
of power other than the dam.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.800
After the crowd settles, Malcolm tells Dreyfus
that there's no other power source other than

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.800
the dam.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.640
Willing to go through desperate measures,
Dreyfus replies that they will have to fight

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.640
the apes.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.060
He further explains that they need to reconnect
and find other survivors around the world,

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.739
and they need to generate power for their
radio transmitter.

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.239
Unwilling to let casualties increase, Malcolm
suggests that Dreyfus give him three days

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.560
to go back and talk it through with Caesar.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.629
Malcolm shows Dreyfus the bag that was returned
to him to reassure further that Caesar is

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.210
more than just an ape.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.060
Dreyfus tells him that if Malcolm fails, then
he will have to resort to more drastic measures.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.570
Malcolm proceeds to prepare for the trip.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.620
He tells Ellie about his plan, and they, along
with their son Alexander, Carver, the man

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.430
who shot an ape, Foster, and Komp, head over
to where the apes are.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.770
They arrive at the place on a rainy evening.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.801
Malcolm tells everyone to stay in the truck,
and if he doesn’t return in two hours, they

00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:37.000
should go back to the settlement without him.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.430
Malcolm heads off and arrives at the entrance,
where he meets a bunch of angry apes.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.610
The apes drag Malcolm over to the tribe, where
an entire ape civilization surrounds him.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.160
He raises both of his hands to express surrender.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.990
Then at the central tribal platform, Caesar
shows himself to meet Malcolm.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.190
Malcolm immediately pleads to Caesar not to
kill him and only wants to show Caesar something

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.210
to understand his intentions.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.940
Caesar silences the crowd and listens to Malcolm's
request.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.590
Malcolm, Caesar, and some apes head over to
the dam.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.910
Malcolm tries his best to explain how they
can restore power for the humans using the

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:06.910
dam.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.620
To Malcolm's surprise, Caesar understands
that they are trying to generate electricity.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.910
Malcolm further explains that they have no
intention of harming the apes; if they did,

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.300
they could kill him.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.080
Caesar agrees to let them do their work but
on the condition that they surrender their

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.080
guns.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.970
At the tribe, Koba expresses his disagreement
with Caesar's decisions, explaining that the

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.560
humans will be a potential threat if they
are given power.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.680
Caesar tells him that he's only doing it for
peace between humans and apes.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.480
Koba stubbornly insists that Caesar is wrong
by showing his scars as a sign of human violence

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.330
but is immediately silenced when Caesar expresses
his superior demeanor.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.710
The next day, while the group begins to do
their work under the supervision of Caesar,

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.990
Koba and his subordinates head over to the
human settlement without Caesar knowing.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.380
There, they sneakily discover the armory where
the weapons are kept.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.610
While in the armory, Koba is spotted by two
armed men, who immediately corner him.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.979
Left with no choice, Koba wittingly plays
dumb, doing random primitive movements in

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.880
front of the humans to fool them into thinking
he is harmless.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.890
And as Koba expected, the confused men let
Koba go free, thinking he is just a lost ape.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.010
Malcolm and the rest are working on the pipes
when a loud accident happens.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.760
Debris falls, trapping them and injuring Carver's
leg.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.300
This prompts the apes to check what happened,
and they immediately help them clear the debris,

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.169
rescuing Malcolm and his men.

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.400
Malcolm thanks Caesar for saving him and the
others, but due to the debris and the condition

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.040
of Carver, he requests that they be given
more time.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.639
Then, a baby ape, Caesar's second son, approaches
the group and everyone stares in awe at it.

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.860
The young ape then discovers a hidden gun
from Carver’s things, and this immediately

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.940
causes the apes to go hostile.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.630
Carver promptly pulls the shotgun and threatens
the apes when to his surprise, Caesar outclasses

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.320
him with his strength, pulling the shotgun
from him and knocking him down.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.250
Caesar is about to hit Carver with the gun,
but Malcolm pleadingly tells Caesar to stop.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.510
Infuriated, Caesar points his gun at Malcolm,
reminding him of his rule about guns.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.470
Caesar shows mercy by throwing the shotgun
in the river and telling the group to leave

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.830
immediately.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.539
While Malcolm and the group are packing, Malcolm
hurries back to Caesar, hoping he can explain

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:54.759
himself properly, and Ellie follows him.

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:58.539
The apes take Malcolm and Ellie to Caesar's
house, and they find out about his sick wife.

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:02.180
Ellie empathetically offers her medicine to
Caesar, to which Caesar agrees.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.789
As gratitude, Caesar allows them to stay for
one more day and let his apes help them speed

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:07.069
up the work.

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:10.069
Carver is immediately kicked out and is forced
to stay in the truck.

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:13.610
Not long after, Koba and his subordinates
arrive at the tribe to report to Caesar about

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.660
the weapons.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.840
Koba then heads over to the dam and immediately
assaults Alex.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.160
Malcolm pleads with Koba to stop, and, to
everyone’s surprise, Maurice defends them

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.490
from Koba.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.710
Caesar then shows up.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.330
Koba starts questioning Caesar’s decisions
and leadership, telling him that he is irresponsible

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.170
to his own kind by choosing the humans over
them.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.460
This makes Caesar furious, and he assaults
Koba, beating him up.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.770
Koba is unable to retaliate, and the fight
is one-sided.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.090
Caesar almost chokes Koba but stops and remembers
their principle that apes don’t kill each

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.090
other.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.660
Koba then gets on his feet and apologizes
to Caesar.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.270
Later that night, Koba privately tells Blue-Eyes
that he should protect Caesar in his stead

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.380
since Caesar no longer trusts Koba.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.110
Koba also tells him that he fears Caesar’s
trust in humans may threaten his own life.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.530
The following day, Maurice goes to meet Alex.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:59.110
Alex gives Maurice the book he reads as gratitude
for defending him against Koba.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.360
The two happily share a good time, reading
the book.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.810
During that same morning, Koba returns to
the armory and meets the men from the other

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:05.860
day drinking.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.880
Koba fools them once again, but this time,
Koba snatches a gun, ends the men's lives,

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.200
and takes the gun with him on the way back.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.020
Malcolm and the group finally finish fixing
the generator in the dam.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.710
Later that night, the group and Caesar find
a gasoline station in the woods with a convenience

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.710
store.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.500
The group enjoys some music then Malcolm tells
Caesar that they have finished their work

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.460
and will finally go back home.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.009
Caesar tells Malcolm that he finally trusts
them, and the two shake their hands.

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:30.580
Caesar takes them back to the settlement to
show them that the lights on their settlement

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.219
have indeed been restored.

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:35.909
Then just as everything is going well, Caesar
spots an armed Koba sneaking in.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.110
Koba schemingly shoots Caesar and hides.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.839
One of his lackeys also starts a fire in the
settlement burning the houses down.

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:43.699
This causes panic among the apes.

00:08:43.699 --> 00:08:47.220
Maurice immediately realizes what's happening,
telling Malcolm and the group to run and lead

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.220
them out.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.019
Koba then takes the stage and frames the humans
for killing Caesar and starting the fire.

00:08:52.019 --> 00:08:55.570
Koba then acts as their new leader and rallies
the apes to start an invasion against the

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:56.649
humans.

00:08:56.649 --> 00:09:00.329
Back in the power-restored city, the people
are celebrating and partying.

00:09:00.329 --> 00:09:03.110
Dreyfus and his men finally start reaching
out to other cities.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.819
While this is happening, the apes invade the
armory and steal human weapons.

00:09:06.819 --> 00:09:10.449
Dreyfus immediately gets notified of the attack,
so he evacuates the settlement, armed his

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:12.600
forces, and prepares to defend.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.709
Dreyfus and his men wait in anticipation as
the hoard of apes approaches on their horses

00:09:15.709 --> 00:09:16.860
amidst the mist.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.429
The apes start firing, forcing Dreyfus and
his men to take cover.

00:09:20.429 --> 00:09:23.250
Dreyfus immediately retaliates, firing at
the apes with precision.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.019
It is total bloodshed.

00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:28.230
Blue-Eyes sees his fellow brethren dying and
struggling to survive.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.189
Koba then gets on one of the horses, picks
up two rifles, and initiates a fierce one-person

00:09:32.189 --> 00:09:33.279
counter-attack.

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:37.199
Dreyfus immediately retaliates by firing a
rocket launcher and slowing the push.

00:09:37.199 --> 00:09:40.360
However, the apes are slowly overwhelming
the men with their numbers, pushing through

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.989
the first line of defense.

00:09:41.989 --> 00:09:46.009
To Dreyfus's surprise, a tank flanks the apes
eliminating a vast number of them.

00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:49.860
But Koba notices this, and with his uncanny
maneuver, he is able to intercept the tank,

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.790
and from there, the apes annihilate the defense.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.399
Dreyfus watches in terror, failing to protect
his people from the invasion.

00:09:56.399 --> 00:10:00.110
The group finds the wounded Caesar in the
woods, and they help take him to their truck.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.390
Caesar tells the confused group that an ape
shot him, so they immediately head out.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.370
The hoard of apes continues to chase the humans,
running away, intending to capture them.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.759
A man bravely tries to slow the pursuit, but
Koba knocks him down.

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:14.249
Koba then commands one of the apes to finish
the man off but refuses as he thought Caesar

00:10:14.249 --> 00:10:15.389
wouldn’t want this.

00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:19.209
Angry, Koba drags the ape upstairs and throws
him off the railing, killing him.

00:10:19.209 --> 00:10:22.920
Koba then incites fear to the rest of the
doubtful apes, including Blue-Eyes, telling

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.870
them Koba is their new leader now.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:29.100
The apes successfully capture the remaining
humans and take them somewhere for enslavement.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.029
Malcolm and the group arrive at an abandoned
city Caesar was leading them to.

00:10:32.029 --> 00:10:35.509
Here, they found themselves at Caesar’s
past home, and the group discovered that he

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:37.220
once lived with a man.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.949
Malcolm tells Ellie that he will go back to
the settlement to retrieve the surgical kit

00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:42.000
needed to mend Caesar’s wounds.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.949
The apes imprison the humans in cages, holding
them captive.

00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:48.110
Koba sends out his apes to find other humans
and capture them.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:52.100
Amidst the crowd, Blue-eyes, to his surprise,
sees Maurice and other apes held prisoners

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.110
as well for their loyalty to Caesar.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.709
Maurice tells Blue-Eyes to protect himself.

00:10:56.709 --> 00:10:59.439
Malcolm arrives at the settlement and rushes
his way in.

00:10:59.439 --> 00:11:03.170
Malcolm retrieves the medicine but finds difficulty
on the way out as the apes approach his way.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:07.249
Malcolm tries his best to avoid them but is
met by a silhouette of an ape holding a gun.

00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:10.670
The ape reveals himself to be Blue-Eyes, who
helps Malcolm upon hearing that Caesar is

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.889
still alive.

00:11:11.889 --> 00:11:15.769
Blue-Eyes and Caesar happily reunite, and
Caesar tells Blue-Eyes about Koba.

00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:20.249
Later that night, Caesar realizes his mistakes,
his misplaced trust, and his view about humans

00:11:20.249 --> 00:11:21.309
and apes.

00:11:21.309 --> 00:11:25.019
Blue-Eyes tells Caesar about Maurice, the
prisoners, and Ash's death.

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:28.579
Caesar is now desperate to stop Koba, and
Blue-Eyes is willing to help.

00:11:28.579 --> 00:11:31.959
The next day, Blue-Eyes devises a plan to
break the prisoned apes free.

00:11:31.959 --> 00:11:35.499
Later that night, Blue-Eyes baits the guarding
apes into the prison bus, and with the strength

00:11:35.499 --> 00:11:38.329
of Maurice and the others, they wipe out the
guarding apes.

00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:42.439
Blue-Eyes assists them, and they break free
along with the rest of the human prisoners.

00:11:42.439 --> 00:11:44.819
Caesar finds himself reminiscing at his old
home.

00:11:44.819 --> 00:11:47.989
He finds a camera and sentimentally watches
a video of his time together with his good

00:11:47.989 --> 00:11:49.299
old friend.

00:11:49.299 --> 00:11:53.389
Malcolm walks in, and they chat for a while
until Blue-Eyes and the refugees arrive there.

00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:57.009
Blue-Eyes tells Caesar that Koba is planning
something terrible, so Caesar, Malcolm, and

00:11:57.009 --> 00:11:59.519
the rest of the apes immediately head for
the settlement.

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:02.809
In the tunnel, Malcolm meets Dreyfus but not
before he tells the apes to take a pathway

00:12:02.809 --> 00:12:06.259
that leads directly towards the settlement
and separating from the apes.

00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:09.410
Malcolm finds out that Dreyfus and his few
left men plan to blow up the tower and that

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:10.829
Dreyfus needs Malcolm's help.

00:12:10.829 --> 00:12:14.730
Malcolm is conflicted by this, so after thinking
it through, he subtly takes a rifle and points

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.679
it towards Dreyfus's team, telling them that
they should give Caesar a chance.

00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:22.259
Caesar and the others arrive at the top of
the tower where Koba and his lackeys are.

00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:26.069
The two have a short verbal standoff where
they clash their views and throw insults.

00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:29.069
This ultimately leads to a one-on-one fight
to prove who's stronger.

00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:32.600
Koba is aggressive, throwing punches on Caesar,
and they both fall.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.010
Back on their feet, Koba pushes the attack
and lands his punches onto Caesar, and they

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.069
fall again along with some debris.

00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:42.199
Caesar is back on his feet, looks at Koba,
who is now injured from the fall.

00:12:42.199 --> 00:12:45.221
Malcolm continues to stall time, trying to
convince Dreyfus that he should give the apes

00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:46.250
a chance.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.970
The fight continues at the tower.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.499
Koba continues the attack with his metal rod
while Caesar is on the defensive, jumping

00:12:51.499 --> 00:12:53.230
platform after platform.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.689
The run stops when Caesar picks up a metal
stair step as a shield.

00:12:56.689 --> 00:12:59.500
Caesar tells Koba that he mistakenly trusted
him like a brother.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.149
Koba tells Caesar that he only fights for
the apes while continuing to attack the defensive

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:04.149
Caesar.

00:13:04.149 --> 00:13:07.550
Caesar then refutes his statement, telling
Koba that he only fights for himself.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:11.160
This infuriates Koba to the point of irrationality,
and he continues to make attacks until his

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.470
wound kicks in.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:16.269
This gives Caesar an opening to retaliate
and strikes him hard on his wound.

00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:19.769
Caesar is now on the counter-attack, parrying
Koba until he is almost down.

00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:22.670
But Koba is still able to retaliate and fight.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:25.699
Malcolm continues to stall some more, but
Dreyfus can finally distract him enough to

00:13:25.699 --> 00:13:28.109
make a quick move to grab the detonator.

00:13:28.109 --> 00:13:31.491
Dreyfus pauses for a while and tells Malcolm
that he's only saving the human race, then

00:13:31.491 --> 00:13:35.040
proceeds to blow himself and his team along
with the tower's foundation.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.220
Malcolm is able to avoid the explosion by
jumping to a safe spot at the side of the

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.220
tracks.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.259
The explosion interrupts the fight between
Koba and Caesar, and it continues to make

00:13:42.259 --> 00:13:45.649
the tower collapse, increasing the casualties
of apes above it.

00:13:45.649 --> 00:13:48.040
Caesar and his subordinates survive along
with some apes.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.740
Koba survives as well, and he picks up a gun
from one of the dying apes.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.959
Going for a desperate attempt, Koba tries
to shoot Caesar and some apes who are helping

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:56.300
the other injured apes.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.179
Koba hits Maurice, and this prompts Caesar
to aggressively jump on the ferocious Koba,

00:14:00.179 --> 00:14:04.189
knocking him at the edge of the tower, and
is now holding on to a damaged platform.

00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:07.879
Caesar approaches the platform, and Koba,
desperate to live, reminds Caesar that apes

00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:09.459
don't kill each other.

00:14:09.459 --> 00:14:12.529
Caesar pulls Koba’s hand as if trying to
help him, but he takes one look at his injured

00:14:12.529 --> 00:14:16.350
men and comes to a simple conclusion; that
Koba is no longer part of them.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.899
So Caesar lets go of Koba’s arm, and Koba
screamingly falls to his death.

00:14:19.899 --> 00:14:22.189
Caesar rallies the apes at the ground of the
settlement.

00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:24.939
There he finds the apes dragging Malcolm out
of the subway.

00:14:24.939 --> 00:14:27.050
Caesar tells the apes to leave Malcolm.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.470
Malcolm immediately informs Caesar that soldiers
are coming and that the apes are in danger,

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.160
telling them that they should go.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.980
Caesar acknowledges the wrongdoings of the
apes, telling Malcolm that they had already

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.850
started a war that humans will not simply
forgive.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.329
Caesar tells Malcolm to go before the fighting
begins.

00:14:40.329 --> 00:14:44.089
The two share their sentiments for a short
while then Malcolm slowly leaves.

00:14:44.089 --> 00:14:47.259
Caesar and Blue-Eyes happily reunite with
the rest of the family, and the apes gather

00:14:47.259 --> 00:14:48.259
together.

00:14:48.259 --> 00:14:51.779
The apes then bow down to Caesar, acknowledging
him as their rightful leader.

00:14:51.779 --> 00:14:54.990
Caesar stands in the face of the sunrise,
lying in anticipation for the storm that's

00:14:54.990 --> 00:15:02.449
about to come.
