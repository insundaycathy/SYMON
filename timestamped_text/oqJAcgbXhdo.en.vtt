00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.270
Everytime he gets killed, he finds himself
alive again in the same bed.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.740
What is happening?

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.609
This is Movie Shortens.

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.600
Follow us to get through a movie titled: ARQ.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.600
Be aware.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.600
There are spoilers.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.090
Now, let's begin!

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.709
Renton is awake in confusion.

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.260
Hannah, his ex-wife, is here with him.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.440
He notices the time, which is 6:16.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.410
Suddenly, The Bloc storms in, knocking him
out.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.450
As he regains consciousness, he attempts to
flee and falls off the stairs, breaking his

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.680
neck to death.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.560
Renton wakes up with the memory of him dying
down the stairs.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.190
It is 6:16.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.940
The Bloc bursts through the door.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.140
Renton does not attempt to flee this time.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.820
Netx, Renton is restrained on a chair.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.730
Hannah is later dragged in and tied back to
back with Renton.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.390
A man named Father demands the "scrips."

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.899
Renton recognizes Cuz, a body lying on the
floor, who actually is a Bloc's member but

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.680
later becomes Torus' agent.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.050
Renton frees himself and Hannad by getting
scissors nearby.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.579
Hannah asks Renton what is going on so far.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.149
Renton reveals that it is Cuz who broke into
his house last night.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.420
Cuz was sent by Torus to follow the ARQ (Arcing
Recursive Quine), a perpetual motion machine

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.649
built by Renton.

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.700
The machine that continues to run even when
there is no external source of energy.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.600
In effect, the ARQ is the answer to the energy
dilemma.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.049
Cuz was unaware that the ARQ is shielded by
a 20,000-volt electric field.

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.299
Cuz most likely touched the ARQ, which shorts
out and kills him.

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.829
Later, Renton attempts to attack the intruders.

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.399
However, he gets shot in the abdomen and dies.

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.159
Renton awakens with the combined memories
of the previous loops.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.599
However, he has a slow reaction time and is
easily knocked out and dragged.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:40.479
Renton and Hannah are bound.

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.939
Renton informs Hannah that he has been looping
as a result of the ARQ.

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.459
He describes Cuz to Hannah before she unmasks
him.

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.139
He also describes to her other intruders including:
Father, Brother, and Sonny.

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:56.529
From the news, this is a dystopian future
in which the world is polluted and the air

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:58.329
is unfit to breathe.

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.670
Torus Corporation is an evil empire that has
taken control of the rest of the world.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.329
The Bloc is a rebel group that wishes to bring
down Torus.

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.940
This time Renton plans to gas the team dead.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.500
He takes the help of Hannah and gives her
the cyanide canister.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.140
He tells her to toss it in the vent and put
on a gas mask.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.530
The ventilation system is activated by Renton,
but Hanna does not use the cyanide canister.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.530
The invaders kidnap Hannah and use her to
persuade Renton to tell where the scrips are

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.530
hidden.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.170
There are lots of scripts from Torus that
Renton hides in a safe.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.390
When Sonny wants to kill Renton, Hannah interrupts
saying no.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.950
Renton now learns that Hannah is part of the
Bloc.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.390
Hannah’s code name is Mother.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.650
Long ago, Renton and Hannad used to work for
Torus.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.440
However, as Torus wants to steal ARQ for their
worldwar plans, Renton took back the ARQ and

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.920
some scrips from Torus to his hideout.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.660
When Hannah leaves the room, Sonny shoots
Renton.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.370
Renton wakes up with the cumulative memories.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.790
Now he knows Hannah is in on it.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.620
They are tied to the chair.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.400
This time Renton doesn’t cut Hannah loose
from her chair.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.180
He goes through the ARQ video logs and notices
the recordings it has been making of the previous

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.290
time loops.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.960
He notices a recording of an event that hasn’t
happened yet.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.620
The recording has Renton yelling “Listen
carefully.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.620
Torus…

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.620
Hannah!” and then gets shot.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.400
Hannah tells Renton that the Bloc has no interest
in the ARQ, they want only the scrips.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.790
When Renton ran away with the ARQ and scrips,
Hannah was caught and tortured for a long

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.700
period of time by Torus.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.300
She is then rescued by the Bloc.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.610
Next, Hannah agrees to work with Renton as
long as he doesn’t kill the intruders.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.150
They subdue the team and tie them up.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.569
Renton wants Hannah to run away with him.

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.190
Hannah wants to stay and fight Torus with
the Bloc.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.440
Renton refuses to give the scrips.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.850
Hannah threatens to shoot the ARQ but Renton
makes Hannah shoot him on purpose.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.040
Hannah is now aware of the previous loop.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.560
Renton was the last person she remembers shooting.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.450
They are tied up again.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.400
Renton informs Hannah that they are trapped
in a time loop.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.080
He then shows her the ARQ logs.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.340
They argue about Bloc and Torus.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.890
Hannah recalls from the lastest loop that
as Renton was shot, she was untying everyone.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.370
However, she heard a gunshot after.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.150
Renton is sure that Sonny shot her but Hannah
doesn’t trust it.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.280
Now the two tie themselves back to their chairs,
but Renton forgets to tie his legs.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.860
Hannah calls in the team and says she knows
where the scrips are.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.290
Hannah also decides that Bloc is taking the
ARQ back with them.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.279
Renton is tied and is unable to do anything
about it.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:33.699
Sonny suddenly shoots everyone else and has
already noticed Renton’s legs were untied.

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.530
He reveals to Renton that he is also an agent
of Torus.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.840
He calls for backup and asks Renton how he
can shut the ARQ down.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.760
Renton refuses to comply, and is later shot
in the face by Sonny.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.330
Renton and Hannah wake up.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.479
Renton tells Hannah that Sonny is a Torus
mercenary.

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.900
After tying them up, Hannah tells Father to
give them 5 minutes alone.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.370
They're both restrained.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.099
Hannah frees Renton on purpose.

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.090
Then she calls her team in and sends Sonny
and Brother to look for Rentom.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.129
She informs Father that Sonny is a mercenary
and they need to kill him.

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:08.650
Hannah explains about the time machine to
Father.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.530
Meanwhile outside, Sonny knocks out Brother.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.499
He then returns to Hannah and Father.

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:15.860
Sonny informs the two that Renton killed Brother.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.590
A moment later, Sonny shoots Father.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.250
Renton attacks Sonny from behind and kills
him.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.249
Renton and Hannah decide to shut down the
ARQ – this will stop the time from looping.

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:28.000
They notice Father is still alive.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.610
Just as Renton is reaching for a first aid
kit, Brother enters and shoots him, thinking

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.029
Renton is the cause of the casualties.

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:37.749
Renton and Hannah wake up.

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:41.509
They hear gunshots in this loop, but no one
bursts through the door.

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:44.379
This is due to Sonny's retention of the prior
loop.

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:47.060
Sonny has killed the rest of his squad in
advance.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.729
Renton and Hannah talk about how people are
regaining their memories.

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.740
They learn that the individual who is the
farthest away from the ARQ will be the first

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.900
to gain memory from previous loops.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.169
Renton came first, then Hannah, and now Sonny.

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.400
Hannah and Renton get near the ARQ and argue
about whether the Bloc or Torus should control

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.629
the ARQ.

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:09.889
They decide if Sonny gets the upper hand then
Hannah should destroy the ARQ with the kill

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:11.789
key – SKY.

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.009
The password is the date of their last meet.

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.300
It turns out Sonny pretends to be dead on
the floor in Cuz’s outfit.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.190
Sonny gets up from the ground, pointing the
gun at Hannah.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.770
Sonny gains the upper hand and calls for backup.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.639
Renton now has no choice but to grab Sonny
and touch the ARQ, electrocuting them both

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:29.740
to death.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.740
Renton and Hannah are both awake.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.440
No one bursts through the door.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.839
They walk down to the ARQ and listen in on
a chat.

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:40.199
Cuz has been prevented from touching the ARQ
by Sonny.

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.069
Cuz is still alive.

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:43.979
Sonny then shoots Father and Brother.

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:47.509
Meanwhile, Renton and Hannah lock Sonny and
Cuz in.

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:51.059
Renton uses the vent to throw in the cyanide
canister.

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:53.789
Sonny realizes that it is a cyanide smell.

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:57.300
Sonny drags the dead bodies of Father and
Brother to create a trap.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.130
He kills Cuz too and puts him alongside the
dead bodies.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.589
Hannah and Renton come in, seeing Ronny is
shot dead.

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:08.990
Again, they have an argument around using
the ARQ for the purposes of the Bloc.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.030
Hanna throws something and it cracks the screen
behind Renton.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.289
This reminds Renton about the recording he
saw earlier.

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:17.669
The one where he says “Listen carefully.

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:18.669
Torus…

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:20.770
Hannah!” and then gets shot.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.479
They notice that the crack is different from
the one in the video.

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:28.119
They still don’t understand why that video
exists as they can’t remember that event

00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:29.219
happening.

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:32.729
Hannah now notices the note in Father’s
mouth that reads SKY.

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:34.840
She falls for the trap Sonny sets.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.389
Earlier, he puts a note in Father’s mouth
as bait and Sonny shoots himself.

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:42.939
She walks up to Father but steps on the blood
by mistake.

00:07:42.939 --> 00:07:46.599
The blood conducts electricity from the ARQ
and kills her.

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:48.369
Sonny knew this would happen.

00:07:48.369 --> 00:07:53.669
Renton doesn’t shut the ARQ, resulting in
the time looping on purpose to save Hannah.

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:55.349
Renton and Hannah wake up.

00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:57.319
Father and Brother storm in.

00:07:57.319 --> 00:08:00.059
Hannah stops them and explains that they are
in a loop.

00:08:00.059 --> 00:08:03.419
Father admits having deja vu of being shot
by Sonny.

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:06.879
They wonder why Sonny has let them come up
to Renton and Hannah.

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:08.719
They learn that it is a trap.

00:08:08.719 --> 00:08:13.339
Sonny and Cuz hold the four of them at gunpoint
and take them to the ARQ.

00:08:13.339 --> 00:08:16.589
Sonny tortures Hannah, forcing Renton to give
the password.

00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:21.050
It’s September19 – the date when Renton
and Hannah last meet.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.589
Sonny gets Renton to disable the ARQ.

00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:26.659
The lights go out for a moment, allowing Hannah
and Renton to escape.

00:08:26.659 --> 00:08:28.869
The two leave the house.

00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:30.899
The air is hard to breathe in.

00:08:30.899 --> 00:08:32.450
They share an air mask.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.970
Next, they reach a burnt line which Renton
believes is the boundary of the ARQ’s time

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:37.970
loop.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.820
Renton thinks that the effect of the ARQ ends
at that boundary.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.820
Renton wants Hannah to leave while he goes
back to kill Sonny and Cuz.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.100
Hannah refuses and the two go back in.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.190
The three confront each other.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.860
Hannah pours some liquidized substance and
burns Cuz.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.540
They return to find that the ARQ has been
restarted.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.530
Sonny wants time to repeat itself because
he is unable to kill Renton.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.590
Sonny and Renton get into a fight.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.310
Hannah accidentally shoots and hits the screen.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.080
Renton kills Sonny by slamming his face into
the spinning ARQ.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.520
Renton and the blood splatters on the screen.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.810
When checking the computer’s logs, Renton
soon learns that these loops have been going

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.510
on for thousands of times, not nine as they
thought.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.270
Renton and Hannah decide to keep the time
loop going.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:26.250
They are aware that they have failed in all
previous sequences.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:31.060
They will wake up with no memory of these
9 loops if they allow time to loop again.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.100
Renton suggests leaving themselves a video
message.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.300
He records a video message “Listen carefully.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.310
Torus…Hannah!

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.310
Torus found you.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.860
Take the ARQ to the Bloc and trust Hannah!”
before he gets shot.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.640
This time, Renton can make the recording longer.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.040
A new loop begins.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:53.410
