00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.250
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.149
Today I will show you a horror, mystery film
from 2009, titled Orphan.

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:08.250
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.290
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.799
Kate and her husband John walk into a hospital
because she's in labor.

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.510
She gets wheeled away, as John stays behind
to sign her in.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.960
Immediately, Kate starts bleeding.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.490
She wakes up in an operating room, surrounded
by medical staff, but her husband isn't there

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.490
yet.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.820
The whole situation feels strange and frightening
to her, when the nurse tells her that her

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.380
baby is dead.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.869
Kate can't believe it.

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.390
John comes in and starts filming the birth,
as if nothing was wrong.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.090
The nurse hands her the infant.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.329
Kate is screaming and suddenly, she wakes
up in her bed.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.059
She gets up and goes to the restroom, looking
at the scar on her belly.

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.670
She takes a tablet.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.230
The next day, Kate is at psychotherapy, where
Doctor Browning explains that nightmares as

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.550
those are a normal response to the trauma
of stillbirth.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.340
Kate wonders if the nightmare was about that
or about the fact that she will adopt a child

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.340
soon.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.270
She thinks she might not be ready.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.580
Kate tells her therapist that she was considering
buying some alcohol, to which Browning replies

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.020
that the important thing is that she didn't
buy any at the end.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.141
Relating to the adoption, the therapist tells
her that ultimately she has to decide if she

00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:13.740
will go through with it.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.700
Kate goes to pick up her deaf daughter Max
from school.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.180
She's driving her home, but when she moves
from a stop light distracted, she almost causes

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.430
an accident.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.950
Later, Kate is seen playing the piano and
composing music.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.600
She gets irritated by some noise she hears,
so she goes outside and sees that Max is throwing

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.490
a basketball on the wall.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.390
She yells at her to stop and the kid apologizes.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.920
John arrives home with their son Daniel and
the three of them goof around with the basketball.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.360
That night, Kate is putting Max to bed, when
she asks her to read her a story.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.870
The story is about the child that died.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.420
Max asks her if she'll get a new sister.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.170
Before Kate goes to bed, she takes another
tablet.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.420
She gets into bed with John and they talk
about the adoption.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.240
She made her decision, they will go through
with it.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.670
Some time later, they are seen diving into
an orphanage.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.060
Sister Abigail meets them upfront and tells
them to look around.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.690
Kate stays on the first floor, looking at
the little girls playing and John goes to

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.110
the second floor.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.210
He hears a girl sing and walks inside the
room, where Esther is painting.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.640
She tells him an amazing story about the painting
she's making, as Kate and Abigail walk into

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.910
the room.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.050
John introduces them and the three of them
continue to talk.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.850
The girl says that nobody has ever talked
to her before because she's different.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.320
They seem to like her.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.620
They talk to Abigail about adopting Esther.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.820
She tells them that she was originally from
Russia and that the people who brought her

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.960
to the US died in a house fire.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.450
But, all in all Abigail thinks that the girl
is wonderful.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.650
Kate agrees.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.930
Three weeks later, they pick her up from the
orphanage and say goodbye to Abigail.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.930
In the car, Kate teaches Esther sign language.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.060
They reach the house and Max is excited to
see them.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.400
Esther introduces herself to her instantly,
asking Kate how much she can hear.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.210
She tells her that she can hear just enough
so that she can read peoples lips.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.480
Once inside, they're met with grandma Barbara
and Daniel.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.820
That night all of them give her welcome gifts,
except Daniel, who already seems jealous of

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.650
the girl, especially when she gives John a
huge thank you hug.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.170
Daniel goes outside to the treehouse with
his friends and they look through dirty magazines.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.170
Esther and Max play in the snow, as Barbara
and Kate talk about Max and about her plans

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.960
to start teaching again once Esther is settled.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.510
Barbara seems to feel disappointed in Kate.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.230
There's a storm brewing that night, as Kate
gets ready to go to bed.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.650
Esther wakes up and goes to Max's room.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.430
John and Kate are making love, when there's
knock on the door and it's the two girls asking

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.200
to sleep in their bed.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.400
Esther wants to sleep next to John.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.360
The next morning, they're all ready to leave
the house and get to school, when Esther comes

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.459
down the stairs in an fancy dress, prompting
the other children to laugh.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.860
Kate wants to make sure if Esther really wants
to wear that to school and the girl tells

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.459
her that there is nothing wrong in being different.

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:53.540
Kate lets her wear the dress.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.170
Later, she is being welcomed in class by her
teacher, when one of the kids makes fun of

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.170
her.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.730
That day, Max and Esther play on the frozen
lake, when Kate runs out, yelling that doing

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.440
that isn't allowed.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.620
Simultaneously, Daniel plays with a paintball
gun and shoots a bird.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.709
Esther and Max walk over and he's very upset,
but Esther gives him a large rock, telling

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.670
him to put it out of its misery.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.350
He doesn't want to do it, so she does it for
him.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.850
Later, Esther goes to take a bath.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.660
Kate goes into her room to put away her laundry,
but finds an old Bible stuck in a drawer.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.820
She doesn't hear Esther looking out of the
bathroom as she looks through it and finds

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.060
a photo of a man inside.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.940
At school, Daniel's friends are making fun
of him because of Esther, so he pushes her

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.240
books over.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.990
When she goes to pick them up, a girl from
her class finds her Bible and as they struggle

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.320
for it, it falls on the ground.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.480
Esther picks it up, but the girl reaches for
her choker, calling her a doggy.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.500
Esther screams.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.610
Later, Kate is teaching her how to play the
piano.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.070
Then she asks her about the incident at the
school, but she doesn't want to talk about

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.070
it.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.900
Kate gives her a scrapbook, which she has
already started for her, when Esther asks

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.639
her about the baby she lost.

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.070
Kate tells her what happened, as she shows
her the roses where they scattered her ashes.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.560
After dinner, thinking the kids are sleeping,
Kate and John make love in the kitchen.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.110
Esther suddenly appears.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.190
The next morning, Kate goes to talk to her
about it.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.810
Esther seems unfazed as she paints, saying
she knows about it and uses the f-word.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.930
Kate and John talk about it later and she
thinks they should take her to a therapist.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.180
John thinks it's overreacting to take the
child to therapy for one dirty word.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.770
John takes the girls to a park and while they're
at a swing, one of his neighbors comes over

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.130
to flirt with him.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.790
Meanwhile, Esther's bully comes into the playground
as well.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.480
Esther's attention is divided between her
and John's exchange with the neighbor.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.080
The bully is actually afraid of Esther and
looks out for her as she goes to play in the

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.080
castle.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.600
She wants to go down a slide when Esther pushes
her suddenly, breaking her leg.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.970
Max sees her do it.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.930
At diner that night, John talks to Esther
about it, Max confirms the story that the

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.389
girl slipped.

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.220
Before they eat Esther prays and Max does
the same.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.240
She even understands sign language better
than Daniel.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.470
He antagonizes her and starts calling her
names, when the parents interject.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.040
He runs off, angry and cursing.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.400
John puts a lock on his treehouse as a punishment.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.010
Later, Kate is at the store with the girls,
when sister Abigail calls her.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.040
Esther refuses to talk to her, but Kate continues.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.041
She steps aside and tells sister Abigail about
everything that has been happening, while

00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:25.250
Max reads her lips and recounts her words
to Esther.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.920
That night, Esther plays the piano perfectly
to Kate's surprise.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.730
She asks why Esther pretended not to know
how to play and the girl replies that she

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.300
did it for her benefit.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.060
That night, Kate and John argue about Esther
and their argument spirals out of control.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.240
Esther hears them in the other room, contented.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.390
One day, sister Abigail comes over to the
house.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.530
She talks to the parents about Esther, thinking
that there might be something wrong with her.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.660
She lists a few things that she might have
done in the past, like hurting other children.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.140
The girl hears everything and goes to get
Max, telling her that she needs to help her

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.730
so the mean lady doesn't take her away.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.210
Kate thinks that Abigail might be onto something,
but John thinks she's overreacting.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.200
Kate suggests they take her to a therapist
and he agrees.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.600
Meanwhile, Esther tells Max to find the keys
to the treehouse, but instead she uses them

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.750
to get a gun out of John's safe.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.290
She takes the bullets out of the revolver,
leaving one inside.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.150
She points it at Max, scaring her terribly.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.091
As Abigail leaves the house in her car, Esther
takes Max to a bridge telling her that they

00:07:24.091 --> 00:07:27.360
will scare her so much, she'll never want
to come back.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.020
As the car approaches, she pushes Max onto
the street and Abigail almost hits the girl,

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.860
swirls and crashes the car.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.350
Abigail finds Max crying, when Esther hits
her with a hammer.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.490
She instructs Max to help her get Abigail
off the road.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:45.300
They roll her down, but she's still alive,
so Esther finishes her off with the hammer.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.830
The two of them go into the treehouse, where
Esther hides her bloody clothes and the hammer.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.430
She tells Max that they'll send her to jail
too just for helping her.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.660
Esther then tells her that she loves her.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.350
Daniel sees them climb down the treehouse,
but Esther sees him too.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:04.010
That night, she comes into his room with a
scalpel, threatening him not to say anything.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.110
The boy pees himself.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:10.620
John and Kate take Esther to see Browning,
who talks to them about her as she waits outside.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.830
The therapist says that there is nothing wrong
with the girl, but that Kate is in fact the

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:15.830
problem.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.370
She thinks Kate feels inadequate as a mother
and is taking it out on Esther.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.210
John agrees with her reasoning.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.970
When they come back home, Kate gets a call
from the orphanage and she's told that sister

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.920
Abigail hasn't returned since the previous
day.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.820
The police search for her and find her body
where Esther left it.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:36.079
A police officer is seen talking to Kate and
John, saying they have no suspects.

00:08:36.079 --> 00:08:39.759
Esther is in her room switching the light
of her aquarium on and off, showing a gruesome

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:42.620
painting she has made of the house and the
family.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.160
Kate searches online for information about
disturbed children and shows her findings

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.360
to John.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.139
He disagrees with her again and she tells
him she won't be seeing Doctor Browning anymore.

00:08:52.139 --> 00:08:55.960
Kate is worried about who Esther is and says
she'll contact the orphanage in Russia, where

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.540
Esther came from.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.189
When she makes the call, she finds out that
there are no records of her previous to her

00:09:01.189 --> 00:09:03.139
arrival in the US.

00:09:03.139 --> 00:09:06.999
The next day, John goes to wake Esther up
to take her to the dentist, but since she

00:09:06.999 --> 00:09:09.639
doesn't want to go he promises to reschedule.

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:13.350
They spend the day painting together and Esther
tells him, that she thinks that Kate doesn't

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.369
like her.

00:09:14.369 --> 00:09:18.279
Meanwhile, Kate is taking the other children
to school and asks them about her.

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:21.339
They lie, saying she's never done anything
wrong.

00:09:21.339 --> 00:09:25.209
That night, Esther comes in the kitchen telling
Kate she has a present for her.

00:09:25.209 --> 00:09:29.029
She gives her a bucket of roses, picked from
the place where Kate's daughter's ashes were

00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:30.110
scattered.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.820
Kate gets upset and grabs her, but John tells
her it was his fault.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.329
That same night, Esther goes to the garage
and breaks her hand.

00:09:37.329 --> 00:09:41.399
Back in bed, she calls for John, telling him
her arm hurts and when he checks it, he sees

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:42.819
it's been broken.

00:09:42.819 --> 00:09:47.149
They come back from the doctor and he's tucking
her in their bed, when Kate comes in.

00:09:47.149 --> 00:09:50.740
He confronts her, but Kate says she didn't
grab her that hard.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.420
Later, she goes to a liquor store and buys
two wine bottles.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.740
She gets a little drunk, but throws the rest
of the open wine bottle down the drain.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.730
Kate drives the kids to school the following
morning.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.739
Daniel walks out of the car and his bag rips,
so when Kate goes to help him, Esther puts

00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:08.309
the car in drive with Max still in there.

00:10:08.309 --> 00:10:12.120
Kate runs after the car, until it's finally
stopped by the snow.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.290
That night, Doctor Browning is in their house
and Kate swears that she put the car in park

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.709
and that Max is covering for Esther.

00:10:18.709 --> 00:10:21.689
John shows her the second wine bottle which
Esther found.

00:10:21.689 --> 00:10:25.600
The therapist tells her that she reserved
a spot for her in a rehabilitation center,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.550
but Kate tells them her side of the story
about the wine.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.639
They don't believe her about the wine and
about the accident.

00:10:31.639 --> 00:10:35.339
John thinks she's being manipulative and gives
her a week to go to rehab or he'll leave and

00:10:35.339 --> 00:10:36.670
take the kids.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.569
Meanwhile, Esther tells Max that she'll shoot
her mom if she tells on her.

00:10:40.569 --> 00:10:45.420
Later, Daniel goes into Max's room and she
tells him about Abigail and the treehouse.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.059
He says he'll get the stuff from the treehouse,
but Esther hears him.

00:10:49.059 --> 00:10:52.029
Kate gets up during the night and sneaks into
Max's room.

00:10:52.029 --> 00:10:54.619
Suddenly, Esther turns the light on.

00:10:54.619 --> 00:10:58.550
They go back and forth, but Esther shows her
the diary she'd been keeping, letting her

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.089
know she'd read it.

00:11:00.089 --> 00:11:03.470
She antagonizes her, but Kate doesn't fall
for it.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.779
The next day, Kate calls the orphanage again
and when she doesn't find out anything, she

00:11:07.779 --> 00:11:09.610
goes to get Esther's Bible.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.350
She finds it hidden in a plush toy and finds
pictures of men inside.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.100
She sees the words Saarne Institute on it
and immediately searches for what they mean

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.199
online.

00:11:18.199 --> 00:11:21.720
She calls the number she finds and they tell
her that the Institute is actually mental

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.709
hospital and not an orphanage.

00:11:23.709 --> 00:11:27.819
Meanwhile, Daniel sneaks out of the house
to get the stuff from the treehouse.

00:11:27.819 --> 00:11:31.310
Esther follows him there and starts pouring
fuel over the evidence, then lights it and

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.769
continues pouring fuel over Daniel.

00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:36.180
She locks him inside the burning treehouse.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.050
He calls for his mother, but she's too busy
investigating Esther.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.420
Daniel gets on the roof, crying for help.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:47.480
He falls onto a wooden beam, but slips and
falls on the ground, as Esther watches him.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.350
Suddenly, Kate sees the fire, as Esther goes
over Daniel to kill him with a rock.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.249
Max pushes her away and Kate arrives before
she can do anything more.

00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:57.549
Daniel is alive.

00:11:57.549 --> 00:12:01.549
They're all in the hospital, when the doctor
comes in and informs them that he has a serious

00:12:01.549 --> 00:12:04.499
neck injury and might not remember what happened.

00:12:04.499 --> 00:12:06.209
Esther is worried about that.

00:12:06.209 --> 00:12:10.360
Kate tells John what she found out about Esther,
but he's still not convinced.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.639
While they are arguing, Esther goes to Daniel's
room.

00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:16.250
Max knows what's going on and goes after her.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:20.470
Esther starts suffocating Daniel with his
pillow, as Max goes to get her parents.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.029
The alarm in Daniels room goes off and the
doctors revive him.

00:12:24.029 --> 00:12:26.180
Kate confronts Esther and slaps her.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.329
Orderlies grab her and sedate her.

00:12:28.329 --> 00:12:30.329
She misses an important phone call.

00:12:30.329 --> 00:12:33.439
Later, Kate wakes up and immediately asks
about Daniel.

00:12:33.439 --> 00:12:37.980
She begs John not to let Esther near Max,
as she stays overnight in the hospital.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.879
That night, Max takes of her hearing aid and
her dad tucks her in.

00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:45.110
Esther comes in and grabs the aid when she
says goodnight to her.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.809
John goes down to the living room and gets
drunk.

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:52.410
Esther walks downstairs, dressed up like an
adult and sits next to John, who doesn't understand

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:53.850
what's happening.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.529
Esther starts kissing him, but he recoils.

00:12:56.529 --> 00:13:00.279
He explains that he doesn't love her the way
him and Kate love each other.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:03.619
John tells her to go to her room, but she
tells him not to talk to her like she's a

00:13:03.619 --> 00:13:04.790
child.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.060
He says he will be calling the orphanage tomorrow
about her.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.839
Esther goes to her room and cries.

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:13.579
Meanwhile, Kate gets a call from a doctor
in the Saarne Institute.

00:13:13.579 --> 00:13:17.269
He recognizes Esther and tells her to get
her family out of the house, then to call

00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:18.439
the police.

00:13:18.439 --> 00:13:22.240
He tells her that Esther isn't a little girl,
but that she has some kind of hormone disorder

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.639
that only makes her look like a child.

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:26.810
She is in fact an adult woman.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:30.839
Esther was one of the most violent patients
in the hospital and when she fought her restraints,

00:13:30.839 --> 00:13:32.980
they left scars on her hands and neck.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.420
The doctor tells Kate that she has killed
at least 7 people.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.709
Kate is rushing to get home, confused how
she could fool them.

00:13:39.709 --> 00:13:43.630
Back at the house, Esther trashes her room
and removes all of her make-up used to hide

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.949
the fact that she's not a little girl.

00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:49.379
John goes to check on her and finds her paintings
all over the wall.

00:13:49.379 --> 00:13:52.949
Kate is calling him as she's driving home,
but the power goes out in the house before

00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:54.359
he can pick up.

00:13:54.359 --> 00:13:56.029
She calls the police.

00:13:56.029 --> 00:13:59.510
John finds a light and looks through the house,
when Esther stabs him.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:04.459
He's incapacitated, but alive, so she keeps
on stabbing him until she kills him.

00:14:04.459 --> 00:14:06.889
Max sees her and she goes after her next.

00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:11.759
Kate drives so fast toward the house that
she crashes into it and immediately goes upstairs.

00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:16.259
She finds John, then she realizes Max is in
trouble and tries to find her.

00:14:16.259 --> 00:14:19.999
She looks in her room, but when she doesn't
find her goes into the bathroom.

00:14:19.999 --> 00:14:22.299
Suddenly, Esther shoots her.

00:14:22.299 --> 00:14:26.259
Kate hides in her bedroom, but fortunately
Esther doesn't find her there, because she's

00:14:26.259 --> 00:14:28.350
hidding outside of the window.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.120
Max hides in the garden and Esther is coming
for her there, as Kate sees her from the glass

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.199
roof.

00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:37.259
Esther shoots after her again, then finds
Max and shoots after her too.

00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:40.910
Max escapes as Kate breaks the glass roof,
falling on top of Esther.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.769
A moment later, Max wakes Kate up.

00:14:43.769 --> 00:14:46.930
She takes the gun and picks her up, leaving
Esther behind.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:48.910
She walks out into the forest.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:52.799
The police arrives and enters the house, but
Esther isn't there.

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:55.489
Suddenly she's running after Kate and Max
with a knife.

00:14:55.489 --> 00:14:59.230
The two of them fall on the frozen lake and
they struggle, with Esther relentlessly going

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.620
after Kate.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.199
Max picks up the gun and shoots, breaking
the ice.

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:07.740
Both of them fall inside and struggle, until
Kate incapacitates Esther.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.499
As she's crawling out, Esther grabs her again,
begging her not to let her die, but Kate kicks

00:15:12.499 --> 00:15:16.149
her back in the lake.
