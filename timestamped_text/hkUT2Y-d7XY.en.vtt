00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.200
After letting Dominic Toretto escape from the&nbsp;
authorities, former LAPD officer Brian O'Conner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.800
flees from Los Angeles to escape prosecution.&nbsp;
He subsequently relocates to Miami and makes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.600
living participating in illegal street races,&nbsp;
driving a heavily modified silver Nissan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.120
Skyline GT-R R34. The races are organized&nbsp;
by his local mechanic friend Tej Parker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.200
After winning a race against drivers including&nbsp;
Suki, the police show up and Brian is arrested.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.440
He is taken into custody, but given a deal by his&nbsp;
former boss FBI Agent Bilkins and U.S. Customs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.360
Agent Markham to go undercover and bring down&nbsp;
Argentinian drug lord Carter Verone in exchange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.720
for clearance of his criminal record. Agent Monica&nbsp;
Fuentes, who has been undercover with Verone for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.760
a year, agrees to assist bringing Brian into the&nbsp;
organization. Brian agrees on the condition that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.400
he is given permission to choose his own partner.
This prompts Brian to travel to Barstow, where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.600
he enlists the help of childhood friend Roman&nbsp;
Pearce, who served jail time for housing stolen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.040
cars in a garage and currently makes a living as&nbsp;
a demolition derby driver. Roman, currently on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.640
parole, gets into a brief fight and blames Brian&nbsp;
for his arrest, but reluctantly agrees to help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.600
in exchange for the same deal Brian was offered.&nbsp;
For their mission they are issued two confiscated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.240
modified cars—a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VII&nbsp;
and a Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder GTS. Roman and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.000
Brian are later hired by Verone, who tasks the&nbsp;
duo to compete against rival drivers to obtain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.280
a package from a confiscated Ferrari located&nbsp;
in a lot. During the race, some of the hired&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.480
drivers crash while a few are injured by big rigs.&nbsp;
Markham, who mistakenly thinks that the duo is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.520
trying to run away, follows them to the lot. The&nbsp;
police ambush spooks Roman, who shoots at Markham&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.160
to help maintain his cover. Roman later confronts&nbsp;
the agent for interfering with the mission. Brian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.040
is able to salvage the situation, telling Bilkins&nbsp;
that Verone is allegedly aiming to launder his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.240
money in Miami before escaping on his private jet.
Brian and Roman challenge a pair of muscle car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.520
drivers they raced when competing for Verone's&nbsp;
hiring, for pink slips. Despite engine and power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.480
output handicaps, they win the race and obtain&nbsp;
the rival cars—a 1969 Yenko Camaro SYC and a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.640
1970 Dodge Challenger R/T. Roman later confronts&nbsp;
Brian about the constant threat of Verone's men;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.160
however, they patch up their differences&nbsp;
and focus on completing the mission.&nbsp;

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.640
At the VIP section of a nightclub, Brian and Roman&nbsp;
witness Verone torturing MPD Detective Whitworth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.280
into giving his men a window of opportunity&nbsp;
to make their getaway. The next morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.040
Monica warns them that they will be killed&nbsp;
once the drop is made. Despite this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.600
Markham refuses to call off the job, claiming&nbsp;
that it is their one chance to catch Verone.&nbsp;

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.560
On the day of the mission, Brian and Roman begin&nbsp;
transporting duffel bags of Verone's money with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.560
Verone's associates—Enrique and Roberto—riding&nbsp;
alongside to accompany them. Before the window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.320
is set, Whitworth decides to call in the police to&nbsp;
move in for an arrest of the drivers of the cars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.800
used by Brian and Roman. This results&nbsp;
in a high-speed chase across the city,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.080
with Bilkins and U.S. Customs also tracking&nbsp;
them. The duo leads the police to a warehouse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.840
where a "scramble" by dozens of street racers&nbsp;
organized by Tej disorients the police. Following&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.480
the scramble, the police manage to pull over&nbsp;
the Evo and the Eclipse, only to find out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.840
they were driven by Tej and Suki. As it turns&nbsp;
out, the duo had switched cars and had escaped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.000
in the two muscle cars they had won earlier.
As Brian approaches the destination point in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.960
his Camaro, Enrique tells him to take the Tarpon&nbsp;
Point Marina exit, instead of heading to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.120
airfield. Meanwhile, Roman gets rid of Roberto by&nbsp;
using an improvised ejector seat in his Challenger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.600
powered by nitrous oxide. At the airfield, Customs&nbsp;
agents have Verone's plane and convoy surrounded,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.400
only to discover they have been duped into a&nbsp;
decoy maneuver while Verone is at a boatyard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.360
several miles away. Verone reveals he knew Monica&nbsp;
was an undercover agent, and purposely gave her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.720
wrong information on the destination point. When&nbsp;
Brian arrives at the Marina, Verone forces Monica&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.760
onto his private yacht and orders Enrique to&nbsp;
kill Brian. As Enrique prepares to kill him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.120
Brian's ejector seat fails, but Roman suddenly&nbsp;
appears and helps Brian to incapacitate Enrique.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.000
Verone makes his escape, but Brian and&nbsp;
Roman use the Camaro to drive off a ramp,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.440
crashing on top of the yacht. Brian shoots and&nbsp;
wounds Verone, who is then arrested by Monica.&nbsp;

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.480
Markham grants Brian and Roman full pardons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.000
and in return Roman turns over the second half of&nbsp;
Verone's money. The two agree to stay in Miami,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.840
and Brian suggests opening a garage – funded by a&nbsp;
cut of Verone's money Roman kept for themselves.
