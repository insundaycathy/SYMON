Story Recapped here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.180
Today I'm going to show you a science fiction
drama film called The Shape of Water.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.620
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.090
Watch out and take careIn 1962, during the
Cold War, there exists Occam Aerospace Research

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.080
Center, a secret government laboratory in
Baltimore, Maryland.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.529
Elisa Esposito, a mute woman, works there
as a cleaner.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.410
She lives in a tiny apartment just above a
movie theatre.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.470
Elisa's life looks like a well-practised routine
because she does the same things every day.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.630
Ever since she was a child, Elisa already
had wounds on her neck, and she constantly

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.580
wonders where it came from.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.420
Her next-door neighbor, Giles, a middle-aged
illustrator, is one of Elisa's closest friends.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.420
Her neighbors are relatively nice to her as
she is a polite and friendly woman.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.320
She always takes the bus on her way to work,
and she is always welcomed by her closest

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.860
co-worker, Zelda Fuller.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.850
When other co-workers harass or intimidate
Elisa, Zelda always stands for her.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.430
Both of them are in charge of keeping rooms
and other facilities clean.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.010
Their work consists of going around offices
and rooms that higher executives use.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.330
On a typical work shift, one of the officials
announces that a new and valuable asset is

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.410
added to the research center, captured from
South America.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.970
A vessel is brought inside along with Colonel
Richard Strickland, the one in charge of the

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.030
project.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.100
As Elisa takes a closer look at the vessel,
something from the inside thumps it, grabbing

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.760
everyone's attention.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.930
Frightened and confused, the two ladies leave
the room and go about their work.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.110
While cleaning the men's restroom, Elisa and
Zelda meet Colonel Strickland, who immediately

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.330
gives off a very menacing vibe.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.799
A while later, they both hear a scream from
the room where the vessel is placed; Strickland

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.909
emerges to the hallway with two fingers missing
from his left hand, making the guards run

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.140
to his rescue.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.850
Elisa and Zelda are assigned to quickly clean
the bloody room where they keep the new "asset".

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.159
As Elisa splashes a bucket of water on the
floor, Colonel Strickland's two missing fingers

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.231
come out from a corner.

00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:57.360
Elisa carefully places it in a bag to send
it to the hospital.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.510
She walks toward the vessel and discovers
that the "asset" is an amphibian man.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.700
Fascinated by it, Elisa comes back to the
room the next day to see the amphibian man

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.900
once more.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.280
She knocks gently at the vessel, but the amphibian
man is now transferred to a small pool just

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.460
beside it.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.400
She calls its attention by offering it a boiled
egg.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.590
The chained creature comes closer; Elisa takes
a good look at it and places the egg in front

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.870
of the creature.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.290
In the next following days, Elisa continuously
sneaks into the room to spend time with it

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.360
as she feeds it boiled eggs.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.190
She even teaches it to use sign language,
and out of kindness, she plays music for it.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.290
She seems much happier now that she has met
the amphibian man.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.790
While dancing in
front of the vessel to entertain it, Doctor

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.200
Robert Hoffstetler, a scientist secretly a
Russian spy named Dimitri Mosenkov, sees Elisa

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.050
forming a close bond to the amphibian man.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.010
He reports this to his Soviet handlers, saying
that this creature is intelligent and can

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.010
communicate.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.640
Hoffstetler's bosses disregard this and orders
him to kill it before the Americans advance

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.960
their scientific research.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.129
During one of Elisa's meeting with the amphibian
man, she saw that it is chained to a small

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.890
platform where Strickland tortures it brutally.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.530
Meanwhile, Strickland's boss, General Hoyt,
wants to harvest the creature's body for further

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.210
research in space technology.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.650
Strickland manages to persuade Hoyt that they
should vivisect the creature's body.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.550
Elisa overhears their conversation, and it
devastates her.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.379
She asks help from Giles to liberate the creature.

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.989
She knows for sure that if she does not do
anything, the amphibian man will surely die.

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.660
He brushes her off, but she remains persistent;
finally, Giles agrees to be part of her plan

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.930
after he ponders that Elisa is his only real
friend and the only one that truly listens

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.700
to him.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.709
Hoffstetler meets with his bosses again.

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.460
They give him a poisonous injection to completely
kill the amphibian man; hesitant, Hoffstetler

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.459
has to obey their commands.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.660
In the meantime, Elisa and Giles orchestrate
their plan to pull off their escape plan for

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.170
the amphibian man; he uses his skills to decorate
a van and make a fake ID for himself.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.459
In the lab, Elisa becomes the unwanted attention
by Strickland after he deliberately spills

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.190
his glass of water, leaving her no choice
but to clean his office.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.720
Elisa walks out after Strickland harasses
her.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.750
Hoffstetler prepares the poison as Elisa initiates
her plan by turning cameras away from the

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.890
enclosure.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.769
At Strickland's office, Hoffstetler discovers
Elisa's plan and decides to help her.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.870
In the vessel room, Elisa is startled when
she saw Hoffstetler; he gives her the keys

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.100
to unchain the amphibian man.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.300
As Zelda leaves work, she senses that Elisa
is up to something and decides to check up

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.300
on her.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.660
Elisa sneaks the amphibian man into a laundry
hamper and pushes it around the facility while

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.990
Giles drives to their agreed spot.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.850
He enters the premises but is unsuccessful.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.540
Zelda finds out about Elisa's plan.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.530
Hoffstetler shuts down power with a bomb device
and uses a syringe on a guard who stopped

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.210
Giles upon entrance.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.590
They successfully get the amphibian man inside
the van, and they drive away.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.001
At the same time, Strickland and the security
team rush to the exit but are too late; this

00:04:56.001 --> 00:04:58.100
left him devastated and furious.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.150
Elisa, Giles, and the amphibian man safely
arrive at Elisa's apartment.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.250
The creature is kept in the bathtub with chemicals
that Hoffstetler instructed her to submerge

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.590
it in to maintain the amphibian man's health.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.610
The amphibian man regains his strength after
being out of the water for some time.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.240
Elisa plans to release him into a nearby canal
in several days when it is

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.620
most probable to rain to provide access to
the ocean.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.870
In the lab, Strickland and his team investigated
how the group managed to escape and "steal"

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.870
their asset.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.520
When Elisa and Zelda go to work the following
evening, Strickland interrogates them, but

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.009
he doubts that they are responsible for it.

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.350
He does not think that two women, one being
mute, can successfully perform a heist in

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.070
a high-security government lab.Giles falls
asleep at the apartment while watching over

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.690
the amphibian man; it gets out of the tub
and ends up eating one of Giles' cats.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.940
He startles the amphibian man; it ends up
scratching his arm, and it also runs out of

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.150
the apartment.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.150
It gets as far as the cinema downstairs before
Elisa, filled with worry, finds him and returns

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.750
to her apartment.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.110
Upon returning, the amphibian man touches
Giles on the head and wounded arm.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.350
One night, Elisa struggles to fall asleep;
she checks up on the amphibian man currently

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.000
living in her bathroom.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.050
The both of them look at each other longingly
and continue to have an intimate moment.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.889
For the first time in her life, Elisa feels
connected to "someone"; the love that she

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.199
so desperately desires is now present in her
life.

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.650
She thinks that her life has a new meaning
ever since the amphibian man arrived.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.350
Back at Hoffstetler's place, his Russian bosses
visit him.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.310
Already sensing danger, he hides a knife in
his defense, but he remains safe as they leave.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.310
He ends up getting shot by one of them.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.320
Giles wakes up one morning and discovers hair
growing on his head where there was previously

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.660
a balding spot.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:42.150
Also, it leaves him confused that the cut
on his arm is not completely healed.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.930
As Elisa and the amphibian man grow closer,
they make love; she even floods the bathroom

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.699
so they can swim together.

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:51.160
This causes the theatre to have leakages.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.780
The theatre owner complains about it, forcing
Giles to disturb Elisa and the amphibian man

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.699
in their precious moment.

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:02.380
Back at the lab, General Hoyt informs Strickland
that in 36 hours, he should recover their

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.130
asset, or his career and life will be over.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.569
Elisa arrives home one morning and realizes
that the amphibian man grows weaker by the

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:12.890
day; she decides that it is time to let it
go soon.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.380
She is unprepared for their depart that she
even imagines a world where the both of them

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.380
could be together freely.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.900
In this imaginary world, music fills the air,
she can sing, and the love of her life dances

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.120
with her.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.530
Meanwhile, Hoffstetler is shot by one of his
Russian bosses, but Strickland, waiting for

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:33.310
perfect timing, not only shoots and kills
both bosses but also shoots Hoffstetler, having

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.830
realized that he is a spy.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.910
Strickland tortures him to get information
about who got away with stealing their "asset".

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.900
Hoffstetler refuses to disclose any information.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.080
Already in much
pain, his last words are, "No names.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.460
No rankings.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.900
They just clean".

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.819
This makes Strickland think, and it gives
him a realization; he is more than shocked

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:55.569
to learn that the two cleaning ladies are
involved.

00:07:55.569 --> 00:08:00.080
He goes to Zelda's home to interrogate her
and her husband, Brewster.Strickland starts

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.729
to act manic as he is desperate to catch the
amphibian man.

00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:08.310
Out of fear, Zelda's husband confesses that
the amphibian man is with Elisa.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.710
Zelda scolds her husband and then calls Elisa
to warn her.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.310
Strickland, filled with angst, leaves to ransack
Elisa's apartment.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.780
Again, he arrives too late, but he sees a
calendar that reveals where she plans to release

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.490
the amphibian man.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:25.419
At the canal, they bid their goodbyes to the
amphibian man.

00:08:25.419 --> 00:08:29.759
Strickland reaches the canal, knocks Giles
down, then continues to shoot the amphibian

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.080
man and Elisa.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.829
Accepting their fate, they hold hands dramatically.

00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:36.860
Giles manages to get up and hit Strickland
down.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.039
The amphibian man gains its strength and heals
its own bullet wounds.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.850
Strickland is impressed and calls the amphibian
man a god before it slashes Strickland's throat

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:50.519
with its claws.As the police arrive, the amphibian
man takes Elisa into the water.

00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:54.059
This happens as Giles and Zelda watch in sadness
and despair.

00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:58.339
The amphibian man kisses Elisa underwater
and touches the wounds on her neck.

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:09.219
This instantly revives her; they remain underwater,
in love and happy that they can be together.
