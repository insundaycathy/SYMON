00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.480
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.410
Today, I'm going to explain a comedy and fantasy
film called "Beetlejuice."

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.690
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.690
Watch out and take care.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:14.230
In a charming country home, married couple
Barbara and Adam Maitland spend their vacation

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.259
at home.

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.500
The happy couple joke around but stop when
Barbara's cousin, Jane, arrives.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.350
Jane eagerly tells Barbara that she got an
offer on their house.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.150
Barbara turns her away, not interested in
selling her home.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.289
But Jane insists that the house is too big
for a couple without children.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.529
The notion has Barbara worrying how she and
Adam have no children.

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.769
Seeing her saddened face, Jane apologizes.

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.719
Barbara directs her cousin out the door and
says goodbye.

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.870
Adam opens the window in the basement but
sees Jane peeking in, telling him about the

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.870
offer.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.489
Adam tells her no and shuts the blinds.

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.350
Then, he asks Barbara to go to the store with
him to pick up some supplies.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.719
The couple gets in their car and drives to
town.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.899
Barbara mentions how Jane thinks their house
should be for a big family.

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.179
Adam jokes that maybe they should try starting
one during their vacation.

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:00.179
They arrive at their hardware store, where
Adam quickly gathers the supplies he needs.

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.420
As they're driving back, Adam asks Barbara
if she'd rather spend their vacation somewhere

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.950
else, but she's happy to stay at home.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.340
Adam spots a dog on the road, forcing Barbara
to swerve to the side.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.230
The car drops into the river with the couple
still inside.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.820
Back at home, Adam and Barbara enter, soaking
wet.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.550
They sit close to the fireplace to warm themselves.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.080
The fire bursts for a moment, startling the
two.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.590
Barbara sees her fingers lit as if they were
candles.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.700
She shakes the flames away, confused that
it didn't even hurt.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.600
With no memory of how they got back to the
house, Adam decides to retrace his steps.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.510
He exits the house only to land on a strange
desert with a giant sandworm closing in.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.650
Barbara pulls him back up the house, telling
him that he'd been gone for two hours.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.730
Inside the house, Barbara shows him that they
have no reflection in the mirror.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.760
Then, she points to a book on the side table
titled "Handbook for the Recently Deceased."

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.050
With all the strange things happening, Barbara
concludes that they didn't survive the car

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.330
crash.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.350
After the revelation, the couple turns to
the book for answers.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.370
Instead of spiritual answers, the book bears
technical instructions which confuse them.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.970
Beneath the house, a strange figure reads
the paper, taking particular interest in the

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.960
Maitlands listed on the obituary.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.540
In the attic, Barbara cleans the house but
gives up.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.550
She complains that there's no one to explain
to them what's going on.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.700
Adam suggests that they might be alone in
heaven, but Barbara retorts that heaven shouldn't

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.700
be dusty.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.340
They hear a car from outside and spots Jane
with her son, mourning for them.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.980
Adam tries to get her attention, but she doesn't
notice.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.050
Barbara gets frustrated at the book, but Adam
suggests that they have nothing to worry about

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.600
since they're dead.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.720
Unbeknownst to them, Jane has already sold
their house.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.320
On the next day, the Maitlands wake up to
a loud rumbling.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.830
The new homeowners have arrived: a real estate
developer, Charlie Deetz, his new wife Delia,

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.850
and his daughter, Lydia.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.480
Charlie is excited to live in a countryside
home, but Delia is displeased.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.960
Delia's mood lightens when her interior designer
friend, Otho, arrives to help her renovate

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.290
the house.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.040
Hearing the family's conversation downstairs,
Barbara laments that they're being punished.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.900
But Adam is optimistic, plotting a plan.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.760
Delia and Otho mock the house and mark areas
to make changes.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.310
They open the closet in the bedroom and turn
the light on.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.740
Inside, Barbara is hanging by her neck, then
pulls off her skin to add to the scare.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.680
Delia and Otho gasp and comment on how small
the closet is.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.599
They do not see Barbara at all.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.310
The two move on to the office, where Adam's
headless body is on the floor.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.660
Barbara stands beside him, holding his head
in one hand and a knife in the other.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.160
Again, the two don't see them.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.900
Charlie jumps in, surprising Delia and Otho.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.880
Charlie and Delia argue about the house, with
Delia insisting on redecorating.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.870
Charlie gives up and asks to at least leave
the office as it is.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.300
Hearing that Otho and Delia are heading to
the attic, Adam's headless body quickly rushes

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.800
upstairs and locks the door in front of them.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.140
In the office, Barbara is tired of seeing
the people invading their house.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.610
She heads to the back door and jumps into
the desert.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.550
Adam follows her and spots the giant sandworm
coming after them.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.630
The monster opens its mouth, but Barbara punches
it on the nose, making it recoil.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.680
The couple goes back inside, escaping the
monster.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.780
That evening, the Deetzes have takeouts for
dinner, much to Delia's disappointment.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.980
Charlie promises Lydia to turn the basement
into her darkroom while Delia complains about

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.110
her stepdaughter's mournful attitude.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.270
Charlie remains optimistic about their new
home, and Lydia admits that she likes how

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.560
the house is now.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.540
But Delia is stern with her decision, telling
them that they'll get rid of everything in

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.260
the house by tomorrow.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.650
On the next day, Barbara and Adam watch their
house get torn apart.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.590
Delia commands the workers while Lydia takes
photos outside.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.680
Adam sifts through the handbook, hoping to
find something that can help them.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.000
A piece of paper falls from the pages, advertising
a bio-exorcist named Betelgeuse.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.720
In the kitchen, Charlie prepares his tea,
looking forward to a relaxing day.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.930
But one of Delia's sculptures crashes onto
the window.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.120
The sculpture then drops, cornering Delia
onto a wall.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.389
Lydia continues to take photos, then freezes
when she spots the Maitlands in the attic

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:35.389
window.

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.830
She gets distracted by Jane's car pulling
up, and when she looks back to the windows,

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.530
the figures are gone.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.070
Barbara is stunned that Lydia looked at them,
but Adam doesn't believe that she saw them.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.240
Outside, Lydia learns from Jane that the Maitlands
drowned.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.780
She hands Lydia the skeleton key to open the
attic.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.180
Curious, Lydia marches up the attic.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.900
The Maitlands rush to block the door, wanting
the attic to be untouched.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.610
The T.V. in the attic switches on by itself,
showing an advertisement with a man in a cowboy

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.970
costume, claiming to be Betelgeuse.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.560
With the advertisement over, Adam plugs a
stick into the keyhole, ejecting the skeleton

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.480
key from the other side.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.530
After Lydia stops, Adam checks the handbook,
remembering what to do if there's an emergency.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.060
He uses chalk to draw a door on the wall,
but Barbara thinks it's silly, wondering if

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.500
they should try the bio-exorcist instead.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.530
Once Adam is done, he knocks on the door three
times and waits.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.030
The bricks on the wall open up, pouring green
light into the attic, which Lydia sees from

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.030
the door.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.800
The couple holds hands as they enter the mysterious
door.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.290
Later that day, Lydia interrupts Charlie's
birdwatching to tell him about the house being

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.290
haunted.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.540
He shoos her away, hoping to get some peace.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.510
Meanwhile, Barbara and Adam enter a strange
waiting room with even stranger people sitting

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.580
around.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.510
Adam knocks on the information desk, where
the informant complains that they're already

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.320
asking for help after only two months since
their deaths.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.800
She explains that they have to spend 125 years
in their house on Earth and only get three

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.020
sessions with their caseworker for help.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.610
Since they don't have an appointment, the
informant tells them to wait like the rest.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.460
With the Maitlands gone, Lydia finally enters
the attic, seeing Adam's miniature town model.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.419
Then, she sees the handbook and reads through
it.

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.050
In the waiting room, Adam and Barbara are
uncomfortable with the other dead people.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.800
The door opens, and a flattened man calls
the Maitlands.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.110
The couple heads inside and makes their way
to an odd funhouse-looking hallway, searching

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.420
for the sixth door.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.979
They pass by a door to the Lost Soul's Room,
where all the exorcised ghosts reside.

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.420
Adam and Barbara find the sixth door and enter,
finding a room with artistic furnishing.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.490
Barbara's eyes widened, realizing that they're
back home.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.270
The Deetzes have changed the interiors entirely.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.050
Behind them appears their caseworker, Juno,
who tells them that three months have passed.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.300
The couple explains that they're unhappy about
how the Deetzes wrecked their home.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.490
Juno scolds them for not studying the manual,
telling them that they can get the Deetzes

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.500
out on their own.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.640
When Barbara mentions Betelgeuse, Juno stops
her, warning her not to ask for his help.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.139
Betelgeuse used to be Juno's trouble-making
assistant until he left to be a freelance

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:48.419
bio-exorcist.

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:51.710
Rumors say that he's been living in the Maitlands'
cemetery recently and will only surface if

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.550
someone says his name three times.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.759
Juno insists for the Maitlands to deal with
the Deetzes on their own before disappearing.

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:01.400
With no other options, Adam is determined
to handle things by themselves.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.390
When they leave, a fly lands on the cemetery
in Adam's model town.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.790
A hand reaches out of the grass, offering
the fly a candy bar.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.650
The fly goes near and gets pulled underground.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:15.110
That evening, Charlie proposes to his old
boss, Max, to turn their new hometown into

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.580
a thriving community.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.310
But Max is not convinced, seeing that the
town is in the middle of nowhere.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.150
Upon ending the call, Charlie hears a moan
from outside.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.580
He opens the door and sees a figure under
a sheet.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.350
He scolds the figure, assuming that it's Lydia.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.420
In the hallway, Barbara whines about using
the sheets as if they're kids playing ghosts.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.229
Adam pushes her to continue.

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:37.400
In the master bedroom, the couple attempt
to wake and scare Delia.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.550
But she simply turns the T.V. off before going
back to sleep.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.400
The two exit the room surprised to see Lydia
taking photos of them in the hallway.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.069
Lydia mocks them, thinking that it's her dad
and stepmom.

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:50.560
When she checks the polaroids, she sees that
there are no feet under the sheets.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.040
She confronts them, but instead of being scared,
she's curious.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.440
The Maitlands take off the sheets, frustrated
that they can't scare them.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.070
Adam questions why Lydia can see them but
the others can't.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.130
Having read the handbook, Lydia figures that
it's because she's unusual.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.410
In the attic, the couple explains that they
wanted to scare them, so her family leaves

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.510
the house.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.020
Lydia chuckles, knowing that her dad won't
let the house go even if it's haunted.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.410
Lydia beams at the idea of talking to real
ghosts but tells them that they need to practice

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:15.410
more.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.300
On the next day, Lydia tries to convince Delia
about the ghosts, but Delia refuses to listen

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.080
as she's busy preparing dinner for their guests
tonight.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.500
In the attic, Adam checks the handbook for
other ideas when the model's cemetery lights

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.500
up.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.080
Barbara wonders if it's Betelgeuse, and Adam
encourages her to repeat his name.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.060
After she says it the third time, they're
transported into the small cemetery where

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.950
they find shovels on a gravestone.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.250
They start digging into foam and cardboard
layers until they reach the coffin.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.110
The coffin begins shaking, and Betelgeuse
comes out.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.910
Scared, the couple runs away, but Betelgeuse
flies and blocks their way.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.880
He kisses Barbara and asks Adam if he has
a chance with his wife.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.800
The man annoys the couple until Barbara tells
him that they just want people out of their

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.800
house.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.019
When asked if he can be scary, Betelgeuse
warps his face, horrifying the two.

00:08:56.019 --> 00:08:59.370
Barbara pulls her husband away, regretting
having called the strange man.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.630
Tired of his attitude, the couple makes to
leave, but Betelgeuse insists on making a

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:03.920
deal with them.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.710
Barbara yells "home" thrice, and finally,
they're out of the model.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.490
Betelgeuse gets angry, seeing that they're
gone.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.089
Barbara insists that they can't let Betelgeuse
near Lydia.

00:09:12.089 --> 00:09:15.029
Instead, she has an idea of what to do tonight.

00:09:15.029 --> 00:09:18.660
That evening, the Deetz family share dinner
with their guests, including Otho, who talks

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.660
about the paranormal.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.420
This prompts Lydia to announce that she'd
seen the ghosts in the house, but Delia disregards

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.779
it as a joke.

00:09:24.779 --> 00:09:28.760
Suddenly, Delia starts singing The Banana
Boat Song to everyone's surprise.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.380
Delia gets up and starts dancing along to
the song.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.310
Charlie and the rest of the adults start performing
along, much to their own confusion.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.270
Lydia laughs at the song and dance number.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.500
The adults return to their seats, where their
shrimp cocktails turn into hands that reach

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.850
out and grab their faces before pushing them
off their chairs.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.430
Adam and Barbara rush to the attic, excited
about their successful performance.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.330
They check the window, expecting the guests
to run out of fear.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.800
But nobody comes out.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.170
Instead, Lydia tells them that the adults
want to meet them.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.580
Downstairs, the adults are ecstatic about
the event, seeing a financial gain in discovering

00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.860
the ghosts.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.790
Lydia announces that the Maitlands refuse
to join them, disappointed that they're not

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:03.790
scared.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.720
Exasperated, the guests leave.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.620
Angered, Delia marches up the attic to speak
to the ghosts.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.260
The door opens, letting them inside, but the
Maitlands aren't there.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.230
Charlie takes an interest in the model town
while Otho takes the handbook.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.931
Delia ushers everyone out of the room, hoping
that the Maitlands will return if they're

00:10:17.931 --> 00:10:19.220
left alone.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.550
Heading down the steps, Delia's hand slides
on the banister then hears a rattling of the

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.550
snake.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.680
Delia looks down and sees the fence turn into
a snake's body that looms over them with a

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.140
demonic face.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.560
The demon snake terrifies Delia and pushes
Otho down the steps.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.120
It turns its head to Charlie and dangles him
by the leg.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.160
The frightened Lydia begs for it to stop.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.870
The snake drops Charlie to the floor and comes
after Lydia, but Barbara finds them just in

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:40.870
time.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.940
She calls Betelgeuse's name three times, forcing
him away.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.510
Lydia accuses Barbara of the events and leaves.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:50.000
Back at the attic, the Maitlands find Betelgeuse
in the model town, confronting him for what

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.260
he did to the Deetzes.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.100
Betelgeuse is frustrated but wonders about
Lydia.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.830
Barbara picks him up, warning him to leave
the girl alone.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:00.490
Suddenly, a demonic bar appears in the model
town, filled with ladies.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:04.660
Betelgeuse happily goes in as Adam and Barbara
are summoned to Juno's office.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:09.029
In Juno's office, Juno berates them for getting
themselves photographed, releasing Betelgeuse,

00:11:09.029 --> 00:11:10.769
and letting Otho steal the handbook.

00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:14.380
Juno explains that they cannot let the living
have proof of life after death.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.130
Back at the house, Charlie and Delia dread
their meeting with Max.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.180
Otho, however, is confident, claiming to be
an expert on the supernatural.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:26.300
Inside, Lydia writes a goodbye letter, having
decided on throwing herself over the bridge.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.620
In Juno's office, Juno pressures the couple
to get rid of the Deetzes and asks them what

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.930
they'll do next time.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.399
The couple warps their faces into monstrous
forms, satisfying Juno enough to allow them

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:35.830
to continue.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.230
In the attic, Lydia searches for the ghosts.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.610
She hears Betelgeuse from the model town asking
her to say his name to summon him.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:45.800
He uses charades to tell her his name, showing
her a giant beetle and an orange juice.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.290
Lydia finally guesses his name but refuses
to say it for the third time, realizing that

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.100
he's the snake from earlier.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.089
In the underworld, Barbara has a change of
heart, realizing that she cares for Lydia.

00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:58.019
They walk back into the attic just as Lydia
is about to repeat Betelgeuse.

00:11:58.019 --> 00:12:01.710
They stop her but seeing their monstrous forms,
Lydia gets scared.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.800
Barbara changes back to her human face and
learns that Betelgeuse promised to take her

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.700
to the afterlife to find them.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.899
Lydia admits that she wants to die.

00:12:07.899 --> 00:12:11.680
The couple comforts her, promising that they'll
accept her family so she can visit them whenever

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.029
she wants.

00:12:13.029 --> 00:12:16.430
Their conversation is interrupted when Charlie
and Otho storm in, carrying the model town

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:17.670
out of the attic.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.360
Downstairs, Charlie presents his supernatural
town idea to Max.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.880
Seeing that Max is displeased, Charlie asks
Lydia to invite the ghosts, but she claims

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.060
that the Maitlands will return only if they
promise not to make fun of them anymore.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.760
With Lydia's news dampening the mood, Delia
diverts the attention to Otho, who reveals

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.149
that he has the handbook.

00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:36.910
Otho asks for the ghosts' personal belongings,
and Delia gets an idea.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.420
Later that night, Otho leads a seance with
the Maitlands' wedding clothes on the table.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.339
Otho chants a spell, making the lights go
out and thunder raging outside.

00:12:44.339 --> 00:12:47.480
Barbara first appears in her dress, but her
body rots quickly.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.990
Adam appears in his wedding suit, holding
Barbara's hand, but her fingers deteriorate

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:52.120
in his touch.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.250
The adults are both frightened and in awe.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.089
Lydia begs them to stop, seeing that the Maitlands
are dying.

00:12:57.089 --> 00:13:00.589
But Otho has finished the spell, which was
an exorcism instead of a seance.

00:13:00.589 --> 00:13:03.579
Desperate, Lydia runs to ask Betelgeuse for
help.

00:13:03.579 --> 00:13:07.670
He tells Lydia that he can help, but she must
agree to marry him to stay in the living world.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.740
Lydia cringes at the thought but seeing that
Adam is rotting too, Lydia gathers up the

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.740
courage and summons Betelgeuse.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.529
The model starts to shake, revealing a full-sized
Betelgeuse.

00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:19.399
He releases an inflatable hammer in front
of Max and his wife, not noticing the test

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:20.910
of strength stand behind them.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.500
Betelgeuse slams the hammer down, launching
the couple into the ceiling.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.160
Betelgeuse releases the Maitlands from the
spell before grabbing Otho, turning his clothes

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.080
into a baby blue suit, scaring him off.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.180
Lydia goes to her parents, who hug her protectively.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.029
Betelgeuse joins in the hug, putting snakes
on Charlie's hand as dowry and changes into

00:13:37.029 --> 00:13:38.720
a purple wedding suit.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.720
He turns to Lydia, who is now wearing a red
wedding dress.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.940
He summons her as he prepares the ceremony
for their union.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.459
Delia's sculptures come to life, trapping
the parents to bear witness to the union.

00:13:48.459 --> 00:13:51.360
The Maitlands struggle to get up, weakened
from their condition.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.550
A small creature appears to officiate the
wedding.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.899
Betelgeuse stops it from saying his name but
lets the ceremony proceed.

00:13:56.899 --> 00:14:00.690
Betelgeuse pretends to think twice over the
marriage but says yes anyway.

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:04.180
Lydia tries to say no, but the groom covers
her mouth, copying her voice to say yes to

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.430
the wedding.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.460
With their strength returned, Adam says Betelgeuse's
name, but his teeth snap off.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.100
The dismembered mouth attempts to say the
name, and Betelgeuse stomps it away.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.170
He sends Adam into the model town, leaving
Barbara to say his name.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.500
Betelgeuse puts a zipper on her mouth, but
she's still able to say his name the second

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.370
time before being shut with a metal plate.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.280
While Betelgeuse searches his pocket for the
rings, Adam gets in the model truck.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.740
Betelgeuse sends Barbara to the supernatural
desert before putting a ring on Lydia's finger.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.730
Adam crashes the model truck onto Betelgeuse's
shoes to distract him.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.440
The ceiling breaks, revealing Barbara, now
in control of the sandworm.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.620
The sandworm devours Betelgeuse before plunging
into the floor.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.130
The officiant disappears, and the night is
finally over.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.750
Months have passed, and Lydia happily leaves
school.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.320
She returns to the house, which has now been
returned to the Maitlands' design.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.529
She gives Adam new paint supplies and a photo
of the new town hall.

00:14:51.529 --> 00:14:55.010
Lydia tells them how she refused to dissect
a frog at school, then shies away when Barbara

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.860
asks her about her math test.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.959
She smiles coyly, announcing that she got
an A.

00:14:58.959 --> 00:15:03.540
With her excellent grades, Lydia is awarded
by the house coming alive with music.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:07.510
Hearing the music downstairs, Charlie smiles,
knowing that Lydia did well.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.060
Delia scares him with a new sculpture, grinning
at his reaction.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.990
Meanwhile, Betelgeuse is stuck in the afterlife
waiting room where the rest of the souls treat

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.090
him coldly.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.200
He steals a witch doctor's ticket to allow
him to be next in line.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.520
But the man shrinks his head as revenge.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:29.930
With the Maitlands and the Deetzes living
together in harmony, Lydia dances in 

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:34.529
the air, celebrating her new and happy life.
