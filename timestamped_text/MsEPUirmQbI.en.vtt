00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.600
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain a mystery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.000
thriller, and sci-fi film called "Mute."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.600
As a child, Leo Beiler had suffered from a&nbsp;
swimming accident that severely damaged his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.280
larynx. The doctor tells his Amish mother&nbsp;
that she might be able to save Leo's voice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.800
but the religious parent refuses an&nbsp;
operation, arguing that God will heal her son.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.480
By 2035, Leo still clings to some of his&nbsp;
Amish roots and avoids the use of technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.800
He has taken up wood carving and&nbsp;
drawing as a hobby while working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.720
as a bartender at a Berlin strip club at night.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.560
Before going to work one night, he goes&nbsp;
on a date with his girlfriend Naadirah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.200
who works as a cocktail waitress at the&nbsp;
same bar. While enjoying their meal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.800
She gives him an outdated phone to help&nbsp;
him communicate. Naadirah asserts that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.560
device would make things easier for them.&nbsp;
After Leo manages to turn the phone on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.560
Naadirah shows him how to activate the camera&nbsp;
and make a video. When the footage shows up on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.880
the monitors around them, Leo tries to take the&nbsp;
phone and hide his face. Naadirah tells him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.480
stop hiding because he's beautiful, calling&nbsp;
him "da stargo tora, the black of her eyes."

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.680
At the bar, Leo tosses a small spherical wood&nbsp;
carving to Naadirah. She says it's the best she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.680
has seen, but she asks him to make something&nbsp;
more elaborate, like a seahorse. While she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.200
serving drinks, two rude customers start harassing&nbsp;
her, so Luba urges her to take a break with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.600
Outside the bar, Luba asks her how&nbsp;
much money she has saved so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.280
When she says she still doesn't have&nbsp;
enough, he asks her why Leo isn't helping.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.160
Naadirah tells him that Leo has&nbsp;
no idea why she's saving up money.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.920
Back inside the bar, Stu, the man harassing&nbsp;
Naadirah, has become more aggressive and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.760
attempts to shove some money in her dress. Leo&nbsp;
witnesses the incident and drags Stu to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.400
bathroom. While Naadirah begs him to let the&nbsp;
customer go, another man arrives to help Stu.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.720
Naadirah breaks up the fight and tells Leo to calm&nbsp;
down because she can't afford to lose her job.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.520
Leo soon simmers down and lets the&nbsp;
bouncers deal with the rude customers.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.760
After the bouncers escort Stu and his friend&nbsp;
Rob out of the bar, Nadirah receives a call. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.000
writes down an address on her hand, so Leo offers&nbsp;
his scratchpad. Maksim, the bar owner, calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.600
Leo to his office and warns him that he'll get&nbsp;
fired if he ever stirs up trouble for him again.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.840
While Leo tries to get some sleep, he hears&nbsp;
someone talking outside his apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.720
When she opens the door, she sees Naadirah sitting&nbsp;
on the floor. Naadirah says she needs to tell him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.200
about someone in her life. Leo starts to worry,&nbsp;
so she assures him that she's not leaving him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.040
Leo uses the scratchpad to say that nothing&nbsp;
else is important as long as she's with him.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.880
As they relax inside Leo's apartment, Naadirah&nbsp;
notices him drawing on his scratchpad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.720
so she asks if she could take a look. Leo&nbsp;
shows her a design of a bed and takes her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.640
his workshop so she can see the parts that he&nbsp;
already finished. Naadirah says that it looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.960
like something from a fairy tale. Naadirah tells&nbsp;
Leo that she loves him so much, but she's worried&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.880
because there are things he still doesn't know&nbsp;
about her. As Naadirah walks out of the workshop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.200
Leo stops her and kisses her, silently assuring&nbsp;
her that he loves her no matter what. Leo makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.880
love with Naadirah at the workshop, but when he&nbsp;
wakes up in the morning, she's no longer with him.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.080
Elsewhere, Cactus Bill and his partner Duck&nbsp;
perform surgery on a man who was shot in the leg&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.960
with a revolver. After removing five bullets,&nbsp;
Cactus tells Duck to sew up the victim's leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.480
Cactus, who is eager to leave Germany, hints to&nbsp;
Maksim's thug, Akim, that he will be gone soon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.240
so they have to avoid getting shot next&nbsp;
time. Akim tells him that Maksim is still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.680
preparing his documents, but he's having some&nbsp;
difficulties because Cactus has gone AWOL.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.800
While Leo eats at a diner, Cactus recognizes&nbsp;
him as the bartender at Maksim's bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.240
Cactus recalls that he fought with Stu&nbsp;
and Rob some nights ago, so he warns Leo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.280
not to fight with them again because he&nbsp;
needs their help to get out of Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.880
Leo ignores his demand and leaves him with a&nbsp;
drawing of his face with a willy on his forehead.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.760
When Leo goes to work again that night, Naadirah&nbsp;
is nowhere to be found. As he looks around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.640
bar, Luba also asks him where Naadirah is. The&nbsp;
manager introduces Leo to a man named Nicky,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.680
notifying him that he drinks for free because&nbsp;
he runs Makim's business across the street.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.600
While he prepares Nicky's drink, Stu and Rob&nbsp;
order two vodkas and tells him there are no hard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.320
feelings about their spat. However, Leo gets irked&nbsp;
when Stu makes suggestive comments about Naadirah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.040
so he throws a bottle of vodka on Stu's face. Leo&nbsp;
then jumps over the bar and charges at Stu and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.680
friend. During the scuffle, Leo accidentally&nbsp;
hits a waitress with his elbow. While Leo is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.480
distracted, Stu slams a table on his face. After&nbsp;
the fight, Maksim tells Leo that he's fired.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.600
At home, Leo uses the phone to contact&nbsp;
Naadirah but receives no reply. He takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.920
a picture of Naadirah out of the frame and leaves&nbsp;
the apartment. As Leo roams the streets aimlessly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.720
he suddenly sees Luba, so he follows him to a&nbsp;
parlor. When he gets to the door, a female voice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.560
asks him what he needs, so he asks for Naadirah.&nbsp;
When the woman tells him that he is in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.160
wrong place, he asks for Luba. Inside, a woman&nbsp;
leads Leo to a room, where he waits for Luba.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.800
When Luba arrives, he asks him about Naadirah.&nbsp;
Luba tells Leo that she probably dumped him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.280
Luba tries to seduce Leo, so he resists and&nbsp;
knocks over a lamp. Luba gets offended by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.360
his reaction and starts taunting him, saying&nbsp;
Naadirah has been hiding secrets from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.400
Akim and another bouncer named Gunther hear&nbsp;
the noise and knock on the door. Luba tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.000
them that Leo's not interested in his services,&nbsp;
so the bouncers throw him out of the brothel.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.920
While he's at home, Leo receives a&nbsp;
message that appears to be from Naadirah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.600
saying she's in the hacker's hall. While he&nbsp;
searches for Naadirah in the hacker's hall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.160
Stu sees him on the security cameras and confronts&nbsp;
him. Rob points a gun at him, telling him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.720
leave. He shows them a picture of Naadirah, but&nbsp;
Stu tells him that they're not interested in her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.640
While he tries to communicate with them using the&nbsp;
scratchpad, he remembers that Naadirah had written&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.560
something down on the pad a few nights ago. He&nbsp;
shades the paper with the pencil to find out what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.080
Naadirah wrote and soon learns that Naadirah&nbsp;
scribbled the address of a man named Oswald.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.840
At a bowling range, Cactus tells&nbsp;
Duck that he and his daughter, Josie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.800
have already been recorded into the system to&nbsp;
prepare them for their departure. Duck tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.720
him that he'll be sticking around because he's&nbsp;
enjoying his job installing body implants. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.640
some high school girls catch Duck's attention,&nbsp;
he starts making lewd comments about them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.840
His remarks make Cactus feel uneasy,&nbsp;
so he tells Duck to just keep bowling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.320
When Duck mentions Josie, he gets upset and&nbsp;
squeezes Duck's hand between the bowling balls.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.560
Leo goes to address on his scratchpad&nbsp;
and knocks on the door. When Oswald&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.240
opens it, Leo immediately enters&nbsp;
the apartment and looks around.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.280
Leo comes across a room with numerous photos&nbsp;
on display. Oswald guesses that Leo works for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.640
Nicky and takes some money, telling him that&nbsp;
Nicky needs to get a better class of workers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.560
if he wants to keep his sideline running.&nbsp;
As he browses through the images, Leo sees a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.840
picture with Naadirah's name on it, although he&nbsp;
can't see her face due to the lack of lighting.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.880
Oswald tells Leo that he already paid&nbsp;
Naadirah. However, Leo gets enraged when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.800
Oswald refers to Naadirah as a thieving&nbsp;
call girl. He shoves Oswald to the bed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.320
and stuffs the money inside his mouth, but&nbsp;
he seems to be enjoying it, so he leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.400
Later, he recalls taking an order from a&nbsp;
man named Nicky at the bar the other night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.720
so he surmises that Oswald must be referring&nbsp;
to the same man. Leo soon receives a cryptic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.320
message with a photo of a man and a little&nbsp;
girl on his phone, asking him if he knows them.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.320
At the parlor, Duck fools around with a girl&nbsp;
named Kanwal, pretending that she's underage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.040
Kanwal usually helps Cactus babysit Josie, but&nbsp;
since she's occupied, he asks another woman named&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.480
Tanya to watch over his daughter while he's away.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Leo is watching the parlor to see if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.360
Nicky turns up. When he sees Nicky riding a taxi,&nbsp;
he takes Maksim's vintage car and attempts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.240
drive it. He struggles at first, but he manages&nbsp;
to start it. As he strives to follow the taxi,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.960
Leo swipes several cars and slams into a garbage&nbsp;
truck. Soon, Leo sees Nicky getting out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.360
vehicle with Tanya and Josie. Leo follows them&nbsp;
into a restaurant and notices Josie drawing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.760
so he starts sketching on his pad. Nicky gets&nbsp;
annoyed with Leo and tells Tanya to take Josie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.680
out of the restaurant. As they leave, Leo&nbsp;
hands Josie a sketch of a bear and a cub.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.000
With Josie out of the way, Leo turns&nbsp;
to Nicky and asks him about Naadirah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.320
Nicky claims that Naadirah doesn't work for him.&nbsp;
Leo shows him the dark photo with Naadirah's name,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.400
but Nicky doesn't seem to know anything about&nbsp;
it. Nicky tells Maksim's men to escort him out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.760
of the restaurant, so Leo asks him&nbsp;
if Maksim knows about his sideline.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.360
Before leaving the restaurant, Leo throws&nbsp;
the money Oswald gave him on Nicky's table.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.880
Leo gets frustrated by the lack of&nbsp;
progress on his search for Naadirah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.240
but he gets an idea when he hears a&nbsp;
man ordering food on his mobile phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.600
Leo soon places an order at a vending machine&nbsp;
in the hopes of tracking down the number that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.080
sends him cryptic messages. When the machine asks&nbsp;
for his number, he tries to type in the digits,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.920
but a man playing video games in the corner&nbsp;
tells him that he's supposed to use his voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.240
Leo tells him that he's mute, so the man decides&nbsp;
to help him and recites the number to the machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.240
The automated vending system is unable to&nbsp;
track the phone, but it displays an address.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.920
When he goes to the address on the vending&nbsp;
machine, a crossdresser approaches him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.880
When they get inside the apartment, the&nbsp;
crossdresser tells him that he's impressed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.960
that Leo was able to scare Nicky. He reveals&nbsp;
that he once thought that Leo and Naadirah were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.720
only trying to pull a disappearing act, but he is&nbsp;
now convinced that Leo is really looking for her.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.480
He removes his wig, revealing that he's Luba. Leo&nbsp;
realizes that Luba is also the woman in the dark&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.360
picture. Luba tells him that he was moonlighting&nbsp;
to help Naadirah raise money. Luba is infuriated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.880
that Naadirah took the money that he earned&nbsp;
and left him without saying a word. He now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.880
fears that Maksim would come for him because of&nbsp;
her sideline with Nicky. Leo pleads with Luba&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.880
to help him find Nicky, but he shocks Leo with&nbsp;
an electric device, knocking him unconscious.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.680
When he wakes up, Luba is gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.040
He sees the phone number of Naadirah's mother&nbsp;
on the refrigerator and tries calling it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.320
Leo writes down the number and looks up&nbsp;
the mother's address using a phone book.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.120
Cactus meets with Duck at a cafe to&nbsp;
tell him that Maksim wants them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.800
squeeze information out of Nicky. Cactus&nbsp;
notes that Leo had been talking to Nicky,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.200
but Duck surmises that they only had small talk.&nbsp;
Cactus deduces that Leo is looking for Naadirah.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.240
Soon, Gunther and Akim bring Nicky to Cactus'&nbsp;
house so they could torture him for information.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.800
Maksim arrives and tells Cactus that his documents&nbsp;
will be ready the next day. Maksim shows them the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.800
note that Leo wrote to Nicky and asks them to find&nbsp;
out what kind of deal they have with each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.840
Duck and Cactus start preparing to&nbsp;
torture Nicky as soon as Maksim leaves.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.320
After going through several phone books, Leo&nbsp;
finally finds the address of Naadirah's mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.640
and immediately leaves his apartment to see&nbsp;
her. Meanwhile, Cactus visit's Jack's clinic and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.400
finds that he's hidden a camera in the dressing&nbsp;
room to watch young girls change their clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:31.040
When he finds Duck, Cactus tells him to stay away&nbsp;
from Josie, noting that he saw the hidden camera.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.680
Duck claims that he just installed them, and he&nbsp;
uses them for his job. Cactus doesn't believe him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.920
so he hits him repeatedly and tells him to stop&nbsp;
treating children in his clinic. Cactus threatens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.320
to expose him the moment he thinks that Duck is&nbsp;
abusing young girls, so Duck promises to stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.000
Cactus soon receives a call from Maksim, who&nbsp;
informs him that his documents are ready.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.320
When Leo reaches the apartment of Naadirah's&nbsp;
mother, he shows her a picture of Naadirah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.240
so she invites him in. The mother struggles&nbsp;
to communicate with Leo as she doesn't speak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.080
English or German. When Leo shows her the&nbsp;
message with the image of a man carrying a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.200
child, the mother tells him that the&nbsp;
little girl is Naadirah's daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.840
She also notifies him that Cactus&nbsp;
had taken Naadirah by force.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.080
Back When Leo had taken Naadirah to his&nbsp;
workshop, Cactus was observing them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.760
Cactus drugged their tea and waited until they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.440
were asleep. He took Naadirah while she&nbsp;
was unconscious and put her into his car.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.080
Meanwhile, Cactus and Duck go to the mall&nbsp;
to celebrate Cactus' imminent departure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.720
Cactus tells Duck that he's leaving the&nbsp;
house to him so that he could take over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.400
the surgeries for Maksim. Duck invites&nbsp;
him to go to the parlor, but Cactus says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.560
he has to fetch Josie first because Kanwal is&nbsp;
leaving early. As they walk out of the mall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.480
Duck confesses that he's been sending messages&nbsp;
to Leo to mess with him. Duck sends a message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.840
to Leo on their way to the parlor, telling&nbsp;
him that Cactus is with Maksim at the bar.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.280
As Cactus waits in the parlor,&nbsp;
he receives a call from Maksim,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.440
so he decides to take Josie with him to Maksim's&nbsp;
bar instead of leaving her with a babysitter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.680
Leo arrives at the bar using Maksim's car. The&nbsp;
bouncers recognize the car and approach him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.760
so Leo slams a car door into one of them and hits&nbsp;
another with a carved wooden bedpost that he made.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.640
Inside the bar, he knocks out Akim and Gunther&nbsp;
while Maksim is in his office preparing Cactus'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.960
documents. Leo soon reaches Maksim's office and&nbsp;
hits Maksim with a statue as he was counting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.680
money. Leo takes Cactus's papers and leaves&nbsp;
the bar. Cactus arrives and sees the mess,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.360
thinking that there has been a gang war. He&nbsp;
sees Maksim lying on the floor and asks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.200
what happened. Maksim warns him that Leo was&nbsp;
looking for him and has taken his documents.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.000
Cactus hurries home and tells Duck to meet him&nbsp;
at his house. Leo soon arrives at Cactus' house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.160
and breaks in using the wooden bedpost. When he&nbsp;
gets to the basement, he sees Nicky on a gurney&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.880
and sets him free. When Cactus arrives home,&nbsp;
he takes Josie to her room and locks her in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.920
He heads to the basement and pulls out a&nbsp;
knife as he walks slowly towards the door.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.560
Back when Cactus kidnapped Naadirah, he took her&nbsp;
to the basement and wrapped a plastic bag over her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.280
head. He berates Naadirah for attempting to leave&nbsp;
with Josie. Cactus says he'll kill Naadirah before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.680
he'd let her take Josie away from him. Naadirah&nbsp;
struggles to breathe as he continues to scold her.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.800
As Leo looks around in the basement, he comes&nbsp;
across a locked wooden gate. Suddenly, he hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.960
banging on the stairs and sees Nicky tumbling&nbsp;
down. Cactus comes down and throws Leo the key&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.080
to the gate. When he gets inside, he opens the&nbsp;
freezer only to find that it's empty. However, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.160
uncovers a body wrapped in plastic in the corner&nbsp;
and finds out that it was Naadirah. He carries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.800
Naadirah's body and walks toward the stairs, but&nbsp;
Cactus stops him. He puts Naadirah's body down on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.720
the gurney and holds out his hands, waiting for&nbsp;
Cactus to hit him. Cactus tries to beat him with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.120
the wooden post, but Leo fends off the attack.&nbsp;
Cactus drops the bedpost to pull out his hunting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.120
knife and tries to stab Leo, but Leo blocks it and&nbsp;
twists Cactus' arm to point the knife toward him.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.600
Leo slowly plunges the knife towards Cactus'&nbsp;
neck until he lays flat on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.360
He removes the plastic covering Naadirah's&nbsp;
body and brings her outside the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.160
Duck soon arrives at Cactus' home and discovers&nbsp;
Cactus bleeding on the floor. However, he refuses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.080
to help him and castigates him for killing&nbsp;
Naadirah. Duck leaves Cactus bleeding, saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.920
that he should've treated him better. Duck takes&nbsp;
Josie out of her room and takes her to the jeep.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.880
Moments later, Duck sees Leo outside the house&nbsp;
and knocks him out. He takes him back to his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.880
clinic and installs an electronic voice box&nbsp;
in his throat. After stitching Leo's throat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.040
Duck tells him to apologize for killing his&nbsp;
Cactus. Leo doesn't say a word, so he takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.760
him out on a trip. When Leo wakes up inside the&nbsp;
jeep, Duck introduces Josie to him as he drives.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.440
When Duck stops by a restaurant to order some&nbsp;
food, Josie shows him her attempt at drawing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:08.000
a bear on the sketch he gave her days ago. Duck&nbsp;
keeps driving until they get to a bridge. He takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.160
Leo to a bench and asks Leo if he recognizes&nbsp;
the place. Duck discloses that they are at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.520
the bridge depicted in the picture of Naadirah,&nbsp;
adding that he was the one who took the photo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.520
After lambasting Leo over the death of his&nbsp;
partner, Duck breaks a lock on the bridge's guard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:25.200
rail and opens it. Duck asks Leo to apologize for&nbsp;
killing Cactus once again, but Leo still refuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.880
Leo takes a deep breath and gives Duck a bear&nbsp;
hug. He then walks toward the edge of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.800
bridge while lifting Duck and jumps to water.&nbsp;
Leo maintains his grip on Duck until he runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.120
out of breath. When Duck stops breathing, Leo&nbsp;
shoves him down and swims back to the surface.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.240
When Josie calls out to him from the bridge, he&nbsp;
waves his hand, asking the child to stay back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.240
He finally manages to use his voice to tell the&nbsp;
child to stay away from the edge of the bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.080
When Leo gets back up on the bridge, he tells&nbsp;
Josie that he'll take her to her grandma.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.520
When they stop by a restaurant, Leo sees&nbsp;
the spherical wood carving he gave Naadirah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.720
on Josie's wrist. Josie smiles at&nbsp;
Leo when he gives her another one.
