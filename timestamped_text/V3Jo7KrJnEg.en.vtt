00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.010
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.510
Today I will show you a horror, mystery film
from 2017, titled Rings.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.560
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.889
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.509
A video is playing on a monitor in plane that's
about to make its descent.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.410
A man is getting nervous, when a woman next
to him starts talking to him.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.260
He immediately tells her about a videotape
that supposedly kills you in 7 days after

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.380
you've watched it.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.310
The man had met a woman precisely a week ago,
who sent him said video.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.869
He found an old VCR and played the tape.

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.110
When it was over, his phone ringed and a girl's
voice told him that he has 7 days.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.510
After the call, everything had became strange.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.080
Suddenly, his nose starts bleeding and he
goes to the toilet.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.950
A second woman appears next to the first one
and she tells her about the guy.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.950
He is in the toilet, when strange things start
happening.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.830
The second woman bangs on the door and asks
him if he'd made a copy of the tape, saying

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.380
that she's also seen it.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.649
All of a sudden, the strange video begins
appearing on all the monitors on the plane.

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.039
Black liquid is running out od the toilet
and the man freaks out, trying to get away

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:59.039
from it.

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.420
The plane begins to fall, as a long-haired
girl can be seen coming out of the monitors.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.400
Two years later, Sky is at a bazaar and she
sees a VCR.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.540
Gabriel approaches and tells her that he'll
buy it.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.750
The guy selling the vintage things had told
him that it belonged to the man that died

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.170
in the plane crash.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.220
Later, Gabriel is trying to fix the VCR and
an old tape pops out.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.920
Sky is getting ready to leave his place, when
he asks her if she wants to watch the tape

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.920
with him.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.220
She's in a hurry and leaves, so he decides
to watch it by himself.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.550
The tape doesn't work at first and when he
goes to light a cigarette the VCR suddenly

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.700
starts working.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.360
He watches the strange tape.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.320
A woman can be seen brushing her hair as well
as a long-haired girl's reflection.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.530
The woman is seen jumping of a cliff.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.630
When the video ends, Gabriel gets the call
from the girl that he has 7 days to live.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.740
A fly comes out of his cigarette.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.110
Gabriel goes to the window to smash it and
notices that the rain outside is falling in

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.600
the wrong direction.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.890
Julia is in her bed listening to Holt tell
her the story of Orpheus.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.479
They almost kiss, but his alarm activates.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.890
She tells him that he needs to pack for college.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.330
Holt's dead is putting his luggage in the
trunk telling him that they need to go.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.780
They say goodbye and he drives off to college.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.560
Six weeks later, the two of them talk on skype.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.810
He tells her about his classes and that it
will be a week until he comes back home.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.640
Suddenly his friends appear and drag him away
to go to a party.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.500
The next day, she's waiting for him to text
her back.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.480
That night, she has a wet dream about Holt,
that quickly turns into a nightmare and she

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.819
wakes up screaming.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.700
Suddenly, she gets a call from Holt, but when
she picks up, it's Skye asking where he is.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.620
Her face is distorting as she tells Julia
that Holt is a dead man walking, because the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.040
girl is coming for him and she can't be stopped.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.790
The call drops and she calls him on his phone,
but he doesn't pick up.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.940
Julia packs and drives off to see Holt.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.110
While driving, she keeps leaving him voice
messages.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.340
She arrives at his campus the next day.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.870
Julia knocks on his door and when no one answers,
she walks in.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.760
She finds his phone on the ground.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.950
Holt has text messages from Skye, telling
him to meet her after biology class.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.180
Julia grabs a key from his board and takes
a look at his schedule to see when he has

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.360
that class.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.819
Later, Gabriel is seen giving a lecture.

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.200
He's their professor.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.810
Julia walks into class and he immediately
calls attention to her.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.879
Gabriel ends the lecture and Julia goes over
to talk to him.

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.070
Gabriel tells her that he can't really remember
him and that she should move on because he

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.120
might have simply found someone else.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.360
Julia doesn't believe that he doesn't know
Holt so she follows him.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.780
She sees which floor he got off from and takes
the second elevator.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.299
When she can't choose the same floor, she
uses the key she found in Holt's dorm room.

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.580
The moment she steps out from the elevator
she sees a TV.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.740
There's a camera mounted on it, recording
everyone that enters.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.360
She finds a book by Gabriel on the mystery
of Samara, the long-haired girl from the videos.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.470
On the same floor, Julia finds a room with
distorted pictures from students and sees

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.680
one from Holt too.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.220
Checking out the room, she sees Skye arguing
with Gabriel.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.510
She tells him that Holt hasn't been picking
up his phone and that Gabriel has to help

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.440
her because he started everything.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.180
Sky explains that she can feel Samara and
that she knows what they're doing.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.700
Gabriel tells her to go home and wait until
someone comes to watch the video.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.760
Julia notices a few screens with running countdowns
with Holt's name on one of them.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.830
She runs out after Skye, asking her why she
called her and where she can find Holt.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.610
Skye tells her that she can help her but that
she needs to show her something first.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.260
They walk into Skye's place and she immediately
sits down on her computer.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.640
Julia notices Skye's phone ring.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.180
Holt is texting her and Julia sends him a
message.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.971
He asks her if she's with Skye, while she
is cueing up a copy of the video for her to

00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:22.990
watch.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.620
Holt tells her not to watch the video.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.890
Skye notices that Julia has her phone and
they fight.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.389
She begs her to watch the video, but Julia
pushes her off and hides.

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.030
Skye begs her for help.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.740
Suddenly, the video starts playing on the
computer.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.830
Skye smashes her computer.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.430
For a moment, she thinks that she has outsmarted
Samara, but her TV begins playing the video.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.440
Skye plugs it out, but it just comes on again.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.220
Samara begins walking out of the well and
Skye smashes the TV too.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.090
Samara keeps coming out of the TV and Sky
doesn't know what to do anymore.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.400
Samara lifts up the screen and comes out of
it going after Skye.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.440
She tries to pull away from her, but Samara
keeps coming for her and kills her.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.050
Julia hears the screams and peeks through
the keyhole.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.700
Suddenly, Samara appears at the door.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.700
She unlocks it and when it opens, Julia can
see Skye's body on a chair.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.400
She runs toward the apartment door, but realizes
she needs a key to get out.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.150
Julia walks over to Skye's body to take her
keys and when she sees her face she freaks

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.150
out.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.470
She unlocks the door and Holt appears in front
of the place, asking her what happened and

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.030
if she's seen the video.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.030
Julia tells him that Skye is dead.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.419
Later that night, Holt calls Gabriel.

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.800
The professor knows about Skye and tells him
that people have started dropping out of the

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.090
watching circle.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.169
Holt asks is he still has someone watching
the video for him.

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.610
Gabriel promises he will find him someone
to watch it.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.740
Holt apologizes to Julia for not telling her,
but says that he didn't want her involved.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.690
He'd seen the video 12 hours after Skye when
Gabriel asked him to be a part of an experiment.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.000
The professor has told them that it would
prove the existence of the afterlife and the

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.760
tape is a doorway there.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.250
Holt explains that after you see the tape
you have 7 days to find someone to watch it

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.720
too and you're safe.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.750
Julia is mad at him for getting involved in
something like that.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.870
Later, she wakes up next to Holt and sees
an imprint of a hand on his back.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.860
Julia gets up and watches Holt's copy of the
video.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.850
It's filled with disturbing and surreal images.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.919
It ends with an image of the well.

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:12.090
The phone rings.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.050
Julia gets the "7 days" call.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.039
She has a vision of a door and when she touches
the handle, her hand gets burned.

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:20.480
Holt wakes up and she tells him that she watched
it.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.729
When Gabriel calls he tells him that she'll
need someone to watch a copy of the video

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:24.729
for her.

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:28.800
Later, the two of them are driving to get
to Gabriel, when Julia sees a bird crash into

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.110
the window and they almost have an accident.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.600
Holt doesn't see the bird.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.110
She runs out of the car and finds the bird
flopping on the street, when she almost gets

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.530
hit by a truck.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.729
Holt pulls her away in time, but the bird
isn't there anymore.

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.630
They arrive at Gabriel's place and Holt tells
him that unlike the rest, she got marked on

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.509
the first day, which means that the curse
is changing.

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:51.099
As they're taking a scan of Julia's hand,
Gabriel tells them that he was wrong about

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:53.060
what the tape and the experiment meant.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.680
He tells Julia what she needs to do to stay
alive, but she doesn't want to do that to

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.030
another person.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.340
Holt convinces her to make a copy of the video,
just in case.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.830
When she goes to do it, Gabriel notices that
her version won't copy.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.050
They realize that her copy is a larger file
than the original.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.780
They scrub through the video and see the bird
Julia saw in the car.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.500
Gabriel says that it shouldn't be there.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.509
They go to his office to get his equipment.

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:19.580
He goes through the video and finds data contained
in the additional still frames in Julia's

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.180
copy, basically a video within a video.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.880
Holt sits down to watch the video with her,
but Gabriel says that it might be intended

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.490
for Julia alone.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.990
She convinces him to let her watch it by herself.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.270
He holds her hand.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.610
The video is much different than before.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.600
She tells them what she sees: a clock, a cross
in a flood and a girl.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.099
She sees a burning body, a door and Samara
at the end.

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:43.890
Gabriel says that those images have never
been on the tape before.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:48.379
He also explains that in some cultures burning
the body releases the spirit as well.

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:51.639
Julia remembers seeing the cross before and
she shows them.

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:54.389
Gabriel tells her that is the place where
Samara was buried.

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:57.750
Julia says that it's where they need to go
and suddenly the phone rings.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.639
Someone has informed Gabriel that the police
are on they're way there.

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:04.610
He will stay back to talk to the police because
he feels guilt for Skye's death.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:08.330
Before they leave he gives them his entire
research on Samara and the tape.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.199
Julia and Holt drive to the church where she
was buried.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:15.150
She says that the images on the tape were
Samara's story, which she wanted heard.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.720
The girl was abandoned as a child and no one
knew where she came from.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.449
When she was adopted, they realized that there
was something evil inside her.

00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:26.599
They tried to kill her, but Samara survived
7 days at the bottom of the well.

00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:28.610
Her body was discovered years later.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.870
However, Julia doesn't know why her body was
taken to the town where she was buried.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.789
She has another vision of a pregnant girl
that was on the tape.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:38.140
They arrive at a motel and get a room.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.479
Julia sees the pregnant girl on a picture
and asks the owner about it.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:44.890
She tells them that the girl disappeared 30
years prior and that she doesn’t want to

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.300
talk about it further.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.269
The two of them go to the church and walk
into an AA meeting.

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:53.420
They look around, but when they don't find
something they think would help, they leave.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.910
Holt asks a man about the church and why it
closed.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.740
As he's telling him that it happened after
a flood, Julia sees a flock of birds showing

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.110
her to the cemetery.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.600
Meanwhile, Gabriel is packing up his stuff
when he notices something.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.920
He takes another look at Julia's palm print
and tries to call them.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.820
He can't reach them, so he decides to find
them.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.930
Gabriel leaves Holt a message that the mark
on Julia's pam in actually in braille.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:19.400
Simultaneously, Julia and Holt are at the
cemetery looking for Samara's grave.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.029
Julia finds an unmarked one and has a flashback
about it from the video.

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:27.300
She calls Holt over, then listens to some
kind of sound coming from inside the grave.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.860
Holt finds her and Julia tells him that Samara's
there.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.910
They open the grave up, but find no body inside.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.880
Julia thinks that someone has moved her.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.610
She sees an inscription inside the grave and
crawls in.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.050
The inscription says "She will find you Julia".

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.850
Suddenly, she gets closed up inside the grave
and hears something behind her.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.320
The video begins to play on her phone.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.160
Chains can be seen on the video and they suddenly
materialize on Julia's arm.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.420
She gets dragged through the grave up to the
well.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.570
Suddenly, Holt pulls her out.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.140
It seems that she had another vision.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.940
A dog starts barking at them and when Holt
tells it's owner that they're looking for

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.160
Samara, he tells them that he knows.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.170
The man takes them to Burke's house.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.480
When they arrive he tells him that he found
them breaking inside the grave.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.871
He asks him if he should take them to the
sheriffs office, but Burke says that he can

00:10:10.871 --> 00:10:12.150
take care of it.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.540
Burke invites them in.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.610
They sit down for tea and he asks how they
found her grave.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.040
Julia tells him about her vision that got
them there, as well as the vision she had

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.040
inside.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.380
Burke tells them how the body came to their
town.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.050
Their priest wanted to give her a resting
place, but the town almost got destroyed because

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:28.100
of that.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.670
Holt realizes that the flood was because of
her.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.410
Burke tells Julia that he also believed that
Samara was trying to tell him something.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.660
He was also pulled inside the grave and had
terrible visions.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.839
After that he lost his eyesight, which almost
came as a relief.

00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:43.340
The priest requested her body to be moved.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.670
Before they leave, he warns them that they
shouldn't look for her and tells Julia that

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.170
even if she had visions, it doesn't mean she
understands what they were about.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.380
They shake hands and he reads the inscription
in braille on her palm, but doesn't tell her

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.500
what it means.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.380
He says that they should be careful.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.610
Holt and Julia get out of there and still
go looking for the body.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:04.200
On their way there they get stopped by the
police because the road has been closed.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.430
Suddenly, Julia has another vision of the
pregnant girl and runs out of the car.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.570
The cop stops Holt and she follows her vision
down the road.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.430
It takes her to a crashed car with Gabriel
inside.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.420
Julia runs over to him and he wakes.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.370
He tries to tell her about the inscription
on her hand, as Holt is running toward them,

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.740
pulling her aside in time before a pole can
crush her too.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.740
Gabriel dies.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.980
Later, Holt brings his bag and says that Gabriel
wanted to tell them something.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:33.390
Julia says that the girl wanted to tell them
something too - that she's connected to Samara.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.290
She says that they need to go back.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.870
In the hotel, Julia says that she can feel
her pain and suffering.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.820
Holt leaves to bring back some food and leaves
her there alone.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.930
Julia watches the video again and realizes
what the ring in the beginning is.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.930
Meanwhile, Holt walks into a diner and sits
next to the owner of the motel.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.290
He asks her about the girl from the photo.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:56.240
Simultaneously, Julia goes back to the abandoned
church and breaks in.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.579
She immediately heads to the church bell and
sees water underneath it.

00:11:59.579 --> 00:12:02.440
She bangs on the ground and realizes that
it's hollow.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.640
Julia breaks off the flooring and finds a
trap door underneath.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.920
The woman is telling Holt about the girl.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.700
She tells him that she just vanished.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.370
Julia goes under the church and finds a room.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:16.079
She sees the pregnant girl's sweater and a
bird cage she saw in the video.

00:12:16.079 --> 00:12:19.829
Julia realizes that the priest kept the girl
down there and suddenly hears someone behind

00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:20.829
her.

00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:24.100
When she turns around the girl disappears
and Julia has a vision of how the room was

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.230
in the past.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.990
There's banging on the door in front and she
walks opens it.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.620
Julia flashes her light inside and a vision
of the girl appears again.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.149
She finds chains on the floor and markings
on the wall of the days the girl was kept

00:12:35.149 --> 00:12:36.149
inside.

00:12:36.149 --> 00:12:38.899
She figures out that it amounts to 8 and a
half months.

00:12:38.899 --> 00:12:41.959
The girl was pregnant with Samara while she
was being kept in.

00:12:41.959 --> 00:12:45.320
In the meantime, the owner tells Holt that
they never found out what happened to the

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.320
girl.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.540
She also tells him that Burke is the priest.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.790
Holt leaves and Julia arrives at Burke's house.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.640
Julia tells him that she understands the visions
and asks about the priest.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.709
He asks her about what she knows and she tells
him what she found out about the girl.

00:12:58.709 --> 00:13:01.900
Julia says that the curse will never stop
until she's free.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.610
Holt comes back into the motel and finds her
gone.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.610
Burke tells Julia that he was certain that
he would father a child that would change

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:08.680
the world.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.680
He shows her that he took his own sight and
pins her down when she tries to run.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.620
Julia realizes that he's Samara's father and
that she's still his prisoner because he moved

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.730
her bones.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.200
Julia runs, but can't get out of the house.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.420
Burke turns off all the lights and looks for
her.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.970
He tells her that she's the 12th person that
has looked for Samara and that she can't bring

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.050
her peace, but instead would unleash hell
on the world.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:30.639
Burke finds her and hits her.

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:32.850
Meanwhile, Holt is running to his house.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:37.130
The priest is going after Julia and says that
he will not allow her to set Samara free.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.230
He chained the girl up because she was trying
to kill their child and that he should've

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.230
let her.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.790
The two of them struggle and he falls down
the stairs.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.190
Julia has another vision.

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.830
She follows a light to a room and when she
opens the door she sees many of the things

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.470
she had seen in the video.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.300
Julia follows her visions around the house,
not understanding what Samara is trying to

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.870
show her, when her nose starts bleeding.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.910
Samara shows her where she is buried, so Julia
starts tearing off the wall.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.440
Meanwhile, Holt breaks into the house and
hears Julia upstairs.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.690
He looks for her through the house and gets
to the stairs, when he finds something on

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:08.700
the floor.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.170
The priest is still alive and knocks him out.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:14.170
Julia tears through the wall and finds Samara's
remains.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.589
Burke gets to her too and starts strangling
her.

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:18.870
Samara appears on Julia's phone.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:22.300
Julia has another vision in which Samara asks
her not to leave her.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.620
Samara raises out of Julia's phone.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.290
Burke turns around when he hears her and she
heals his eyes.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.029
He finally looks at her and dies just like
the rest.

00:14:30.029 --> 00:14:31.880
Holt wakes up and finds Julia.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.850
She tells him that it's not over yet.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.410
That night, they're seen burning Samara's
remains.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.079
Julia says that she's free.

00:14:38.079 --> 00:14:42.970
Later, Julia is taking a shower and Holt finally
listens to Gabriel's voicemail, saying that

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:45.600
the inscription on Julia's hand is in braille.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.180
Holt finds the scan of her palm in one of
his books.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.800
Meanwhile, Julia sees that she has a broken
callus on her palm.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.990
She tears at it.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.860
When she comes out of the shower Julia begins
to choke and to take out strands of hair from

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.490
her throat aa well as a sack made out of hair.

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:01.070
A fly comes out of it.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:05.060
Julia looks at herself in the mirror, then
has another vision of Samara, saying that

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.240
it won't stop.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.750
Holt translates the braille inscription from
Julia's hand and before he reaches to the

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:14.290
final letter the computer goes haywire sending
the video to all of Julia's contacts.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.120
When the translation is done it shows the
word "rebirth".

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.580
He calls for Julia.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.019
She is looking at herself in the mirror and
when she wipes the vapor off of it, she's

00:15:22.019 --> 00:15:26.520
turned into Samara.
