Welcome back to Movie Shortens.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.650
Follow us today to a movie titled: 6 Souls
- Shelter.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.410
Be aware, there are spoilers!

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.849
Cara, a psychiatrist, believes that multiple
personality disorder is a psychological fad.

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.320
After work, Cara calls her daughter, Sam,
who is being looked after by her uncle Stephen

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.380
back home.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.990
When Cara is on the way to the airport, she
receives a phone call from her father, who

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.490
also is a psychiatrist, Dr Harding.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.980
He tells her that he’ll pick her up at the
airport to meet with a patient, who suspected

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.179
to have multiple personality disorder,

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.340
At the hospital, Cara complains that her dad
only gives her some medical oddities, and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.940
perhaps including this time.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.120
Harding argues that this case has a whole
new kind of act.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.850
Just then, Cara sits with a patient on a wheelchair
named David.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.829
He tells Cara that his legs are disabled due
to a car accident when he was a young.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.079
Cara does some standard visual tests including
ones with multiple small circles in a pattern

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.970
where the numbers 16 and 73 are clearly visible
to normally sighted people.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.050
After some basic tests, Cara comes out to
tell her dad that David is completely normal.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.750
Harding tells Cara to wait for a moment and
makes a phone call to the room.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.360
When David picks up the phone, Dr Harding
asks David to talk with “Adam”.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.580
David first says that there is no Adam with
him.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.020
Suddenly, a loud noise is heard in the room.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.670
Cara is shocked but she returns to the room
under her father’s request.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.030
Here, Cara meets with Adam, who transformed
from David mysteriously.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.351
She proceeds to do the same tests, but Adam
behaves quite rudely and doesn’t answer

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.351
it correctly.

00:01:26.351 --> 00:01:30.880
He confronts Cara about her husband's tragic
death, attempting to hurt her feelings.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.470
When Cara shows a card of green circles varying
slightly with nothing visible, Adam says it

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.710
is a number 7.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.860
Cara nods and places red film over the card,
making a 7 clear.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.490
She then asks him if he is color blind and
he admits to red deficiency since birth.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.930
Adam even stands up - he can walk despite
being immobilized by a wheelchair moments

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.980
earlier as "David".

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.590
Later, Cara tells Harding that Adam must be
the 'host' and David is the 'alter'.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.340
The whole case is just Adam’s imagination.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.520
She complains to her dad that it was much
easier for her to meet with Adam first.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.700
The two pick up Sam home from Stephen.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.540
Harding hands Cara a box of Adam’s files
so she can take a deeper look.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.730
Cara becomes attached to this case soon after
that as her father insists there is something

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.630
very strange about Adam.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.129
Cara meets with Dr Charles.

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.200
He first met with David and later transferred
the case to Harding when David became Adam

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.370
back and forth.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.870
At this point, Charles’s neck has some blisters.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.470
Cara sees that the two x rays taken strangely
are different although “David” and Adam

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.800
share the same body.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.690
However, Cara still believes Adam just makes
up everything about David and she’ll prove

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.690
it.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.360
Later, she talks to Charles about the health
files of Adam.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.870
Strangely, he becomes very sick and the skin
is badly rotten.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.340
He even vomits black dust out of his mouth.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.980
There is a mysterious shadow passing his house
at the time.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.220
The next morning, Cara follows David’s information
and finds the way to his house.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.940
She meets with his mother and learns that
David was a real person who became a paraplegic

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.269
after an accident.

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.599
His mother reveals that David was murdered
long ago in the woods, being abused and severely

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.159
tortured by Satan-worshipping mountain witches.

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.340
Cara reveals to the woman about Adam, who
self-proclaimed him as David.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.069
David’s mother is a highly religious person.

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.250
She believes Adam is possessed and she’ll
help Cara cure him.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.600
Back home, Cara concludes to her father that
Adam just creates a delusion and begins carrying

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.380
around a mental picture of David since he
was young.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.650
The next morning, Cara introduces Adam to
David’s mother.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.819
At this point, he is the real Adam and doesn’t
know David’s mother.

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.710
When the phone rings, Adam transforms to David
after a very painful convulsion.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.500
“David” talks to his mother in tears,
saying that he misses her so much.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.110
As the mother is skeptical, David gives her
all the details and secrets that only two

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.210
of them could know.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.940
David’s mother becomes scared, saying he
is evil and leaves in extreme sadness.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.660
Several days later, Cara decides to bring
David to the mountain where he was murdered.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.819
David recalls the horrible nights and suddenly
becomes frightened, saying that the “evil”

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:54.819
is coming.

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.770
Cara decides to call for help.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.150
Just as she turns around, David transforms
again.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.090
However, this time it is not Adam.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.000
He reveals himself to be Wesley, another personality.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.269
Cara again finds that Wesley, a metal band
singer, is dead long ago due to suicide.

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.990
She meets with Wes in the room.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.630
He asks her if she believes in science or
God.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.440
Cara answers that she considers herself a
doctor of science, but a woman of God.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.949
When Cara shows him an article about his suicide.

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.180
Wes remembers the night he was in a car.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.590
However, he becomes scared and shakes.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.550
He cracks his head backward and returns to
David again.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.780
David tells Cara that evil has been around.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.530
Cara is convinced that Adam again created
another alternative for his mental problem.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.509
She finds the way to Adam’s house.

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.730
There, she finds a decomposing body.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.650
Cara immediately calls the police and reports
Adam as a murderer.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.160
She goes to pick up Sam at the soccer field,
only to find her with Adam.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.790
Cara becomes mad, threatening Adam not to
approach her family.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.699
However, “Adam” reveals to be Dr Charles,
the 4th personality to be seen.

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.660
At home, Cara asks Sam about the convo between
her and the man.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.630
He asks Sam about her faith in God.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.759
Sam tells him that since God couldn’t do
anything to save her father, she doesn’t

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:08.759
believe anymore.

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.479
Sam says her grandpa also has no trust in
God.

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.130
Cara finds some rash on Sam’s back, thinking
it as allergy.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.860
Later, Cara talks about the incident at Sam’s
school with her dad.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.350
When Cara tells about Adam lied himself to
be Charles, Harding reveals that Dr Charles

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.220
is dead without any reason.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.280
Cara is shocked because he seemed very well
several days ago.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.570
At this point, Harding suffers from bad coughing,
just like Charles before.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.460
Cara watches over the tapes of Adam again.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.639
She notices a huge shadow absorbing Adam while
he is sleeping.

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.090
The next day, Adam is arrested about the body
in his house.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.210
The detective asks about a strange symbol
in the back of the body.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.760
However, Adam denies all the charges.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.880
Cara realizes she has seen it at David’s
house and in the mountain before.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.310
She meets with David’s mother again about
the symbol, who eventually shows her the way

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.970
to meet with a witch blind doctor named Granny
in the witch mountain.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.810
However, Granny doesn’t want to talk to
her and send her away.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.949
Cara sneaks back and sees Granny cutting open
an old man, sucking out his soul, and blowing

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.060
it into a container with a strange symbol
on it.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.970
Granny then takes out a cancerous lump from
his body and sews him up before blowing the

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.180
soul back into him.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.670
The old man wakes up seemingly fine as if
he was never ill.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.710
The witch doctor turns and asks Cara if she
still only believes in science.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.509
Granny says that the symbol is the writing
of the mountain and is the shelter.

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:31.830
Later at night, Stephen lets her know that
the shadow in the tape is actually a sound

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.670
wave of a freaking voice.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.660
He then tells Cara to see a man for the exact
answers.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.100
Cara pays a visit to a man who tells a childhood
story, showing Cara a mute home movie recorded

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.100
by his father.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.960
A long time ago a priest named Christian Moore
came to his city to preach about God, although

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.030
he himself did not believe.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.150
The priest said witchcraft and pagan rituals
were unnecessary and people could be healed

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.150
by faith.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.520
The flu broke out in town, but people believed
the priest.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.569
When they discovered that the priest was an
unbeliever who had vaccinated his two daughters

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:06.289
and left the townspeople to die, they killed
his daughters.

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:11.140
Granny sucked his soul and blew into the air,
then filled his mouth with dust so that it

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.449
couldn't come back.

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:15.570
She cursed his body to be a shelter to the
faithless.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.039
The police tell Cara that they released 'Adam'
to her father and that the body in his house

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:21.250
was the real Adam.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.169
Cara looks at the screen and sees 'Adam' in
the midst of the influenza epidemic.

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:28.949
He is the faithless priest Christian Moore.

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:33.060
Meanwhile, “Adam”, who is now Christian
is returned to Dr Harding.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.620
Cara soon realizes his plan and calls her
dad but it is too late.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.250
Christian has killed Harding and hosts in
his body.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.509
Helpless, Cara calls Stephen and tells about
her discoveries.

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:48.240
He tells her that Sam is ill, just like Charles
and their father, and that a strange symbol

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.410
is burned on her back.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.979
Cara asks him to take Sam to Granny.

00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:57.110
However, the uncle and niece are then confronted
by Christian, who insists on being Harding.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.819
Stephen is knocked out and injured in the
stomach.

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:03.820
Cara tells Sam to put the call on speaker
and demands to speak to Christian.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.960
At this point, Christian transforms back into
David and collapses as he needs a wheelchair.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.039
Stephen and Sam eventually escape.

00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:13.410
The three reunite and rush to see Granny.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.090
Cara holds Sam and tells Stephen to hang in
there with the wound.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.500
However, Granny says she cannot help because
Sam herseldoesn’t believe in God.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.699
Sam will be sheltered with the other faithless
souls.

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:29.400
As Christian enters the house, Cara holds
Sam back to Stephen, who is already dead.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.659
The mother and daughter run away from Christian
deep to the woods.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:36.500
Sam vomits dust from her mouth, signaling
the transformation.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.690
Christian arrives and knocks Cara to blackout,
eventually hiding in Sam’s body.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.070
Cara wakes up, seeing Sam now is in Christian’s
body.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.690
She holds her daughter in hand for a moment.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:51.940
Suddenly, she strangles the man before piercing
him through a root from the ground, attempting

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.800
to release all the souls in Christian’s
body.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.530
At this point, Sam revives, to Cara’s surprises.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:02.080
However, the girl’s eyes reveal to be Christian’s.
