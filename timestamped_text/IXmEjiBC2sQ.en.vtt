00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.160
If you vacationed in a snowy mountain cabin and&nbsp;
Nazi Zombies tried to kill you, what would you do?

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.920
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow&nbsp;
the Norwegion students, see if we can make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.320
better decisions, and ultimately attempt&nbsp;
to beat the Nazi Zombies in, Dead Snow.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.600
If you think you could do better than&nbsp;
me, let us know in the comments! If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.600 --> 00:01:58.640
like these how to beat videos, consider&nbsp;
liking and subscribing. Let’s get to it.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.920
After witnessing a random woman run down and&nbsp;
eaten by zombies that were suspiciously wearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.000
Nazi SS uniforms, we start following seven&nbsp;
students vacationing in a cabin in the woods.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.480
In the car, Roy tells them about a man in&nbsp;
the newspaper who was buried in an avalanche,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.680
and was later found to have accidentally dug&nbsp;
six yards deeper into the snow because he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.520
disoriented. Vegard’s pro tip is to just spit,&nbsp;
and then dig in the opposite direction gravity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.240
pulls your saliva. Apparently this is something&nbsp;
he learned in his military service. I thought this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.000
was common knowledge, or just common sense. How&nbsp;
this man dug ‘six’ yards deep without realizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.480
he should’ve been falling back down is one of&nbsp;
the most idiotic things I've heard all week.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.880
It’s not going to be a sausage party after all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.240
they got some ladies coming too. There’s mention&nbsp;
of a Sara who was going to hike into the cabin on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.560
her own. If that was Sara in the prelude,&nbsp;
they’re going to be coming up one short.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.080
The cabin they’re staying at is a 45 minutes&nbsp;
walk off the road. Only Vegard knows the way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.960
in and out, so the rest will have to follow his&nbsp;
snowmobile tracks. He could have ferried them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.280
to the cabin, but that would just get in&nbsp;
the way of doing some sick Triple X moves.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.520
I’m sure he never comes up here and it’s&nbsp;
rarely ever used, but it wouldn’t be hard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.360
to pin some red markers on the trees to&nbsp;
mark the route so others could get in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.800
and out if needed. Or if someone got hurt&nbsp;
and emergency services needed to find you.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.480
Not only is the route unmarked,&nbsp;
but there's no cell signal. Elon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.320
Musk really needs to get that Starlink&nbsp;
set up so people getting attacked by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.560
Things in Antarctica and Nazi Zombies&nbsp;
in the Norwegion Alps can call for help.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.120
Movie cliches aside, being in remote areas with&nbsp;
no ability to call for help and no way of anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.640
finding you quickly is actually a risky thing&nbsp;
in real life. Just because it’s a movie cliche&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.040
doesn’t make it less dangerous. “Haha man how&nbsp;
many movies are there where some psycho is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.840
stalking you with a knife in their hand, that guy&nbsp;
following us at night is so cliche, am I right.”

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.000
Well I feel attacked.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.440
The group burns the rest of the&nbsp;
daylight off tubing, grilling wieners,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.720
and playing twister until eventually, someone&nbsp;
has to use the outdoor laboratory. Nothing good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.960
ever comes from using an outhouse at night&nbsp;
in the dark freezing woods. At minimum,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.680
it’s freezing and uncomfortable. But worst&nbsp;
case, you’re alone, in a vulnerable position,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.440
and your enemies can take you&nbsp;
completely by surprise. Not Liv though,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.600
she gets that weird subconscious feeling&nbsp;
of being watched. Like something is off.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.840
Like anyone would do, she runs back&nbsp;
inside yelling about seeing a man outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.680
Of course everyone tries to come up with&nbsp;
reasonable explanations like it being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.960
Sara or a Moose, which has to be infuriating.&nbsp;
Knowing you saw something but your friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.200
just think you saw a rabbit or the&nbsp;
shadow of snow falling off the trees.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.840
That or they look out of a musty window and say,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.320
Yah, no shit you didn’t see anyone standing in&nbsp;
plain view of the window. If there was someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.120
out there they’d be operating in the darkness&nbsp;
of the tree line or in the house’s blind spots.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.280
With Liv being freaked out about seeing someone&nbsp;
outside, they should probably start using the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.520
buddy system if anyone else needs to use&nbsp;
the port-a-potty tonight, or at least slow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.400
down on the booze. I also hope there's an old&nbsp;
hunting rifle stashed away in a closet because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.880
they don’t have much in the way of weapons if an&nbsp;
axe-murderer all of the sudden busts in swinging.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.360
Like a true Alpha male, Roy needlessly puts&nbsp;
himself in harm's way to prove there isn’t any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.920
danger. He gets lucky that the man who snuck up&nbsp;
behind him was only looking for a cup of coffee.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.000
This dude is completely killing the vibe they had&nbsp;
going, but if we’re going with the whole movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.160
cliche thing, he’s definitely the strange old&nbsp;
man that’s going to start dropping history&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:51.840
lessons about an old evil that’s lurking around&nbsp;
these parts. It’d be wise to pay attention.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.520
If what this guy said is true, why would he be&nbsp;
traveling outside in these parts by himself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.600
unarmed. And why would he willingly&nbsp;
leave the relative safety of the cabin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.040
I’d be suspicious of this guy,&nbsp;
not the tall tale he was spitting.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.960
Everyone but Liv is disregarding this&nbsp;
as senile rambling, and even then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.600
she’s probably thinking what she saw in the&nbsp;
treeline earlier was the old man himself.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.160
Sara hasn’t shown up yet, but Vegard did say&nbsp;
that she might be arriving in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.960
As far as they’re concerned,&nbsp;
there’s nothing to worry about.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.120
Before the wanderer leaves, Roy makes&nbsp;
another smartass remark that he doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.980
take too kindly too. Whether his story&nbsp;
is true or not, the fact that this guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.880
is roaming around would be scary enough&nbsp;
to wanna watch your back from here on out.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.000
Naturally, all the disturbing&nbsp;
shit the old man was talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.840
seeped into their minds and&nbsp;
propagated into their dreams.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.960
What the fuck brain, thanks for the visual of my&nbsp;
missing girlfriend dying and puking black blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.160
I really needed that after being&nbsp;
told there might be undead Nazi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.120
zombies lurking in these mountains with my&nbsp;
girlfriend hiking in by herself. I will say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.960
going hiking through somewhat treacherous&nbsp;
terrain by yourself with no cell signal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.000
wasn’t too smart. I’m sure she’s fine and this&nbsp;
was just a case of an overactive imagination.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.240
Really, what is this guy even doing out&nbsp;
here? He doesn’t look like a hunter to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.400
Maybe he’s not simply a ‘hunter’,&nbsp;
maybe, he’s a ‘ghost’ hunter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.200
or whatever the Nazi zombie equivalent&nbsp;
of a ghost hunter is. Ah, I know, this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.400
guy is like the amateur Norwegion version of the&nbsp;
Hunting Hiter crew. He’s no Tim Kennedy though.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.040
I don’t want to put words in Tim Kennedy’s mouth,&nbsp;
but I doubt he would have trekked into the heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.400
of these evil mountains by himself, having only&nbsp;
brought a bolt-action rifle and a narrow-beam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.360
flashlight, and then set up in the middle of&nbsp;
the open in a tent lit up like a Christmas tree.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.680
That would be the sound of your&nbsp;
bad decisions catching up to you.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.920
We already know this guy massively fucked&nbsp;
up coming here at night and by willingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.000
leaving the cabin to camp in a tent, but&nbsp;
let’s just rip through him some more. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.320
should have brought a camping lantern which&nbsp;
lights up over 30 meters in all directions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:12.000
His narrow beam flashlight is next to useless,&nbsp;
and coupled with a bolt-action rifle, acquiring,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.760
engaging, reloading, reacquiring and re-engaging&nbsp;
is going to be absurdly difficult. If what he said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:23.440
is true, there could be hundreds of undead&nbsp;
Einsatzkommandos out here. Impossible odds..

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.400
Even if he was a regular camper or hunter who&nbsp;
was only concerned about dangerous animals,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.560
and didn’t actually believe his own&nbsp;
stories, he was still poorly equipped.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:39.840
He basically committed suicide.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.200
The nightmare, what the old guy said,&nbsp;
Sara still not here in the morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.200
all stoke Vegard into going on a search&nbsp;
and rescue mission to try to find her.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.120
This is a mistake. He should ride&nbsp;
back into town to contact the police,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.080
who will notify the Norwegion&nbsp;
Search and Rescue Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.320
The SAR team is vastly more well manned,&nbsp;
equipped, and trained for the job.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.520
Vegard going after Sara by himself without any&nbsp;
real training or equipment is not only dangerous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.880
but he’s also much less likely to find her or&nbsp;
be able to effectively rescue her if he does.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.840
On his way he finds the wanderer’s&nbsp;
tent, and inside, his mutilated corpse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.240
Seeing as there’s bloody footprints walking&nbsp;
away from the scene, this was no animal.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.400
I know they’re evil Nazi zombies and&nbsp;
all, but leaving behind a crime scene&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.320
isn’t going to do them any favors. They&nbsp;
have a leader, are somewhat intelligent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.960
and according to the legends they fled into&nbsp;
these mountains to hide at the end of the war.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.720
Covering their tracks should be a strat residing&nbsp;
in their decaying brain matter. Stupid Nazi’s.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.040
Now as Vegard, do you keep snowmobiling&nbsp;
around the mountainside searching for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.280
Sara with a murdering psycho on the&nbsp;
loose, or do you head back and get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.560
off the mountain with the rest of your&nbsp;
friends so you can get help from people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.080
that actually know what the fuck they’re&nbsp;
doing? I’m going to go with the latter.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.080
For some reason Vegard thinks&nbsp;
this is a movie and he’s the hero,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.160
and decides to follow the murderer’s foot&nbsp;
tracks. It’s not a good sign when you’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.280
resorting to tracking down a murderer to find your&nbsp;
missing girlfriend, but it’s the best lead he has.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.240
Maybe undertaking the rescue operation&nbsp;
by yourself wasn’t such a good idea.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:28.320
Back at the lodge the group discovers a box full&nbsp;
of old gold and jewelry dated with the year 1942.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.200
No bells are ringing that this might be related&nbsp;
to the World War 2 Einsatzgruppe confiscations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.680
the wanderer was talking about. Not that it would&nbsp;
change anything if it had. There’s no way they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.400
could anticipate that undead Nazi’s will rise out&nbsp;
of their icy graves and shank them for fucking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.960
with their loot. To them, it’s old junk they&nbsp;
could pawn off to pay off their student loans,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.160
which I’m sure is triggering&nbsp;
to any historians out there.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.720
While everyone’s playing with the cursed jewelry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.480
Hanna slips one of the coins into&nbsp;
Martin's joggers without him knowing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.840
I don’t get why she didn’t put it in her&nbsp;
own pocket if she wanted to take one.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.440
Liv seeing someone in the woods, the creepy old&nbsp;
man sneaking up on them and choking out Roy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.800
and Vegard not being back yet&nbsp;
hasn’t unnerved them one bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.280
They’re all wasted and not using a buddy system&nbsp;
when visiting the outhouse a night. Sure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.840
you'd most likely get called a bitch by the other&nbsp;
guys for suggesting you tag team the toilet with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.120
your bro, but I think it’s reasonable given the&nbsp;
circumstances. In the Navy SEAL BUD/S training&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.840
you get assigned a swim buddy that you can’t&nbsp;
be further than 3 feet from the whole 6 months,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.880
because they get that when you’re alone you’re&nbsp;
weak and vulnerable. Especially when on the John.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:39.040
Damn, Chris is a freak jesus christ. Not&nbsp;
what I meant with the buddy system, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:44.560
it’ll do. Erland heads back into the Cabin to run&nbsp;
a victory lap while Chris finishes up on her own,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.360
or so she thinks. When she goes for&nbsp;
the TeePee she catches a peeping tom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:55.440
or more technically, a peeping undead Nazi&nbsp;
SS paramilitary death squad soldier. The most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.640
surprising thing is her lack of blood curdling&nbsp;
screams, not that it would help with the rest of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:09.840
the group smashing beers and blasting jams.&nbsp;
There’s not much she can do at this point.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.520
What do ya know, there was&nbsp;
a gun in this old cabin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.560
Hope there’s ammo around and&nbsp;
it’s not just for decoration.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.640
Hanna tosses Martin the pump trench gun&nbsp;
and the boys head out looking for Chris.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:26.000
Their investigation comes up empty, which I find&nbsp;
hard to believe. How did Chris get pulled through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.960
the toilet hole without breaking anything. And&nbsp;
how was her blood not all over the snow leading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:36.080
up to the house. The guys seem to think that them&nbsp;
not finding Chris means that everything is chill.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:41.280
I’d think that it would be even more alarming.&nbsp;
Especially since they also found Sara’s backpack.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.880
Hannah takes a peek outside and sees&nbsp;
Chris’s head being waved around by a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.600
homicidal maniac. The Nazi zombies sure&nbsp;
do have a sick sense of humour. Liv then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:57.040
makes the almost fatal, cliche mistake of&nbsp;
having her back next to that same window.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.280
Cutting Liv’s hair with the knife to free her&nbsp;
was a clutch move, good thinking. Barricading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:10.160
the windows and doors is also good, but everyone&nbsp;
needs to find things they can use for shields&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.880
and weapons. One of them should look around and&nbsp;
try to find spare ammo for their shotgun since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.520
it’s the best weapon they have. I doubt there&nbsp;
is any, so Martin needs to be sparing with it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.040
and only shoot when he sees the whites&nbsp;
of their undead eyes. Once all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.440
entrances are sufficiently barricaded up,&nbsp;
everyone needs to huddle in the middle to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:33.600
one, avoid getting grabbed like Liv, and two, so&nbsp;
that Martin has a clear shot. Beyond that there’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.000
not much to do but hold out until morning.&nbsp;
I’ve never heard of Nazi vampires, so the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.560
sunlight can’t be relied upon to vaporize them,&nbsp;
but Vegard might be back with the snowmobile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.960
they’d have better visibility, and more people&nbsp;
would be awake that could potentially help them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.120
Whatever is attacking them, it likely&nbsp;
doesn’t want to be spotted in broad daylight.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.800
Now it’s clear they’re dealing with zombies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.280
and judging by the decayed hand with&nbsp;
the Einsatz ring, the Nazi variety.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.280
Erland, having watched his fair share of&nbsp;
movies, starts freaking out yelling at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:13.040
everyone to not get bitten. Hey, that’s my&nbsp;
job. Based on what the wanderer man said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.680
this is looking a lot more like an evil curse,&nbsp;
not a virus. Not that you’d want to get bitten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.520
by a Nazi zombie. Zombies are just a breeding&nbsp;
ground for bacteria and infectious diseases.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.360
Hannah thinks they should run for the car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:30.000
which is a total joke. There’s no way they can&nbsp;
make it trudging for 45 minutes through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.160
snow at night while being attacked when they&nbsp;
don’t even know the way out without Vegard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:39.360
Besides that automatic fail, they have no&nbsp;
idea how many of them are actually out there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.080
it’s dark as hell and they have no flashlights,&nbsp;
the shotgun doesn’t have enough ammo and Martin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.160
doesn’t have the training to operate it under&nbsp;
duress, and they’re all booz’d up, unarmed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.880
and out of shape. Good thing Hannah isn’t team&nbsp;
lead, because that would’ve been a total massacre.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.720
Erland makes the same mistake as Liv&nbsp;
by standing too close to the window,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.720
but he’s not as lucky as she was.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.840
Running to the car is out of the question.&nbsp;
This zombie just pulled his head apart like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.760
it was a watermelon. That’s like game&nbsp;
of thrones mountain levels of strength.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.680
And there’s tons of these freaks out there.&nbsp;
They just need to hold out till morning.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.800
To be honest, I'm somewhat shocked that they&nbsp;
survived the night. Colonel Herzog is a dipshit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.920
no wonder they lost the war. All they needed&nbsp;
to do is molotov the cabin and smoke them out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:38.240
Or tossed one of their stick grenades in through&nbsp;
a window to stun them before charging in to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.080
rip their guts out. I honestly never&nbsp;
thought i’d have a job which entailed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.880
helping Nazi zombies kill innocent&nbsp;
civilians. Dreams really do come true.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.280
With snowfall covering the snowmobile tracks&nbsp;
and obscuring the path back to civilization,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.520
they plan to split up. The gals will&nbsp;
make a run for where they think is town,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.800
while Martin and Roy create a&nbsp;
diversion to buy them some time.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.880
If only someone marked the route in an out.&nbsp;
Not that it would help much if the Nazi things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.280
decided to hunt them in broad daylight, but&nbsp;
it would have given them a sliver of a chance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.040
Thinking about it, they weren’t&nbsp;
blindfolded for the 45 minute walk in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.720
They should have at least a general sense&nbsp;
of direction of where they came from.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.360
The distraction idea is also flawed. Creating&nbsp;
a diversion only works if you know where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.760
Nazi’s are located. Liv and Hannah could&nbsp;
easily be running right towards the zombies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.440
in which case Martin and Roy banging&nbsp;
on pots and pans isn’t going to help.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.120
Their best option is to stay&nbsp;
together, grab weapons from the shed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.800
and haul ass in the general direction&nbsp;
they came while daylights on their side.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:40.080
Damn Vegard was unconscious for like 12 hours.&nbsp;
Must’ve really jacked his head on something.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.720
Looks like some sort of tunnel network.&nbsp;
Could it be, the old man wasn’t lying?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:50.000
Using a stick and some gas from his snowmobile&nbsp;
he fashions a makeshift torch to go tomb raiding.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.240
The unearthed graves are odd. There’s Nazi&nbsp;
flags, machineguns, grenades, helmets, yah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.840
the old dude wasn’t lying. Vegard should grab the&nbsp;
MP40 before he inevitably runs into the murderer.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.920
It’s not reasonable for Vegard to jump&nbsp;
to conclusions and think he’s dealing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:09.280
with Nazi zombies, but it could be another&nbsp;
Hiroo Onoda situation where some old ass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.680
Nazi’s held out and survived in these tunnels&nbsp;
this whole time by mugging and murdering the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.240
occasional hiker. Honestly, the Norwegions&nbsp;
should have hunted them down after World War&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:23.600
2. Why would you let a group of genocidal&nbsp;
maniacs roam free miles from your town.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:29.520
Vegard eventually finds Saras head, on display&nbsp;
as some sort of sick trophy. As heart stopping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.960
as this revelation is, there’s no&nbsp;
time to grieve in the devil’s lair.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.240
Not too help the Nazi’s, but If they&nbsp;
still have functioning firearms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.720
why aren’t they using them?&nbsp;
Odd that they’d want to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:53.680
knives with the historical precedent of mowing&nbsp;
down millions of innocent people with rifles.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.000
Using his military training and the fire&nbsp;
of vengeance ignited from Sara’s death,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.240
Vegard beats the zombie down with it’s own&nbsp;
helmet. The Norwegion military apparently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.920
doesn’t train to double-tap their&nbsp;
downed enemies. It’s an undead monster,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.280
you can’t expect it to be fully dead&nbsp;
from knocking it’s head around a bit.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:14.640
His victory is short-lived with another undead&nbsp;
Nazi climbing out of the snow next to him. Yah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.160
time to run back to the snowmobile&nbsp;
and Triple X your ass back to base.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.640
Who knows how many of them&nbsp;
are buried in these tunnels.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:25.040
The Nazi’s corner him before he can get to his&nbsp;
snowmobile, so he’s forced to face them head on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.600
Defeating them is surprisingly easy. The&nbsp;
problem with Nazi zombies is that their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.440
brains have decayed to the point where they&nbsp;
turn into shitty movie villains who throw their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.400
enemies towards weapons that can be used against&nbsp;
them. That was basically a layup for Vegard.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:43.520
The throwing knife to the face was a pro move,&nbsp;
especially considering he’s cold, exhausted from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.640
fighting, wearing thick gloves, on an uneven&nbsp;
snowy hillside, and stressed from being under&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:54.480
attack by undead Nazi’s. I’ve thrown axes before&nbsp;
and it’s a lot harder than it looks. I personally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.320
wouldn’t have done that because I’d have fucked&nbsp;
it up and ended up just giving it the knife.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:09.840
He gets tackled off a cliff but manages to grab on&nbsp;
to the other zombie’s intestines Tarantino style.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.760
Hopefully this is an evil curse thing&nbsp;
and not an infectious zombie virus thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:20.080
because there’s a lot of bodily fluids being&nbsp;
exchanged. He head butts the zombie off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.800
climbs back up, and performs some extreme&nbsp;
field surgery by stitching his carotid artery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.120
closed with a fishing line and hook using&nbsp;
his snowmobiles mirror. Hell of a day. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.360
don’t think it’s possible to stitch a chewed&nbsp;
open carotid artery closed in the field like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.440
that. The duct tape around his neck might help&nbsp;
a bit, but it’s just a matter of time before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.320
he bleeds out. He needs to get to a hospital&nbsp;
A.S.A.P. if he has any chance of surviving.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.400
Vegard knows his friends must also be under&nbsp;
attack, and that nobody would believe him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:52.080
if he went for help. So rather than save&nbsp;
himself he mounts a confiscated belt-fed MG-34&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.880
on his snowmobile and prepares for war.&nbsp;
There’s still that MP40 and possibly more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.520
guns, grenades and ammo that he should’ve&nbsp;
stocked up on but doesn’t. Crucial mistake.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.840
When he fires her up for one last ride,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.080
another buried Nazi smells the fresh&nbsp;
blood and thinks it’s his moment to shine.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.120
The zombie catching a facefull of tree-branch was&nbsp;
lucky. This is also why he should have brought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:22.800
that submachine gun. The MG-34 isn’t really&nbsp;
made for blasting people off your snow boots.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.520
As expected, the diversion was a total failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.680
Hannah is putting in work though. That’s the&nbsp;
other thing about zombies, their bodies have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:36.240
decayed so much that their heads pop like&nbsp;
water balloons when you stomp on them. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.320
really should have grabbed knives or something&nbsp;
from the tool shed to defend themselves with.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.840
Liv isn’t doing as well, getting cannibalized&nbsp;
by the undead SS and all. The Nazi’s are too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.320
preocuppied indulging on her tasty flesh&nbsp;
to notice that she swiped one of their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:55.120
potato mashers. By the time they do, the&nbsp;
4 and a half second fuze is burnt through.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.920
I’m a bit surprised Liv knew how to detonate&nbsp;
the grenade. World war 2 stick grenades aren’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.640
as intuitive as modern ones where most people&nbsp;
know to pull the pin and let the lever fly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.480
With stick nades you have to unscrew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.640
the inconspicuous looking bottom cap&nbsp;
and pull the string that comes out.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.840
Hannah hides in a tree which somehow works.&nbsp;
These Nazi’s must be blind to not see her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:25.200
She’s wearing a giant puffy red coat. Hannah&nbsp;
really should’ve taken that off. Being cold is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:30.400
better than being dead. She accidentally climbs&nbsp;
up next to a bird nest, causing mama crow to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.120
pissed and start cawing loudly. By the time she&nbsp;
chokes it out, the zombies already found her.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.840
The tree isn’t the greatest hiding spot because&nbsp;
you’re basically trapped if you get caught.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.240
That and your footprints in the snow will&nbsp;
obviously lead to the tree and then suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.400
stop. Hannah had no idea where she was&nbsp;
going and was exhausted by this point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.960
so the tree probably looked like her only option.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:56.800
She does have the high ground..

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.840
And expertly uses it to perform a super&nbsp;
smash bros link drop sword maneuver.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.560
I can’t say I would’ve thought to do that.&nbsp;
She accidentally backs herself into a corner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:11.840
and knowing she can’t take it on one v&nbsp;
one, takes it with her off the cliff.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.040
Must’ve been a thick layer of pow&nbsp;
that cushioned that fall. According&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:24.400
to a physics.stackexchange post, falling at&nbsp;
terminal velocity into 15-20 feet of snow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.200
should be survivable. Don’t&nbsp;
try that at home though.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.680
Problem with surviving a huge fall into snow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.840
is that you need to dig your broken ass&nbsp;
back out. Hope she knows the spit trick.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.040
The zombie survived the fall&nbsp;
too, but Hannah got out first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.440
so she gets a free penalty kick to it’s head.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.640
The boys aren't doing so hot&nbsp;
themselves. Roy does the Nazi’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.120
job for them by burning themselves out of&nbsp;
the shelter with a poorly thrown molotov.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:52.320
Martin then pulls out his Nokia and rings the&nbsp;
cops. You’re telling me you did have a cell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.960
signal this whole time? Why the fuck didn’t you&nbsp;
call the police when you first got attacked? Wow.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.840
He then takes this critical opportunity to start&nbsp;
yelling at the cops that they are under attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:09.120
by zombies in German world war 2 uniforms, and&nbsp;
gets hung up on. Roy is right, if you’re being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:14.000
attacked by Nazi zombies, don’t say you’re&nbsp;
being attacked by Nazi zombies. The thing is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.840
even if Martin told them a hiker had gone&nbsp;
mad and attacked them and the police were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.120
ready to respond, he wouldn’t be&nbsp;
able to give them his location,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.600
because he doesn’t know it. And even if he did,&nbsp;
without route markers finding this place will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:30.720
be difficult and take awhile. It’s also crazy&nbsp;
to me that nobody had a paper map of this area.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.280
The Nazi zombies failed to secure the perimeter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.440
so Roy and Martin are able to flee to&nbsp;
the shed stocked with killing devices.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:42.720
An all out war between the Norwegion students&nbsp;
and the undead Nazi’s ensues, waged with crude&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:48.880
instruments of farming and fieldwork. The undead&nbsp;
get clobbered rather easily, almost, too easily.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.760
Even though killing them isn’t too difficult, more&nbsp;
keep rising out of the snow. If you ventured into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:59.200
some of my random earlier videos I made, you’ll&nbsp;
notice one called, “Your Heroes will Die Tired”.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:04.000
The point I tried to make is that hand to hand&nbsp;
fighting is extremely taxing and exhausting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.328
Your average person, AKA you, would be completely&nbsp;
smoked and out of energy after a couple hand to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:09.328 --> 00:24:12.960
hand bouts with the enemy, to the point&nbsp;
where if another attacker came at you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.920
it would be very easy for them&nbsp;
to overpower and kill you.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.320
Roy and Martin are running on fumes.&nbsp;
Just when all hope seems lost,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.960
Vegard flies in with the upgunned snowmobile&nbsp;
and saws down a line of zombies. That should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.880
buy them enough time for Martin and Roy to&nbsp;
get on the snowmobile and drive out of there.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.600
Vegard instead decides to pop a wheelie&nbsp;
and decapitate another Nazi with it’s skis.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.840
The snowmobile gets pinned into a tree,&nbsp;
so Vegard suplexes the next zombie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.880
plants the snowmobile treads on&nbsp;
its face and opens the throttle.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.600
I’m almost feeling sorry for them at this point.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.200
Vegard wouldn’t have had to wreck his&nbsp;
snowmobile if he had brought more ammo, guns,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:54.880
and grenades from the tunnels, or if he executed&nbsp;
a hot extract for Roy and Martin and peaced out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:59.840
Now they are’ unarmed and on foot with zombies&nbsp;
popping out of the snow everywhere. Not good.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.240
Nooo, Vegard was a badass. Why’d&nbsp;
they have to do my boy like that.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.200
Hannah arrives at the party&nbsp;
with a hatchet in her neck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.200
must’ve caught that on the way back. Looks&nbsp;
like it’s all down to Roy and Martin.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.800
Martin unloads the trench gun into the SS zombies,&nbsp;
but there’s only 5 or so shells in it. Not enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.600
to kill them all. One of the remaining SS zombies&nbsp;
tackles him to the ground and bites his arm.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:34.080
Remembering what Erland said about zombies and&nbsp;
not getting bitten, he fires up the chainsaw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:39.120
to self-amputate his arm so as to not let the&nbsp;
infection spread. Did he not just get zombie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:44.560
guts poured into his facial orifices? If this was&nbsp;
a zombie virus thing, you’re already infected.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.680
I still think it’s more reasonable to assume the&nbsp;
Nazi’s are undead due to a curse, not a virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.000
In which case there is no need to amputate.&nbsp;
Even if you assumed the worst case scenario&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.720
that you contracted the zombie virus, chopping&nbsp;
your arm off is a bullshit movie cliche and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.040
doesn’t work at all. Blood pumps through&nbsp;
your body extremely fast, and likewise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:08.720
so do pathogens. For example, drugs injected into&nbsp;
your arm will reach your brain in a few seconds.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.720
Guess they didn’t cover that in your med school.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.960
His efforts, stupid yet commendable,&nbsp;
are rendered obselete when another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.440
zombie rise from the grave beneath his&nbsp;
legs and sinks it’s teeth into his sack.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.360
Yah, let's go with the evil curse&nbsp;
thing. The movie cliche I would go with,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.120
is that killing Herzog would end the&nbsp;
curse, deading all the undead for good.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:41.040
If they want to live and end this thing, they&nbsp;
need to kill him now before his backup arrives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:46.320
in force. Martin and Roy freeze up, lose their&nbsp;
only opportunity, and are forced to run for it.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.320
Roy gets sideswiped by Herzog and his&nbsp;
intestines get caught up on a tree,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:55.040
not sure how that happened. Martin looks back&nbsp;
and see’s Herzog grab some loot out of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.480
pockets. It looks like he connected&nbsp;
the dots with the wanderers story,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:03.440
that all this was over the confiscated valuables.&nbsp;
Damn Nazi zombies, all you had to do was ask.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:08.160
This is the crux of the situation,&nbsp;
but I don’t really think there was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.000
point in the movie besides when Martin saw&nbsp;
Herzog take the loot out of Roy's pocket,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.080
that this was clear. And really, I don’t&nbsp;
think this mattered much at all. Sara,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:21.200
the hiker, and Vegard were all attacked before&nbsp;
anyone pulled out the box of confiscated goods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.720
The undead nazi curse seems&nbsp;
more territorial in nature.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.120
Martin races back to the burnt down cabin&nbsp;
and offers up the box of gold and jewelry.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.920
Herzog accepts and reluctantly spares his life.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.760
The movie ends with Martin reaching his&nbsp;
car, grabbing the keys out of his pocket,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.720
and realizing he was still in&nbsp;
possession of one of the coins.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.000
That’s why I always put the car in drive&nbsp;
immediately after I get in. So if someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.800
pops up on my driver-side window I can just jam&nbsp;
the pedal and peel out. It is understandable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.520
that Martin wouldn’t be in the headspace to do&nbsp;
that, having had his entire reality take a hard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:02.960
left with all his friends getting murdered by&nbsp;
Nazi zombies. That and he was spared by Herzog.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.200
So how could things have gone down differently?

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.280
Sara really shouldn’t have been hiking alone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:11.200
but it wouldn’t have mattered if she&nbsp;
had a friend. Her death was inevitable.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.960
When Sara didn’t show up the morning after&nbsp;
the wanderer told his tale, Vegard should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.120
have rode into town and gotten the help of the&nbsp;
police and Norwegion Search and Rescue team.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:23.760
I could see the rest of the friends staying at the&nbsp;
cabin in the meantime in case Sara did show up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.240
but they wouldn’t have been&nbsp;
alone as police and SAR teams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.480
would be scouring the mountains looking for her.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.880
With the night approaching and Sara still gone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.840
I think it would be reasonable to&nbsp;
cancel the trip and head back into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.080
town. I can’t imagine I'd wanna drink beer&nbsp;
and play twister with my friend missing.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.720
If they changed course at this pivotal point in&nbsp;
their decision tree, none of them would have died.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.760
Except for the Wanderer who was&nbsp;
out camping there like an idiot.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.120
If they did stay and Vegard went&nbsp;
off looking for Sara on his own,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:53.520
which I suppose could be reasonable,&nbsp;
Erland and Chris’s deaths were unavoidable.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.480
If Vegard had put up route markers or the&nbsp;
others retained a semblance of direction,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.840
it would be a 20 minute run to the&nbsp;
car. Could they have made it, I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.000
it’s possible given that the Nazi zombies&nbsp;
weren’t that coordinated or hard to kill,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.240
especially if they all stayed together and got&nbsp;
weapons from the shed. When Vegard arrived at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.640
the cabin and noticed it was empty, he would’ve&nbsp;
rode back to town and made it to a hospital.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.360
Once they all got off the mountain&nbsp;
and alerted the authorities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.720
the military would have rolled in&nbsp;
and closed Herzog’s casket for good.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.800
I think we could have beaten&nbsp;
the Nazi Zombies from Dead Snow.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.040
Thanks for watching, and remember, don’t&nbsp;
play dress up with jewelry stolen from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:39.840
innocent civilians that were murdered&nbsp;
by Nazi paramilitary death squads.
