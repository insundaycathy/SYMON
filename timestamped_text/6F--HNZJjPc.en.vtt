00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.040
Hi folks, welcome back to Movie Shortens.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.930
Follow us today to a movie titled: Piranha.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.939
Be aware, there are spoilers!

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.080
The movie begins with an old fisherman named
Matty Boyd alone on his boat on an isolated

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.349
part of the lake.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.370
He is clearly feeling relaxed and reaches
for a beer.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.570
Next, as a fish bites on his bait, rocking
the boat, the bottle falls into the water

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.510
and drifts to the bottom of the lake.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.340
As it comes to rest, an earthquake occurs.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.060
This causes a sizable split to open up in
the lake floor, which creates a whirlpool.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.140
A swarm of hungry piranha emerge from a newly-exposed
prehistoric lake below.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.410
He is unable to start his boat and falls into
the lake to be eaten by the fish.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.780
Our final glimpse of him is a ragged, heavily
gnawed and bloody hand that quickly disappears

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.379
below the surface.

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.170
Back in the town, the streets are alive with
spring break holiday makers looking to party.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.519
Jake Forester makes his way through the traffic
on a scooter, en route to pick up his younger

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.600
siblings Zane and Laura.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.430
He is then distracted by the presence of a
former crush, Kelly.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.269
The two of them are busy catching up when
her boyfriend, Todd, and his friend arrive

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.269
in a Jeep.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.520
Todd presses Kelly to hurry up, heavily mocks
Jake and ultimately throws his drink over

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.310
him before driving away.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.160
Embarrassed, Jake walks over to collect the
youngsters, to be greeted by Danni, an aspiring

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.180
actress.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.340
She compliments him on his Pixies t-shirt.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.420
He assumes her to be joking with him, but
she turns out to be friendly.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.420
As they are striking up a rapport, a wannabe
filmmaker Derrick Jones arrives.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.890
Upon learning that Jake is a local, Derrick
convinces him to join his crew as a guide.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.630
Later that night, we watch as Jake’s mum
- the town’s sheriff Julie - and her Deputy

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.710
Fallon search for Matty Boyd.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.330
As they attempt to haul in his boat, which
has come to nestle among some reeds, his heavily

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.320
mutilated body rises to the surface.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.640
In shock, they consider whether they could
possibly close the lake, given the presence

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.350
of thousands of visitors already in the town
and the economic importance of this holiday.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.810
The next day on a fishing excursion, Jake
offers to pay his younger brother and sister

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.830
to stay at home in order that he can join
Derrick and Danni on their boat.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.210
His sister proves a tough negotiator and demands
60 dollars to do so - 20 more than Jake himself

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.289
was due to make from babysitting.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.120
He accepts the deal, but heavily insists they
cannot use the phone, answer the door or leave

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.349
the house.

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.439
Back in the town, the quayside is a hive of
activity, with hundreds of young people drinking,

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.840
dancing and ready to party.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.950
At the centre of this are Danni and her co-star
in Derrick’s forthcoming movie, Crystal.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.739
They are dancing in a provocative manner,
to the delight of the crowd.

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.200
Before climbing aboard the boat to join them,
Jake runs into Kelly.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.400
Derrick, who clearly finds her attractive,
persuades her to abandon her boyfriend and

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.629
join the party.

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.480
He promises her champagne if she does so.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.319
Elsewhere, it soon becomes clear that Jake’s
plan for his younger siblings is not panning

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.319
out.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.379
They have defied his orders and set off for
a nearby island together in a long, red canoe.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.579
Unfortunately, as they are walking around
the island the canoe drifts away and they

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.209
are unable to recover it.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.250
As a result, they attempt to hail a passing
boat but they fail to attract the attention

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.650
of those on board.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.409
During one of these attempts, Laura cuts her
foot on some trash lying on the seabed and

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:08.849
begins to bleed.

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.499
Meanwhile, following a report of seismic activity
below the surface, a team of experts have

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:14.900
arrived to investigate.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.980
They are escorted to the site of the earthquake
aboard Julie’s launch.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.189
When they arrive the two divers, Paula and
Sam, descend into the depths.

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:28.030
Sam forges ahead and forces himself through
a tight gap and into the prehistoric lake.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.989
He is able to make out the eggs of the piranhas
but is quickly attacked and overpowered by

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.109
a group of them.

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.569
Paula soon meets a similar fate, but is pulled
to the surface and onto the boat by a third

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.729
member of the team, Novak.

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:43.110
Both he and Julie are shocked to discover
she is no longer alive.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.950
Much of her skin and an eye have been consumed
by the predators below.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.129
Not too far away, Kelly and Jake are still
enjoying the company of Derrick and his crew.

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.180
With the drinks flowing, Kelly is persuaded
to take a tequila shot with Crystal and the

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.450
two share a kiss.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.650
Jake is also invited to join the fun, but
at the moment he is about to take a slice

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.590
of lemon from Kelly’s mouth.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.819
Just then, she rushes to the side of the boat
to vomit.

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.370
She is clearly drunk and struggling to keep
pace with the others.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.959
Back on land, Novak and Julie take a solitary
piranha they have captured to the home of

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.919
Carl Goodman, a retired marine biologist.

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.169
Having poured the fish into a tank, Carl immediately
recognizes it and compares it to a fossil.

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.460
He explains to the others that this species
has been extinct for over 2 million years.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.440
They speculate how it may have survived for
so long below the surface without a food source.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.610
Carl asserts that this is probably due to
cannibalism, pointing out the scratches and

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.199
scrapes scarring the fish in his tank as evidence
for this.

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.479
Now certain of the danger facing those out
on the lake, Julie leads her group back to

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.509
the docks to try and disperse them.

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:51.449
Fallon fires his gun into the air in an attempt
to silence the crowd so he can audibly instruct

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.240
them to leave, but the lull in the music is
only momentary and the party continues.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.650
Hundreds of the college students completely
ignore his pleas and plunge into the water.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.750
Carnage ensues as scores of them are either
killed or maimed by both the piranhas themselves

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.070
and several accidents that occur as a result
of the chaos.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.010
Further out on the lake, Derrick and his cameraman
Andy, with support from Jake, have been filming

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.650
Danni and Crystal cavorting around in the
water.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.300
Derrick, who has been drinking heavily, is
irritated to see Jake stop filming, but Jake

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.370
has spotted Laura and Zane on a nearby island.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.510
Derrick is initially reluctant to help them
for fear of missing out on the action back

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.610
in the town.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.090
However, he soon changes his mind when he
learns that Jake’s mother is the Sheriff

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.389
of the town.

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.780
With Andy at the helm, they make it over to
collect the kids, but the propeller of the

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.280
boat becomes stuck.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.410
As they attempt to release it, some rocks
below the surface smash the boat’s glass

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.880
bottom that they’d been using to film the
girls swimming underwater.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.449
The force of the impact tosses Andy, Crystal
and Derrick into the water, where they are

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:56.080
immediately set upon by the predatory school
of fish.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.490
Derrick makes it out, but is delirious as
most of his lower half has been eaten away.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.569
Meanwhile, with the water gushing in and the
boat sinking Kelly cannot make it out.

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:09.830
She is forced to take shelter on a worktop,
trapped below deck.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.090
Back in the town, hundreds of stunned and
injured partiers are still trying to make

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.360
it to safety.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.639
Deputy Fallon begins shooting the fish in
an effort to assist.

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:22.669
He runs out of cartridges and picks up an
outboard motor instead.

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.849
He attacks the fish that are surrounding him
with it, slicing many of them up.

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.150
The water turns red with both their blood
and his own.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.479
Eventually they overpower him and he succumbs
to them.

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:37.270
Time is of the essence for Kelly, but help
is on its way.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.270
Julie and Novak arrive on a smaller boat and
Julie manages to clamber on to the bigger

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.090
vessel by rope, desperate to help her children.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.240
Jake, however, refuses to leave Kelly, announcing
that she wouldn’t be there if it wasn’t

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.240
for him.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.219
The kids follow Danni onto the rope.

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:56.560
With their mum at the rear, the four of them
begin to make their way towards Novak.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.939
Danni’s long hair is seen dangling precariously,
just above the surface of the water.

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:05.490
This gives the piranhas a chance to attack
and she is dragged into her death.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.600
The others make it across.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.699
Over the bigger boat, the resourceful Jake
realizes he can use Derrick’s corpse to

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:12.889
distract the piranhas.

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:16.860
After Derrick utters some rather confused
last words, Jake tosses his body into the

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.860
water.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.600
He uses this diversion to swim under the water
and join Kelly, still clutching the rope.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.560
Once inside, he sets off some canisters of
gas and tells Kelly to tie two flares together.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.370
They emerge from the boat and instruct Novak
to tow them to safety.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.220
As he desperately tries to start his engine,
the school of fish closes in on the pair.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.250
Jake sees this and wraps his arms around Kelly
to protect her.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.999
The engine springs back into life and the
smaller boat powers away, with Jake and Kelly

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:45.999
in tow.

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:50.780
Meanwhile, the flares cause the propane gas
to release to set alight, creating a huge

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.659
explosion in which thousands of the piranhas
are killed.

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:57.500
Once sufficiently far away from the fish,
the couple are reeled in and climb on board

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.500
the smaller craft.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.840
They are still alive and in reasonable shape,
although Jake has some blood on his back,

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:08.249
seeping through his t-shirt.The relief doesn’t
last too long, however, as Carl Goodman rings

00:08:08.249 --> 00:08:09.599
them up with news.

00:08:09.599 --> 00:08:13.870
He has discovered the fish in his tank are
yet to develop reproductive organs.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.370
It is merely a baby.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:20.159
Before this information can be fully processed,
in our last view of the lake, Kovak is snatched

00:08:20.159 --> 00:08:22.820
from the boat by one of the adult piranhas.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.780
It is enormous.
