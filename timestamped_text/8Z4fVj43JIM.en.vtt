00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:02.380
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:07.080
Today I will show you a sci-fi film from 2018,
titled Aniara.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.240
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.339
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:14.669
The ANIARA is an interplanetary spaceship
meant to take humans to the terraformed Mars

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.840
because the environmental collapse of Earth
has made the planet barely habitable.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.590
The effects of this crisis happening in the
distant future can be seen both on land and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.600
on the human population traveling off-world
in search of a better life.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.070
The vessel works as an all-encompassing traveling
hotel, which has everything one can possibly

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.870
imagine, from restaurants and malls to spas,
pools, and nightclubs.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.610
As the captain would later reflect, it's their
own little planet they have built inside of

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.940
a spaceship.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.530
In fact, as you will discover, every aspect
of the ship is meant to mirror life on Earth,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.780
both literally and symbolically.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.920
The main character whose experience we will
follow on the ANIARA is a Mimaroben or MR

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.000
for short.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.390
A Mimaroben is a person that works in a special
part of the ship - the Mima - that is meant

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.350
to give people an escape from the realities
of their current situation and virtually whisk

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.250
them away into a time when the Earth wasn't
destroyed.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.570
The technology is so potent that everyone
who steps inside the Mima room instantly falls

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.950
into a kind of daze that can only be avoided
by proper training to gain focus and control

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.570
over its effects.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.830
MR has had such training, but she can still
use the benefits of Mima and lose herself

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.590
inside it for a brief moment of surrender
before her shift begins.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.580
The Astronomer is one of the side characters
in the film that will reflect its darker themes

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.540
more directly later on, but for now, she explains
how the passengers can expect their journey

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.500
on the ANIARA to look like for the next three
weeks.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.340
The passengers are led into their rooms by
the personnel and aided to strap into their

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.820
beds until the gravitational load has adapted
to the vessel's cruising speed.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.610
MR will be sharing a bunk bed with the Astronomer
for what is to be a routine voyage for the

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.960
two of them.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.690
The beginning of the first hour on the ANIARA
goes on without a hitch.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.460
Some of the passengers have gathered before
the Mima to enjoy its effects, though, not

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.920
many are interested in them for the moment.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.880
MR takes the passengers inside the Mima room
and explains how it works.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.000
The Mima's control over one's consciousness
becomes more intense as one stays in its proximity.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.230
MR uses one of the passengers, Chebeba, to
show the rest what they can expect to see

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.230
once the full effects of Mima have entered
their minds, as well as their memories, and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.530
she does it through a tiny monitor device.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.380
Suddenly, the ANIARA experiences a critical
hit that pretty much destroys its propulsion

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.430
systems.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.550
The command bridge tries to do some damage
control by ejecting the fuel so they don't

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.810
explode, while the pilot, Isagel, observes
how their course has been dramatically altered

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.550
because of the accident.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.620
Some of the systems on the ship come back
online, but the trouble with ANIARA is only

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.200
just beginning as the captain will soon inform
everyone on board.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.300
The crucial information that the captain shares
with the passengers and everyone else is that

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.930
they no longer have control of the ship and
to get back on course they will have to wait

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.870
for a celestial body to use its gravity and
slingshot back on track.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.739
However, since they don't know when they will
be able to do that, the journey to Mars will

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.739
be prolonged from three weeks to a couple
years which naturally, doesn't bode well with

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.050
the passengers.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.209
To illustrate how some handle the news, we
see a woman in the next scene, Libidel, being

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.370
dragged into Mima by MR to calm her awful
panic attack.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.350
Chebeba is there to help, but she checks out
fast as well.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.060
It's week three since the accident and things
seem superficially calm on board the ANIARA.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.310
The passengers find different ways to escape
their daily realities on the ship, so Mima

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.920
also gets many more visitors than before.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.080
Realizing this new influx of customers, MR
wants to speak to the captain so that he could

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.980
assign more people to the Mima to help her
out.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.900
She gets stressed as well and can't sleep
so she goes to the pool to relax where Isagel

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.690
goes to do the same.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.310
MR is attracted to Isagel but doesn't know
how to approach her yet.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.310
When she gets back to her room she has an
illuminating conversation with the Astronomer,

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.780
who tells her something she probably would've
been better off not knowing.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.550
The old woman, in a very dry, matter-of-fact
fashion, tells MR that they will not be coming

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.830
in close contact with a celestial body any
time soon.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.030
In fact, she's sure the captain is aware of
that as well, but he's keeping the information

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.540
from the others to avoid the negative reaction
it can produce.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.049
MR also has trouble handling the fact that
they are doomed to drift in the vastness of

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.440
space for an indefinite amount of time, even
though, unlike most of the others, she has

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.760
no one waiting for her on Mars.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.909
She panics and tries to find some comfort
in alcohol and Mima, lying down in the fetal

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:22.889
position and finally drifting off in the virtual
space of the device.

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.360
MR isn't the only one suffering panic attacks
as we can see in the next scene, where a passenger

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.099
has also found out the same truth from the
Astronomer.

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:34.639
While trying to calm him down so she can take
him to Mima, MR drops another devastating

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.259
truth about the hellish life conditions on
Mars which he, fortunately, doesn't hear because

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.289
his translator knows better than to share
it with him.

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.259
MR takes the passenger to the already full
Mima and finds him a spot next to the others

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.689
while also managing to grab the security guard
just before he can fall completely under its

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:51.779
control.

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:56.050
Sometime later, she finally gets to see the
captain to make her request for assistance

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.020
in Mima, telling him that she will need around
5-6 people that will also need to be trained

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.020
to resist Mima's images.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.839
MR thinks that the influx of clients in Mima
will be even greater when the people find

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:08.099
out that they won't be able to turn back.

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.909
The captain agrees to grant her request and
tells her that the rest of the people will

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.819
be informed of the situation, once they get
used to eating the algae that will soon become

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:18.009
their only source of food.

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.189
After three years of drifting, the algae situation
on the ANIARA is causing a little bit of a

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:24.999
problem with the filtration systems on board.

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:29.689
The passengers are keeping it together somehow,
mostly by using Mima or other ways to divert

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:32.189
their attention away from their doomed state.

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:36.270
MR keeps falling more for Isagel, even though
she has one-night stands with men that mean

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.630
nothing to her.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.779
She talks to the Astronomer about what she
feels for Isagel, but the woman just diverts

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:46.139
the conversation into a fatalistic and defeatist
acceptance of the human condition and all

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.419
its marginal nonsense like love.

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:53.580
In her worldview, their lives, their loves,
and the ANIARA are just as minuscule and meaningless

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.869
in the vastness of space, as the little bubble
of air in her whiskey glass.

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:02.279
MR tries to escape those ideas in the comfort
of Mima, but as she will soon discover, the

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:05.860
device itself is no better at dealing with
their predicament than the humans seeking

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.319
refuge in her delightful calm as it can be
seen in the horrible images of the birds disappearing

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.490
or dying.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.499
The Mimaroben can't find what exactly is the
problem with the device as clients begin to

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:17.280
come in for a session.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.099
MR welcomes all, but Mima begins unraveling
once again, spouting what seems like nonsense

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:24.990
and causing terrible nightmares in the clients.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.379
MR sees the nightmares with her monitoring
device, first in one client, then in all of

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:33.710
them, and quickly calls quits to the session,
getting everyone out and not allowing anyone

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.530
in, regardless of how many have flocked to
enjoy the serenity of Mima.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.939
We see Libidel again, very disappointed that
she won't get into Mima for a session.

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:45.960
MR gets a scolding from the captain for closing
down Mima, even though she reminds him that

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.069
it needs to rest, considering it can see and
feel everything that the passengers have gone

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:51.069
through.

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:54.909
The captain doesn't care for her explanations
because he wants to keep the new ecosystem

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:57.909
on the ship working and Mima is a great part
of that.

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:02.309
MR continues to work with Mima, jotting down
everything that the magical device states,

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:05.809
as a kind of therapy to let it get out its
innermost thoughts about the horrible visions

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:07.470
it has received of mankind.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.800
Mima is on its very edge when people begin
to enter the room and don't respond to MR's

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.360
yells to get out.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.780
Libidel stares into the dying device when
it explodes in what was probably a way to

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.849
end its own life and suffering.

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:22.779
In the next shot, we see MR who is not taking
Mima's death easily.

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:26.779
But neither is anyone else on the ship with
Libidel already spreading rumors about MR

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.809
and her involvement in Mima's demise.

00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:32.870
Isagel goes to talk to the captain on MR's
behalf so that she doesn't get punished for

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.180
what happened, but since he needs a scapegoat
for his own wrongdoing, he's willing to accept

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.309
the rumors about MR as truth.

00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:44.619
The captain taunts Isagel in their conversation,
prompting her to hit him, so she gets arrested.

00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:48.559
And MR faces the same fate just some moments
later as the guards catch her in one of the

00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:53.500
hallways of the ANIARA and beat her up quite
gruesomely before they take her in custody.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.559
The fourth-year on the ANIARA rolls by and
things become truly dire.

00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:01.370
Some of the people on board, in need of any
kind of meaning and reassurance, begin to

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.889
form cults, while others commit suicide in
ever-growing numbers.

00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:09.240
Isagel and MR have gotten close during their
years of imprisonment and we can see them

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.610
now getting chosen to be part of the additional
staff of the ANIARA, tasked to maintain some

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.739
of the ship's most important systems and resources.

00:08:16.739 --> 00:08:21.489
The two of them, however, get different directions,
with Isagel getting back to Logistics and

00:08:21.489 --> 00:08:23.400
MR getting a teaching position.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.449
They even get new lodgings together which
just strengthens their bond further.

00:08:27.449 --> 00:08:31.300
When MR walks through the ship after her one-year
imprisonment, she can see how changed and

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.110
rugged it has become.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.820
Just like the cult of science which MR is
now a part of as a teacher, the other more

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.120
nonsensical ones continue to grow on the ANIARA.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.430
This is something that Isagel and MR find
out during a session in the spa when Chebeba

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.970
asks them to be a part of the Libidel and
the Libidellas cult.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:52.070
MR rightfully thinks that they would want
to sacrifice her for killing Mima, but Chebeba

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.420
tells them her cult believes that Mima killed
herself out of grief.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:00.029
In the next sequence of events, we see the
ritual to canonize Mima that begins innocuously

00:09:00.029 --> 00:09:03.790
with the ceremonial painting of their faces
and a prayer for Mima.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.449
Libidel leads the women of the cult into another
room where the men join them and opens the

00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:09.690
floor for a ceremonial gathering.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.300
The people of the Libidel cult have exchanged
the pleasure they would have received from

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.220
Mima for the pleasure they can now receive
from each other.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.580
While MR is fully immersed in the experience,
Isagel doesn't seem too excited for it but

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.370
sleeps with one of the men nonetheless.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:28.529
In the fifth year of ANIARA's endless journey,
Isagel and MR are expecting a baby but Isagel,

00:09:28.529 --> 00:09:33.240
unlike MR, isn't happy about it, dispassionately
reflecting on their hellish predicament on

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.269
the ship.

00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:38.490
In a bid to help Isagel and the others, MR
decides to build a beam-screen outside the

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.790
windows of the ANIARA to bring back the light
on the ship.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.430
Sharing that idea with the Astronomer, who
has been in a constant drunken stupor for

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.860
the last couple of years, isn't the smartest
thing she could do.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.710
The drunkard laughs at her, saying that she
wants to build a substitute for what itself

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.220
was a substitute.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.290
That doesn't stop MR from trying to get to
the captain and share her ideas with him.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:03.600
His reaction, while not as full of ridicule
as the Astronomer's, is a definite no, explaining

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.480
that her place as a teacher is infinitely
more important for the future generations

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.149
of the ship than that of a light beam, shielding
them from reality.

00:10:11.149 --> 00:10:14.889
MR needs to grow up because her baby is on
its way too as can be seen in the next shot

00:10:14.889 --> 00:10:17.550
of Isagel giving birth in their bathtub.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:22.079
After the baby is born, Isagel's doesn't get
any better, in fact, she's probably suffering

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:24.149
from post-partum depression.

00:10:24.149 --> 00:10:28.170
Taking a bath with the infant, Isagel is seen
holding it underwater for a bit longer than

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.170
she should, until she is called out to the
bridge.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:35.620
MR joins them there and she finds out that
some kind of vessel is approaching the ANIARA.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.000
Based on their observations, it is not a rescue
ship, regardless of what the rumors on board

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.390
might want to make it look like.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.460
Isagel and the captain are of the impression
that the vessel might be a probe carrying

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.910
fuel and fuel rods for the ship.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.529
Even Isagel is happy about that discovery.

00:10:50.529 --> 00:10:54.600
The ANIARA rejoices about a future in which
they can restart their engines and turn back

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.629
home when the vessel arrives in a year or
so.

00:10:57.629 --> 00:11:01.850
The sixth-year comes with a different attitude
and a different outlook on the ANIARA.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:06.230
The crew is getting prepared to grab the incoming
vessel they see as their saving grace by performing

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.930
simulations with the ship's grappling hooks.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:13.000
It's not a situation lacking in stress for
the commanding crew, considering how important

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.069
they see the mission, but at least the passengers
have some hope for the future.

00:11:17.069 --> 00:11:20.670
The vessel approaches finally and the crew
instructs the passengers to get into their

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:25.050
cabins and lie down because they will be upping
the gravity on the ANIARA considerably so

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.060
they can slow it down and grab it.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.160
The procedure starts with Isagel on the command
bridge.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.910
The vessel comes close to the starship and
they engage the grappling hooks as everyone

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.529
waits in suspense.

00:11:35.529 --> 00:11:39.480
They catch it successfully and reel it inside
the ANIARA with a whole team coming in to

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.680
inspect it.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.699
The vessel turns out to be a complete mystery
to everyone.

00:11:43.699 --> 00:11:47.610
In a briefing with the captain, one of the
younger engineers suggests that their methods

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.660
of investigating might actually be outdated,
while the second in command questions if they

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.339
should've even said that it was a rescue probe.

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:59.259
The captain, however, has an entirely different
outlook, primarily concerned with the psychological

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:03.040
wellbeing of the crew, noting how much their
motivation was umped when they heard about

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.139
the probe.

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:08.040
He even says that they should have lied it
was coming long before they actually saw one.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.670
MR's and Isagel's child is growing up happily,
with two mothers who have found a new joy

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.300
in life because of what they expect the probe
to be.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.779
However, that is soon to change when MR finds
the Astronomer drunk again at one of the bars

00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:21.050
on the ship.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.889
She knows about the probe and soon everyone
else will too.

00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:27.990
However, the way they try to extract data
from the probe, nothing comes up with any

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.990
answers.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.589
Luckily, the Astronomer is there to remind
everyone working on the probe to adopt a nihilistic

00:12:33.589 --> 00:12:35.889
attitude as she has once again succumbed to.

00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:40.731
In an ironic twist, the captain tells her
that she will be receiving an award for her

00:12:40.731 --> 00:12:44.220
discovery since she was the first one to see
the probe on the telescopes.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.870
He informs the rest of the people investigating
the probe that he will not be sharing their

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:51.939
lack of discoveries with anyone else and,
furthermore, the captain forbids them from

00:12:51.939 --> 00:12:53.440
sharing it also.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.350
The Astronomer aptly comments that they are
in a coffin hurling through space which angers

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.680
the captain enough to shoot her dead.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.569
MR reads the eulogy during the Astronomer's
funeral and the motivation and happiness that

00:13:03.569 --> 00:13:07.710
was felt by everyone before is seen leaving
their minds, just as the Astronomers body

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.160
is sent out to drift alone in space.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.810
One might think that MR would take her death
the worst, doing hallucinogenic drugs with

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.689
her friends, but they aren't doing that great
either.

00:13:16.689 --> 00:13:20.870
While the ANIARA is going through some kind
of space storm, MR goes dancing and falls

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:25.060
back to her old ways before she met and fell
for Isagel, leaving her alone in their room

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.320
with the baby.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:31.129
The storm creates another problem on the ship,
whose effects are seen in a momentary turbulence,

00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:34.360
with the aftermath of death reaching throughout
the entire ship.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.329
Libidel dies during the space storm like many
others.

00:13:37.329 --> 00:13:42.350
MR rushes into her quarters and finds Isagel
and the baby still alive, but not for long.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.839
Isagel isn't doing very well.

00:13:44.839 --> 00:13:49.389
Sometime later, the captain has at last given
MR the go-ahead to make her beam-screen outside

00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:53.420
of the ship so she continues working, trying
haplessly to keep it together.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:57.750
Isagel tries to be happy for her, but she
has other things on her mind.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:02.290
She sees how happy MR is and tells her that
she admires her for keeping her hopes up.

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:07.170
After many years of darkness, MR finally gets
her beam-screen running outside of the ship.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.490
She prances back happily to her room only
to be struck by the tragedy that has occurred

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.939
inside, of Isagel killing both herself and
their little child.

00:14:14.939 --> 00:14:20.939
10 years later, the ANIARA is still operational,
but with fewer passengers and even less enthusiasm

00:14:20.939 --> 00:14:22.759
than the previous years.

00:14:22.759 --> 00:14:26.800
After one of the most depressing parties to
happen in deep space, the captain still pretends

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.070
like everything is fine even when he has begun
cutting himself, saying that the ANIARA is

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.720
a pioneering ship.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.670
He calls MR on stage and gives her an honorary
medal for exemplary achievement for her beam,

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:42.480
but she isn't happy anymore, nor does she
care for the medal or the ship quite frankly.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.720
Even the algae don't care anymore.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:49.579
It is the 24th year since the ANIARA started
her journey into the unknown reaches of space,

00:14:49.579 --> 00:14:52.520
devoid of all meaning, and some of the people
still persist.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.680
However, they return to cultish and mystical
thinking, in their solemn surroundings.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.139
Almost 6 million years have passed with the
ANIARA drifting in space when it finally arrives

00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:03.620
at a celestial body.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:12.589
No one is alive on board to witness it happening.
