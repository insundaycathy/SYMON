Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:08.350
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of
the 2008 American monster film called 'Cloverfield'.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.480
The film is directed by Matt Reeves, produced
by J. J. Abrams, and written by Drew Goddard.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.839
The movie follows five young New Yorkers running
for their lives while battling giant monsters

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:21.739
and other lesser beasts in the streets of
the city while throwing a goodbye party.

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.939
Warning: there will be spoilers ahead, so
please proceed with caution.

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.089
According to the DVD presentation, the footage
seen in the film is that retrieved by the

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.990
United States Department of Defense, and it
bears a disclaimer that details numerous Cloverfield-like

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.890
creatures appearing in the area 'previously
known as Central Park.'

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.320
On older video, Rob awakens at Beth's father's
New York City apartment to have a wonderful

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.650
day before setting out for Coney Island with
her. A few little pieces of this overwritten

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.510
video occasionally emerge throughout the film.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.829
The gathering includes Jason's fiancÃ©e Lily
and Jason's brother, who are celebrating Rob's

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.730
new job in Japan. Hud shoots testimonials
for Rob as the celebration is in progress.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.340
Rob's prior relationship with Beth causes
a new man to attend the party. Rob and Beth

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.450
quarrel over who her visitor would be, and
during this argument, Beth flees just as a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.220
large earthquake strikes, creating a local
power outage. In the aftermath, the local

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.670
news reports a sunken oil ship in New York
Harbor.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.549
After the guests leave, the head of the Statue
of Liberty is thrown onto the road in front

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.369
of them. One of Hud's entries recounts a gigantic
monster destroying the Woolworth Building

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.439
in downtown New York City. When the creature's
tail destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, many additional

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.929
people die. It appears like the 42nd Infantry
Division, a component of the Army National

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.719
Guard, is fighting the monster. It comes with
smaller parasitic organisms that try to harm

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.889
people and troops nearby. [a]

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:47.759
As Rob listens to the voicemail message from
Beth, who is locked in her apartment in the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.229
Time Warner Center, he realises she is trapped
there and is unable to move. Rob, Hud, Lily,

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.429
and another party-goer, Marlena, travel into
Midtown Manhattan to rescue Beth, who is now

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.959
in a deserted section of the city. At 3:17
a.m., they are assaulted by parasitic beings

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.670
who rush into the subway, and find themselves
in a struggle with the monster. Marlena is

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.060
bitten by one of the monsters during the scuffle.
Bypassing the metro, the four make their way

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.750
to an underground mall, where she starts to
feel sick. They are captured by soldiers and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.820
brought to a military base and medical clinic
located nearby. Marlena is bleeding from her

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.950
eyes in response to being bitten. She explodes
in a tent, which is why she is in this state.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.870
Rob hopes to free Beth by influencing one
of the military commanders, but the result

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.160
is a trap that entraps them all. As he is
notified, the military's 'Hammer Down Protocol'

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.650
is triggered and the monster is killed.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.450
Beth was impaled on exposed rebar when she
arrived at her apartment building after it

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.880
had been knocked down. When they reach the
Grand Central Terminal evacuation location,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.550
they come face to face with the monster once
more. With only minutes to spare, Lily is

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.570
hurried aboard a Marine Corps chopper and
manages to escape. A few minutes later, Rob,

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.900
Beth, and Hud are evacuated by a second helicopter,
which also takes off in time to see the creature's

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.450
destruction. With the bombing, the creature
fell, and assuming victory, the participants

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.840
believed the task was over. In fact, the thing
continued to attack the helicopter in Central

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.790
Park, forcing it to crash.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.581
Fifteen minutes after the radio device aboard
the wrecked helicopter warns of the Hammer

00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:23.930
Down procedure, a voice announces the protocol's
beginning. The three companions come awake,

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.740
and one of them attempts to return to the
wreckage to grab the camera. They run into

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.221
the beast, who kills Hud. Beth and Rob pull
out the camera and duck under an arch, as

00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:37.420
bombs start to drop. Beth and Rob each give
their final statement of the day. Rob's camera

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.280
is buried in rubble when the bridge falls.
Before another bomb detonates, both Rob and

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.660
Beth declare their love for each other. Then,
all of a sudden, the monster roars and they

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.550
both scream while holding on for dear life.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.400
After the climax of Rob and Beth's journey
to Coney Island, the movie comes to a close.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.270
While the surface of the water looks calm,
an inaudible yet tangible item falls into

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.050
the water. During the film's transition from
one scene to the next, Beth says, 'I had a

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.320
nice day.'
