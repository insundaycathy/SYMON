00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.970
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.109
Today I'm going to show you an action, adventure,
sci-fi film called “The Day After Tomorrow.”

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.469
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:10.469
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.320
At the United Nations global warming conference,
paleoclimatologist Jack Hall warns delegates

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.580
of an impending global icing event that, according
to their findings, could occur within the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.670
next couple of centuries.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.529
Continual excessive use of fossil fuels, Jack
warns, could lead to warmer climates, which,

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.529
in turn, could lead to a new ice age.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.580
After the conference, Jack meets Terry Rapson
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.690
and the two share findings on their respective
fields.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.530
In Japan, a freak weather storm causes disruption
when huge blocks of hale rain on pedestrians.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.350
Back at Terry’s monitoring station, some
men detect a sudden drop in temperature in

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.530
the ocean.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.920
In the International Space Station, astronauts
note several massive storm systems forming

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.880
across the planet’s surface.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.059
Terry then notes the sudden drop in temperature
and sees even more temperature drops being

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.120
recorded.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.360
In New York, Jack’s son Sam arrives with
his friends, Laura and Brian, to join a decathlon

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.080
meet and notice a massive flock of birds all
flying westward.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.910
Terry later calls Jack and tells him his predictions
were not only correct but are happening sooner.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.750
Jack adds that an event similar to this hasn’t
happened in the last 10,000 years.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.030
At a weather monitoring center in California,
a technician gets word that hale has started

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.540
raining on the beach.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.710
He warns his colleague that they have to issue
a tornado warning in California.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.390
Not long after that, gigantic whirling pillars
of air form and decimate downtown, Los Angeles.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.490
This sudden weather phenomenon catches people
off-guard, and panic and destruction quickly

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.150
overcome the streets.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.460
As soon as it arrived, the giant tornadoes
dissipate, leaving Los Angeles in tatters.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.960
Back at the weather monitoring station, Jack
and his colleagues scramble to figure out

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.310
what has happened.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.150
They find out that areas across the globe
are all experiencing the same destructive

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.630
weather occurrences.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.140
Jack tells everyone that the mid-Atlantic
current could be the cause, and the weather

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.780
events won’t only continue but will worsen.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.600
Jack then meets with the vice-president and
tries to warn him but gets a cold shoulder.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.840
In Scotland, three military helicopters pass
through the eye of the weather system, and

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.200
their instruments start freezing.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.560
Helicopter rotors freeze mid-spin, and the
three choppers crash.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.980
A soldier survives and tries to flee but freezes
instantly the moment he opens the door.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.790
In New York, Sam and his friends are stuck
with all flights canceled.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.880
They try to use the subway, but the tunnels
are flooded.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.560
With no warning, a supermassive tsunami appears
wreaking havoc through downtown Manhattan.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.770
Jack and his friends flee to a library building
with countless other civilians lucky enough

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.800
to escape the storm surge.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.620
Terry and Jack communicate and learn that
the freezing air that brought down the helicopters

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.230
is from the upper atmosphere.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.750
Usually, this air would warm up as it descends,
but the weather systems are causing the air

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.320
to move down too fast, freezing everything
on the surface.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.630
They also find out that their predictions
were off, and the storm will be coming in

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.070
a few days, not in a few weeks.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.960
Jack shows the weather prediction, and three
massive weather systems are forming across

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.920
the globe, getting worse each day.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.670
This storm, Jack predicts, will change the
planet.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.069
Back in New York, Sam contacts his parents
through a submerging telephone line.

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.880
Jack tells him he must stay inside and wait
for the storm to pass as it’s only going

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.880
to get worse.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.400
He advises him to gather as much food and
insulation as he can.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.500
Jack then decides to head to New York to get
Sam.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.020
Jack then briefs the heads of state of the
situation and tells them the worst is yet

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.140
to come.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.880
He suggests evacuating everyone in the southern
states to Mexico.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.010
The vice-president disapproves of this, asking
Jack what he urges the people in the north

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.010
do.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.450
Jack answers that people in the north are
doomed to die if they set foot outside their

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.180
homes and advises they too must hold out and
stay inside until the storms pass.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.180
The president decides to take Jack’s advice
and orders the national guard to evacuate

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.430
the remaining population to the south.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.950
In New York, the refugees in the library spot
a crowd of people venturing into the frozen

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.940
icescape in hopes of reaching warmer states
before the snow gets deeper.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.970
Sam tries his best to warn everyone, telling
them they won’t survive in the storm and

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.070
that they should all stay inside, but the
crowd still decides to leave.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.130
Only Sam and a handful of people are left
in the library.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.160
After a heartfelt phone call to his wife,
Jack sets off for Manhattan with two Frank

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.889
and Jason, his two colleagues and friends.

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.520
At the Mexican border, vast crowds of Americans
are trying to cross the border, even traversing

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.970
the Rio Grande.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.030
Back at the library, Sam and his companions
raid vending machines for food and gather

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.440
books for burning in the fireplace.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.350
Jack and his crew eventually run into a roadblock
and have to make the rest of the way on foot.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.820
Being researchers stationed in the north pole,
Jack, Frank, and Jason are used to walking

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.910
long distances in the cold.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.120
The men are trekking on top of a building
when Frank breaks the glass and falls in.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.880
He gets caught by their lifeline but sees
that more of the roof is giving way.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.970
Jack tries to pull him up as Jason holds the
weight, but Frank sees the glass cracking

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.350
and decides to cut the line to save his friends,
sacrificing himself.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.800
In the library, Laura gets a fever and falls
unconscious.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.360
The group tries to figure out what’s happening
to her and discovers that she’s potentially

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.230
suffering blood poisoning from a wound infection.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.630
She needs an immediate injection of penicillin,
or else her injuries could lead to amputation

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.840
or death.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.850
Sam decides to head out to a nearby cargo
ship that got washed in to look for medicine

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.020
and food.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.320
Brian and another guy, J.D., decide to accompany
him.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.980
At a military base, the vice-president finds
out the president has died.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.610
Researchers also get word from the International
Space Station that the weather system affecting

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.230
North America has moved over to New York.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.360
It would soon be pulling supercooled air from
the upper atmosphere to the surface, freezing

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.430
everything.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.840
Jack and Jason make their way through New
York, but Jason collapses from exhaustion,

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.580
and Jack has to carry him.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.030
In the library, the trio also heads out to
the grounded cargo ship, unknowingly putting

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.960
themselves in harm’s way when a hungry pack
of wolves catches their scent.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.960
Sam, Brian, and J.D. make their way to the
ship’s mess hall, and Brian finds penicillin.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.150
As they rummage through the kitchen, the wolves
come in and attack J.D. Brian and Sam fight

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.930
the wolves and save J.D. but get stranded
inside the mess hall.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.660
With J.D.’s foot mangled, they must find
a way back to the library.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.640
Sam sees the sky clearing up and deduces they’re
in the eye of the storm.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.889
Sam then plans to make his way outside and
lure the wolves away from the mess hall.

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:24.280
He then runs through the ship, narrowly escaping
the wolves, and doubles back to Brian and

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.820
J.D. Sam and Brian drag J.D. rushing into
the library, seeing frost and ice descending

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.790
from the sky.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.750
Meanwhile, Jack drags Jason with him and sees
the sky clearing up and realizes they’ll

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.380
get caught in the eye.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.600
Knowing everything will freeze soon, he hurries
to find an open vent and throws Jason inside

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.470
before throwing himself in just as the ice
descends.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:49.330
Sam, Brian, and J.D. make it into the library
in the nick of time but see the frost entering

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.449
the room.

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:54.620
They scramble to get the fire up, throwing
more books and wood in, desperately getting

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.070
the room to warm up.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.889
Jack also struggles, knowing a fire is the
only thing that can save him and Jason.

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:03.590
Jason wakes up and sees ice all around him.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.340
He sees Jack had managed to start a fire using
an open stove.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.919
With the eye of the storm already passed,
Jack is determined to continue into Manhattan.

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:15.380
The two rest for a night, contemplate the
future of humanity.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:21.180
Jack says humanity survived the last ice age,
but if careless, might not survive this one.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.949
In the International Space Station, astronauts
confirm the storm is dissipating, seeing landmass

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:28.700
appear on the surface for the first time in
days.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.650
Jack steps out of their tent and sees a massive
ship frozen in place.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.240
They start their trek again, walking past
the statue of liberty.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.919
The pair finally reach the city and see the
whole bay frozen and the city buried under

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:41.760
several meters of snow.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.740
They find the library, barely visible out
of the snow, and find the fireplace where

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.460
Sam and the rest are sleeping with a burning
fire keeping them alive.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.200
Jack and Sam are finally united.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.400
In Mexico, the heads of state receive transmissions
from Jack, informing them of survivors.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.389
The president then addresses the nation, telling
the country that survivors have been found

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:03.470
in New York despite tremendous adversity.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:08.360
A vast search and rescue operation is underway
to retrieve anyone stranded in the northern

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.930
states.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.300
Helicopters finally reach Jack and the group,
and they fly south.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.699
As they pass through Manhattan, they see more
surviving pockets of populations on rooftops

00:08:17.699 --> 00:08:18.699
awaiting rescue.

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:24.009
In p[the International Space Station, an astronaut
looks down upon the changing planet, remarking

00:08:24.009 --> 00:08:32.529
the sky is the clearest he’s ever seen.
