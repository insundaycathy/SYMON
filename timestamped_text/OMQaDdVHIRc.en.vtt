00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
i think they kind of get lost in their
 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.390 align:start position:0%
i think they kind of get lost in their

to<00:07:24.560><c> me</c><00:07:24.880><c> yeah</c><00:07:25.280><c> you</c><00:07:25.440><c> can</c><00:07:25.680><c> just</c><00:07:25.840><c> hand</c><00:07:26.080><c> it</c><00:07:26.240><c> over</c><00:07:26.400><c> but</c>

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
to me yeah you can just hand it over but
 

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:27.990 align:start position:0%
to me yeah you can just hand it over but
i<00:07:27.120><c> guess</c><00:07:27.360><c> not</c>

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
i guess not
 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.670 align:start position:0%
i guess not
now<00:07:28.240><c> i</c><00:07:28.400><c> think</c><00:07:28.639><c> it</c><00:07:28.720><c> will</c><00:07:28.880><c> be</c><00:07:29.039><c> a</c><00:07:29.120><c> big</c><00:07:29.280><c> point</c><00:07:29.520><c> in</c>

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
now i think it will be a big point in
 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.510 align:start position:0%
now i think it will be a big point in
season<00:07:30.080><c> three</c><00:07:30.319><c> that</c><00:07:30.479><c> we</c><00:07:30.560><c> will</c><00:07:30.800><c> see</c><00:07:30.960><c> them</c><00:07:31.199><c> going</c>

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
which is why they brought it up here i
 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.909 align:start position:0%
which is why they brought it up here i
could<00:07:34.880><c> of</c><00:07:34.960><c> course</c><00:07:35.280><c> be</c><00:07:35.520><c> wrong</c>

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
could of course be wrong
 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:37.909 align:start position:0%
could of course be wrong
but<00:07:36.319><c> this</c><00:07:36.560><c> is</c><00:07:36.639><c> one</c><00:07:36.800><c> of</c><00:07:36.880><c> the</c><00:07:37.039><c> big</c><00:07:37.280><c> plot</c><00:07:37.520><c> threads</c>

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
but this is one of the big plot threads
 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:39.430 align:start position:0%
but this is one of the big plot threads
that<00:07:38.080><c> is</c><00:07:38.240><c> still</c><00:07:38.400><c> left</c><00:07:38.639><c> dangling</c><00:07:39.039><c> by</c><00:07:39.199><c> the</c><00:07:39.360><c> end</c>

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
that is still left dangling by the end
 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.390 align:start position:0%
