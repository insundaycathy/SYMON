00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.289 align:start position:0%
led you here
so<00:02:52.739><c> yeah</c><00:02:53.099><c> this</c><00:02:53.250><c> with</c><00:02:53.430><c> this</c><00:02:53.519><c> video</c><00:02:53.880><c> better</c><00:02:54.120><c> be</c>

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 align:start position:0%
so yeah this with this video better be
 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.180 align:start position:0%
so yeah this with this video better be
good<00:02:54.480><c> I</c><00:02:54.510><c> guess</c><00:02:54.780><c> now</c><00:02:55.319><c> what</c><00:02:55.560><c> the</c><00:02:55.709><c> machine</c><00:02:56.010><c> are</c>

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 align:start position:0%
good I guess now what the machine are
 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.250 align:start position:0%
good I guess now what the machine are
