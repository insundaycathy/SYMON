00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.440
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.189
Today, I'm going to explain a horror and mystery
film called "Mother!".

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:06.410
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.109
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.930
A woman stands amid crackling flames, with
a tear falling down her face.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.090
People scream as her flesh burns to a crisp.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.320
Meanwhile, after his first wife's death, a
man named "Him" is a well-known poet suffering

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.750
from writer's block.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.410
With his hands covered with dusty charcoal,
he puts a crystal piece in his office.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.050
The house then goes from being burned down
and rundown to being a wholly renovated home.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.200
A young woman named "Mother,” appears in
his bed and, upon noticing his absence, calls

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.160
out to him, calling him “Baby.”

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.220
He doesn't respond so, and she walks through
every part of the seemingly deserted house.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.540
As she steps out onto the porch to check on
him, he surprises her by approaching from

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.050
behind and hugging her.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.871
Mother asks Him why he didn’t wake her up,
to which he responds that he wanted to be

00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:49.100
alone to clear up his head for his writing.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.480
She kisses him, trying to be intimate, but
he refuses and gets himself into the shower

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.710
instead.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.390
She goes back to the house and continues renovating
it.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.470
Mother attempts to paint one of its rooms
in a variety of bright colors.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.039
As she approaches the wall, she notices scratches
on it and sees a vision of a pulsating heart

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.239
within it.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.920
That night, Mother joins her husband in his
office while he is working on his novel.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.360
She silently observes him as he is trying
to formulate some ideas when suddenly, someone

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.750
knocks on their front door.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.500
A stranger named "Man" introduces himself
as an orthopedic surgeon.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.860
The writer openly welcomes the stranger into
their home without asking his wife, and he

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.330
even offers some drinks.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.729
The writer is courteous to Man, but Mother
is not pleased with his presence.

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.230
She offers to make them some tea while the
two continue chatting about her.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.230
The Man presumes that she is his daughter.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.830
While Mother makes tea, she experiences dizziness
and hears a loud ringing in her ears, causing

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.640
her to drop the cup and make a mess.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.350
The ringing suddenly stops.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.530
She serves the tea and joins their conversation.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.680
The Man directs their house under the impression
that it was a bed-and-breakfast.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.020
The stranger will stay as long as he finishes
his research as a doctor.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.990
The writer invites the stranger to spending
the night in their house for a while as the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.439
house is too big for the two of them alone.

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.600
Mother looks surprised at how his husband
impulsively acts in the situation, but she

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.909
can't do anything.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.390
She reluctantly agrees to let the stranger
stay.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.810
As she sees the Man about to light his cigarette,
she informs him that smoking is not allowed

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.340
inside the house.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.000
Later that night, while Mother is in the basement
to grab some linens for the visitor, she hears

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.369
soft rumbles in the dark.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.899
She checks it and sees a stone wall, wondering
where the sounds are coming from.

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.480
As she approaches the wall, a loud stomp transpires
from it, and the woodstove near her suddenly

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.930
lights up with fire.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.290
She goes back upstairs and fixes the guest
room.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.980
Meanwhile, the writer shows the Man his office
filled with his written works.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.459
The Man confesses that he admires his works.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.620
Man notices the crystal piece, and when he
is about to touch it, the writer precedes

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.030
to get it, telling the Man that it is a fragile
and extraordinary gift.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.290
He reveals that the crystal is the only thing
left from ashes when everything burned down

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.090
by fire when he was younger.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.159
As the Man tries to touch the crystal from
the writer's hand, he holds it tighter as

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.120
he continues to tell the Man that it gives
him strength and it brings back life like

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.249
how Mother does in his life and their house.

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:45.870
The Mother smiles at Him.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.290
However, the Man only coughs severely loud
and hard.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.760
At midnight, Mother wakes up without Him at
her side.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.730
She rushes through the guest room, and there
she sees her husband comforting the Man as

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.879
he continuously coughs his lungs out.

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.200
She seems worried and notices a chunk of flesh
missing from the Man's back.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.680
Her husband immediately covers it with his
hand while letting her out of the room.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.059
Despite being baffled, she sees Man's lighter
and tosses it off the drawer.

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:08.799
She hears the ringing once again and hallucinates.

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.430
As she walks, the ringing grows louder and
louder.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.689
She heads to the bathroom and makes her yellow
drink to help her hallucinations cease.

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.389
Soon enough, the insufferable ringing in her
ears disappears

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.430
The next day, Mother inquires about the Man's
well-being.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.439
The writer tells her that the Man feels better,
and he's delighted to have someone to talk

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.159
to who appreciates his work.

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.239
The Man walks in and lights up his cigarettes
as if nothing happened last night.

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.559
He even tells her that he feels terrific.

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.670
A few moments later, the doorbell rings from
the entryway.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.360
Mother opens the door, and there appears "Woman,”
who happens to be Man's wife.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.489
Man greets her with kisses, and Him invites
them for breakfast.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.590
Despite feeling neglected by his husband,
Mother still prepares breakfast for all of

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.590
them.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.489
While eating, the strange couple appears to
be intimate with each other and asks them

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.659
why they didn't have any kids.

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.150
There is a silence for a second, and then
Mother tells them that they are still too

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.469
busy to have a child, and the writer supports
her answer immediately.

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.959
While the strange couple is away, Mother confronts
Him about how he summons strangers to stay

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.540
in their house as long as they want without
asking her permission.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.059
However, the writer just walks away.

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:10.760
Later that day, Mother is left alone with
Woman while her husband and Man go for a hike.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.699
The Woman bothers Mother with many questions
about whether she and Him want children and

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.919
why the Mother minds fixing the house instead
of buying a new one.

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.180
Based on Mother's expression, the visitor
confirms that it is Him who doesn't want children

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.259
and not her.

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.800
The Woman even desires to visit the writer's
office, but Mother refuses to let anyone in

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.240
without his permission.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.289
They do their laundry, and suddenly, the Woman
asks Mother about the couple's intimate life,

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:31.580
which she doesn't answer.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.310
Woman leaves the room as the tension between
them arises.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.039
After doing her laundry, Mother heads into
the guest room in search of the woman.

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.919
Disgusted by the mess of the strange couple,
she fixes their trash and cleans the toilet.

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.650
The toilet isn't working, so she plunges it,
and to her surprise, an unknown creature is

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.759
stuck in it.

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.360
When she pokes it with a stick, blood pops
and she flushes it down the toilet.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.870
While leaving the room, she sees a picture
of her husband inside the Man's luggage.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.620
Meanwhile, the Man has another coughing fit
when they return from the hike.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.770
Mother confronts Him about what she saw inside
the Man's luggage, and Him informs her that

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.310
the Man is dying, and he confesses to him
earlier that he and his wife are huge fans

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.389
of the writer.

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.039
They want to meet Him before it is too late.

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.090
At the same time, Man and Woman enter his
office, and the crystal piece is accidentally

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.090
shattered.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.090
Him rushes to his office.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.250
Feeling distraught, he orders them to leave.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.389
The writer clutches the broken pieces in his
hands until he bleeds.

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.590
On the other hand, Mother tells the couple
to leave, but they go into another room to

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.020
have an intimate conversation.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.460
Him, then, finally leaves his office, with
his things covered with cloth.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.810
He knocks out its doorknob and seals the door
with a large piece of wood.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.990
Mother rushes into the guest room to ask them
to leave once more, and the half-dressed Woman

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.409
opens it, giving her an unwilling attitude.

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:39.139
The woman says she needs to check her husband
for coughing, and then she slams the door.

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.610
A little while later, a young man knocks on
their door.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.350
He says he is looking for her mother, who
is the Woman.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.470
Mother is shocked at how suddenly there are
many strangers in their house.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.419
Another man arrives, who happens to be the
young man's older brother.

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.650
They start arguing about their father's will,
and the elder son is enraged at receiving

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.340
less than his younger brother.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.979
As the confrontation escalates, the elder
son punches his brother, prompting the writer

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.729
to intervene between them, and helps to calm
down the older brother.

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.569
However, the quarrel continues as they rush
into the bedroom, where the elder son smacks

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.590
his brother's head, causing his skull to crack
and bleed.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.460
Mother witnesses everything as she tries to
stop them from breaking things inside her

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.460
house.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.320
With Man and Woman following, the writer picks
up the younger brother and offers to carry

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.940
him to the hospital.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.430
Despite Mother's pleas not to leave her alone,
Him insists that he needs to be there, leaving

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.639
the traumatized Mother alone.

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.169
Fearing that the older brother might come
back, she locks every door in the house.

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.189
She cleans up the blood on the floor, but
there's one spot where the stain won't wash

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:33.189
off.

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:36.300
When she presses against it, it begins to
leak blood into the basement.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.430
Mother returns to the basement to check it,
and she notices blood leaking into a light

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.910
bulb, which shatters upon switching it on.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.099
Blood splatters on the stone wall forming
an arc-like passageway, which she breaks with

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:47.350
a tool, revealing a smaller dungeon.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.620
When Mother gets through the opening, she
perceives a furnace oil tank.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.669
Suddenly, she hears a glass shatters from
upstairs.

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.080
She goes upstairs to check where it came from,
and she sees a scribbled picture of his husband

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.080
on the floor and picks it up.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.630
The older son, who has been hiding behind
her, emerges.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.029
He simply takes his wallet and walks out of
the house, wishing her good luck.

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:08.300
She rushes to call for help, but then her
husband comes home.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.909
That night, Him comforts her as he sees how
terrified she is from what happened.

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:14.879
He then informs her that the younger son is
no longer alive.

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:18.330
The writer organizes a wake for the younger
son in their house, with more strangers attending

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.879
to pay their respects.

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:22.889
Mother knows that if she protests against
it, he won't listen to her, so she lets them

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:24.500
hold the wake in their house.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.660
She shares her empathy with the Woman, but
the Woman resents her, saying that the Mother

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.289
will never understand how she feels for she
doesn't have any child on her own.

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:35.029
More visitors arrive, and she becomes increasingly
irritated by their behavior.

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:38.159
They do not listen to her and keep on invading
their privacy, while some even try to make

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:39.590
love on their bed.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.509
Some visitors would try to flirt with her,
and someone even painted their house without

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:43.650
her permission.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.699
Finally, when the strangers intentionally
break their sink, causing the water to burst,

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:50.169
she snaps out and orders everyone to leave.

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:53.740
Later that night, Mother continues cleaning
up their mess all over the house.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.759
She and the writer argue about their guests
and how selfish he has been in deciding things

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:58.150
without her consent.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.559
Their argument is cut short when they start
having passionate intercourse.

00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:04.900
The following day, Mother informs Him that
she believes she is pregnant.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.610
He is delighted and now motivated to resume
his writing.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.720
With the thought that everything will be alright,
now that they're having their child, Mother

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.599
throws her yellow drink into the toilet, hoping
that she won't need it anymore.

00:08:14.599 --> 00:08:17.830
Several months have passed by, and everything
seems back to normal.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.319
Mother would take care of the house while
her husband is doing his work.

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:23.400
One morning, she runs to her husband to have
a look at the baby bump.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.570
She finds her husband standing on the porch,
holding his finished work.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.809
They are both delighted, and while she is
reading the novel, her eyes signify pure joy

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:31.620
as she imagines his writing.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.110
She sees a vision of them in a deserted burnt
down place, and at the moment he holds her

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.289
hand, and everything brings back to life.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:39.000
She says that the novel is perfect.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.360
However, she wonders if she is going to lose
him.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.370
The Herald, his publisher, rings their phone
to congratulate Him about his work.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.990
He seems busy with his work again while Mother
continues fixing the nursery room and notices

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.370
that there's a bloodstain on the floor again.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.440
Time has passed, and Mother is nearing the
end of her pregnancy.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.670
While wearing her flowy white dress, she prepares
dinner in celebration of his husbands’ success.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.010
Suddenly, the writer's fans begin to arrive
outside their house.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.250
The writer seems so ecstatic by the compliments
of his fans, while Mother is worried that

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.399
they would invade their place once again.

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:09.510
More and more people arrive at their house.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.260
She panics and locks the door.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.820
She is surprised by a woman who walks in with
her toddler, who has wet his pants.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.470
So, she points them where the bathroom is.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.589
In the bathroom, she notices a man peeing
in the sink, asking for some privacy.

00:09:20.589 --> 00:09:24.160
There are strangers everywhere doing the strangest
things she could ever imagine.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.970
Soon, a slew of fans, including the Herald,
arrive at the house, eager to speak with Mother,

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.510
whom they have acknowledged as the writer's
inspiration.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:35.180
Mother feels a pain that causes the house
to shake as a result of their growing presence.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.940
Meanwhile, despite Mother's best efforts to
remain hidden from the crowd, the fans begin

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.070
to break and steal items from the house.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.420
On the other hand, fans seem to worship Him
as they fall in line with Him to get marked

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.550
by the writer.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.940
He looks happy and seems no remorse towards
what is happening inside their home.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.420
Finally, she manages to get away from the
crowd for a moment, and she sees a vision

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.029
of the beating heart that turns into a half-burnt
heart.

00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:58.149
She then gathers some of her belongings and
decides to leave the house.

00:09:58.149 --> 00:10:01.230
While on her way out, people begin to act
violently toward one another as she moves

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.670
around every room.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.090
They continue to destroy their amenities,
and people keep on arriving.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.910
The writer finds her and is surprised that
she is leaving until she is about to give

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:09.910
birth.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.920
They search for a room to allow Mother to
give birth when suddenly a cop shows up a

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.100
disperses pepper spray in their eyes, breaking
them apart.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.820
She continues searching for Him.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.230
She then ends up in a room where people lie
down, hand-cuffed, and their heads are covered

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.360
with bags.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.610
The Herald casually shoots their heads and
as they calmy converses with her.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.800
Suddenly, a massive blast that rips through
the room kills the Herald.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.120
As she walks through the dead bodies, a S.W.A.T.
team arrives, battling the growing horde of

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.120
fans.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.519
A soldier helps Mother to locate a safe place.

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:39.470
Unfortunately, someone shoots him, leaving
Mother behind.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.300
Afterward, the Mother looks frail as she is
about to give birth anytime.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.790
She crawls over the remains of strangers when
all of a sudden, Him appears.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.030
He picks her up, and they search for a place
where she could give birth.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:53.050
Upon their searching, they find a room full
of sick people as if they are experiencing

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.050
a plague.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.940
A woman recognizes the writer and worships
Him, drawing all the attention on them.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.620
Finally, He takes her to his office, where
she gives birth to a son.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.389
The moment their baby begins his first cry,
the clamors of people outside ends.

00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:07.050
There is silence for a while.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.209
He heads out to check what is happening, but
he comes back with a fruit basket given by

00:11:10.209 --> 00:11:11.240
the people.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.510
He tells her that the people are waiting for
him, which annoys her, and asks Him to let

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.370
them go, but he refuses.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.610
His desire to hold his son is strong, but
the Mother won’t allow him to do so unless

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.300
he dismisses his fans.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.610
Mother spends the entire day in the office
with her son, holding him near her chest while

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.230
her husband is right there waiting for her
to fall asleep.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.290
When she wakes up, the baby is gone.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.850
He brings their son to show the audience,
and they begin passing the baby around.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.769
The baby is crying out loud, as well as the
Mother as she is apprehensive about him.

00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:39.430
Suddenly, the crowd breaks the baby’s neck.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.519
Mother hears it and rushes in front of the
room in a panic.

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:46.140
When she arrives, she discovers that her baby
has been mutilated and eaten by the fans.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.350
Mother screams angrily, causing the foundation
of the house to crack.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.720
She snatches a piece of glass and begins stabbing
and slashing them until their leader grabs

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.920
her and whacks her in the head with a candlestick.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.459
The fans brutally strike her and tear off
her clothes, calling her names.

00:11:58.459 --> 00:12:01.800
The writer rushes in to stop them, sobbing
as he holds his wife.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.649
Mother screams at Him, accusing Him of butchering
their child.

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:07.680
He continues to defend his fans, causing an
outburst from Mother.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.270
Then, her vision of a half-burnt-heart turns
into a wholly burnt one.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:15.680
Meanwhile, Mother dashes down the stairs to
the basement, where she finds the oil tank.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.060
Before taking out a lighter, she breaks it
open and lets the oil flow out.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.860
Him begs Mother not to do anything, but she
refuses and throws the lighter in it.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.390
Before everything around the house explodes,
the entire house bursts into flames, burning

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.029
everyone inside into ashes.

00:12:28.029 --> 00:12:31.670
Still, Him and Mother make it out alive, but
Mother is severely burned while the writer

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.130
remains unharmed.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:36.520
Mother's body is carried out by Him, which
prompts her to ask who he is.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.350
He tells him he is taking her to the beginning,
but he needs her love to start over.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.449
Despite everything that happened, Mother still
loves Him.

00:12:42.449 --> 00:12:45.680
He digs his hands to her chest and pulls out
her heart, shattering her body into burnt

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.890
ashes.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.930
He crushes the heart in his hands, revealing
a crystal piece similar to the previous one.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:54.639
He chuckles to himself as he places it in
the same spot in the ruins of his office.

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:57.050
The house transforms from ruined to brand
new once more.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:01.650
A young woman forms in the bed, calling out
to her husband, exclaiming, "Baby?”

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.990
Like many stories before, this represents
something bigger than it is.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.670
This story is an allegory about Mother Nature
and the destruction that she’s experiencing,

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.529
based heavily upon passages from the Bible.

00:13:10.529 --> 00:13:14.710
It begins with Mother being born from the
fire, representing Mother Nature herself.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.630
She looks for her husband, Him, the representation
of the Creator or God himself.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.959
In this case, the house can be seen as a representation
of the Earth.

00:13:21.959 --> 00:13:25.509
Mother is seen constantly caring and fixing
up the house, just as Mother Nature is constantly

00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:28.180
growing and building the Earth as a paradise.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.250
This paradise comes to an end when Man suddenly
shows up, who is a big fan of Him and his

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.250
book.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.400
Him lets him in but doesn’t allow Man into
his study and forbids him to touch the crystal.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.060
In this part, Man represents Adam who has
come to Earth and reading the Bible, worshipping

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.060
Him, or God.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.370
Him’s study represents the Garden of Eden
where the crystal sits as the Forbidden Fruit.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:49.079
Woman, representing Eve, arrives and makes
herself comfortable in the house.

00:13:49.079 --> 00:13:53.100
When she sneaks into the study, this represents
Eve being tempted by the Forbidden Fruit.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.580
Man and Woman manage to touch the crystal
and break it.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.630
Him is furious and asks them to leave.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.770
This represents Adam and Eve falling into
temptation and being banished from the Garden

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.420
of Eden by God.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.399
The two brothers soon arrive, representing
the biblical brothers, Cain and Abel.

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:09.230
They argue and one brother eventually ends
up killing the other.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.110
The guilty brother leaves the house.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:15.240
This is parallel to Cain killing his brother,
Abel, and leaving his home to wander for life.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.319
As they mourn the brother’s death, more
people arrive at the house and start misbehaving.

00:14:19.319 --> 00:14:21.970
This represents how humans are now abusing
Mother Earth.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.100
The water flooding the house signifies the
Great Flood that washed out the first humans

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.610
off the Earth.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:30.079
Mother becomes pregnant, but more of Him’s
fans storm the house, continually destroying

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:31.480
what Mother has built.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.759
The people don’t care as they are too busy
worshipping Him.

00:14:33.759 --> 00:14:37.110
This means the continuous growth of humans
has lead to even further destruction of the

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.110
Earth.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.120
They are too busy preaching the words without
doing all of the actions needed.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.670
A soldier tries to help Mother but he is killed.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:47.070
This represents the actual people trying to
make a difference but is defeated by the overwhelming

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.579
population.

00:14:48.579 --> 00:14:52.250
Mother gives birth to a baby boy, a representation
of the birth of Jesus.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.050
Mother has given a new gift to the people,
but they abuse him.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:58.970
Just like in Jesus’s story, instead of following
his words, the people crucify him, leading

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.050
to his death.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.850
Mother becomes furious and starts killing
off people.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:06.730
This signifies Mother Nature giving back all
the destruction that humans have given her.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.670
The house ends up burning everyone including
Mother, except for Him.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.259
He rips out her heart and takes the crystal
from within.

00:15:12.259 --> 00:15:15.750
Him reconstructs everything, forming a new
Mother, thus continuing the never-ending cycle

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:25.869
of beginnings and endings.
