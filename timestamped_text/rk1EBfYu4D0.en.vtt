00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.440
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.&nbsp;
Today I will show you a horror,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.720
mystery film from 2014, titled Last Shift.
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.720
Outside of a police station, Jessica is sitting&nbsp;
in her patrol and talking to her mom on the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.360
Her mom is worried that she's become a police&nbsp;
officer like her dad, who died on duty. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.200
doesn't want to talk about that on her first&nbsp;
day of work so she ends the conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.120
Jessica enters the station with a bit of&nbsp;
hesitation. There seems to be no one there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.800
so she goes inside to look. She hears some noises&nbsp;
and sees a man in the distance, cursing. Jessica&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.360
speaks to him, but he tells her to turn around&nbsp;
and stop. When he eventually walks over to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.880
he introduces himself as Sgt. Cohen. He tells her&nbsp;
that this isn't the new station, but the old one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.040
She was the lucky rookie to work the last shift&nbsp;
there. Cohen explains that all the calls have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.040
already been rerouted to the new station. She&nbsp;
may have some walk-ups that she should send&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.160
his way. In case of an emergency, she should&nbsp;
call the station. Cohen shows her the kitchen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.280
but tells her not to go into holding. Jessica asks&nbsp;
him why she's there instead of a security guard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.960
He explains that she has to be there because&nbsp;
she needs to take care of the evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.280
Hazmat will come to the station sometime during&nbsp;
the night to dispose of it. He orders her not to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.280
leave the premises and tells her that he'll&nbsp;
relieve her when her shift is over. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.400
Jessica is reading a book and almost falls asleep.&nbsp;
Suddenly, she notices something wrong with one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.960
the lights in the hallway, when the phone rings.&nbsp;
She gets a distress call from a woman saying that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.280
she's trapped and that all of the people with her&nbsp;
might be dead. When she asks for the address the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.640
woman hangs up. Jessica immediately calls the new&nbsp;
station. Since she didn't obtain the necessary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.400
information from the caller, they just tell her&nbsp;
that they'll check on the call and if the calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.720
have been properly rerouted. She hears something&nbsp;
in holding and walks over to check it, thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.120
that it might be Cohen. Jessica reaches the place&nbsp;
where the sounds of banging are coming from,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.520
but finds nothing there. Later, she eats her&nbsp;
lunch in the kitchen and finds a long strain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.080
of hair inside her sandwich. Suddenly, there's&nbsp;
a knock on the front doors, but when she goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.880
check there is no one outside. When she turns&nbsp;
around, there is someone inside the station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.560
Jessica tells him to leave the station&nbsp;
and sees that he's peeing on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.720
She takes out her baton and tries to communicate&nbsp;
with him, but when that doesn't go anywhere she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.000
chases him out. Jessica cleans the station and&nbsp;
after that goes to the bathroom to wash her hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.480
She hears weird noises in the pipes and sees a&nbsp;
pair of boots. Jessica leaves them outside for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.280
the homeless man. When she comes back inside,&nbsp;
she hears another noise. She finds one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.840
bathrooms completely wrecked, then goes through&nbsp;
to the station gym and into the locker room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.400
One of the lockers still has a key in it and she&nbsp;
opens it up, only to find a photograph inside of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.520
her and her father. She closes the locker and sees&nbsp;
that all of the others have been opened. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.720
there's another call. It's the same woman begging&nbsp;
for help. Jessica gets her name and she tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.200
that she has been taken on a ranch, then hangs&nbsp;
up again. There is another call instantly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.120
but this time it's the waste removal company.&nbsp;
The man tells her that they will be running a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.680
little late. Jessica calls the new station&nbsp;
again and tells them about the second call.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.040
They say that the girl isn't calling 911, but the&nbsp;
station directly. And if she calls again Jessica&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.160
should tell her to call 911. Jessica continues&nbsp;
to read the handbook, waiting for another call,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.280
when suddenly the raft behind her starts to move.&nbsp;
She checks it, though she finds nothing wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.320
As soon as she sits down it unrolls again and rams&nbsp;
into the other rafts. Jessica hears another noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.400
out back and follows up on it. She sees that one&nbsp;
of the doors has been opened and hears another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.040
noise inside, so she calls it in before she goes&nbsp;
to investigate. The only thing she gets back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.680
from the station is a song. There's another&nbsp;
noise and an alarm turns on in the station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.320
Jessica is reciting lines from the handbook as&nbsp;
she approaches the site where the sound came from.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.480
She goes into a trashed room and when a box&nbsp;
almost falls on her, she sees that the homeless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.400
man has entered the facility. He's looking&nbsp;
for something not paying attention to her so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.440
she climbs up to get him. She incapacitates him&nbsp;
and arrests him. Jessica takes him to holding,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.160
but he keeps resisting her so she drags him in.&nbsp;
The doors slam shut and the sounds of screaming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.360
can be heard outside. The man assaults her and she&nbsp;
stuns him. Jessica realizes that she's locked in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.400
the cell and calls for someone to open the door. A&nbsp;
strange face appears on the window, scaring her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.440
drop the flashlight. Suddenly, the homeless man&nbsp;
has the flashlight and he's aiming it at her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.080
She reminds him that she's armed. The flashlight&nbsp;
lights the corner to reveal the homeless man still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.560
unconscious. Jessica asks who's in there&nbsp;
with them. A child's voice can be heard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.880
She bangs on the door again and the voice asks&nbsp;
her if she wants to get out of there alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.360
Jessica asks for her flashlight, then everything&nbsp;
goes dark again and two figures are seen next to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.520
her. The lights come back on and the cell&nbsp;
door is open. She goes out and locks the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.560
prisoner in, then tries to calm herself down.
Later, Jessica calls Cohen and when he doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.880
answer she leaves him a message, but doesn't&nbsp;
tell him what happened. She pushes back to try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.680
and relax, but sees the word SOW etched out on the&nbsp;
ceiling. When she checks the doors of the station,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.480
she sees a woman outside and tells her to leave.&nbsp;
Marigold asks to finish her cigarette there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.320
because she feels safer and Jessica&nbsp;
lets her. Before she walks inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.720
Marigold says that she can tell she's a rookie.&nbsp;
She tells her that she was in a cell next to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.720
Paymon murderers that killed themselves in the&nbsp;
station, who had kidnapped and slaughtered some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.120
girls. Jessica knows about the case because her&nbsp;
father got killed on the scene of the crime and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.280
she knows that the criminals died there too.&nbsp;
Marigold insists that they brought them back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.360
alive to the station and she could hear them&nbsp;
sing some weird song in the cell next to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.600
They hung themselves with their bed sheets.&nbsp;
Marigold finishes her smoke and leaves Jessica&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.040
speechless. She patrols the station and finds a&nbsp;
switched on TV. The TV plays a police interview&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.680
with the Paymon brother that had committed the&nbsp;
heinous crime mentioned. Two other TV's come on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.320
playing interviews with the Paymon sisters. John&nbsp;
Paymon is seen in a flashback, talking about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.360
devil. The flashback of the interviews continues&nbsp;
with the sisters, both saying similar things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.760
John makes an absurd threat on the recording,&nbsp;
as if he could be speaking right to Jessica.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.000
Suddenly, one of the chairs swings over to her and&nbsp;
for a moment it looks like someone is sitting on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.600
it. It keeps on doing that until it knocks Jessica&nbsp;
over. The phone rings and she rushes to answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.520
It's the same girl saying that the other girls&nbsp;
have been killed. The people that have done that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.800
keep singing the same song that Marigold told her&nbsp;
about. Jessica tries to make the girl call 911,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.760
but she tells her that she can't, so Jessica&nbsp;
tells her to run and hide. Before the call ends,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.720
Jessica asks the girl if she's heard the name&nbsp;
John Paymon and she says that she has. Jessica has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.440
started connecting some of the dots, so she calls&nbsp;
the new station again and conveys all the details&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.680
of the call with the girl. She tells the officer&nbsp;
on the other side of the call that she thinks that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.000
the remaining members of the Paymon family might&nbsp;
have her. He laughs and tells her that all of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.560
are in custody under constant police supervision.&nbsp;
He gives her the number of a police report and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.040
tells her to reference that report number when she&nbsp;
calls again if she gets any more information. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.760
thanks him and hangs up. All of a sudden she hears&nbsp;
whistling from the other side of the station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.960
Jessica checks on a room with some office chairs,&nbsp;
but gets distracted by more noise. When she looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.680
back, the chairs have been completely rearranged.&nbsp;
Jessica has had enough and thinks that the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.560
police officers are playing a trick on her because&nbsp;
she's a rookie. Suddenly, the bell of the station&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.200
rings and when she goes to check, there is one&nbsp;
officer there. She begins asking him if it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.360
just him that played the prank on her or were&nbsp;
there others as well. He doesn't seem to know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.240
she's talking about. Jessica asks if they play&nbsp;
that same trick with other rookies as well. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.200
introduces himself as Price and he tells her that&nbsp;
he just came to check up on her. Price asks her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.000
let him in. They walk inside the station together&nbsp;
and chat. She thinks that someone made him check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.560
up on her. But when he asks her how her shift&nbsp;
is going she tells him about the homeless man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.040
He laughs and says that he's had worse than that,&nbsp;
with one perp defecating all over his police car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.600
once. Jessica relaxes a bit and he tells her that&nbsp;
he actually came to check up on her because he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.960
knew her father. She asks him if he was with him&nbsp;
that night. Price tells her how it all went down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.640
They arrived early at the scene, but they&nbsp;
could hear the girls begging for their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.320
The two of them went inside without back&nbsp;
up and her father held the Paymon's off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.640
while he managed to get some of the girls out.&nbsp;
He tells her that two officers died there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.440
including her father. Price says that her dad was&nbsp;
a good cop and that he'd be very proud of her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.760
When he turns around she sees a massive hole in&nbsp;
his head and as he walks by the window outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.280
he vanishes. Jessica goes to check where he went&nbsp;
and calls after him. Suddenly, she hears voices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.320
coming from all around the station. Circling her.&nbsp;
Suddenly she sees a body being moved inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:10.000
hallway. It begins to levitate and it moves in an&nbsp;
unnatural way. Jessica hides for a moment, pulls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.800
out her gun and when she steps out to check if the&nbsp;
man is still there, he's gone. All of a sudden,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.360
she hears the homeless man screaming in his cell.&nbsp;
He begs to be let out of there and when she asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.320
him what's wrong, he steps aside and shows her&nbsp;
the three ghosts in his cell. Jessica keeps saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.120
that it isn't real. The man cries and pleads with&nbsp;
her not to leave him in there. She hears the song&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.280
again and when she reaches the place where it's&nbsp;
coming from, she sees a group of girls sitting in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.760
a circle and singing. The ghost girls turn around&nbsp;
to face her with bloody sheets on their faces,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.160
while their reflections look normal. The&nbsp;
door shuts behind her and they disappear.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.720
Jessica hears another racket outside and goes&nbsp;
to the evidence room. She finds it completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.520
trashed, with some male clothes placed out in the&nbsp;
center. Jessica runs over to the phone and calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.160
Cohen. He asks her why she's calling him and she&nbsp;
tells him that she thinks she's seeing things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.720
Jessica doesn't think she'll be able to finish&nbsp;
her shift. Cohen belittles her about being afraid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.040
and asks her again if she'll be there by the&nbsp;
end of the shift. Before he hangs up, he tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.760
her not to call him again. She calls the waste&nbsp;
disposal company to ask when they will be there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.120
When the man tells her that he's not sure,&nbsp;
she tells him that she'll be waiting for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.880
them outside in her squad car. Jessica leaves the&nbsp;
station, but the phone rings so she rushes inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.880
It's the girl again telling her that she's&nbsp;
escaped. She tells Jessica that she sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.280
some kind of sign and Jessica keeps her on the&nbsp;
line while calling dispatch from her cell phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.520
The girl says that she knows that she's going to&nbsp;
die and Jessica asks her if there is something she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.400
could use as a weapon. She disconnects again.&nbsp;
Jessica calls the new station and references&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.560
the number that was given to her earlier. The&nbsp;
same officer picks up the phone and tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.040
that the girl that has been calling the station&nbsp;
is dead. Jessica can't believe it. The officer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.280
tells her that she was the last Paymon victim&nbsp;
and was beaten to death with a bat. He says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.360
maybe some of the members in the Paymon commune&nbsp;
might have avoided capture and is paying a sick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.680
joke on her or it might be ghosts. The officer&nbsp;
tells her that the Paymon's killed themselves in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.520
the station and that ever since then there have&nbsp;
been strange things happening in the station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.320
A photograph drops behind Jessica and she hangs&nbsp;
up the phone. It's a postmortem photo of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.360
dad. She sees more photos on the ground from the&nbsp;
Paymon crime scene of the girls that died there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:16.240
There is also one of Price. Jessica closes her&nbsp;
eyes for a moment hoping it will go away, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.880
when she opens her eyes the photos are arranged&nbsp;
neatly in the hallway. Jessica hears screams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:26.480
inside her mind as the mug shots from the Paymon&nbsp;
family are seen. Suddenly, the photo's catch fire.&nbsp;

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.440
Jessica wakes up on the hallway floor to her phone&nbsp;
ringing. Her mom is on the other line, saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.320
that she's sorry for bringing up her father.&nbsp;
Jessica notices her gun is missing. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.640
she sees someone in the hallway and when she&nbsp;
follows them, she gets knocked out. She wakes in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.760
an interview room with a woman. Jessica isn't sure&nbsp;
what's real anymore. The woman tells her that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.000
would do anything for John Paymon and that it was&nbsp;
her that he should've taken with him that night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.400
She asks Jessica if she's seen him there and tells&nbsp;
her that she has too. Then the woman says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:59.120
she's there to celebrate the one year anniversary&nbsp;
of his death and kills herself with Jessica's gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.360
The phone rings again and Jessica walks by&nbsp;
the body, takes her holster and her gun back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.320
then gets to it. It's the same girl on the&nbsp;
phone. When Jessica tells her that she's dead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.160
the girl starts laughing and the sound of the&nbsp;
bat hitting her can be heard over the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:17.040
The sound continues around Jessica and when she&nbsp;
looks under her desk, she sees the girl's ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.160
Jessica hides in the rafts and the ghost follows,&nbsp;
searching for her. She finds Jessica and tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.280
that she doesn't want to die. The ghost vanishes&nbsp;
and Jessica runs to the door, wanting to get out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.960
She can't unlock the door, nor shoot her way out.&nbsp;
Her phone rings. Her dad is calling. He tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.600
that she's driven like him, but asks her why she's&nbsp;
trying to leave when he gave his life for the job.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.240
Jessica apologizes, saying she won't. He tells&nbsp;
her that the man that killed him is still in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.480
the building and that she needs to do something&nbsp;
about it. The homeless man suddenly walks past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.520
by her. She asks him how he got out and tells him&nbsp;
to get down. When she goes to cuff him, he turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.640
into an apparition. Jessica checks the homeless&nbsp;
man's cell, only to find him dead. The words&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.960
"King of hell" are written on the walls. Jessica&nbsp;
tries to call the new station for assistance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.600
but she gets only static on her radio, then a&nbsp;
scream and the song again. Blood comes out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.920
the radio and a ghost appears next to her. She&nbsp;
sees a projection of the Paymon's doing some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.400
kind of ritual in their cell and then killing&nbsp;
themselves. Johns turns toward Jessica and takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:19.280
off the sheet. The ghosts are suddenly next to her&nbsp;
and on the projection as well. Price appears as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.560
well and shoots himself. John almost gets her, but&nbsp;
she finds a photo of her father and recites parts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.280
of the law enforcement codex. Her dad calls her&nbsp;
again and tells her that they're coming. He says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:34.560
she needs to stop them, whatever it takes. A few&nbsp;
men in hoods appear and she shoots at them. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.200
tell her to come and find them. Jessica searches&nbsp;
for them and ends up in the evidence room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.440
She hears them again and goes after. Jessica&nbsp;
shoots one and continues after the others.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.160
She takes out another one and incapacitates&nbsp;
another. He starts talking about the devil and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.520
she shoots that one as well. Suddenly, she gets&nbsp;
shot too. Cohen appears behind her with his gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.080
raised at her. She turns and sees that the man&nbsp;
she killed was from the waste disposal company.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.040
The real events play out in a flashback. Jessica&nbsp;
can't believe it. She's killed all the guys from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.280
the company that were supposed to come and take&nbsp;
care of the evidence. Cohen calls the situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.760
in, while Jessica sings the Paymon's song.&nbsp;
The three Paymon ghosts appear and take her.
