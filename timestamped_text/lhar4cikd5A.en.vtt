00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.780
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:07.110
Today, I'm going to show you an action, adventure,
sci-fi film called “Armageddon.”

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.550
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.470
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.639
On a routine mission repairing a satellite,
a team of astronauts suddenly get bombarded

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.750
by high-speed projectiles, damaging their
shuttle and killing them instantly.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.891
NASA is caught in complete surprise by the
sudden tragedy, but they immediately start

00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:24.400
an investigation.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.900
They spot a large number of incoming bogeys
headed for the eastern United States.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.940
In New York, people are going about their
daily business when huge balls of fire rain

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.309
upon the city.

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.989
The streets are filled with panic, people
are running for their lives, and buildings

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.359
are destroyed.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.879
Within a matter of seconds, the city is reduced
to a fiery mess of rubble and debris.

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.960
At NASA, missions director Bob Thurman addresses
the U.S. president on the situation.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.879
They’ve found that the meteor shower that
hit the astronauts and the eastern United

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.709
States was the front end of a massive asteroid.

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:59.629
The incoming asteroid, according to their
estimates, is about the size of the state

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:00.839
of Texas.

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.159
Bob warns the president that the meteor has
the potential to end all life on the planet,

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.810
calling it a global killer.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.600
They have just 18 days to figure out a solution
before it hits.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.829
On an off-shore oil drilling platform in the
South China Sea, company owner Harry Stamper

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:16.200
plays golf.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.329
He tries to hit a small barge of protesting
activists, laughing at them, pointing out

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.340
how their barge consumes a large amount of
diesel every hour they protest.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.420
His crewmate, Chick, informs him that one
of the drills has malfunctioned and Harry

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.890
immediately knows it’s AJ’s fault.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.009
Harry heads to AJ’s quarters and barges
in.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.140
AJ springs up from bed and apologizes for
what happened.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.560
Harry is immediately suspicious as AJ never
apologizes this quickly.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.069
He quickly suspects something and upon inspection,
sees his daughter Grace in AJ’s bed.

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.159
Harry gets his shotgun and chases AJ through
the platform, shooting at him.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.740
AJ dodges the shots, and tries to tell Harry
that he’s in love with Grace.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.289
Harry doesn’t listen and keeps shooting
until a ricochet hits AJ.

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.749
Grace rushes in and tries to help.

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:06.229
At NASA, everyone is trying to figure out
a solution for the incoming asteroid.

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.590
They exhaust their ideas, ranging from placing
solar sails on the asteroid, to firing lasers,

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.230
but nothing seems like a viable option.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.010
Back on the platform, Grace scolds Harry,
telling him he can’t keep controlling her

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.010
life.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.030
As they entertain clients Grace tells Harry
that she likes AJ and her decision to be with

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.269
him stands.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.030
She argues that she’s been around roughnecks
all her life, and it would not be so strange

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.890
for her to fall for one.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.110
In NASA’s meeting room, heads of the military
meet with scientists, and head of research

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.640
Doctor Ronald Quincy proposes a solution.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.080
The presidential advisers suggest firing multiple
nuclear rockets at the asteroid to change

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.239
the trajectory, but Ronald advises against
it.

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.480
At the asteroid’s current size and velocity,
the rockets would do very little.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.080
He suggests drilling into the asteroid and
placing a nuclear warhead inside it.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.480
Upon detonation, the asteroid would break
apart and miss the planet.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.030
For this, they would need the help of the
best deep core drilling team on the planet.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.489
The military then arrives at Harry’s drilling
platform and takes him and Grace to NASA.

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.480
Bob then briefs Harry and Grace on the situation
and asks them for help regarding the plan

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.360
to drill into the asteroid.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.430
Bob shows Harry a prototype drill, and Harry
immediately recognizes it as his design.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.120
Bob tells Harry they’re intending to send
two teams of astronauts, and Harry has to

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.260
train them to use the drill since he’s the
best at drilling.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.739
Harry then responds saying he’s only the
best because of his team.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.209
He offers help but would rather have him and
his team be sent out to space rather than

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.520
the astronauts.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.629
He informs Bob that drilling is an extremely
difficult job and can only be perfected through

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.290
years of experience.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.660
Bob agrees and Harry lists everyone he wants
on the team.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:51.231
The FBI then picks up Bear, Max, Rockhound,
Oscar, Chick, and AJ. Bob gathers them and

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.800
informs them of the impending doom.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.659
They’re all mortified to know about the
asteroid and the suicidal plan to save the

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.420
planet but realize they don’t have a choice
but to say yes.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.160
The team is then placed through a rigorous
physical and psychological evaluation process,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.370
and everyone fails almost every aspect of
the evaluation.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.799
Bob, seeing the results, still says they should
move forward.

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.470
The team later meets with Colonel Willie who
will train them on the mental and physical

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.190
rigors of space flight.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.550
The team is placed in high-speed fighter jets
and subjected to neck-breaking speeds to simulate

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.380
gravitational forces.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.520
The team then trains underwater to simulate
weightlessness.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.190
They also meet other various trainers, preparing
them for other aspects of the mission.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.770
At the mission briefing, they learn that they’ll
intercept the asteroid with help from the

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.170
moon’s gravity.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.930
The two shuttle teams would then land at different
locations and start drilling to 800 feet before

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.770
placing the nuclear bomb inside, taking off,
and detonating the bomb remotely.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.510
They must detonate the bomb before a certain
point, after which the asteroid would still

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.760
hit Earth even after getting blown up.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.920
The two teams will both get their own drills
outfitted to a Martian exploration rover dubbed

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.180
the Armadillo.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.660
Later, Harry looks for Grace and he finds
her with AJ at the flight hanger.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.320
He sees them sharing an intimate moment and
decides not to disturb them.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.800
AJ later proposes to Grace.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.580
The rest of the team sees Harry, and they
confront him about his treatment of Grace.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.320
They tell Harry that he should loosen up on
Grace and allow her to grow up.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.380
Bear argues that they feel like they all helped
raise Grace and believe they should be heard.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.250
They perform underwater simulation, with the
team being split into two.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.840
AJ, Oscar, and Bear would be with the shuttle
Independence.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.950
Harry, Chick, Rockhound, and Max would be
on-board the shuttle Freedom.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.150
After a training mishap, Harry confronts AJ
and warns him this is no time for any errors.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.280
Harry then requests some time to let the team
spend time with their families.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.720
The day of the launch comes and the whole
world holds its breath for the brave souls

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.350
launching into the stars to save humanity.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.310
The president gives an address wishing luck
to the men.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.350
The teams get into their respective shuttles
and get into position for launch.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.190
The shuttles launch successfully and they
later dock with the Rssuan space station to

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.190
refuel.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.650
They meet with cosmonaut Lev Andropov and
set up the fuel transfer.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.030
Lev tasks AJ to head down to the fuel pod.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.310
A leak occurs and the fuel pod catches fire.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.720
Chaos erupts and everyone rushes back to their
shuttles to evacuate.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.710
AJ and Lev get left behind as everyone makes
their way back.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.190
The two men make their way through a small
shaft and eventually get to the shuttle in

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.600
the nick of time.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.170
As Independence and Freedom fly off, the Russian
space station breaks apart.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:33.860
The two shuttles initiate a slingshot maneuver
around the moon, enduring fatal gravity forces

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.970
and make a path for the asteroid.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.940
They finally spot the asteroid and both teams
are in awe of what they’re seeing.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.770
The two shuttles then try to land but run
into a large debris field.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.720
Independence takes a hit and NASA listens
helplessly as the men call out.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.120
Rocks bombard the shuttles and the crew on
the Independence try to make their way to

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.220
the cargo bay but the shuttle loses all control.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.440
Independence crashes and all hands appear
to be lost.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.120
Freedom also crashlands into the asteroid
a few minutes later.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.650
The Freedom crew is all accounted for but
have missed their landing zone and landed

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.310
on an impenetrable portion of the asteroid.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.090
NASA struggles to regain radio contact with
both shuttles.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.990
Under the wreckage of the Independence shuttle,
AJ finds a dead Oscar.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.340
Lev calls out to him and they find Bear.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.000
The three men are all that remains of the
original shuttle crew.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.440
The Freedom crew takes out their Armadillo
and starts drilling through the hardened surface.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.680
They get no farther than ten feet of drilling
before the drill bit breaks.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.970
Communication with mission control gets reestablished
but is faulty.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:37.390
In the Independence, AJ, Bear, and Lev get
into their Armadillo and begin their journey

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.000
for the Freedom.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.970
The Freedom replaces the drill and immediately
starts drilling but the transmission blows

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.030
up and they have to replace it.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:49.050
Willie asks Harry about the progress and he
informs him of the setbacks.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.330
Willie then rushes to convey the information
to mission control but Harry follows.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.220
Harry and Willie get into an altercation and
the communication cuts off again.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.790
After seeing the drilling has failed, the
president orders the remote detonation of

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.310
the nuclear bomb.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.500
The military advises Bob to evacuate the men
off the asteroid as they’ll have to detonate

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.280
the bomb in five minutes.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.420
Bob calls the president telling him detonating
the bomb would have no effect on the asteroid’s

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.800
trajectory but the order remains.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.460
In the Freedom, the nuclear timer starts beeping
and Willie comes in telling everyone to evacuate

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.310
because the president just activated the bomb.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:26.260
Willie orders Harry to have the men return
or else they’ll get left behind.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.190
Harry tells Willie that if they don’t get
the bomb into a hole deep enough, the explosion

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.740
would have minimal effect on the asteroid.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.409
Everybody starts shouting and Harry grabs
a wrench to break the timer but Willie draws

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.750
a gun and points it at Harry.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.949
Back in NASA, Bob orders one of his men to
discreetly deactivate the connection between

00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:45.000
the signal on Earth and the nuke.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.050
They succeed and are able to buy a few minutes
of time but the military catch on and bring

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.670
the timer back online.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:55.209
In Freedom, Harry tries to convince Willie
to let them do their job.

00:08:55.209 --> 00:08:59.420
He tells him that if the nuke explodes now,
everyone on Earth would still die.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:04.089
With less than a minute left, Willie decides
to help him deactivate the timer manually.

00:09:04.089 --> 00:09:08.959
They open up the bomb and Willie sifts through
wires, trying to disconnect the proper connections.

00:09:08.959 --> 00:09:14.069
The timer beeps faster, nearing zero, and
Willie has to decide which wires to cut.

00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:18.079
With seconds on the timer, Willie cuts the
wire and the timer stops.

00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:21.629
Freedom reestablishes connection and Harry
tells NASA they’re going to continue with

00:09:21.629 --> 00:09:22.959
the mission.

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:27.310
The Independence survivors are stranded in
a ravine but AJ gets an idea to float over

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.980
it, using the asteroid’s reduced gravity.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.779
They throttle up their Armadillo and jump
the ravine, soaring above it.

00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:37.910
They soon realize they have no control and
the thrusters start malfunctioning.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.990
Lev heads out to manually override them and
they eventually land safely.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.970
The Freedom crew repairs the drill transmission
but Rockhound starts screwing around with

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.149
the equipment.

00:09:47.149 --> 00:09:51.819
He finds a remote controlled machine gun and
starts firing blindly at the asteroid.

00:09:51.819 --> 00:09:55.519
Rockhound is clearly experiencing some sort
of mental breakdown and believes they’ll

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:57.329
all die on the asteroid.

00:09:57.329 --> 00:10:00.960
Harry manages to disable him but the asteroid
starts cracking.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.360
This causes the Armadillo to explode, launching
it into space with Max still inside.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.330
They’re now left with no drill, and Harry
sends word to NASA that they’ve failed.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.000
On Earth, the public is informed and everyone
tries to prepare.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.120
A huge chunk of the asteroid hits Paris, destroying
the city.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.340
As Harry and his team prepare to leave, they
spot the Freedom’s Armadillo arriving, and

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.740
they start cheering.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.660
They inform NASA and immediately start drilling
again.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.779
With their final chance, the team works together
to get the hole to 800 feet.

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:34.100
The team succeeds and now sends the bomb down
the hole.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.930
The asteroid starts breaking apart and the
men get thrown around and some of the men

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:38.930
die.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.560
Willie sees that the remote detonation for
the bomb has been damaged and means that someone

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.480
would have to remain to detonate the bomb
manually.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.990
In the shuttle, the men decide to draw straws
to see who will do it.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.439
AJ draws the short straw.

00:10:51.439 --> 00:10:56.360
Harry takes AJ down to the asteroid but as
they get down, Harry pulls AJ’s oxygen supply

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.779
and gets forced to return to the shuttle.

00:10:58.779 --> 00:11:02.300
Harry takes the detonator and tells AJ to
take care of Grace.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.569
Harry steps out and heads to the bomb.

00:11:04.569 --> 00:11:07.490
The shuttle prepares to leave and Harry calls
Grace.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.310
He tells her that he won’t be able to return
and Grace tells him she loves him.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.970
Harry says his final goodbyes and ends the
communication.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.699
The shuttle engine goes online and the flight
begins.

00:11:17.699 --> 00:11:21.589
They ascend, getting out of the blast range
and heading for Earth.

00:11:21.589 --> 00:11:26.450
On the asteroid, Harry sees the Earth one
last time before pressing the button to detonate.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.899
The asteroid blows up, breaking apart and
passing by the planet, missing the Earth by

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.350
400 miles.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.220
The Freedom announces they’ll be heading
home.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.589
People on Earth witness the spectacular explosion
and cheer.

00:11:38.589 --> 00:11:43.470
The folks at NASA are ecstatic, shouting and
cheering, congratulating each other.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.910
The shuttle lands successfully and the team
is greeted on the runway.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:56.740
AJ and Grace run to each other’s arms as
the crowd watches meteors fly across 

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.429
the sky.
