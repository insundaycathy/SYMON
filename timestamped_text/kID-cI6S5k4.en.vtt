00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.640
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain a Horror film called "The Mimic."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.360
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.280
A man anxiously drives along the road to Mount&nbsp;
Jang in search of a secluded spot as his female&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.200
companion asks him in a panicked voice if he&nbsp;
knows where he's going. Distracted by the woman's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.600
nagging, the driver runs over a dog on the dark&nbsp;
road, prompting him to hit the brakes. He grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.840
the dead animal and opens the car trunk, where he&nbsp;
is keeping his wife captive. The wife tearfully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.680
begs her husband not to kill her, but he ignores&nbsp;
her pleas and throws the dog inside the trunk.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.920
When they arrive at their destination, the man&nbsp;
smashes a brick wall covering the entrance to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.240
a cave. When the mistress reaches the site, she&nbsp;
staggers back in horror as she witnesses the wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.640
drawing her last breath. After putting the wife's&nbsp;
body inside the cave, they suddenly hear her voice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.040
as they walk back to the car. When the man removes&nbsp;
a loose brick to take a peek inside, he hears his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.440
wife's voice again, followed by several other&nbsp;
voices, including their own. The man and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.960
mistress turn and run, leaving the loose brick&nbsp;
on the ground and a small opening to the cave.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.080
Hee-yeon and her husband Min-ho decide to&nbsp;
move to Mount Jang in the hopes that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.360
would help Hee-yeon's senile mother, Sun-ja,&nbsp;
recover her memories. While relaxing outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.920
Sun-ja sees her granddaughter, Jun-hee,&nbsp;
approaching her, but she mistakes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.640
child for her sister. Sun-ja starts hearing voices&nbsp;
coming from the woods, so she warns the child that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.880
something terrifying is nearby. She hurries back&nbsp;
to the house, taking her granddaughter with her.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.520
After shopping for groceries, Hee-yeon sees&nbsp;
an unkempt child walking on the streets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.560
She notices that the boy is wearing&nbsp;
the same shoes worn by her missing son,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.240
Jun-suh, so she tries running after him. Failing&nbsp;
to catch up to the child, Hee-yeon goes back home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.160
and unpacks Jun-suh's belongings, hoping to&nbsp;
find clues that would help her find her son.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.160
She tells Min-ho that she wants to start looking&nbsp;
for Jun-suh again, but Min-ho discourages her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.160
noting that the boy has been missing five years.&nbsp;
Hee-yeon tearfully reminds him of his vow to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.680
up the search, so Min-ho promises to ask the&nbsp;
authorities to continue looking for the boy.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.640
One day, a brother and his sister stop by&nbsp;
Hee-yeon's house searching for their missing dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.560
Hee-yeon tells the kids that they had mistaken&nbsp;
her family's dog, Mong, for their missing pet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.720
but she encourages them to keep looking. When the&nbsp;
boy comes across the path leading to the cave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.880
he hears a dog barking, so they follow the&nbsp;
path. Along the way, they see an abandoned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.240
car with a damaged windshield stained with&nbsp;
blood. Upon reaching the cave entrance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.200
the girl reaches into the hole in&nbsp;
the wall, calling out to their dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.280
Unable to see anything, the girl uses her&nbsp;
cellphone to shine a light inside the cave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.680
When her phone rings, a hand&nbsp;
grabs her and takes her inside.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.240
The frightened boy slowly peeks into the opening&nbsp;
of the cave to look for her sister. When a hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.480
reaches out to him, he staggers, but he's soon&nbsp;
relieved to see his sister emerging from the cave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.920
The children tell Hee-yeon and Min-ho about what&nbsp;
happened at the cave, so they go to the site to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.400
investigate. As Hee-yeon walks around the woods,&nbsp;
she finds a little girl wandering on her own.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.000
She tries talking to her, but the child&nbsp;
wouldn't respond. When Min-ho reaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.280
his hand to touch her, the child recoils&nbsp;
and raises her hand to shield herself.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.080
They suddenly hear the children screaming for&nbsp;
help, so Min-ho goes back to the cave entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.600
When Hee-yeon tries to follow him, the&nbsp;
girl grabs her shirt, trying to stop her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.000
Hee-yeon tells the child to wait for her and goes&nbsp;
to the cave. Meanwhile, Min-ho enters the cave and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.280
discovers a bolted door. After forcing the door&nbsp;
open, he tries looking inside, but it's too dark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.800
A mutilated woman suddenly emerges and&nbsp;
throws herself upon Min-ho, causing him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.880
to fall on his back. As Min-ho struggles to&nbsp;
get away, the woman falls on him and dies.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.520
Soon, the police arrive at the site to&nbsp;
investigate. While looking around the woods,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.040
Detective Kim finds an old picture of a young girl&nbsp;
and a man. By the time the lead detective arrives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.280
Hee-yeon is already exasperated from repeatedly&nbsp;
explaining the incident to the cops, so she leaves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.120
the site and goes home. That night, the little&nbsp;
girl Hee-yeon found in the woods knocks on their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.800
door, so Hee-yeon lets her inside and asks her&nbsp;
husband to let the girl stay there for the night.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.080
Meanwhile, Detective Kim looks&nbsp;
at the old cases related to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.840
cave and learns that they involve missing&nbsp;
persons. Before the victims disappeared,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.480
they heard voices of their dead&nbsp;
relatives asking them to go to the cave.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.280
As Hee-yeon baths the child, she finds signs&nbsp;
of physical maltreatment on the girl's body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.360
She tries dressing the child in Jun-hee's clothes,&nbsp;
but they're too big for her, so Hee-yeon decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.680
to let her wear Jun-seo's clothes. As the girl&nbsp;
listens to Jun-hee and Hee-yeon talk, she starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.200
mimicking Jun-hee's voice, calling Hee-yeon&nbsp;
"mom" and claiming that her name is also Jun-hee.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.600
The following day, Hee-yeon and Min-ho feel&nbsp;
irritation in their eyes, thinking that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.000
are signs of infection. Suddenly, they hear a&nbsp;
noise outside their house, so they go out and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.400
find a blind woman walking away. When Hee-yeon&nbsp;
calls out to her, the blind woman tells them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.320
leave the place immediately, noting that the place&nbsp;
is dangerous because she can hear voices again.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.520
Inside the house, the mysterious girl&nbsp;
observes Jun-hee playing outside and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.600
imitates her laugh and speech. While Min-ho is&nbsp;
preparing some medicine for their dogs, he hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.200
Jun-hee's cheerful voice, but he's perturbed when&nbsp;
he finds out that it was the girl from the woods.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.920
At the police station, the detectives manage&nbsp;
to track down the abandoned carâ€™s owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.000
By that time, the owner is already having problems&nbsp;
with his vision and is still hearing voices,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.160
telling him to come to the cave. Detective Kim&nbsp;
asks him about the woman found dead in the cave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.480
but he wouldn't respond. He tries shaking his&nbsp;
ears, hoping that he would stop hearing his wife's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.880
voice. When he gets home, he frantically&nbsp;
washes his face to jolt himself awake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.480
But soon, he hears knocks coming from&nbsp;
inside the cabinet. When he opens it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.480
he hears his wife asking him for help. He drops&nbsp;
to the ground and whimpers in sheer terror&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.840
when he sees a hand appear in the reflection,&nbsp;
desperately trying to break out of the mirror.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.400
While preparing to take Jun-hee to school, Min-ho&nbsp;
asks his wife if she has reported the mysterious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.560
girl to the police. When he learns that the&nbsp;
girl is also called Jun-hee, he points out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.240
she also sounds like their daughter. Hee-yeon&nbsp;
is reluctant to report the girl to the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.080
because she fears that the authorities would not&nbsp;
take good care of her. Min-ho points out that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.480
girl's parents are probably worried about her, so&nbsp;
he urges Hee-yeon to go to the police right away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.440
Meanwhile, Sun-ja hears her brotherâ€™s&nbsp;
voice, telling her to come to him.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.320
Hee-yeon notices the television on with no one&nbsp;
watching, so she looks for the strange child.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.880
When she opens the wardrobe, she&nbsp;
finds the girl hiding inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.280
She takes the girl out of the wardrobe and asks&nbsp;
what she's doing inside, but she doesn't reply.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.480
Suddenly, Sun-ja approaches them with a knife and&nbsp;
tries to stab the girl. Hee-yeon defends the child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.480
and runs out of the house after disarming Sun-ja.&nbsp;
Hee-yeon and the child run to the shed and lock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.880
the door. Sun-ja bangs on the door repeatedly,&nbsp;
saying the voice she's been hearing is not her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.200
brother's. The child hides inside the dog cage&nbsp;
holding a broken mirror to defend herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.800
Hee-yeon tries to console the child, projecting&nbsp;
her love for her missing son onto the girl.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.929
[HELLO VIDEO EDITOR: I asked the writer if&nbsp;
thereâ€™s a transition here somewhere because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:54.000
it seems like it jumped from Sun-ja&nbsp;
attacking Hee-yeon in the shed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.880
then sheâ€™s suddenly in a room with Min-ho.&nbsp;
Will update you when the writer responds.]

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.000
When Min-ho drops by Sun-ja's room, he's&nbsp;
baffled when he sees the mirror covered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.160
with tape. He asks Sun-ja if she's the one who&nbsp;
taped the mirror, but he doesn't get a response.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.200
He peels away a strip of tape and leaves&nbsp;
the room to tell Hee-yeon to take Sun-ja&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.000
back to the nursing home because they're&nbsp;
having a hard time taking care of her.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.920
The child from the woods approaches&nbsp;
Hee-yeon to tell her that she can't sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.920
When Hee-yeon puts her to bed, she asks her&nbsp;
about Jun-suh, saying Hee-yeon kept repeating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.080
the name in her sleep. Hee-yeon tells her that&nbsp;
he's Jun-hee's brother. Hee-yeon explains that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.760
she doesn't know where Jun-suh is, but his&nbsp;
grandmother might know. Hee-yeon recalls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.080
leaving Jun-suh with Sun-ja at the grocery.&nbsp;
Sun-ja holds the boy's hand tight as he cries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.320
but later on, Sun-ja is left alone staring into&nbsp;
space, clutching the child's toy in her hand.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.480
Min-ho is increasingly bothered by the&nbsp;
presence of the mysterious girl in their home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.520
so he instructs Hee-yeon to take her&nbsp;
to the police station the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.640
Hee-yeon objects and confesses that&nbsp;
the girl reminds her of their son.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.280
She vows to start the search for Jun-suh again,&nbsp;
insisting that the boy is still out there. Min-ho,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.800
however, believes that the child is already&nbsp;
dead and tells Hee-yeon to let go and move on.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.640
Later that night, Sun-ja starts&nbsp;
hearing her dead brotherâ€™s voice again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.360
calling her from behind the mirror. This time,&nbsp;
Sun-ja also hears her dead sisterâ€™s voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.120
Due to her illness, she has forgotten that&nbsp;
her sister is dead, so she heads to the cave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.040
following her voice. The following day,&nbsp;
the family scrambles to find Sun-ja,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.440
but she's nowhere to be found. When Min-ho looks&nbsp;
at the mirror in Sun-ja's room, he is puzzled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.400
by the liquid dripping on the reflection&nbsp;
while the mirror itself appears to be dry.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.960
Min-ho removes more strips of tape from the&nbsp;
mirror, revealing two handprints on the mirror.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.800
Min-ho goes missing hours later after asking the&nbsp;
girl from the woods about Sun-ja's whereabouts.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.200
Hee-yeon reports Min-ho's sudden disappearance&nbsp;
to the police, saying there's something strange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.280
going on in the town. When Hee-yeon mentions the&nbsp;
girl from the woods, Detective Kim asks to speak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.600
to her, but the child is nowhere to be found.&nbsp;
The detective reveals several reports of missing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.840
persons in the town, and there have been mentions&nbsp;
of the girl. When Detective Kim shows Hee-yeon a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.360
picture he found in the woods, Hee-yeon confirms&nbsp;
that the girl in the picture is the girl she took&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.080
into her house. Kim, however, points out that&nbsp;
the picture was taken in the 80s. Kim goes back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.920
to the police station and looks at the records&nbsp;
mentioning the strange girl. Some witnesses say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.760
that the girl never spoke, but one told the police&nbsp;
that the child invited a victim to come with her.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.600
While Hee-yeon looks for Jun-hee in the woods, the&nbsp;
blind woman she met days earlier approaches her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.760
and takes her to her house. The woman tells her&nbsp;
that the entity responsible for the disappearances&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.280
is known as the Jangsan Tiger, which mimics&nbsp;
the voice of humans to entice them to its lair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.760
Several shamans have served the horrific tiger,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.120
but one particular shaman had gained&nbsp;
extraordinary powers after serving the entity.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.800
As the tiger slowly possesses the&nbsp;
shaman, he starts looking at his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.360
neglected daughter with contempt as&nbsp;
she cries for her missing mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.120
Soon, the tiger completely takes over&nbsp;
the shaman's mind, but it still wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.040
to possess something pure. The shaman grabs&nbsp;
his daughter and puts the terrified child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.360
inside a drum as he performs an unholy ritual&nbsp;
for the dreadful entity. Soon, the shaman and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.880
his daughter disappear from the town, leaving&nbsp;
the villagers to speculate about their fate.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.960
The blind woman discloses that people started&nbsp;
disappearing soon after the shaman and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.560
daughter went missing. She believes that the&nbsp;
missing villagers have been sacrificed to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.400
Jangsan Tiger. The woman warns Hee-yeon not&nbsp;
to trust the girl because when she appears,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.840
the shaman usually follows. She points&nbsp;
out that they exploit their victim's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.400
vulnerabilities and use their guilt, anger, and&nbsp;
longing to entice them to the cave. The woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.760
notes people usually have trouble seeing&nbsp;
when the girl starts breaking their chi.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.880
She hands Hee-yeon a talisman to provide&nbsp;
temporary protection from the tiger.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.360
As Hee-yeon runs back to the house, Jun-hee wakes&nbsp;
up and tries to find her mom to tell her about her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.680
irritated eyes. When Jun-hee hears Hee-yeon's&nbsp;
voice, she slowly approaches the bathroom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.440
but she runs away in complete terror when&nbsp;
she sees the shaman emerging from the mirror.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.280
Jun-hee hides inside their shed and comes across&nbsp;
the strange girl, pointing a broken mirror at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.800
her while imitating her mother's voice.&nbsp;
When Hee-yeon finally reaches the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.880
she finds the girls hiding in the dresser. Jun-hee&nbsp;
tells Hee-yeon that the strange girl saved her.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.720
Hee-yeon recalls the blind woman telling her&nbsp;
that the child is the only one who knows the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.640
way to the tiger's territory. In the hopes of&nbsp;
saving her husband and mother from the tiger,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.760
Hee-yeon asks the child to take her to the cave.&nbsp;
The child, however, is reluctant, fearing that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.000
shaman will harm her. She asks Hee-yeon to promise&nbsp;
that she'll protect her and never leave her alone.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.560
Before venturing into the cave, Hee-yeon covers&nbsp;
all the mirrors in the house and warns Jun-hee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.320
against trusting anyone. She then tells her&nbsp;
daughter to call Detective Kim if she doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.320
return the next day. Upon reaching the cave,&nbsp;
the child tells Hee-yeon not to respond to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.920
any voice she hears. Hee-yeon is suddenly&nbsp;
struck with fear and confusion when she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.120
starts hearing the voices of her husband and&nbsp;
her daughter. Hee-yeon starts calling out to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.560
Jun-hee when she hears her screaming, but the&nbsp;
strange child pleads with her not to respond.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.520
Soon, the possessed shaman emerges and chases&nbsp;
after them. The man almost catches up to Hee-yeon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.040
as she crawls through a narrow space, but&nbsp;
the child pulls her out. Hee-yeon and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.960
child find themselves in a chamber full of&nbsp;
mirrors, where they hear multiple voices.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.480
In her confusion, Hee-yeon covers her&nbsp;
ears and leans against a large mirror.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.480
She doesn't flinch or struggle when the shaman&nbsp;
emerges and lays his hands on her. As the shaman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.360
slowly pulls her inside the mirror, Min-ho arrives&nbsp;
and smashes the mirror. Min-ho, now completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.640
blind, tells Hee-yeon to climb up the hole&nbsp;
that he fell through to escape from the tiger.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.560
As Hee-yeon struggles to climb up, she&nbsp;
receives a call from Detective Kim,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.920
so she answers the phone and pleads&nbsp;
for help. Hee-yeon then loses her grip,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.000
but she feels someone grabbing her and hears&nbsp;
Detective Kim. However, she soon discovers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.440
that she's holding on to the shaman's hand, so&nbsp;
she lets go and falls back down to the ground.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.880
Min-ho, Hee-yeon, and the child crawl through&nbsp;
the narrow passage to get away from the shaman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.640
As they turn to leave, the child calls out to&nbsp;
Hee-yeon, but Min-ho warns her not to trust the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.960
child. The girl hugs Hee-yeon and begs her not&nbsp;
to leave, but Hee-yeon starts losing her vision,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.920
so she walks out of the cave with&nbsp;
Min-ho. As Hee-yeon looks back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.400
the child tearfully reminds Hee-yeon&nbsp;
of her promise not to leave her.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.880
Soon, the tiger starts to weaken as the&nbsp;
mirrors in the chamber continue to break.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.680
As Hee-yeon and Min-ho carefully&nbsp;
climb up the stairs leading outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.440
Hee-yeon hears Jun-suhâ€™s voice, pleading&nbsp;
with her to stay. Min-ho points out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.520
the voice she's hearing is not Jun-suh, but&nbsp;
Hee-yeon cannot resist, so she turns back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.920
With her fading vision, she runs toward the child&nbsp;
and hugs her, talking to her as if she is Jun-suh.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.560
Min-ho manages to walk out of the cave and comes&nbsp;
across Detective Kim. Inside, the child guides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.320
Hee-yeon deeper into the cave, with her desire to&nbsp;
have a mother that cares for her finally quenched.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.560
In Korean folklore, the Jangsan Tiger is&nbsp;
known to have the ability to create noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.000
that lures people deep into the forest.&nbsp;
The mythical animal can mimic the voice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.360
of a wailing woman, making people think&nbsp;
that someone in the forest needs help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.720
At other times, it can imitate the sound&nbsp;
of running water to lure thirsty hikers.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.960
However, the tiger terrorizing Hee-yeonâ€™s&nbsp;
village is far more dreadful as it can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.320
possess a human and exploit its victims'&nbsp;
feelings to lure them into its lair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.600
The reports reveal that most of the victims&nbsp;
encountered the child and were most likely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.440
lured to the cave because of her innocence. Though&nbsp;
the knowledgeable villagers think of the strange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.360
child as malevolent, she appears to be a victim&nbsp;
of the entity and the shaman's thirst for power.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.720
The Jangsan Tiger uses the child to&nbsp;
break his potential victimsâ€™ chi slowly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.120
but there's no indication that&nbsp;
she's deliberately doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.880
When she first met Hee-yeon, she stops her from&nbsp;
venturing into the cave, as if she doesn't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.720
her to be harmed by the vicious tiger. When&nbsp;
Jun-hee comes under attack from the shaman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.240
the child hides with her instead of&nbsp;
luring her back to the malevolent entity.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.160
After experiencing maltreatment from her father,&nbsp;
the child takes the opportunity to find solace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.920
at the caring hands of Hee-yeon. Although the&nbsp;
child helps Hee-yeon escape from the shaman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.240
she wouldn't let her leave. Despite her innocence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.840
she knows how to exploit Hee-yeon's longing for&nbsp;
her lost son to satisfy her longing for a mother.
