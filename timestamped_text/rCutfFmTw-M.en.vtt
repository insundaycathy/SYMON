00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome back to Movie Recaps. Today&nbsp;
I will show you an action, Drama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.440
Thriller film from 2018, titled Red Sparrow.&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.640
The story begins by jumping back and forth between&nbsp;
the lives of our two protagonists in Russia.&nbsp;

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.600
First, there is Dominika Egorova, a famous&nbsp;
ballerina that is in charge of taking care of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.320
sick mom. After a visit to the doctor, Dominika&nbsp;
leaves her mother with a caretaker so she can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.200
go to work. Once in the theatre, she changes and&nbsp;
puts on make-up before going to meet the guests,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.360
which include her uncle Ivan Egorov,&nbsp;
Deputy Director of Russian secret service.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.680
He introduces her to Dimitry Ustinov, a Russian&nbsp;
gangster that asks her for a picture and takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.560
the chance to touch her improperly. Moments&nbsp;
later, the play begins, and Dominika is dancing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.200
as wonderfully as ever when suddenly, his dancing&nbsp;
partner jumps and lands on her leg, breaking it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.840
Dominika is immediately taken to have surgery.
The other character we follow is Nate Nash,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.800
a CIA agent, who is taking a phone call from an&nbsp;
automatic caller that dictates some words to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.880
He uses those words to decode the address of&nbsp;
a meeting location, and he takes his gun with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.440
him before leaving. The chosen spot for the secret&nbsp;
meeting is the park at night, and when he arrives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.880
there, he notices he's being followed by a car.&nbsp;
A mysterious man, codename Marble, is walking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.800
towards him as well, and Nate hands him something&nbsp;
as they cross each other on the road before they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.360
go on as if nothing happened. The car is still&nbsp;
following him, though, so to give the man a chance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.840
to escape, Nate creates a distraction by shooting&nbsp;
the floor and starts running away as the car gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.400
him chase. He reaches town and is surrounded by&nbsp;
the police just as he makes it to the American&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.520
embassy. Inside, he meets with his bosses, who&nbsp;
tell him the asset is safe, but Nate will still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.720
be sent back to the USA for his mistake.
The next day, Ivan visits Colonel Zakharov,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.720
director of the secret service, in his office&nbsp;
- General Vladimir Korchnoi is there as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.600
They show Ivan a video of Nate's meeting at the&nbsp;
park and mention he's a CIA agent that left the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.000
country that morning, but their main interest lies&nbsp;
in the other man and finding out his identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.240
We cut to Dominika then, who is waking up at&nbsp;
the hospital to find her leg in a metal frame,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.120
she starts crying when she realizes&nbsp;
she won't be able to dance again.&nbsp;

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.920
Three months pass. Dominika, who is&nbsp;
still walking with the aid of a cane,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.320
is visited by Ivan. He comments on the fact&nbsp;
a replacement for her has already been found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.160
and how the theatre had been lending them the&nbsp;
apartment and covering her mom's medical expenses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.320
all that will stop soon now that she doesn't&nbsp;
work for them anymore. Ivan says he wants to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.160
help her and asks her to come to him when she's&nbsp;
ready, he also leaves an envelope for her before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.800
leaving. Dominika opens the envelope and finds&nbsp;
pictures that show her dancing partner has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.480
romantically involved with her replacement,&nbsp;
plus a recording of a conversation between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.240
them that implies he jumped on her on purpose&nbsp;
so his girlfriend could take Dominika's place.&nbsp;

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.560
Later that day, we find Dominika in the&nbsp;
theatre, watching her former partner and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.360
the new girl practice. After they're done, they&nbsp;
go to the steam room and Dominika follows them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.160
only to find them having relations. Rage takes&nbsp;
over and Dominika starts using her cane to beat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.320
them both to the ground before running away.&nbsp;
On the bus home, she sees her hands stained&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.120
with blood and decides to get off, stopping by a&nbsp;
payphone to report what she did as an accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.120
When she arrives at her apartment, she finds&nbsp;
her mom on the bathroom floor, the caretaker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.880
nowhere in sight - her mom tells her she didn't&nbsp;
come because the theatre stopped paying her.&nbsp;

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.080
Knowing she has no other choice now, Dominika&nbsp;
goes to see her uncle to ask him for help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.000
He accepts as long as she helps him in return&nbsp;
with a little case: the secret service wants to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.960
know more about Ustinov, whom Dominika had met&nbsp;
at the theatre. Ivan wants her to approach him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.320
befriend him and gain his trust using her charms.&nbsp;
Dominika at first refuses, but Ivan wins her over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.560
by reminding her how awful state hospitals are and&nbsp;
how he can give her mom the best doctors instead.&nbsp;

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.800
That very night, Dominika goes to&nbsp;
the hotel Ustinov is staying in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.360
wearing the dress she's been given. She goes to&nbsp;
the bar to wait for Ustinov to approach her first,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.760
which he does. Dominika tells him she's come&nbsp;
to see him, wanting to feel special again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.560
so they leave for her room. She asks the guards to&nbsp;
give them privacy and Ustinov starts undressing as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.680
soon as his men leave the room, then asks Dominika&nbsp;
to do the same. She does so after some hesitation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.400
and when she comes closer, Ustinov wastes no time&nbsp;
in taking advantage of her. Their intercourse is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.200
suddenly interrupted when a man wearing a black&nbsp;
helmet appears behind Ustinov and cuts his throat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.560
The body is thrown on the floor and&nbsp;
after asking for silence with a gesture,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.480
the man throws Dominika a coat for her to cover&nbsp;
her blood-stained body and takes her out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.640
room through a back door. When they make it to&nbsp;
the parking lot, he shoots an employee before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.360
getting them on his bike and driving away to an&nbsp;
abandoned building. Inside, the man takes off his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.000
helmet to reveal Sergei Matorin, another secret&nbsp;
service agent sent by Ivan, who is in another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.800
room in the same building together with Korchnoi,&nbsp;
watching Dominika on the security cameras. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.960
Korchnoi mentions she's a witness and she should&nbsp;
be eliminated, Ivan mentions she could be useful.&nbsp;

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.920
Ivan changes rooms to go see Dominika, and&nbsp;
confesses he did know what would happen in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.320
room and didn't tell her because she wouldn't have&nbsp;
done it if she knew. He makes her an offer then:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.800
since she's so good at this, she can be sent to a&nbsp;
special institution to be trained to be an agent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.720
If she refuses, he won't be able to&nbsp;
protect her, so she can only accept.&nbsp;

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.280
Dominika leaves for the institution a couple&nbsp;
of days later. When she arrives there, she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.320
received by Matron, the Headmistress of Sparrow&nbsp;
School. She gives Dominika a fake name to use in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.040
the school before taking her to her room. Classes&nbsp;
start soon after that - Matron talks about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.080
modern world being in chaos and how Russia is the&nbsp;
only country willing to make sacrifices to fix it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.320
The students will be trained to be Sparrows, spies&nbsp;
who specialized in seduction and psychological&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.880
manipulation. Dominika and a student named Viktor&nbsp;
are called to the front of the class and asked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.840
to strip, Viktor does so without issues, but&nbsp;
Dominika doesn't dare. Matron scolds her for it.&nbsp;

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.240
We then cut to Nate, who's been summoned by&nbsp;
the CIA's discipline panel to be informed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.360
he'll be suspended for his mistake in&nbsp;
Russia and he can't leave the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.600
Nate protests because their mole, Marble, has&nbsp;
been working with Nate for three years and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.240
won't trust anybody else, but he isn't heard.
Back in the Sparrow School, during a class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.680
with Matron, she tells them they need to be&nbsp;
able to identify what their targets want.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.880
She puts some videos on tv for examples for them&nbsp;
to work on: the first one Viktor guesses wrong and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.760
Dominika corrects him, earning her his dislike.&nbsp;
The second is guessed by another female student,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.880
who is called to the front of the class and&nbsp;
told she will have to use her mouth on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.040
man from the video, who is brought into the&nbsp;
classroom in cuffs. The girl gets on her knees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.840
but is incapable of doing it, she falls to the&nbsp;
floor crying. Matron reminds all the students&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.000
that they need to learn to trick their bodies&nbsp;
and teaches them some basic seduction tricks.&nbsp;

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.640
Back in the USA, Nate notices he's being&nbsp;
tailed and informs his superiors of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.680
He learns that the CIA hasn't heard&nbsp;
anything from Marble and he takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.880
the chance to remind them he will&nbsp;
talk if it's Nate that contacts him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.720
They reach a deal: he can't still go back to&nbsp;
Russia, but they can send him to a country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.240
nearby so the Russian secret service will&nbsp;
know he's around and Marble will resurface.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.440
Nate accepts for the team to come with him.
Meanwhile, in the school, the students are asked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.760
to give a welcome to a group of soldiers that&nbsp;
just returned home from war. Dominika chooses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.240
a young man and takes him to her room where she&nbsp;
successfully gives him a hand. Later that day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.840
Matron and the students watch all the videos&nbsp;
of their performances with the soldiers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.240
Matron tells Dominika her technique was good&nbsp;
but she still hasn't learned to give herself up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.720
After class is over, Dominika goes to the&nbsp;
showers, where she's assaulted by Viktor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.920
She defends herself by taking the water&nbsp;
tap from the wall and hitting him with it.&nbsp;

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.800
In the meantime, Ivan, Korchnoi and Zakharov&nbsp;
are discussing the fact Nate has been relocated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.320
to Budapest. They want to do something&nbsp;
about it, but they know the president&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.800
doesn't want them anything that may come off&nbsp;
as antagonistic against the USA. Ivan proposes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.720
they give the mission to someone else.
Back in the Sparrow School, Matron and a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.600
newly arrived Korchnoi question Dominika for her&nbsp;
attack on Viktor. Matron thinks Dominika still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.560
has potential, Korchnoi asks for a moment alone&nbsp;
with her. After everyone else leaves the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.680
he questions Dominika again, and she explains&nbsp;
she owes and serves the state, not her classmate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.840
She's allowed to go back to class, where Matron&nbsp;
once again calls her to the front while Korchnoi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.560
watches from a security camera. Dominika is shown&nbsp;
a picture of Viktor and asked what he wants as he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.520
enters the room. Matron orders her to give him&nbsp;
what he wants. Viktor asks her to turn around,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.240
Dominika refuses and gets into action: as she&nbsp;
undresses, he tells Viktor to look at only her and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.120
once she's completely naked, she sits on the table&nbsp;
with her legs open, egging him on to take her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.960
Viktor can't get it up and runs away&nbsp;
when she teases him for it. Then Dominika&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.320
answers Matron's question: what he wants is&nbsp;
power. Korchnoi is impressed. Moments later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.080
Matron meets with Dominika in private again&nbsp;
and tells her she'll be sent back to Moscow.&nbsp;

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.280
Days later, while reuniting with her mom at their&nbsp;
place, Dominika receives a call that tells her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.520
meet Ivan at a restaurant. When she makes it&nbsp;
there, she sits with him and he explains her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.280
next mission: she'll be sent to Budapest to&nbsp;
befriend Nate and gain his trust so she can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.600
learn the identity of their mole. He gives her&nbsp;
a new passport and documents with a new name.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.480
Dominika leaves without eating.
She makes it to Budapest a couple of days later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.760
and goes to stay at an apartment she'll&nbsp;
share with a fellow Sparrow Marta.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.240
Later that day, she meets with her new boss,&nbsp;
station chief Maxim Volontov, and asks him for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.160
some information on Nate. Afterward, she&nbsp;
follows Nate around to learn his routine.&nbsp;

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.720
The next day, Dominika starts going to the&nbsp;
same swimming pool as Nate, and lets him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.880
go to her when they leave the building. They&nbsp;
chitchat a bit but Dominika plays hard to get,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.840
she also makes up a story about being a translator&nbsp;
for the embassy. The following day, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.840
she doesn't find Nate at the pool, and the&nbsp;
receptionist tells her her ID has gone missing.&nbsp;

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.400
Turns out, Nate already knows she isn't&nbsp;
what she says. We cut to him explaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.480
to his superiors that she's been using many&nbsp;
names and making the connection to Ivan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.080
He thinks she's valuable and that her&nbsp;
using her real name is a provocation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.000
After some hesitation, his superiors allow&nbsp;
him to get closer to her to gather intel.&nbsp;

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.040
After going to Volontov to report her progress&nbsp;
and ask for an embassy pass, Dominika visits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.720
the embassy and sees Marta chatting with&nbsp;
Stephanie Boucher, an American politician.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.280
Nate interrupts her staring to chat, admitting&nbsp;
he was the one to steal her ID from the pool,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.120
and asks her out to dinner the next day&nbsp;
at eight. Dominika accepts before leaving.&nbsp;

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.760
Back in her apartment, Dominika searches Marta's&nbsp;
room and discovers she's been buying intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:37.280
from Boucher. Marta returns home then, but doesn't&nbsp;
catch her in the act. She gives Dominika a copy of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.240
the report Volontov sent to Moscow, apparently&nbsp;
Dominika has made an enemy. The next day after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.400
work, she follows Volontov into a bar and&nbsp;
asks him to buy her time with a better report,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.720
then provokes him into punching her by making&nbsp;
fun of his small member. His violence is now on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.640
the security cameras and Dominika tells him he'll&nbsp;
write a better report or she'll take the recording&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.920
to the police. While all this is happening, Nate&nbsp;
is alone in a restaurant, waiting for his date.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.840
Thinking he's been stood up, he leaves the&nbsp;
place, but Dominika is following him closely.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.000
Back in his apartment, Nate receives another&nbsp;
coded message on the phone that he quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.320
writes down and deciphers: it says Viena.&nbsp;
He's about to leave when a crying Dominika&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.720
rings his bell, he allows her to come in.
While sharing some whisky, Dominika tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.200
him his boss assaulted him. When Nate asks her&nbsp;
how she knows where he lives, she raises the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.920
volume of the tv so they can't be heard. Dominika&nbsp;
asks him what happened in that park in Russia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.000
and kisses him after he tells her. Nate tells&nbsp;
her to go home and figure out what she wants.&nbsp;

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.920
The next day, Ivan visits Dominika before leaving&nbsp;
for Viena. He asks about her progress with Nate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.320
since their superiors are getting impatient.&nbsp;
To buy time, she lies and tells him she's also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.880
working with Marta on her Boucher case, but she'll&nbsp;
need more money. Ivan accepts and asks for his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.520
coat to leave, Dominika gets it for him but not&nbsp;
without secretly taking a peek at his passport.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.920
After he's gone, Marta approaches Dominika&nbsp;
with her gun: she overhead the lie and is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.160
angry because the Boucher case is supposed to&nbsp;
be only hers. Dominika promises she'll give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.560
her all the credit and more money, she just&nbsp;
lied for the extra time. Marta only accepts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.200
because she has no other choice. Later on,&nbsp;
Dominika goes to Vienna and opens a bank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.960
account there while Marta visits Volontov to&nbsp;
tell him she knows how to get rid of Dominika.&nbsp;

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.040
Dominika returns to her place that night&nbsp;
and finds Marta murdered in the bathtub.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.760
Suddenly, Sergei appears behind her and grabs&nbsp;
her by the neck to pass on a warning: this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.400
what happens to those that share secrets. He also&nbsp;
tells her to call the police before he disappears.&nbsp;

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.760
We cut to Nate there, who is reporting to his&nbsp;
superiors about having met with Marble in Vienna.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.440
Marble has given him some files confirming&nbsp;
Dominika is a Sparrow, and that makes Nate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.160
think she's even more recruitable. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
Dominika is being interrogated by the police,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.040
but she tells them nothing. When she leaves the&nbsp;
precinct, she finds Nate outside waiting for her.&nbsp;

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.600
They go back to his place, where he confesses&nbsp;
he knows she's a Sparrow. Dominika tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.400
her story in return, putting emphasis on the fact&nbsp;
she only cares about her mother's well-being. Nate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.120
asks her to be a double-agent for him, promising&nbsp;
her protection, she replies she needs to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.920
He gives her his room. Later in the night, she&nbsp;
leaves the room and joins Nate on the touch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.000
After asking if she can trust him and getting&nbsp;
a positive answer, she makes love to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.640
The next morning, after she confirms she accepts&nbsp;
his deal, Dominika goes back to her routine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.840
writes a fake report on Nate saying she&nbsp;
has him in her pocket and then returns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.760
to her place to wait for his signal, which is a&nbsp;
simple phone call that plays her favorite song.&nbsp;

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.560
Dominika meets with Nate's superiors and is put&nbsp;
through a liar detector test to see if she can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.600
trusted. When they accept her, she asks for money.&nbsp;
They laugh at her, but they change their minds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.000
when she tells them she can give them Boucher. The&nbsp;
following Friday, the whole team flies to London&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.200
to meet with Boucher. Dominika stays in a special&nbsp;
hotel room the CIA prepared for her with security&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.680
cameras to monitor her and a set of disks hidden&nbsp;
under a desk to change for the real ones later.&nbsp;

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.080
Moments later, while she's at the bar waiting for&nbsp;
Boucher, he's surprised by the sudden appearance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.480
of Volontov who supposedly wants to help.&nbsp;
Dominika sends him to her room, otherwise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.040
his presence will scare Boucher off. Boucher&nbsp;
arrives soon afterward and Dominika goes to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.520
explaining Marta sent her. Boucher doesn't like&nbsp;
this change and is about to leave, but Dominika&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.760
convinces her to stay when she threatens her with&nbsp;
some dangerous pictures and mentions the money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.480
Both women go to Dominika's room where Volontov is&nbsp;
waiting. Boucher gives her the disks in exchange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.560
for the money, and Dominika pretends to take the&nbsp;
disks to her computer to check they're real when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.040
she's actually trading them with the CIA's.&nbsp;
Dominika and Volontov leave then after telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.680
Boucher to wait an hour to leave too, but Boucher&nbsp;
is anxious and drunk so she leaves soon after.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.760
When she makes it to the street, she notices&nbsp;
she's being followed and gets scared, so she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.320
throws the money in a trashcan and crosses the&nbsp;
street where a truck hits and kills her. Dominika&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.800
is in a car with Volontov when this happens, and&nbsp;
he quickly gets the news on the phone. He tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.640
Dominika they've been given orders to return&nbsp;
to Moscow immediately and takes her passport.&nbsp;

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.760
When they make it to Moscow, Ivan takes the&nbsp;
disks from Volontov before arresting him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.480
Both he and Dominika are under suspicion of&nbsp;
having helped the Americans. When asked about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.240
she denies it, so she starts being tortured&nbsp;
in different ways for the real answer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.800
but she doesn't give in. They even show her&nbsp;
a video of how Volontov was shot for lying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.240
but when the interrogator points at her&nbsp;
head and she lies again, nothing happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.600
Ivan takes over then, and Dominika manages to&nbsp;
manipulate him into protecting her. She's allowed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.520
to return home, but when she gets there, she&nbsp;
feels so dirty she doesn't let her mom hug her.&nbsp;

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.240
After a difficult meeting with Korchnoi and&nbsp;
Zakharov, Ivan returns to his apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.160
where Dominika is waiting. He tells her&nbsp;
they've granted her request to let her keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.600
working on Nate, she kisses him before leaving.
Dominika returns to Budapest and meets with Nate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.520
They go to his apartment, where he expresses&nbsp;
his suspicions of her quick release.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.160
Dominika convinces him to relocate her and her mom&nbsp;
to America and to give her more money, he accepts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.640
before they make love. In the middle of the&nbsp;
night, Dominika wakes up when she hears a noise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.200
she goes to the kitchen to find Sergei torturing&nbsp;
Nate. She pretends to be on his side at first,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.360
even helping him hurt Nate to get the name&nbsp;
of the mole. But when Sergei gets distracted,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.680
she hits him back and helps Nate cut the straps&nbsp;
tying him to the chair. The three of them get into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.760
a fight that doesn't last long: Sergei slips&nbsp;
and Dominika takes the chance to stab him.&nbsp;

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.160
She wakes up in the hospital the next&nbsp;
day, and leaves her room to have a smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.520
She's then approached by Korchnoi,&nbsp;
who reveals himself as Marble.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.000
He thinks he'll be caught soon and doesn't want to&nbsp;
die in vain, so he asks Dominika to expose him so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.880
she can become a national hero and take his place&nbsp;
as a mole. She doesn't give him a definite answer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.760
but after he leaves, she checks on Nate and leaves&nbsp;
as well. She gives herself up to the police and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.000
asks to see the Russian ambassador, when she's&nbsp;
taken to him, she tells him to call Zakharov and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.440
inform him she has the name of the mole, which&nbsp;
she'll give him in exchange for her freedom.&nbsp;

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.320
A meeting to do the exchange is arranged later&nbsp;
that night at an airport. Nate will walk with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.720
her to confirm the identity of the mole and she&nbsp;
mustn't try to run or she'll be shot. Nate is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.880
angry with her because he thinks she's used him,&nbsp;
but she has a surprise: when the Russians approach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.680
them with the mole, they take the bag off his face&nbsp;
to reveal it's not Korchnoi - it's her uncle Ivan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.000
who has been framed thanks to Dominika fabricating&nbsp;
evidence since she made it to Budapest the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.200
time. Nate quickly catches on and confirms&nbsp;
Ivan is the mole. After the exchange is done,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.960
Ivan is shot by a Russian sniper and&nbsp;
Dominika is taken away on a helicopter.&nbsp;

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.600
Back in Russia, she's named a heroine and&nbsp;
allowed to have a good life with her mom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.600
The movie ends when she receives a phone call and&nbsp;
the only sound on the line is her favorite song.
