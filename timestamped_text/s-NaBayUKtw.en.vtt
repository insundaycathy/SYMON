00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.120
nothing in common and she likes to touch max&nbsp;
but not the patient. Also she feels different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.440

he can't remember the patient's face properly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.120
all he remembers was that a man's&nbsp;
nails were strange. The nose was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.800
strange. After hearing that a man&nbsp;
had a lot of hair on his body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.760

your patient after all, which had some flaws.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.280
Scarlett says that I should not answer this or&nbsp;
else her relationship with Max will get worse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.720

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.280
but even after this, Scarlett did not have&nbsp;
the slightest remorse for his actions.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.680
When the court sees Scarlett, the court thinks&nbsp;
that Scarlett's mental state is not good and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.640
Scarlett is also fired from the doctor's job&nbsp;
