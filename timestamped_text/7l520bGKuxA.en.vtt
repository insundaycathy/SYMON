00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.090
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.450
Today I will show you a drama, mystery, thriller
film from 2004, titled The Village.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.559
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.490
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.269
In what appears to be the 19th century, there's
an isolated Pennsylvania village in the middle

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:15.429
of the woods.

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.260
The story begins with them holding a funeral
for the son of August Nicholson, one of the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.470
village elders.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.260
After the burial, all the villagers have lunch
together and chief elder Edward Walker offers

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.680
comforting words.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.770
In the middle of the meal, some strange noises
are heard coming from the forest, making Noah

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.989
Percy, a man with a developmental disability,
laugh and clap with excitement.

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.170
We then get a montage of the village's daily
life: they all work together in harmony.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.030
Among their daily habits, we see them burying
anything red and sending a man up a watchtower

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.260
every night.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.089
On the water, we also see the reflection of
a passing mysterious hooded figure wearing

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:48.199
red.

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.890
One morning, Edward is approaching the school,
as he is the teacher there, only to find the

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.730
kids outside in a circle.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.469
They're looking at the body of an animal,
bloody and missing its fur.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.800
The kids swear they didn't bring it there.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.449
Everyone goes inside and Edward asks his class
who could've possibly done such a heinous

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.390
act, the kids answer with "Those We Don't
Speak Of" because they are meat-eating monsters.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.970
Edward tells them it makes no sense since
the village has a truce with them: they don't

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.940
enter their forest and the monsters, in return,
don't enter the village.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.510
That afternoon, the village elders have a
meeting.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.830
They're discussing possible festivities when
Lucius Hunt, son of elder Alice Hunt, requests

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.830
to see them.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.760
Lucius has written down what he wants to say
and proceeds to read it to them: after reassuring

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.240
them his mother has nothing to do with this,
he says the death of the child has weighted

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.800
on his thoughts, so he wants permission to
cross the forest and go to other towns so

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.700
he can acquire some new medicines.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.370
He thinks the monsters won't attack him because
creatures can sense emotions, and Lucius is

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.780
pure of intention.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.370
The request is denied.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.960
Later at night, Alice asks him what he's even
thinking about, he just says he's going to

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.310
make a friend company in the watchtower.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.610
The guard for the night is Finton Coin.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.960
Lucius joins him there and asks him what he
thinks of other towns, Finton replies they're

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.030
wicked places where wicked people live.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.650
He also thanks Lucius for coming, since he
isn't supposed to be there.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.310
The next morning, another animal body with
no fur is found in town.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.660
The elders hold a meeting with the villagers
and tell them this must be some predator like

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.590
a coyote or wolf, suffering from madness.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.520
It couldn't have been Those We Don't Speak
Of because they're rather big, they would've

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.239
known they were in the village.

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.510
On their way home from the meeting, Edward
chats with his daughter Kitty.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.049
She mentions she's in love and wants permission
to get married, Edward looks displeased with

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.689
the fact the boy isn't there with her to ask
properly.

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.069
Kitty explains she hasn't even asked the boy
yet because she wants his blessing before

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.379
saying anything and mentions the boy's identity:
Lucius.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.299
Edward gives them his blessing.

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.219
Kitty rushes to meet with Lucius and confesses
his love to him.

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:38.319
Lucius turns her down, so Kitty returns to
her house and spends the evening crying on

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.930
her blind sister Ivy's lap while she sings
to her.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.810
Meanwhile, Lucius gathers wood and takes it
to August's house, where August wonders if

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.230
his son and Lucius had bonded because neither
talked much, he also calls him kind.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.580
At the same time, at the edge of town, a group
of boys is playing a game of bravery: you

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.500
must stand on a stump, facing away from the
forest and with your arms stretched, and see

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.859
how much you can last before getting scared.

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.049
The current player swears he hears noises
in the woods, but he stays on his spot.

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.779
Back to Lucius, August is telling him that
one can run from sorrow but sorrow will still

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.349
find you because it can smell you like a dog.

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.029
Then he looks at a mysterious black box in
the corner.

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:16.760
Then we cut back to the boys again, who finally
are running away from the area when the noises

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.670
prove to be too much.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.189
Morning comes, and Ivy is being called to
deal with Noah, who is hitting other boys

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.409
with a stick.

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.909
He stops as soon as she asks him to, then
she takes him to stare at a special house

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.129
where he'll be locked in if he doesn't listen.

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.400
They strike a deal and he promises he won't
be hitting anyone again.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.019
Now that's over, they decide to spend time
together by racing up the hill to the resting

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.019
rock.

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.330
Noah asks her not to cheat, but she distracts
him and cheats anyway.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.139
They make it to the rock and find Lucius already
there.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.450
He shares a snack with them and Ivy tells
him how much her sister cried when he turned

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.620
her down.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.099
She also explains that she was able to tell
Lucius is there because a handful of people

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.819
give the faintest color, her father has it
too.

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.200
When Noah suddenly leaves to go after a bird,
Lucius tells Ivy she runs like a boy.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.349
She thanks him for that, then confesses she
knows why he denied her sister: Lucius likes

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:03.349
her.

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.980
She can tell because he's stopped touching
her some years ago.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.400
Noah makes it back then and pranks Ivy by
putting a little toad on her hand.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.680
Afterward, he retrieves some red berries from
her pocket and puts them in her hand as well.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.169
She smiles, enjoying the present, until Lucius
points out she's holding the "bad color" that

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.500
attracts Those We Don't Speak Of, she says
they should bury them.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.900
But now Lucius is worried because he's never
seen those berries before and Noah already

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.270
had them in his pocket before they arrived.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.300
He asks him where he found them, Noah takes
him there.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.810
Hours later, Lucius is reading one of his
letters to the elders again.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.080
He tells them about the berries Noah found
near a drawing on the resting rock, which

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.080
means Noah has been entering the forest all
this time without anything happening to him.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.520
This reinforces his belief that the creatures
won't attack him either if he does the same

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.180
and asks again to be allowed to go to other
towns.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.680
The elders don't accept.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.450
Later at night, back in their house, Alice
decides to tell Lucius a story about the other

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.590
towns.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.550
His father had left for the market and was
found naked and robbed on a river days later.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.270
Alice is telling him this so he can understand
the nature of what he wants, but he explains

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.840
he doesn't want to do this for himself, it's
for the sake of the village.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.611
He says he isn't the one with secrets, because
secrets are everywhere in the village, like

00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:10.919
the black box Alice has and he points at.

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.610
Alice says that's for her own good, to be
safe from but not forget the evil things from

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.979
her past.

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.919
Lucius wants to open it, Alice refuses and
tells him they should talk to Edward.

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.340
Lucius says Edward has feelings for Alice
because he never touches her.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.150
The following day, a group of boys wearing
yellow cloaks are walking by the border between

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.599
village and forest, painting a yellow line
on the torch posts that separate both areas.

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.259
Lucius is among them, and he doesn't go back
with everyone when they're done: he enters

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:36.259
the woods instead.

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:39.979
It doesn't take him long to find the berries,
and when he hears some growling, he looks

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.260
to his side to see a creature getting away.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.879
He decides to return to the village after
that, it's nighttime when he arrives and finds

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.639
Ivy outside her house.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.030
She tells him she's heard from her parents
that Lucius wants to leave the village for

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.770
medicine, she thinks it's noble but not a
good idea.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.169
She also informs him that her older sister
is getting married, which means now she is

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.490
free to receive interest from anyone.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.410
We cut to the watchtower then.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.860
Finton hears a noise and opens the hatch,
believing it to be Lucius - but it's one of

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.120
the monsters.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.490
So after some hesitation, he starts ringing
the bell to alarm the village.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.169
Everyone in town is running back to their
houses to hide.

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.460
While Lucius helps villagers to get to safety,
Kitty rushes Noah, the kids and Ivy into the

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.840
basement, but Ivy stays at the door, waiting
for Lucius.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.110
She extends her hand in front of her and an
approaching monster is about to take it when

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.129
suddenly Lucius shows up, grabs her hand and
drags Ivy inside to hide with the rest of

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:29.880
the family in the basement.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.330
The next day, red markings are found on the
doors of all houses.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.780
The elders are holding a meeting with the
villagers to try to figure out what happened:

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.289
the markings are obviously a warning, but
the creatures never attacked without a reason

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:41.349
before.

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:45.220
When elders ask if anyone knows anything,
a written note is handed to them: it's a confession

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.810
from Lucius, admitting he went into the woods
and was seen by the creatures.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.039
Edward goes to the back of the room where
Lucius is crying and tells him he's been fearless.

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:56.680
A couple of days later, the villagers are
celebrating Kitty's wedding.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.060
There's a lot of food, decorations and dancing,
but also a little ritual where two men wearing

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.780
yellow cloaks leave some meat on a rock for
the monsters.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.849
When Alice congratulates Edward for his daughter's
marriage, she offers him her hand to shake,

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:10.830
but he doesn't take it, confirming Lucius'
theory.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.050
Everyone is having fun at the party until
the screaming of some kids is heard.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.470
The little boys are brought to Edward, who
asks them what happened - they tell him they

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.470
saw the monsters in the village, leaving more
warnings.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.639
They think the creatures want them to leave.

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:26.530
The party is canceled, Edward makes everyone
go home together for protection.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.319
What they find in the village is terrifying:
there are dead animals everywhere.

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:33.909
Livestock has been taken and skinned, the
hides and feathers are missing.

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:37.409
There are marks on the barn door so high a
coyote couldn't have done it, this confuses

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:38.590
the elders.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.719
Meanwhile, Ivy is awoken in the middle of
the night and goes outside: there is Lucius,

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:43.910
sitting at her porch.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.090
She sits next to him and tells him there will
be an inquiry tomorrow to find out how the

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.689
border was breached.

00:07:48.689 --> 00:07:52.509
Lucius wants her to go inside since it's cold
and unsafe, she changes the subject.

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:56.889
First, she asks if Lucius thinks she's a tomboy,
then she mentions the game of bravery, to

00:07:56.889 --> 00:07:58.819
which Lucius holds the record.

00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:02.560
She asks him how he can be so brave, to which
he replies he concentrates on what needs to

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.710
be done.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.830
Then she wonders if he'll dance with her on
their wedding night and why he doesn't express

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.380
his thoughts more.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.280
Lucius gets a bit angry then, if he wanted
to speak, he would, and if he wanted to dance

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.319
with her, he would ask her to.

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:18.280
Most importantly, he admits he does get scared
sometimes too when he thinks of Ivy coming

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.240
to harm, that's why he's on that porch: he
fears for her safety above anyone else's.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.789
Finally he says yes, he'll dance with her
on their wedding night.

00:08:25.789 --> 00:08:27.469
Then they kiss.

00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:31.669
The next day, during the inquiry, one of the
villagers asks Alice if the news about Ivy

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:34.360
and Lucius is true, Alice confirms it is.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.360
Meanwhile, Ivy is asking her sister for her
blessing, because she doesn't want to do anything

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.240
to hurt her and she's still more important
than a boy.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.219
Kitty does give the couple their blessing
and wishes them happiness.

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:49.300
While the sisters talk, Lucius is visited
by Noah, who looks clearly upset by the news.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.720
Lucius knows Noah has feelings for Ivy too
but he isn't allowed to say much before Noah

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.430
stabs him twice.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.829
We cut to the Percys, who are getting ready
for the town meeting when Noah arrives at

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:00.529
the house covered in blood and calls it the
bad color.

00:09:00.529 --> 00:09:03.839
The elders are immediately told about the
accident and they make all villagers start

00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:05.740
searching for the injured person.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.240
As soon as she hears it was Noah who did it,
Ivy guesses who could've been hurt and hurries

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.399
to Lucius' house to find his unconscious body
on the floor.

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:16.130
She crouches next to him and hugs him, and
when Edward arrives, she tells him she can't

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.540
see Lucius' color.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.089
A couple of hours later, one of the elders
is telling the villagers Lucius is hanging

00:09:21.089 --> 00:09:24.990
in there but he can pass at any time, so everyone
should pray for him.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.339
Feeling angry after hearing this, Ivy goes
to visit Noah to the house he's been locked

00:09:28.339 --> 00:09:32.330
at and slaps him repeatedly, his father has
to drag her out by force.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.510
Noah is heard crying out and hitting things
when he's left alone and locked again.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.780
Sometime later, Ivy talks to her father and
tells her that if Lucius dies, so will she,

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.750
so she asks for permission to go to the towns
for medicines.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.070
We cut to Edward talking to the doctor to
know more details about Lucius' condition

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.860
before taking a decision: he's got an infection
and they can only pray for it.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.970
Edward pushes the doctor to give him a better
answer on what could be done if they had resources,

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.730
the doctor admits Lucius will have a better
chance if they can contain the infection.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.130
Alice takes Edward away from the house to
talk to him privately, guessing what he has

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.639
in mind and reminding him he swore an oath
he must respect like the rest of the elders

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:06.639
do.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:09.900
Edward doesn't listen and when Alice starts
crying, he hugs her.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.690
Edward returns to Ivy and takes her with him
for a walk, where he tells her his father

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.970
had a knack for business but it was dangerous
because money is a wicked thing that turns

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.160
people's hearts black, that's why they don't
have it in the village.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.399
Her grandfather died of a shot in the head
while he was sleeping and Edward is telling

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:26.589
Ivy all this so she can understand what he's
about to show her.

00:10:26.589 --> 00:10:30.079
They reach an old shed that mustn't be used,
and he asks her to try not to scream before

00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:31.970
he takes her inside.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.190
Next we cut to Ivy getting a bag ready for
a trip and telling Lucius she'll leave to

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.820
fetch some medicines for him.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.450
Meanwhile, Edward meets with the other elders
to tell them about this.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.410
It's back to Ivy then, she's waiting by the
village borders wearing a yellow cloak.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.980
Finton and Christop join her wearing the same
cloak.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.560
They get closer to the woods and Ivy raises
a hand to show a little bag she's holding

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.470
before the three of them step in.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.350
They only make it a few steps in before Finton
stops Ivy to tell her Christop isn't following

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:57.550
them anymore.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:01.370
She tells Christop they don't need to be scared
because they have the magic rocks, and Christop

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.940
wonders why they didn't hear of these rocks
before.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.730
Finton begs him not to leave them, but Christop
thinks it's too dangerous, so he goes back

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:08.940
to the village.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.990
A few hours later, while they're waiting for
the rain to stop, Finton sees and hears something

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.310
among the trees.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.769
He also gets scared and decides to go back,
leaving Ivy alone.

00:11:17.769 --> 00:11:20.459
Crying, she drops the magic rocks on the ground.

00:11:20.459 --> 00:11:24.269
A flashback starts then that shows what had
happened in the shed: there are monsters inside

00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:27.690
- or that's what Ivy thinks at first, they're
actually costumes.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.949
Edward explains it is all a lie.

00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:32.990
There used to be rumors about creatures living
in the woods on the books he used to teach

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.470
back in the towns.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.640
The screaming in the woods, the taking away
the meat offering, the furless animal bodies,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.949
the drills - all of it was the elders' farce,
a plan to keep people away from the woods.

00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:46.649
Their lies weren't meant to harm, but Lucius'
situation went too far, which is why he's

00:11:46.649 --> 00:11:48.440
making an exception for her.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.570
He gives her a pocket watch and a piece of
paper with the names of the medicines she

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:55.399
needs to acquire before giving her instructions
on how to navigate the woods and reach the

00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:56.399
towns.

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:59.350
She mustn't tell anyone in the outside world
about their village.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.560
Then Edward visits Alice to tell her he's
sent Ivy to the towns because this is all

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.829
he can give her.

00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:07.800
We cut back to the Edward meeting with the
elders, who aren't happy about this decision.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.139
They accuse him of jeopardizing everything
they've made, Edward reminds them that they

00:12:11.139 --> 00:12:15.089
built this town to have hope and he can't
allow another elder to lose their child.

00:12:15.089 --> 00:12:18.880
He also reminds them they won't live forever,
Ivy and Lucius are the perfect people to take

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.620
their place one day.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.250
August gives in and tells everyone to let
Ivy go.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.480
Back in the present, Ivy continues her trip
through the woods.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.420
Not being able to see the ground, she falls
into a hole, and only manages to save herself

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.130
by hanging on a branch.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.540
She carefully climbs out and rests against
a fallen tree for a second before going back

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.850
to her walking.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.459
She doesn't make it far before she hears a
noise.

00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:43.060
After throwing a branch in that direction,
the noises get worse, so she starts running

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.769
away until she stops in the middle of the
red berries field.

00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:49.460
A growl makes her turn around: one of the
monsters is behind her.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:54.170
She tells herself it's not real, but the creature
goes after her, so she starts running again.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.139
Eventually she bumps into the fallen tree
from before, and that gives her an idea.

00:12:58.139 --> 00:13:01.850
She stands still and opens her arms, just
like the game the village boys played on the

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.470
stump, and when the monster is about to catch
her, she steps aside and makes it fall into

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.790
the hole.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.910
Back in the village, the Percys are visiting
Noah, but they don't find him in the house.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:14.360
What they do find it's an empty hole on the
floor, which means Noah had found the hidden

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.750
monster costume there and ran away with it.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.269
When we cut back to the hole, we effectively
see the mask had come loose and it was Noah

00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:22.140
that had chased after Ivy.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.209
He passes away in the hole.

00:13:24.209 --> 00:13:27.280
Ivy continues to walk until she finally finds
a road.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.720
After leaving her cloak and her bag on the
ground, she quickly follows the road until

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.829
she comes across a very tall wall that she
climbs to reach the other side, finally leaving

00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:35.970
the woods.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.459
Back in the village, the elders are opening
their black boxes to remember their pasts

00:13:39.459 --> 00:13:42.870
and the reason why they created the village:
they used to live in the city and were all

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.670
victims of some form of violence, they met
in a grief counseling clinic.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.319
Edward recruited them to create a place where
they would be protected from any aspect of

00:13:50.319 --> 00:13:51.630
the outside world.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:56.290
A group picture Edward is looking at reveals
something important: this isn't the 19th century.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:57.959
It's the 21st.

00:13:57.959 --> 00:14:01.790
Back to Ivy, she's landing on the other side
of the wall when a jeep with the "Walker Wildlife

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:03.790
Preserve" logo parks next to her.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.630
A park ranger named Kevin comes out of it
and believing Ivy is an intruder, tells her

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.500
she isn't allowed to be there.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.100
Ivy tells him she comes from the woods, which
he has trouble believing, and asks him for

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.120
his help: she hands him the lists of medicines
and the pocket watch to pay for them.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.680
When he understands someone is hurt, he accepts
to help, since they have those medicines in

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.160
the guard shacks.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.709
Ivy is surprised by his kindness, she didn't
expect it from the people in the outside world.

00:14:26.709 --> 00:14:30.329
Kevin gets back in the jeep and drives to
the guard shack, where his superior receives

00:14:30.329 --> 00:14:31.829
him with some advice.

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:35.709
He reminds him it's an easy job, they just
need to keep people away from the animal sanctuary

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:37.329
and not disturb the woods.

00:14:37.329 --> 00:14:40.790
Kevin shouldn't make conversation with any
intruder, only patrol.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.420
His superior still remembers when planes were
paid not to fly over that area some years

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.949
ago, the press had caused him enough stress.

00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:50.920
While the man goes back to reading his newspaper,
Kevin steals some medical supplies and borrows

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.490
the maintenance ladder.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.220
Soon after that, Ivy is back in the woods
wearing her yellow cloak and returning home,

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.730
while Kevin is on the other side of the wall
with the ladder Ivy used to climb back and

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.920
her pocket watch hanging on the rear mirror.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.600
Moments later, the news of Ivy's return with
the medicine reaches the elders, who are waiting

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.029
next to Lucius' bed.

00:15:08.029 --> 00:15:12.069
They are also told Ivy was attacked by a creature
and she killed it, which greatly upsets Noah's

00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:13.069
parents.

00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:16.360
Edward tells them they'll find him and give
him a proper burial, they'll also tell the

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.079
others a creature did it.

00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:21.720
Noah's sacrifice has made the stories real
and given them a chance to continue this place

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.490
if that's what all the elders want.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:25.500
They all agree with this plan.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:35.459
The movie ends with Ivy entering the room
and grabbing Lucius's hand to tell him she's

00:15:35.459 --> 00:15:35.819
back.
