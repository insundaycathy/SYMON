00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.500
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.490
Today, I'm going to explain a Sci-Fi film
called "Equilibrium."

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.779
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.520
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.430
Upon the conclusion of World War 3, the survivors
sought to create a world free of conflict

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.320
by suppressing human emotions.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.070
In the city-state of Libria, the leaders,
known as the Tetragrammaton Council, banned

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.970
any material that could potentially evoke
strong emotions.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.590
To enforce such a law, the council formed
The Grammaton Cleric, highly-trained soldiers

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.000
tasked with hunting down and eliminating sense
offenders.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.610
In a district known as the Nethers, Grammaton
Cleric First Class John Preston takes part

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.100
in a raid to stamp out members of the resistance
group called "The Underground."

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.450
When the team comes across an unknown number
of resistance members barricading themselves

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.800
in a compound, they call Preston to deal with
the persistent rebels.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.190
With firearms in both hands, Preston breaks
the door down and waits in the dark until

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.840
the rebels stop firing.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.420
As the insurgents listen for movement, Preston
shoots the rebels in all directions with great

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.280
accuracy and efficiency.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.900
After killing all the insurgents at the compound,
they search the buildings for materials rated

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.000
"EC-10," objects known to have high emotional
content.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.879
Hidden under the floorboards, they find Leonardo
Da Vinci's painting of the Mona Lisa.

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.390
After verifying its authenticity, Preston
orders the men to set it ablaze along with

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.040
other forbidden materials.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.200
On their way back to the headquarters, Preston
notices that his partner, Errol Partridge,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.770
had taken a copy of the collection of poems
by William Butler Yeats, so he asks him why

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.920
he didn't leave it to the evidentiary team.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.130
Partridge tells him that he wanted to personally
log it himself because the team doesn't always

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.439
keep proper records of forbidden materials.

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.670
Throughout the city, Father, the reclusive
leader of Libria, makes his appearance in

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.150
giant video screens to encourage citizens
to dispense with their emotions by taking

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.450
their daily dose of Prozium.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.600
He reminds the people to destroy any material
that would tempt them to feel strong emotions,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.990
noting that they've finally achieved peace
by getting rid of such objects.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.300
Citizens cheer for Father as he concludes
his speech declaring victory against hatred,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.710
war, and human nature itself.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.380
When Preston gets back to the Clerics headquarters,
he reports to Vice-Counsel Dupont, the highest-ranking

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.290
member of the Tetragrammaton Council next
to Father.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.600
Dupont commends Preston for his keen ability
to sense when someone feels strong emotions

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.950
and asks Preston how he managed to acquire
the unique skill.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.790
Preston explains that he has learned to think
like the offenders by putting himself in their

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.790
position.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.301
When Dupont asks about his family, Preston
reveals that his wife has been arrested and

00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:09.889
incinerated for being a sense offender some
years ago.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.840
Dupont warns him that it was an egregious
error on Preston's part because he wasn't

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.969
able to sense that his own wife had been feeling
strong emotions.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.519
After leaving Duponts office, Preston looks
at the records at the evidentiary department

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.959
to find out if Partridge has logged the EC-10
book in his possession.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.049
When he learns that Partridge has not turned
in any evidence for weeks, Preston goes to

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.529
the Nethers to find him.

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:31.620
Soon, Preston comes across Partridge reading
Yeats' book inside an abandoned church.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.349
When Preston confronts him, Partridge admonishes
Preston for using words to describe emotions

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.080
he never felt.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.650
Partridge laments that everything that makes
them human has been extinguished because of

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.379
the council's mandates.

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.250
Preston reminds him that there is no war and
murder in the new world that the council has

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.549
created, but Partridge contends that he'd
gladly pay a high price as long as humans

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.409
are free to feel emotions.

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.340
Partridge slowly reaches for his gun.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.180
Preston points his firearm at him and shoots
Partridge in the head as he covers his face

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.689
with Yeats' book.

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.049
Partridge is immediately replaced by a career-driven
Cleric named Brandt.

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.510
After witnessing Preston kill his old partner,
Brandt tells Preston that he hopes to be as

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.670
uncompromising as he was.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.319
When Preston gets home, his son, Robbie, tells
him that he saw another boy crying earlier

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.779
and asks if he should notify the authorities.

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:14.529
Preston tells him that he should report the
incident without question.

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:17.829
In his sleep, Preston dreams about his wife
when she was arrested for suspicion of being

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.209
a sense offender.

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.689
When the police barged into their home, Preston
quickly disarmed two men.

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.659
Tell him that his wife has been charged with
a sense offense, and they have a warrant to

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:26.790
arrest her.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.569
When he puts his weapon down, his wife kisses
him and tells him not to forget her.

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.530
Preston wakes up in the morning and stares
at his wife's empty bed.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.599
As he prepares to brush his teeth, he accidentally
drops a vial of Prozium on the floor, so his

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.169
son tells him to stop by the Equilibrium Center
later to get a replacement.

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.879
When he arrives at the center, he learns that
the office is temporarily closed due to terrorist

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:45.879
activity.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:46.879
An announcer tells the citizens to proceed
to the Equilibrium Center in sector 8A to

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:47.879
get their supply of Prozium.

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.069
When Brandt fetches him at the Center, Preston
doesn't mention that he wasn't able to replace

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.629
his dose.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.579
Preston and Brandt proceed to raid the house
of a sense offender named Mary O'Brien.

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.219
Inside a hidden room, they discover an extensive
collection of forbidden items.

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.959
Knowing that she would be executed, Mary grabs
an officer's gun and aims it at Preston.

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.339
Brandt tries to shoot her, but Preston stops
him, arguing that they still need her to tell

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:06.949
them who her associates are.

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:10.620
During the interrogation, Preston asks Mary
about her acquaintances, but she deflects

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.189
by asking Preston about his purpose for living.

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.440
Preston tells her that his purpose is to serve
Libria and safeguard the continuity of society.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.840
Mary is unsatisfied with his response, arguing
that his purpose is circular because he is

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.070
only living to continue his existence.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.410
She then points out that without emotions,
Preston is just a ticking clock.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.240
……...
When he wakes up one morning, Preston frantically

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.139
peels away the tint on the window in his room
to see the sunrise.

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.740
After admiring the beauty of the sun rising
across the city, he rushes to the bathroom

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.020
and loads a dose of Prozium in the syringe
gun, but he refrains from shooting the drug

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.349
into his system.

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.540
On his way to the headquarters, he drops several
vials of Prozium on the ground.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.919
Inside the office, he starts rearranging his
desk as Father encourages them on the video

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.340
monitor to forget about their individuality
and embrace conformity.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.530
When Brandt asks him what he's doing, Preston
tells him that he's only trying to optimize

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.800
his space.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.490
Brandt tells Preston that they have an operation
to eliminate sense offenders in the Nether.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.509
During the raid, a man rushes towards Preston,
so Brandt shoots the rebel.

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.189
Preston catches the insurgent and inadvertently
stares into his eyes as his life slowly withers

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:07.189
away.

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:10.110
When he drops the rebel to the ground, he
is distraught by the sight of blood in his

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.110
hand.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.660
After the officers kill all the rebels, Preston
discovers a secret room filled with forbidden

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.660
items.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.990
As he inspects the objects in the room, he
comes across a vinyl record of Beethoven's

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.360
Ninth Symphony and plays it on the turntable.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.960
Upon hearing the first few bars of the Symphony,
Preston drops a snow globe on his hand and

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.669
starts to cry.

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.400
While the team burns down the contraband inside
the building, Brandt asks Preston why he didn't

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.720
turn over a book of nursery rhymes to the
evidentiary team.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.419
Preston tells him that he wants to log it
himself because the team doesn't always do

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:37.590
it properly.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.069
An officer interrupts them to tell them that
they've found dogs at the compound.

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:45.150
Brandt orders the officers to exterminate
all the dogs, but Preston raises an objection.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.949
However, Preston cannot think of a good reason
for his disapproval, so he tells them to go

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:50.659
ahead with the execution.

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:54.330
While the officers shoot the animals one by
one, a puppy runs to Preston.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.479
When he grabs it, he stares at the puppy as
it licks his face.

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.749
Preston reluctantly turns it over to the officers,
but he suddenly takes it back and says it

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:02.780
should be tested for diseases.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.099
During a meeting with Dupont, Preston raises
his concerns about the ruthless slaughter

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.409
of insurgents, arguing that they should be
apprehended and interrogated instead.

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:13.389
Dupont points out that Father has released
a mandate ordering officers to exterminate

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:15.419
all rebels without any processing.

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:18.449
He stresses that they should follow Father's
orders even though they might disagree with

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:19.669
them.

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:23.270
Inside the evidentiary department, he inspects
Mary's effects and takes a ribbon.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.590
He then goes back to the Nether to release
the dog that he rescued earlier.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.509
When the dog wouldn't leave him, he decides
to put it back in the trunk.

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.770
Soon, officers arrive at the area and ask
him for identification.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.039
The ranking officer asks Preston for the keys
to take a look at the trunk, but the officer

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:40.039
soon recognizes Preston, so he apologizes
and hands him back the keys.

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.960
But before Preston could take it, the officers
hear the dog yelping inside the trunk.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.860
Upon seeing the dog, the officers order Preston
to get down on his knees.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.629
Preston attacks the men and uses their own
weapons to kill them.

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:54.810
As other men arrive to apprehend him, Preston
takes out his weapons and fires at them relentlessly,

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.860
killing them all.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.940
Back at home, Preston hides a few vials of
Prozium behind the mirror before going to

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.240
the headquarters.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.350
While he's practicing his sword-fighting skills,
Brandt interrupts him and starts sparring

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.350
with him.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.370
Brandt taunts Preston by telling him that
he knows that Preston is thinking of the murders

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.229
in the Nether the previous night.

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:12.870
Brandt says that he is glad that it happened
because Father had ordered a crackdown on

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.009
the resistance.

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:17.330
After the sparring session, Brandt tells Preston
to get ready because they will be conducting

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.779
another raid in the Nether in Sector 7.

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:23.350
During the operation, Preston comes across
a group of rebels, but he lets them go and

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.370
leads them to a corridor to hide from the
police and the Clerics.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.510
The insurgents reluctantly follow Preston,
but he soon gains their trust when they see

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.879
him defending them.

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:34.349
When another group of officers arrives to
ask Preston about the gunshots, Preston pulls

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:37.340
out his weapons and starts attacking them
while the rebels escape.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.729
After killing the officers, Preston looks
for the rebels, only to find them lined up

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:42.470
for execution.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.400
Brandt asks Preston to shoot the men, but
Preston argues that they should be interrogated.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.090
Brandt surmises that Preston must be low on
ammo, so he gives him his weapon, insisting

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.530
that offenders are supposed to be shot on
sight.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.110
Preston takes the weapon, but he hesitates
to shoot.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.430
Finally, he hands the firearm back to Brandt,
saying it will be better for him to hold on

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.840
to his own gun.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.710
Brandt orders the police officers to execute
the rebels.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.639
Preston tries to keep a straight face as he
walks away in disappointment from failing

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:07.819
to save the insurgents’ lives.

00:08:07.819 --> 00:08:10.819
Preston reports to Dupont to tell him that
he's ready to become Father's instrument against

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:11.870
the resistance.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.289
After the meeting, Preston goes to the morgue
to ask for Partridge's effects before burning

00:08:15.289 --> 00:08:17.169
the body in the incinerator.

00:08:17.169 --> 00:08:20.510
Inside a thin metal case, he finds several
pictures of people unfamiliar to him, but

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.960
one photo with the word "Freedom" written
at the back catches his attention.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.210
Preston visits Mary and asks her about Partridge.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:30.680
Mary, however, contends that she doesn't hang
around clerics, so Preston shows Mary a photo

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.539
of her and Partridge together.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.740
When Preston mentions that he's the one who
killed Partridge, Mary grabs a pen and tries

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.089
to stab him.

00:08:37.089 --> 00:08:39.590
Preston blocks the attack and stares at her
eyes while pinning her down.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.209
After releasing his grip on Mary, Preston
deduces that they were lovers.

00:08:43.209 --> 00:08:46.649
As Preston continues to gather clues about
Partridge's involvement with the resistance,

00:08:46.649 --> 00:08:50.339
he learns that his former partner used to
meet regularly with a man named Jurgen.

00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:54.320
When he discovers a secret room inside a school
in block 42, Jurgen emerges and tells him

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.980
that they've been watching him.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.829
Jurgen takes Preston underground and lets
him see the activities of the people living

00:08:58.829 --> 00:08:59.829
there.

00:08:59.829 --> 00:09:03.019
To find out where his loyalties lie, Jurgen
puts Preston under a polygraph to make sure

00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:04.890
he feels strong emotions.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.490
When Jurgen mentions Mary, the vibrations
on the polygraph machine become stronger.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.130
Jurgen discloses that he knows Preston carries
Mary's ribbon in his pocket and frequently

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.070
smells it when no one's looking.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.080
Jurgen asserts that Preston's feelings will
only be satisfied if he allows himself to

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.610
fall into Mary.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:21.339
Preston informs Jurgen that Mary will be incinerated
the next day.

00:09:21.339 --> 00:09:25.320
Later, Jurgen warns Preston that emotions
can be destructive without restraint, so some

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.180
members of the resistance are forced not to
feel anything.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.190
Preston asks Jurgen what he can do for the
resistance, so Jurgen urges him to kill Father.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.270
After leaving the Underground, police officers
arrest Preston and take him to Dupont, who

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.870
tells him that he heard rumors that a Cleric
has decided to stop taking Prozium.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.019
When he asks Preston what he's been doing
with his time lately, Preston tells him that

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:45.150
he's attempting to contact the resistance.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.671
He warns that the council will be doomed once
the Underground compromises the Clerics, so

00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:52.180
Preston promises to double his efforts in
infiltrating the rebels.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.540
When he gets home, he leaves another vial
inside the mirror and watches his children

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.540
sleep.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.000
Robbie wakes up and sees him holding the syringe
gun.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.610
Preston explains that he's only trying to
make sure that Robbie is taking his daily

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.880
dose.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.220
When he meets with Mary the next day, she
realizes that he's not been taking his regular

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.220
doses.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.291
Mary senses that Preston is lost and confused,
so she reaches out her hand to him, despite

00:10:11.291 --> 00:10:13.269
the risk of the cameras seeing her.

00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:16.690
Soon, Preston meets up with Jurgen again to
tell him that assassinating Father would be

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.790
impossible because the reclusive leader hasn't
met with anyone face to face in quite a while.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.259
Jurgen argues that Preston is trained for
such an occasion.

00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:27.730
Preston, however, is still unsure that anything
will change once Father is dead.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.260
Jurgen assures him that the Underground network
will take action to destroy Prozium labs around

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.260
the city.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.269
He stresses that their cause will be won by
human nature if they manage to disrupt the

00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:37.269
Prozium supply even by just one day.

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:41.070
Due to Jurgen's determination, Preston agrees
to assassinate Father despite the lack of

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.139
means to do it.

00:10:42.139 --> 00:10:45.450
As Preston is about to leave the Underground,
Jurgen warns him not to see Mary because it

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.430
will only make it hard for him to complete
his new mission.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.230
Preston goes to the office and watches the
preparation for the execution on the video

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.440
monitors.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.839
Later on, he decides to watch footage of his
wife's execution.

00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:59.020
Distraught by his lack of reaction at that
time, Preston runs to the incineration chamber

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.190
to save Mary.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.790
However, when he arrives, the executioner
tells him that the machine turbines have already

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:04.980
been started.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.660
If they open the door, the turbines will cause
an explosion on the streets.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:13.170
Preston holds back the tears from his eyes
as he listens to the countdown to Mary's incineration.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.510
When he breaks down and cries outside the
building, Brandt arrests him and takes him

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.510
to Dupont.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.079
Brandt tells the Vice Counsel that Preston
has been involved with a woman charged with

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:23.710
sense crime, and he was also the one who killed
the officers in the Nether.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.000
Preston reminds Dupont about his mission to
expose the traitor among the Clerics and claims

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.829
that he has now brought the man to him.

00:11:28.829 --> 00:11:32.080
He then tells Dupont that Brandt is the traitor
that he's been looking for.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.430
When Dupont checks the gun used to kill the
police officers at the Nether, the report

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.370
reveals that it was Brandt's gun.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.660
Brandt looks at his firearm and learns that
he has Preston's gun in his possession.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.790
He realizes that Preston switched the firearms
when he asked Preston to execute the rebels.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:48.820
However, Preston tells Dupont that Brandt
took his firearm when he arrested him.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.829
Dupont orders the men to take Brandt to the
Hall of Destruction for summary judgment and

00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:53.290
eventual combustion.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.970
Later, Dupont notifies Preston that he will
order a team to conduct a search on his house

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.870
because the law requires it.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.209
Preston agrees, but he tells Dupont that he's
disappointed that he hasn't still met Father

00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:05.480
despite being an instrument for the destruction
of the Underground.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.459
Dupont reminds him that Father never grants
an audience to anyone.

00:12:08.459 --> 00:12:11.540
Preston runs back home to take the vials of
Prozium hidden behind the mirror as the police

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.139
start searching the house.

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:15.500
But much to his surprise, the vials are no
longer there.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.500
Not long, his son enters the bathroom and
shows him the vials in his hand, telling Preston

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.240
to be more careful in the future.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.339
Robbie then reveals that he and his sister
have stopped taking Prozium since their mother

00:12:24.339 --> 00:12:26.079
was executed.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.509
Preston meets up with the Underground and
calls the Council to tell them that he has

00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:30.089
located the resistance.

00:12:30.089 --> 00:12:33.060
On the day of his meeting with Father, the
Proctor tells him that he must still undergo

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.310
a test before meeting the reclusive leader.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.570
After surrendering his weapon, he undergoes
a polygraph test.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.990
The man conducting the test asks him the easiest
way to take away a weapon from a Grammaton

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.140
Cleric.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.779
Before he could respond, Brandt whispers the
answer to his ear, saying, "You ask him for

00:12:46.779 --> 00:12:47.779
it."

00:12:47.779 --> 00:12:50.960
Father addresses Preston over the video screen,
saying Brandt's arrest was a mere ploy to

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.040
make Preston feel like he had won.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.000
Father tells him that he had been trying to
infiltrate the Underground, but he realizes

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.670
that he needs a man that will think and feel
like the rebels.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.930
When Father points out that Preston was the
only man who has such an ability, Preston

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.550
is puzzled because he has never met Father
before.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.860
Father then reveals himself to be Dupont and
discloses that the real Father had died years

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:08.860
ago.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.060
The council has elected him to replace Father
and continue his traditions.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.069
Preston, infuriated by the deception, pulls
out the guns he concealed in his sleeves and

00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:18.220
starts shooting at the men in the room.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.199
Preston warns Dupont that he's coming for
him and goes on a rampage, shooting every

00:13:21.199 --> 00:13:22.870
guard that gets in his way.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.790
When Preston reaches Dupont's room, Brandt
is there standing by the Vice-Counsel's side.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:30.880
After he swiftly kills more of Dupont's guards,
Brandt engages him in a sword fight.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.579
When Brandt takes a swing at him, he strikes
Brandt with three quick slashes, killing Brandt

00:13:34.579 --> 00:13:35.649
instantly.

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:39.079
As he drops to the ground, his slashed face
falls off.

00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:42.459
Dupont grabs a firearm and attacks Preston,
but Preston manages to grab a gun from the

00:13:42.459 --> 00:13:44.899
floor and fends off Dupont's attacks.

00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:48.019
Despite Dupont's skills, Preston defeats him
and takes away his weapon.

00:13:48.019 --> 00:13:51.600
Fearing death at the hand of Preston, Dupont
pleads with him, confessing that he also feels

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.980
emotions just like him and the rebels.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.920
Dupont then asks Preston if killing him would
be worth the price of guilt, knowing that

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.490
he has killed a man with feelings.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:03.149
In response, Preston shoots Dupont in the
head, saying he'll pay the price gladly.

00:14:03.149 --> 00:14:06.450
Before leaving the building, Preston destroys
the machines broadcasting Father's messages

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.639
across Libria.

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:11.980
Soon, bombs start exploding in Prozium factories
all over the city, signaling the rebels that

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:21.490
it's time to rise against their tyrannical
rulers.
