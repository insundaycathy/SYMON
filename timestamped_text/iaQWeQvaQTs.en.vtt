00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.200
There's no nightmare fuel worse than being in&nbsp;
one of Jigsaw's traps. If he picks you for one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.840
of his games, what would you do? In this video,&nbsp;
I'm going to break down how to beat every single&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.560
one of his traps, and the mistakes you should&nbsp;
avoid, starting with the 2017 movie Jigsaw,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.120
where his genius shines through, in both the&nbsp;
games, and an ending that connects every trap in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.080
the series. And I will do the whole franchise&nbsp;
if I have to. This is how to beat Jigsaw.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.000
We start off following a man running from&nbsp;
the cops, and into an empty warehouse. Up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
on the roof top, he finds a detonator duct&nbsp;
taped to a beam. Desperate and cornered,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
he demands to see a detective Halloran, and&nbsp;
if he doesn't come in the next 17 minutes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.480
five people are going to die. The detective&nbsp;
arrives at the scene with his partner, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.680
obviously they think he means it's five hostages&nbsp;
strapped to a bomb, but time is running out. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.400
pulls on the switch and the cops start firing.&nbsp;
But something is wrong with this whole situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.960
and it doesn't take a detective to see it. He&nbsp;
pulled the trigger, but there was no explosion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.920
He's holding a long range wireless detonator,&nbsp;
which typically has a range of 1000 meters and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.320
must have line of sight, which means whatever it's&nbsp;
going to trigger is nearby, but there's nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.840
around them except empty factories. So there's&nbsp;
no one here to kill. This is highly suspicious.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.120
The detective looks for clues, not realizing he&nbsp;
will soon be caught in one of Jigsaw's traps.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.000
With his dying words, he tells the detectives the&nbsp;
games have begun, and somewhere in a dark room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.040
a countdown has reached zero and four people wake&nbsp;
up. And they realize the only way out is through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.920
a door of saw blades, until they hear the voice&nbsp;
of a man, and he's speaking directly to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.280
They must now play a game. All that's required&nbsp;
is a blood sacrifice. With that ominous warning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.120
their chains start pulling them towards the&nbsp;
spinning blades. If I were in this room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.600
I'd be absolutely terrified, but they're all&nbsp;
wasting time by resisting because this trap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.120
is possible to escape with some quick&nbsp;
thinking and strategy. Now, you didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.120
say it needed to be your blood, so you might&nbsp;
think to push someone into your door's blades,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.120
which is super cold blooded, even for me. But&nbsp;
the room is being monitored, and there's no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.080
way to evade any potential consequences,&nbsp;
so cheating isn't a great option here.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.880
One woman has an epiphany. She walks towards the&nbsp;
spinning blades and cuts her arm. Immediately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.760
a green light flickers on her helmet and the&nbsp;
blades in her door stop in place. She figured&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.520
it out quickly. But first, I would definitely&nbsp;
be trying to cut the chains with the saw.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.840
Only if that fails, is it time to think about&nbsp;
where to cut yourself. Your limbs have vital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.680
arteries and are important for mobility,&nbsp;
and if you think a finger will do the trick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.760
you'll find it hard to avoid cutting a flexor&nbsp;
tendon, as the margin for error is as little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.240
as three millimeters, and circular saws are not&nbsp;
forgiving. The best part of the body to cut is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.240
your stomach's subcutaneous adipose fat tissue,&nbsp;
damaging no vital organs and no loss of mobility.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.920
The others follow their lead and cut&nbsp;
themselves as they're dragged to the next room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.840
but the last man is in for a rude awakening&nbsp;
as he's too late to open the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.360
This was a mercy kill compared to&nbsp;
what's awaiting them next in this room.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.560
Meanwhile, a body has been found wearing the&nbsp;
same distinctive bucket. In the autopsy, two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.120
medics find a jigsaw-shaped cut in the man's skin.&nbsp;
The calling card of the legendary Jigsaw Killer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.760
John Kramer, who's been dead for 10 years. The&nbsp;
lead doctor pulls out a chip from the man's wound,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.920
revealing that there are four more people left&nbsp;
in his trap. The survivors who made it past the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.160
first stage, try to figure out what is going on&nbsp;
and why they've been chosen, and they realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.880
they've been chosen for past sins. But it's&nbsp;
time to focus on what matters. This is a game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.000
and games can be won. You have a critical moment&nbsp;
here to plan ahead for what's to come. If you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.760
not checking the environment for tools that&nbsp;
could help you, then you're wasting your time.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.080
This place is loaded with useful tools. The teeth&nbsp;
of the pitchfork could be put through the chains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.640
to stop it. You could also use the hoof nipper&nbsp;
to break the camera. Suddenly, the winches start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.960
pulling them forward. The first instinct is to&nbsp;
quickly wrap a chain around a sturdy object,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.000
but it likely won't be enough. Your best chance is&nbsp;
to cross your own chain around the winch and into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.280
a knot, so that as it tightens, it pulls on itself&nbsp;
and jams, and the knot wouldn't be able to move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.320
through the wheels. One guy spots a tape recorder&nbsp;
and grabs it, causing the winches to break off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.760
except this is a set up for the next trap to be&nbsp;
hung from the ceiling. Three syringes drop down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.880
all marked with numbers. The tape recorder has a&nbsp;
message saying, a purse snatcher has been poisoned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.160
and only one syringe has the antidote. The others&nbsp;
have saline or a deadly acid. They're only clue is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.040
a question, what is the value of a life to you?&nbsp;
Luckily, the blonde's guilty expression is all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.000
the proof they need to know that she's the thief.&nbsp;
The problem, she isn't willing to take the shot.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.880
Now, with that being said, there might be a way&nbsp;
to outsmart this. An acid will burn. Put someone's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.080
skin or supply blood to test the compounds. If&nbsp;
you experience itching, rashes or skin necrosis,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.240
you may be able to eliminate it, allowing&nbsp;
you to confirm by the taste of salt that one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.040
of the remaining two really is saline solution,&nbsp;
revealing the last syringe as the antidote. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.920
relying on others' cooperation is risky, because&nbsp;
hesitation or dishonesty will get us killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.960
In this case, the puzzle could be&nbsp;
solved without their confession.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.040
The tape gave enough information here.&nbsp;
A purse snatcher who doesn't value life.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.280
If the lesson he wants to shame you with is that&nbsp;
life is worth very little to you, then the lowest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.000
number of 3.53 could be guessed correctly&nbsp;
as a monetary value, saving everyone from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.120
a bad case of the Mondays. Instead, the bearded&nbsp;
man stabs all three syringes into the blondie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.560
and they're finally set free. They all watch in&nbsp;
horror as the acid eats her face to a leaky pulp.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.320
The guy in plaid checks the antidote syringe,&nbsp;
finding a sequence of numbers inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.160
and uses them to successfully unlock the&nbsp;
next door, which is great, but what about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.640
the windows? I would stack the bales of hay to&nbsp;
get up and see if I can break free. But sure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.440
let's just walk into the next trap. They might&nbsp;
be safe for now, but another brutal trap awaits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.600
them through this door. I would take precautions&nbsp;
here. We should survey the room before leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.520
and grab what we can, because it might prove&nbsp;
useful and you simply don't know what's next.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.200
The last door is mechanized, so jamming the&nbsp;
door with this wheelbarrow could keep it open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.680
long enough for them to retreat when things go&nbsp;
horribly wrong. They don't stop to consider any of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.560
this as the door slams behind them, forcing them&nbsp;
inwards to face their next twisted confessional.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.840
But I'm such a coward, you're gonna&nbsp;
have to drag me out of the first room.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.360
The cops find more evidence that&nbsp;
Jigsaw is somehow still alive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.120
confirming the voiceprint in the message&nbsp;
was definitely Jigsaw's. They don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.600
what to make of this, because all signs point&nbsp;
towards an impossible Jigsaw resurrection,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.200
but if they dug deeper they could have solved this&nbsp;
case right here. Any audio recording since 2005&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.840
can be accurately dated using just the background&nbsp;
hum. The electrical frequency from our power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.840
grids have a unique fluctuation, and matching&nbsp;
that frequency to a database, they would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.080
been able to confirm which power grid it was&nbsp;
recorded in, and the date of its recording.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.920
The three survivors enter another room and&nbsp;
find that not only are the windows barred,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.680
but they're in the countryside. These traps&nbsp;
are personal, so it's time for honesty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.840
The bearded man admits he's cheated on his&nbsp;
wives along with a slew of other crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.480
The woman tells them her husband accidentally&nbsp;
smothered her baby and she's never forgiven him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.280
Hardly a confession. We also know this woman was&nbsp;
a thief whose greed ended up killing someone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.400
We'll find out that every single one of&nbsp;
these people are here because they did some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.400
bad [0:06:46.9] ____ and Jigsaw tracked them&nbsp;
down for payback, but you still have a chance.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.480
Now, this room is suspiciously void of traps,&nbsp;
but you can guarantee there's one somewhere,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.480
but it's not time to break out yet. Find&nbsp;
the trap first without setting it off. By&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.240
cautiously investigating the area, they find&nbsp;
a great vantage point from the sides here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.480
exposing the trap beneath the floorboards.&nbsp;
Then, it's time to find the camera and break it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.720
giving you enough time to avoid the trap and break&nbsp;
down the door with the tools inside. But this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.640
guy doesn't care much for planning as he falls&nbsp;
through the floorboard and right into the trap.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.600
Breaking through the floor with a&nbsp;
shovel, they find a tape recorder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.240
he finally grabs it, and they play it back.&nbsp;
Pull the lever and everyone goes free.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.920
I would try to get them out by attaching&nbsp;
these chains and hooks on the pulley wheels,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.440
pulling to reverse the trap and give&nbsp;
enough slack to pull his leg out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.600
But this wouldn't work because I'm not&nbsp;
on steroids. My very average strength&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.200
probably won't match the pulley's force.&nbsp;
A better method is to find something heavy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.520
enough to use as a counterweight to help relieve&nbsp;
the tension of the wire. There are tons of heavy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.200
objects in this room, and if you can figure&nbsp;
out the leverage needed, it might be enough.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.320
Suddenly, all the lights go out, except for the&nbsp;
one in the silo. Together, they walk inside and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.800
find a TV remote hanging on a string. With&nbsp;
no other options, they grab it, immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.920
locking them in. The TV turns on, announcing that&nbsp;
this guy must pull the lever to save their lives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.400
but might lose his leg as a result. And in that&nbsp;
moment, the silo begins to fill with grain.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.480
Okay, let's take another look. This is obviously&nbsp;
a trap, so maybe take the doors off the hinges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.800
before entering in case you need to bail, but&nbsp;
they've made this harder on themselves. Grain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.560
entrapment is no joke, and takes only 22 seconds&nbsp;
to be completely submerged. Desperate as it might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.960
seem, I would wrap my shoelaces around my hands,&nbsp;
and weave them through holes in the iron mesh to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.600
stay on top of the grain. Also, dispersing weight&nbsp;
across the grain makes it harder to get sucked in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.760
It's not a permanent solution, but it buys time&nbsp;
for this guy to sack up and pull the lever.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.240
Trapped in the grain and unable to move,&nbsp;
a pitchfork flies down, inches away from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.800
them. This just got a lot more interesting.&nbsp;
Saw blades and knives begin raining down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.240
one of them flunk right into his shoulder, and&nbsp;
they really don't have much to work with here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.800
but every weapon that misses them is an object&nbsp;
they can use to protect themselves. The screams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.320
of pain overwhelm him with guilt, and he pulls the&nbsp;
lever. His leg gets sliced, the silo doors burst,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.760
and the exit swings open, leading to the next&nbsp;
room. This was one leg short of a miracle.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.520
Meanwhile in the lab, they discover&nbsp;
particles of pig feces and blood under&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.240
the nails of the victim that matches the&nbsp;
DNA of Jigsaw himself. He must be alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.760
And all this could help them find the others,&nbsp;
but they're interrupted with a new arrival.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.480
It looks like the purse thief. Her autopsy shows&nbsp;
that she has a jigsaw-shaped cut in her tongue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.200
and the assistant gets way too excited about&nbsp;
this. And there's a lot more where that came from,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.880
as she shows the doctor her hobby room full&nbsp;
of Jigsaw traps. It's incredibly suspicious,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.600
but also kind of kinky. Fashioning a tourniquet&nbsp;
with her belt, the woman bandages the guy's leg,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.200
while the other survivor struggles&nbsp;
to force open a door. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:43.280
the tractor's lights turn on and inside is a tape&nbsp;
recorder meant for him, and he fell for the bait.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.760
Okay, hay scattered across the floor&nbsp;
is not an accident. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.440
you have to play the game, but you don't have&nbsp;
to walk into its trap if you can help it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.920
environmental awareness saves lives. So&nbsp;
maybe next time before you get caught,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.960
investigate the giant trap in&nbsp;
the middle of the floor first.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.520
The recorder continues. As we find out that&nbsp;
years ago, he sold a faulty motorbike to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.560
Jigsaw's nephew, who died minutes after buying it.&nbsp;
If he doesn't pull the handbrake at the bottom to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.200
stop the swirling blades, he'll be turned into&nbsp;
human sashimi. Now, once you're lowered in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.440
you don't have a chance, so lucky for&nbsp;
him, the gears of this trap are exposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.360
This can be jammed by putting a strong metal&nbsp;
object between the gears or the wheel spokes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.640
The woman tries this and it works, but not long&nbsp;
after, the force pulls through the obstruction.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.720
Okay, this thing is freaking strong, but there&nbsp;
was something they could have done even before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.400
all of this. She could have helped him&nbsp;
swing as soon as he was off the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.400
increasing his angle of momentum, which would&nbsp;
give him several chances to reach the bike and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.120
pull himself onto it. I mean, look how close he&nbsp;
is already, it wouldn't take much. But that's only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.520
half the battle, there's no kill switch and the&nbsp;
only break is through the trap. If the engine is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.080
already running, disconnecting the battery won't&nbsp;
cut it off. Now, I'm not a motorcycle mechanic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.600
so this one is tricky, but maybe&nbsp;
this key in the ignition will help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.080
It's worth a shot. But time runs out for&nbsp;
him, resulting in another brutal death.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.560
The woman is able to force open a doorway and&nbsp;
make it to the other side, but she sees a man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.680
in a pig mask and gets knocked out. The next day,&nbsp;
the suspect has gone missing from the hospital,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.800
and when John Kramer's casket is opened up, the&nbsp;
suspect's body is inside and Jigsaw is nowhere to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:20.080
be found. The woman wakes up to find both her and&nbsp;
the other survivor have been shackled to the wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.720
by John Kramer, the Jigsaw killer himself, who&nbsp;
is very much alive, and tells them they've been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.120
thinking about all of this backwards. Jigsaw&nbsp;
reveals that she had lied about her husband&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.280
smothering the baby, she was the one who&nbsp;
killed it and framed her husband for murder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.640
so now he's made this really simple. Loaded with&nbsp;
one shell, he leaves them one shotgun placed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.360
between them both. The woman realizes someone&nbsp;
will have to die and she won't let it be her.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.400
Now, they're forgetting two key details here.&nbsp;
First, there's always a way out for everyone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.120
and second, he wants to make a moral point. Now,&nbsp;
this might be with the benefit of hindsight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.360
but when he holds up the shell and says, "Here's&nbsp;
the key to freedom," maybe it has a little more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.840
meaning and maybe trying to kill someone is&nbsp;
playing right into his hands. They would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.640
seen this in every room, with each tape talking&nbsp;
about how they put their lives before others.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.680
But how do we beat this? Investigating the&nbsp;
room and devices before any rash action is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.400
always the right plan. But they don't. He begs&nbsp;
her not to kill him, but she grabs the gun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:21.040
lines up the barrel and pulls the trigger,&nbsp;
her face ripping open as the gun backfires.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.760
He then has a horrifying realization as he sees&nbsp;
fragments of keys, color-coded green for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:32.080
woman's lock and yellow for his. The keys were&nbsp;
in the shell. They could have escaped, if she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.560
hadn't fired the gun. This is what he meant,&nbsp;
when he said they've got all this backwards.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.560
But wait, let's back up, because there may&nbsp;
have been another way. This is actually the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.280
most forgiving trap so far, because there's no&nbsp;
time limit here and the trap is only a padlock.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.200
But let's say there were no keys, I'm immediately&nbsp;
grabbing the gun to prevent the other guy from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.280
shooting. This railing is attached by four&nbsp;
screws on each end. With no time limit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.680
it might be possible to kick it loose to slip the&nbsp;
chains out. However, this isn't a great strategy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.840
if you only have one leg. Without a time&nbsp;
limit, I would try to disassemble the gun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.080
using the pieces to pry open the padlock, which&nbsp;
is possible to do with a pair of wrenches.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.240
It would likely be extremely&nbsp;
difficult in this case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.400
but all it needs is leverage and sturdy tools.&nbsp;
It also might be your only chance to live.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.320
The detective learns about the assistant's&nbsp;
warehouse and they bust into an extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.120
suspicious, museum of terror. Now behind a&nbsp;
fake wall, they find another shredded victim,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.880
hanging from the ceiling. The doctor gets&nbsp;
arrested because he was seeing the assistant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.200
at the warehouse the night before. But claims,&nbsp;
that inside the suspects body is a bullet that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.840
could have only been fired by Halloran's gun.&nbsp;
This means the detective shot him, to hide his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.480
true identity as the Jigsaw killer, and he&nbsp;
shows the detective the evidence. Back home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.800
the assistant tells him she knows where Jigsaw&nbsp;
is playing his game and decides to check it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.720
They arrive at the farm where they find the traps&nbsp;
but Halloran has followed them. He tries to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.840
them hostage and they're able to break away, and&nbsp;
split up and Halloran gets knocked out. He and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:57.200
doctor wake up with a collar of laser cutters&nbsp;
on their necks. This is Jigsaw's final game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.640
confess their sins as to why they&nbsp;
deserve to die and they'll be set free.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.760
Okay, hold up. I'm not waiting around for&nbsp;
a confession here. I can't see my trap,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.560
but I can see the other person's and assume mine&nbsp;
is identical. To produce enough energy to power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.120
these lasers, there must be wiring inside the&nbsp;
mechanized arm. It won't hold your weight extended&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.680
like this. The first thing I'm trying to do is&nbsp;
grab the collar and use my weight to pull it down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.400
hoping to break the arm, and maybe sever the power&nbsp;
supply. Halloran activates the doctor's collar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.680
and forces him to confess his crime. He was the&nbsp;
one that messed up Jigsaw's cancer x-rays, dooming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.960
him. But it's not the confession that Jigsaw&nbsp;
wants and the doctor has his neck lasered open,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:40.240
killing him instantly. The detective is next&nbsp;
and his lasers turn on. He confesses a whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.720
laundry list of crimes. But there's something&nbsp;
wrong here, the lasers on his collar burn the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:50.000
ceiling above him, while the ones on the doctor's&nbsp;
didn't. What is going on? The doctor gets up from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.760
the floor and confesses that he is Jigsaw.&nbsp;
Everything was staged and the trap was fake.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.840
Years ago, he was chosen for a game because&nbsp;
he really did screw up Jigsaw's x-ray,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.760
which led to the cancer being detected too&nbsp;
late to treat him. But Jigsaw had mercy at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.640
last minute and saved him, because it was just an&nbsp;
accident. Letting him become Jigsaw's apprentice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.640
He was the guy in the beginning of the movie,&nbsp;
who we thought had died in the buzz saw room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.400
Now, 10 years later, he set things up&nbsp;
to trick them that Jigsaw was back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.880
planted fake evidence to frame the detective.&nbsp;
He shot the first suspect on the rooftop with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:26.160
sniper and faked the tapes with Jigsaw's voice.&nbsp;
And no one will know the truth. All because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.640
detective let this guy, the criminal&nbsp;
who killed the doctor's wife, go free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:36.080
The doctor leaves Halloran to his death as a laser&nbsp;
cutter splits his head into pieces. Game over.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.720
Now, this is just the start. There are more&nbsp;
convoluted horrifying Jigsaw traps out there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.800
and we're going to get them all in upcoming&nbsp;
videos. But what do you think? How would you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.720
beat the death traps to Jigsaw? Let me know&nbsp;
