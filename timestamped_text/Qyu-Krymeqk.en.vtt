00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.240
Detective Recapped here. Today, I'm going&nbsp;
to explain a Crime-Mystery film called:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.480
"Wild Things.” Filled to the brim with deception&nbsp;
and betrayal, this film proves that people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.480
don't always turn out to be who they say they&nbsp;
are. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.560
For the charming guidance counselor, Sam&nbsp;
Lombardo, carnal abuse is something the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.920
seniors of Blue Bay High School should&nbsp;
know about. To educate the students,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.920
Sam invites Detectives Ray Duquette and Gloria&nbsp;
Perez to give a lecture about the matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.680
As Ray introduces himself and his partner,&nbsp;
one of the students, Suzie Toller,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.000
shows hostility toward him and rudely walks out&nbsp;
of the auditorium. After the lecture, Sam and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.800
detectives see Suzie immediately walk away as soon&nbsp;
she spots them. Ray informs Gloria that he busted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.120
Suzie the previous year for possession, while&nbsp;
Sam adds that she spent six months in Camp Nine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.960
Although Suzie's reaction is understandable,&nbsp;
it's a wonder why she's too nasty towards Ray,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.880
considering the fact that she's the one in the&nbsp;
wrong. Suzie must've felt that she was wrongfully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.360
jailed, or maybe, there's more to the story of her&nbsp;
arrest than the detective lets on. At the school&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.040
entrance, Sam thanks the detectives for coming&nbsp;
to their school, and as they get to their car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.840
Gloria notes how Ray doesn't seem to like Sam.&nbsp;
Ray implies that Sam has a thing for school girls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.000
and Gloria teases him that she won’t mind sleeping&nbsp;
with the guidance counselor. Before the lecture,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.840
most of the girl students aren't embarrassed to&nbsp;
show their interest in Sam. It is clear enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.000
that Sam is popular among them, which explains&nbsp;
Ray's coldness towards him. It's not that Ray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.160
is jealous, but he thinks Sam is a womanizer who&nbsp;
would even prey on his students—a possible threat.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.480
One day, Kelly Van Ryan approaches Sam&nbsp;
after he's gone sailing with his student,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.120
Jimmy. Obviously flirting, Kelly asks the guidance&nbsp;
counselor if she and her friend can wash his Jeep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.920
for the senior car wash, and Sam says they can.&nbsp;
She then asks Sam if he can give her a ride home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.200
saying her mother was supposed to&nbsp;
pick her up but didn't show up. Here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.600
Kelly shows that she isn't afraid to go after what&nbsp;
she wants, which is Sam. She doesn't even mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.880
teasing him in front of another student, proving&nbsp;
that she pays no mind to what others think.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.080
Sam seems reluctant to do it, so he offers Jimmy&nbsp;
a ride, too. They then see Suzie trying to fix&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.680
her car on their way out of the campus, and&nbsp;
Sam asks if she needs a lift home. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.000
Kelly pisses Suzie off by insulting the way she's&nbsp;
dressed, and once her car is fixed, Suzie flips&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.360
them off. With Kelly getting dropped off, her mom,&nbsp;
Sandra, comes out of the balcony wearing a bikini.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.360
To Kelly's irritation, Sandra asks Sam if he'd&nbsp;
like to have a drink with her inside, but Sam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.520
politely refuses and quickly drives away. Sandra's&nbsp;
way of talking to Sam indicates they used to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.600
romantically involved, and Kelly doesn't even&nbsp;
bother hiding her annoyance. She's probably irate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.200
that she has to compete with her mother for Sam's&nbsp;
attention, but Sam isn't even interested in them.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.560
On Sunday, Kelly gets to washing Sam’s jeep. She&nbsp;
then enters the house without Sam's permission,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.400
and as she stands there and drips water on&nbsp;
the floor, she looks at Sam salaciously.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.400
Later on, Kelly comes out of the house looking&nbsp;
upset with her hair and clothes disheveled.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.600
When Kelly comes out of the house, it's hard&nbsp;
to determine if something really happened to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.680
her because there's no proof or witness. Her&nbsp;
earlier behavior, her dishevelled appearance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.400
and the upset look on her face are&nbsp;
telling completely different things.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.560
The next day, as Sandra spends the day in bed&nbsp;
with Frankie, she receives a call from Kelly's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.480
school informing her that her daughter was absent.&nbsp;
She quickly asks Sam if he's heard from Kelly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.280
but Sam doesn't know where she is. As they talk,&nbsp;
Sandra hears her daughter outside, skeet-shooting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.040
so she tells Sam she's already found her. She then&nbsp;
tells him that it was nice seeing him the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.200
day, but Sam isn't in the mood for her games and&nbsp;
just ends the call. When Sandra asks her daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.680
why she skipped school, Kelly starts crying and&nbsp;
says she misses her dad. Though Sandra sympathizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.200
with her daughter, all she could tell her is that&nbsp;
she isn’t sure why her father killed himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.920
As Kelly continues to cry, she confesses&nbsp;
that Sam Lombardo violated her. Of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.680
it’s only natural that Sandra will quickly&nbsp;
believe anything Kelly says. Though they don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.680
always see things eye-to-eye, Sandra is still&nbsp;
a mother who is protective of her daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.120
But things aren’t quite adding up, and if only&nbsp;
Sandra had spent more time with her daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.720
and less time with her lover, then maybe she&nbsp;
would see right away if Kelly’s lying or not.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.200
Wasting no time, Sandra contacts Ray and Gloria,&nbsp;
informing them of what happened to her daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.680
As Gloria records her statement, Kelly starts&nbsp;
recounting the events at Sam's house. According&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.680
to her, Sam started rubbing her shoulders,&nbsp;
and she let him because he was a nice guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.240
The next thing she knew, Sam's hand was already&nbsp;
in her shorts from behind. Despite her protests,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.560
Sam had her hands pinned behind her and repeatedly&nbsp;
urged her to just let it happen. When Sam suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.640
stopped, he insulted her by saying no little&nbsp;
girl could ever make him finish. Once Ray,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.040
Gloria, and Bryce Hunter are done watching Kelly's&nbsp;
recorded confession, Gloria deduces that nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.280
happened between Sam and Kelly. Gloria believes&nbsp;
Kelly was just acting because she was disappointed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.280
that Sam didn't come on to her when she wanted&nbsp;
him to. Gloria then suggests they make Kelly take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.480
a polygraph test, but Ray opposes, saying that her&nbsp;
lawyer, Tom Baxter, will cut her down. Gloria gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.560
mad that Ray won't back her up, and as they argue,&nbsp;
Bryce tells them to start with the investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.120
It's difficult to explain how Gloria immediately&nbsp;
concluded that Kelly was lying. It may come from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.880
her experience as a detective to quickly tell&nbsp;
if a person is telling the truth or not. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.440
since they lack any physical evidence, Gloria is&nbsp;
right to call for a lie detector test for Kelly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.880
However, they live in a place where even the&nbsp;
authorities are afraid of powerful and wealthy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.440
people like Sandra Van Ryan and Tom Baxter.&nbsp;
Unfortunately for them, Kelly is a Van Ryan.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.760
After learning about Kelly's accusations and&nbsp;
that Sandra is pushing for his suspension,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.600
Sam gets mad and asks Artie why the board would&nbsp;
decide without hearing his side first. Feeling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.080
sorry for him, Artie tells him to just wait until&nbsp;
his name is cleared, but Sam won't hear him out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.760
Sam believes that no one ever gets cleared from an&nbsp;
accusation like that, adding that it will follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.760
him wherever he goes. Artie then advises him to&nbsp;
hire a lawyer, but he isn't sure where to find one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.840
who would agree to go up against the Van Ryans in&nbsp;
court. Another proof that money can buy anything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.080
Sandra uses her influence to convince the board&nbsp;
to suspend Sam without going through due process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.120
Artie, who has a position in school,&nbsp;
can't even do anything about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.240
which is even more upsetting because he&nbsp;
knows what they're doing to Sam isn't fair.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.720
After some time, Sam hires Ken Bowden to defend&nbsp;
him against the Van Ryans. When Sam insists that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.400
he's just Kelly’s guidance counselor and nothing&nbsp;
more, Bowden assures him he's got nothing to worry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.240
about. Even though most people are afraid to&nbsp;
go up against someone more powerful than them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.240
there are still few who are willing to do what's&nbsp;
right, and one of them is Ken Bowden. Bowden isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.840
scared to face the Van Ryans in court, but&nbsp;
instead, he considers it to be a challenge.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.640
That night, Sam goes to a local bar to&nbsp;
drink before going home. As he drives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.880
he notices a vehicle following him. It bumps&nbsp;
into his Jeep until he goes over the swamp.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.720
Bleeding, Sam manages to get out of his Jeep.&nbsp;
But the driver, who turns out to be Frankie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.800
punches him and starts beating him up. The next&nbsp;
day, Bowden goes to Sam's house and gets startled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.040
when Sam comes out with a gun pointed at him.&nbsp;
Sam quickly apologizes and invites Bowden inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.360
the house, where he informs him that Frankie Condo&nbsp;
attacked him and was driving Sandra's Range Rover.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.640
Bowden wants him to go to the cops&nbsp;
and make a statement, but Sam refuses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.160
saying he doesn't need any more trouble from&nbsp;
Sandra. Confident that they'll win against the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.000
Van Ryans, Bowden brings up the time when Kelly&nbsp;
ran away from home and stayed in a motel to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.160
high after her father killed himself. Bowden then&nbsp;
says the authorities haven't taken his statement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.440
yet because they're still looking for dirt,&nbsp;
which they won't find. When Bowden looks at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.800
Sam and asks for confirmation, Sam simply&nbsp;
says he doesn't sleep with his students.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.120
Once again, Sam's beating proves that&nbsp;
Sandra can do whatever she wants with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.800
She can even have Sam killed if she wants to,&nbsp;
but of course, she'd rather see her daughter's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.200
violator suffer first. And while Sam’s punishment&nbsp;
is already preceding the verdict, Bowden isn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.400
averse to playing dirty himself, which is&nbsp;
clear when he mentioned Kelly’s breakdown.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.320
One day, Ray and Gloria visit Suzie and her&nbsp;
grandmother, Ruby, since Suzie called them. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.320
finding out that Sam isn’t arrested yet, Suzie&nbsp;
admits that Sam forced himself on her about a year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.960
ago in her trailer. As the detectives question&nbsp;
her, Suzie starts getting upset and aggressive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.480
but she still manages to tell them that once&nbsp;
Sam stopped, he said that no little girl could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.960
make him finish. With her statement matching&nbsp;
Kelly’s, Sam is immediately arrested. Though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.200
Sam vehemently insists that he’s innocent, Bowden&nbsp;
only tells him that he’s preaching to the choir.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.280
Things are definitely looking bleak for Sam. With&nbsp;
another victim coming forward and unknowingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.800
corroborating Kelly’s story by repeating what&nbsp;
she said, there’s little room for doubt with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.640
his crime. Though it’s easy to fault Suzie for&nbsp;
not coming forward earlier, these things are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.960
difficult to report. It’s just easier for people&nbsp;
like Kelly, who’s already rich and powerful.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.120
Before the trial, Sandra and Baxter tell the&nbsp;
press that they're confident Sam will get what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.600
he deserves. However, Suzie breaks under Bowden's&nbsp;
questioning and admits to court that Sam didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.520
really defile her. She says she was just pissed&nbsp;
at him for not bailing her out of jail when she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.200
was arrested for narcotics possession,&nbsp;
leaving everyone in court in disbelief.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.120
As she continues to confess, Suzie also tells&nbsp;
the court that Sam didn't sleep with Kelly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.280
either. Kelly’s just in love with him and wants&nbsp;
to get back at him for sleeping with Sandra.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.480
Humiliated and enraged, Kelly gets&nbsp;
up and throws a glass at Suzie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.400
but she’s immediately taken away before she could&nbsp;
cause more damage. After the fiasco at court,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.440
Bowden celebrates as he plans to&nbsp;
file a lawsuit against Sandra.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.960
A case of jealousy and betrayal, Suzie and&nbsp;
Kelly are desperate girls who are willing to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.960
ruin a man's life just to avenge their wounded&nbsp;
egos. The girls are lucky the judge doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.120
punish them for committing perjury, but Bowden&nbsp;
isn't the type to let that kind of scheme slide.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.640
It is only fair that Sam demands compensation&nbsp;
for what he went through because after all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.320
the money he'll get won't even be enough to pay&nbsp;
for the damages the girls have done to his life.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.240
After Bowden set up a meeting with Baxter and&nbsp;
Sandra, Sam finally gets his settlement pay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.400
and Bowden tells him to enjoy the money. Later&nbsp;
that day, Sam goes back to school to retrieve his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.640
belongings. As he is about to leave, Sam bumps&nbsp;
into Kelly, who is infuriated that Sandra is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.720
using her trust fund to pay Sam. Kelly attacks&nbsp;
Sam in front of everyone, repeatedly hitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.720
him with a book while screaming about how much&nbsp;
she hates him. Once Kelly is taken away, Sam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.560
tells Artie that he couldn't come back to school&nbsp;
even though he wanted to. Kelly's outburst only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.080
proves how bitter she is, and she doesn't even&nbsp;
hesitate to make a scene in front of everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.000
It is a pity that Sam won't be able to go back to&nbsp;
his work. This only proves that he was right when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.520
he said that being accused of committing carnal&nbsp;
abuse isn't something that would just go away.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.000
That night, Sam goes to a hotel after losing&nbsp;
his house, where he finds Kelly waiting for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.080
It is then revealed that it's their plan to get&nbsp;
money from Sandra all along. When Suzie comes out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.520
too, she asks how much is $8.5 million divided&nbsp;
among them. After some celebrating, he reminds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.880
them that the three of them can't ever be seen in&nbsp;
one place before they start to make out and sleep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.360
together. This just proves that people aren't&nbsp;
always what they appear to be. Sam Lombardo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.000
a respected guidance counselor, turns out to be a&nbsp;
manipulative schemer. At this point, it shows that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.080
he's the mastermind of getting money from Sandra,&nbsp;
and Kelly and Suzie are clearly under his spell.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.240
At the station, Ray tells Gloria that he believes&nbsp;
Sam has hatched the elaborate plan of taking money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.720
from Sandra using Kelly and Suzie. He then starts&nbsp;
following Sam, determined to prove that his theory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.120
is correct. Ray has never liked Sam, but the&nbsp;
former guidance counselor has never hurt anyone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.520
so he can only despise him from a distance.&nbsp;
One day, Ray approaches Kelly as she finishes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.440
swimming to ask what she, Suzie, and Sam&nbsp;
plan to do with the money. Playing innocent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.920
Kelly pretends to be clueless, but Ray doesn’t buy&nbsp;
it. He says the truth will eventually come out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.400
and it's Suzie who will eventually ruin them. Ray&nbsp;
visits Suzie next and apologizes for what happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.200
to her friend, Davy. He then gives Suzie a piece&nbsp;
of paper that shows Sam's recent bank activities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.480
revealing that he has just transferred the&nbsp;
settlement money to an offshore account. Ray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.560
also adds that Sam has just put a downpayment on&nbsp;
island property and a lease-to-buy on a sailboat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.480
When he points out that Suzie is into sailing,&nbsp;
Suzie plays dumb and asks why he's telling her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.720
all that. Angry, Ray snaps at her and asks if&nbsp;
she actually expects Kelly and Sam to share&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.640
the money with her. Wanting to be left alone,&nbsp;
Suzie tries to walk out, but Ray catches her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.560
by the arm and warns her to keep a close eye&nbsp;
on Kelly and Sam. A smart move on Ray's part,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.240
he tries to turn Kelly and Suzie against&nbsp;
each other. Seeing that Suzie is high-strung,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.400
Ray plays his card right by making Suzie doubt&nbsp;
her accomplices. And during their confrontation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.320
it is also revealed that Suzie's anger towards&nbsp;
Ray roots from something he did to her friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.200
Davy. While the two don't go into details about&nbsp;
it, it is clear that Suzie is deeply hurt by it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.280
Upset, Suzie calls Sam once Ray is gone but&nbsp;
fails to reach him. She then goes to Kelly's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.800
house to tell her what happened, clueless that&nbsp;
Ray is following her. Kelly gets mad that Suzie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.880
contacted Sam, and as they talk, she receives&nbsp;
a call from the former guidance counselor.&nbsp;

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.960
Sam asks Kelly if Suzie is with her, and when&nbsp;
Kelly confirms it, Sam instructs her to calm her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.880
friend down. He then says he'll handle everything&nbsp;
before asking Kelly to get Suzie so they can both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.600
listen to what he has to say. Meanwhile, Ray stays&nbsp;
hidden as he records a video of Kelly and Suzie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.120
Sam tells them to watch out for Ray before&nbsp;
reminding Suzie not to fall apart. When the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:04.160
call ends, Suzie accuses Kelly of double-crossing&nbsp;
her, but Kelly denies it then insults her. Even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.800
more upset, Suzie slaps Kelly for trying to&nbsp;
touch her. Taken aback, Kelly slaps Suzie, too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.880
before grabbing her by the hair and dragging her&nbsp;
to the pool. There, Kelly tries to drown Suzie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.280
but Suzie manages to break free from her. As&nbsp;
she swims towards the stairs, Kelly grabs her by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.760
the leg and realizes that Suzie really is scared.&nbsp;
Eventually calming down, the girls start kissing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.840
and as they make out, Ray continues to record&nbsp;
them. In spite of the scheming they took part in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.760
Kelly and Suzie are just volatile young girls.&nbsp;
Sam must have realized this, and this makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.760
them easy pickings for exploitation. On one&nbsp;
hand, you have Kelly, who’s still hung up on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.120
her father’s death while not receiving enough&nbsp;
attention from her mother. Then there’s Suzie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.200
who’s clearly a troubled girl with her own string&nbsp;
of problems, financial and otherwise. Being the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.640
guidance counsellor, you’d think that Sam would&nbsp;
do his job and actually give them guidance and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.720
counsel, but instead, he fools around with&nbsp;
both their bodies and Kelly’s trust fund.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.120
The next day, Ray shows the&nbsp;
footage to his colleagues,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.880
but Bryce isn't happy that Ray went to the&nbsp;
Van Ryans' property without authorization.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.640
And unfortunately, the audio from the recording&nbsp;
is unintelligible, so they can’t hear the girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.040
talking about Sam. Though Bryce warns about Sandra&nbsp;
suing for invasion of privacy, Ray is unmoved and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.880
reveals that he brought Sam in for questioning.&nbsp;
Sam is furious, and he threatens to sue them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.120
next time Ray drags him to the station. When he’s&nbsp;
free to go, Sam insults Ray then takes his leave.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.200
After some time, Kelly takes a drunken&nbsp;
Suzie by the beach, where Sam is waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.880
for them. He tells Suzie that he wants them to&nbsp;
celebrate one last time before they split up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.120
and she agrees. However, when Sam orders&nbsp;
Kelly to get a blanket from her mom's car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.560
he repeatedly attacks Suzie with&nbsp;
a bottle of champagne. After that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.720
Sam and Kelly wrap Suzie's body in plastic before&nbsp;
loading her to the back of the Range Rover.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.480
Sam then casually wipes the blood off his face&nbsp;
before going to the swamp to dispose of Suzie's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.640
body. Kelly is visibly shaken after hearing&nbsp;
Suzie's screams, but it is unclear if she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.080
aware of Sam's plan to kill the girl right&nbsp;
from the beginning. Maybe she thought they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.160
were really just going to celebrate by the beach,&nbsp;
or maybe, she deliberately lured Suzie there so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.120
Sam could take her out of the equation. After all,&nbsp;
Suzie's death means more money for Kelly and Sam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.240
And since Suzie’s the weakest link, having&nbsp;
her gone would make them feel safer.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.880
Ray and Gloria then investigate Suzie’s&nbsp;
disappearance. Ray asserts that Kelly and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.440
Sam are responsible for it then asks Gloria to&nbsp;
check on Suzie's car for him. Meanwhile, Ray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.440
goes to the beach with Jimmy, where the boy shows&nbsp;
him the spot where he and Suzie used to hang out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.000
As he investigates the place, Ray finds traces&nbsp;
of blood on an old boat and teeth in the dirt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.760
Ray then calls his colleagues and the forensic&nbsp;
team to show them where Suzie was killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.920
Since there's no body, Ray believes that Sam has&nbsp;
dumped Suzie in the swamp. After learning that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.840
Suzie's car has been found at the bus terminal,&nbsp;
Ray insists that Sam is behind everything and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.640
Kelly will be next. However, Bryce tells Ray to&nbsp;
get off the case and warns him not to go near Sam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.040
But as soon as he's out of earshot, Ray asks&nbsp;
Gloria to keep an eye on Sam, and in exchange,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.960
he will drop the investigation if the teeth&nbsp;
are not Suzie’s. Although Ray won't show it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.480
he must be thrilled that he'll finally be able&nbsp;
to nail Sam. Suzie doesn't mean a thing to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.320
anyway, and her disappearance just gives Ray a&nbsp;
chance to go after the former guidance counselor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.240
Ray is so confident that Sam is the culprit&nbsp;
that he isn't even looking for other suspects.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.920
However, Gloria doesn't feel the same way&nbsp;
and thinks her partner is mistaken about Sam.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.800
Gloria does as she's told and watches Sam, while&nbsp;
on the other hand, Sam receives a call from Kelly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.160
The girl is panicking, but Sam assures her that&nbsp;
they’ll be fine as long as they stick to their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.960
plan. He then reminds Kelly to stay at the guest&nbsp;
house, before going outside to talk to Gloria.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.880
After informing him that Suzie’s missing,&nbsp;
she asks him where he was the previous night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.200
Ray smoothly evades the question then invites&nbsp;
Gloria to his room. There, he gives her Kelly’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.520
file which shows her history of violence. Kelly&nbsp;
has once threatened the lives of Sandra and Suzie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.760
and as Sam tells Gloria more about Kelly's anger&nbsp;
issues, he implies that Kelly might be responsible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.080
for Suzie's disappearance. Trying to seduce&nbsp;
Gloria, Sam claims that he didn't tell them about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.080
it during the trial because he had principles&nbsp;
back then, but not anymore. He then tells Gloria&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.160
to leave, and Gloria calls Ray to tell him&nbsp;
she's going home and that Sam is gone. Pissed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.920
Ray informs her that the blood found on the scene&nbsp;
matches Suzie's. To this, Gloria just tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.400
that if Suzie really is dead, then Bryce might&nbsp;
be on the right track about Kelly. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.080
the keen eye and sharp wit that Gloria had when&nbsp;
calling crap on Kelly’s victim statement is now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.560
nowhere to be found. Perhaps Suzie had it with&nbsp;
her when she was killed. To be more accurate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.800
though, Gloria just finds him hot. With how&nbsp;
Sandra and Sam have been finessing everyone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.640
it just goes to show that the strongest forces&nbsp;
in the world are big dollar bills and attractive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.040
scheming men. But the third strongest force&nbsp;
happens to be the ego of a detective with a hunch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.520
so it’s anyone’s guess as to&nbsp;
what will win out in the end.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.680
Worried about Kelly, Ray goes to the Van Ryans'&nbsp;
residence to look for her. When Ray enters the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.600
house, he is greeted by an agitated Kelly,&nbsp;
who wants to know why he's there. The two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.920
then engage in a struggle, and after three shots&nbsp;
are fired, Ray comes out of the house, injured.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.560
Seeing the officer on the ground, Sandra rushes&nbsp;
inside and screams upon finding Kelly's body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.840
At the station, Ray recounts how Kelly&nbsp;
attacked and shot him in the shoulder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.120
and he claims that he had no choice&nbsp;
but to return fire. Because of this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.880
Ray is eventually fired from the force for&nbsp;
insubordination. After finding Suzie's blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.560
in Sandra's Range Rover, the police department&nbsp;
concludes that Suzie was murdered by Kelly.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.040
After Suzie's disappearance and Kelly's death,&nbsp;
it is later revealed that Sam and Ray have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:45.680
working together all along. Although Sam is upset&nbsp;
that Ray killed Kelly, he agrees with his partner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.520
when he says that they don’t have any more loose&nbsp;
ends. Since the bank will take two more days to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.840
complete the money transfer, Ray decides to stay.&nbsp;
When you open up a Russian matryoshka doll, you’ll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.600
find a smaller doll inside it, and when you open&nbsp;
that smaller doll, you’ll just find another one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.480
inside it, too. That’s what the tale of Ray and&nbsp;
Sam is. Just when the story thread is unknotted,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.120
a new twist shows up. Later on, the two are&nbsp;
sailing when Sam suddenly attacks Ray. As Ray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.360
leans over the railing, Sam suddenly steers the&nbsp;
wheel, causing Ray to fall overboard. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.040
Ray manages to hold on to the boat, and he&nbsp;
attacks Sam, who pretends to be clueless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.520
As the men fight each other, Suzie suddenly&nbsp;
appears. She’s actually alive, and she’s sporting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.720
a new hairdo. With a speargun, the girl quickly&nbsp;
shoots Ray in the leg. Ray asks for Sam's help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.440
but Sam ignores him, saying he shouldn't have&nbsp;
killed Kelly and Suzie's friend, Davy. Suzie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.320
then shoots him again, and Ray goes overboard once&nbsp;
more. Suzie and Sam then watch Ray as he bleeds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.880
struggling to stay afloat. At this point, it would&nbsp;
just be easier to assume that the entire town is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.120
in on Sam’s scheme. The man is a masterclass in&nbsp;
deception, and Suzie is unbelievable herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.280
After all, the girl had her death faked&nbsp;
just to have a bigger share in the millions.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.920
Sometime later on, Gloria visits Ruby to talk&nbsp;
about Ray. Ruby informs her that Ray used to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.280
have a relationship with one of the girls over&nbsp;
at the glades, and Davy had a crush on her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:01.200
One time, Davy caught Ray beating the girl, so Ray&nbsp;
killed him. Suzie, however, witnessed everything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.120
so Ray busted Suzie and sent her to jail&nbsp;
for six months just to prove that he could.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.440
She then reveals to Gloria that Ray got Sandra's&nbsp;
mom pregnant with Suzie, making Sandra and Suzie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.680
half-sisters. When Sandra's mom died, Ruby&nbsp;
took in Suzie and raised her like her own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.480
granddaughter. Before Gloria leaves, she sees&nbsp;
Ruby's son, Walter, tending to Suzie's boat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:23.200
Gloria is surprised that Suzie can sail, and&nbsp;
Walter tells her that Suzie's IQ is above 200.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.360
Another unexpected revelation is that Suzie&nbsp;
is actually Kelly's half-aunt. Gloria, who's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.520
been partners with Ray for quite some time now,&nbsp;
clearly doesn't know that he's a dirty detective.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.600
He's been abusing his power ever since, and&nbsp;
he's had no problems covering up his deeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.120
Meanwhile, Suzie, who's been portrayed&nbsp;
as a teen with no future at all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.320
is actually a genius. Unfortunately, she's forced&nbsp;
to use her wits to do bad things just to survive.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.480
Back at the boat, Suzie poisons Sam and knocks&nbsp;
him overboard. It is then revealed that Suzie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.240
is the one who hatched the plan of getting&nbsp;
money from Sandra. Initially, she blackmailed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.240
Sam by showing him his pictures with Kelly in&nbsp;
bed. She's also the one who instructed Sam to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.000
befriend Ray and involve him in her scheme, and&nbsp;
later on, she forced Sam to pull out two of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.640
teeth. However, Sam couldn't do it, so she did&nbsp;
it herself. It is also revealed that Ray killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.480
Kelly and planted the gun in her hand before&nbsp;
shooting himself to make it look like a struggle.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.000
After some time, Bowden meets with Suzie and&nbsp;
gives her the money they got from Sandra.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.520
He informs her that he's already set aside&nbsp;
the money for Ruby and Walter, and of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.360
his fee. As Suzie walks away with the&nbsp;
cash, Bowden reminds her to be good.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.360
Suzie must've waited long to get her scheme&nbsp;
into motion because what she did required&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.280
insane patience and elaborate planning. To&nbsp;
say that Suzie is smart is an understatement,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.240
for she has successfully eliminated&nbsp;
everyone in her path to get the money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.840
She is also cunning enough to cover her tracks,&nbsp;
making sure that nothing goes back to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.520
For the final twist in this story, Bowden's&nbsp;
involvement in Suzie's plans shows that one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.080
can easily get what they want, if&nbsp;
they just know which side to take.
