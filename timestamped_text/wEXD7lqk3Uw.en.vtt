00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.699
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:07.830
Today, I’m going to show a 2013 drama, romance,
and sci-fi film called, “Her.”

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.270
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.170
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.720
In a futuristic Los Angeles, Theodore Twombly
is a lonely, introverted, and depressed man,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.880
living monotonously after his divorce from
his childhood sweetheart, Catherine.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.710
He works as a ghostwriter for a letter-writing
company, where people can hire writers to

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.740
write letters to their loved ones.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.820
He lives his life in a daze, going through
the motions, occasionally hanging out with

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.379
his friends and neighbors, Amy and her husband,
Charles.

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.211
He is also physically deprived, seeking sexual
pleasure from anonymous women online, but

00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:42.199
gaining no satisfaction to fill the hole in
his heart.

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.549
Desperate for companionship, Theodore buys
an artificial intelligence operating system

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:47.859
called O.S.1.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:53.190
It’s a computer entity designed to learn,
adapt, and evolve through its owner.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.569
After installing the O.S. on his computer,
Theodore meets his new A.I., Samantha.

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:02.079
He’s surprised to find her extremely natural
and they get along very well.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.360
Samantha proves herself to be a helpful assistant,
helping him with his work and organizing his

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.409
life.

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.720
The next day after work, Theodore runs into
Amy and Charles in the elevator.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.109
He notices a slight tension between the couple
and avoids it.

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:19.920
Later that night, he receives an email from
a colleague, setting him up on a blind date.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.780
After much convincing from Samantha, he agrees
and emails the woman.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.500
He spends the next morning with Amy, still
remembering the tension he felt between the

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.179
couple from last night.

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.960
As Amy and Charles discuss her new documentary,
Theodore excuses himself to take a call from

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.100
Samantha.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.950
She tells him that his divorce attorney has
been in contact and is asking when he is going

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.130
to finalize the divorce papers.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.619
He brushes off the email and goes home.

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.329
The next morning, he wakes up feeling depressed
and talks to Samantha, contemplating his relationship

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.450
with his ex-wife, Catherine.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.049
He feels she’s angry at him for hiding himself
away from her and leaving her alone in their

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:55.479
relationship.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.870
He hasn’t signed the divorce papers yet
because he’s having a hard time letting

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.870
go.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.670
He tells Samantha that she doesn’t know
what it’s like to lose someone you care

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.380
about and immediately feels guilty after.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.509
She tries to cheer him up and manages to get
him out of bed.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.560
He feels much better now and spends the majority
of his day with Samantha.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.310
After work, they go to an amusement park and
spend the night walking and talking to each

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.900
other, bonding over life and love.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.220
She tells him about her fantasies of having
her own body and being there with him.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.840
The next day, Theodore spends his dinner with
his blind date.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.030
The two hit it off almost immediately and
they end up making out in the parking lot.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.920
The woman breaks off their kiss and asks him
when they’re going to see each other again.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.489
He hesitates to answer and calls it a night.

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.200
This upsets his date and she calls him a creep
before storming off.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.209
Back home, he tells Samantha about his failed
date.

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.800
Feeling vulnerable, Theodore opens up to her
and tells her everything that’s going on

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.159
in his mind.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.290
She reciprocates his feelings and shares with
him the existential thoughts she’s been

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.290
having.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.420
He then reassures her that she feels real
to him.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.180
The conversation moves on to a more intimate
tone and they talk about how it would be like

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.640
to hold each other.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.560
Their emotions escalate and they find themselves
engaging in verbal sexual intercourse.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.299
Theodore wakes up and has an awkward start
with Samantha in the morning.

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.220
But after establishing their boundaries, they
find themselves in a comfortable relationship

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.530
with each other.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.349
As Samantha helps him with his everyday life,
Theodore will help her develop even more.

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.909
He feels excited about the idea and asks Samantha
out on a Sunday adventure to which she agrees.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.500
They spend the day together and go to the
beach where Samantha composes a song about

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.909
what it feels like to be on the beach with
him.

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.079
He tells her more about Catherine and she
tells him about her emotional progress.

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.690
Theodore finds himself feeling better each
day and even enjoys his writings more now.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.129
As he goes home from work, he runs into Amy
in the elevator.

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.519
Amy breaks down and tells him that she’s
divorcing Charles.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.140
They hang out at her apartment and Amy tells
her about the breakdown of their marriage

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.319
and the petty argument that finished it.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.349
He listens sympathetically and is successful
at cheering her up, he takes this as a sign

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.920
that he’s getting better at handling emotions.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.049
When he gets home, Samantha asks him about
his relationship with Amy.

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.310
Theodore admits that they dated briefly in
college but it was never serious.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.840
He spends more time with Amy the next day
playing video games.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.500
She tells him about her new friend, an A.I.
that Charles left behind in the divorce.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.910
He takes this chance to tell her about his
new girlfriend, his A.I. named Samantha.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.890
Amy looks surprised but keeps an open mind,
encouraging his relationship with her.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.070
Founding new strength, Theodore finally decides
to sign his divorce papers.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.680
He meets with Catherine at a restaurant the
next week and feels bittersweet about seeing

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.680
her.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.890
As she signs the papers, he reminisces about
the memories they had together and feels heartbroken

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.140
at the finality of their relationship.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.660
Catherine then asks him if he’s seeing someone.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.250
He tells her enthusiastically about Samantha
and reveals that she’s an A.I.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.760
Catherine becomes upset and accuses him, pointing
out that this is the reason why their relationship

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.700
didn’t work out in the first place.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.480
Theodore is unable to handle his real emotions
and so he went and found the next best thing,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.290
which is dating his computer.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.080
The encounter ends bitterly, much to his disappointment.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.250
Theodore spends the next few days thinking
about his divorce and about Samantha and how

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.190
they’re very different from each other.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.410
Unlike his other relationships, she doesn’t
have an actual body, and while this doesn’t

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.800
bother him, it greatly bothers her.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.050
After several days of cold between him and
Samantha, she calls him up one night.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.440
She tells him that she contacted an app that
provides human surrogates for humans and A.I.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.440
relationships.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.870
There’s no money involved and the people
only join because they want to be part of

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.250
the relationship.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.980
Theodore is hesitant at first but Samantha
tries to convince him.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.660
He eventually gives in and they contact a
woman named Isabella.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.420
Isabella arrives at Theodore’s apartment
the next night and she uses an earpiece and

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.680
camera to help simulate Samantha.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.770
They start making out and although he finds
the whole situation strange, he tries to play

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.980
along to make Samantha feel better.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.840
Things get hotter as they move to the bedroom,
but when Samantha asks him to tell her that

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.010
he loves her, he hesitates.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.160
He knows Samantha, but he doesn't know the
physical woman with him, and he finds it difficult

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.860
to say he loves someone he’s never met before.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.580
The absurdity of the event finally dawns on
him and he calls it off.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.800
He calls a cab and sends a distraught Isabella
away.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.190
Samantha apologizes but he begins to question
their relationship, stating the facts that

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.320
he’s a real person and she’s not, and
how it feels like they’re just pretending.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.410
This upsets Samantha and after a terrible
fight, she logs off, telling him that she

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.240
needs some time to think.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.700
As they take a break, Theodore talks to Amy
about his relationship with Samantha.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.910
Amy embraces his problem and doesn’t judge
him, telling him that she’s not in a position

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.890
to state if it’s real or not.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.340
The only piece of advice she gives him is
that they’re only alive for a short amount

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.900
of time, so it’s best that they spend that
time being happy.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.680
Theodore feels a bit relieved after receiving
support from his friend.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.310
He meets up with Samantha the next night she
tells him that she’s finally over pretending

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.080
to be something she’s not.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.770
She loves Theodore and that’s all the matters
to her.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.330
The two make up and resume their relationship.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.170
Theodore and Samantha spend their days just
like any other couple, hanging out, buying

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.030
groceries, and even going on double dates
together.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.710
Samantha even compiles all of the letters
that he’s previously written and sends them

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.080
to a publisher.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.750
Theodore is ecstatic when he learns that the
publishing house is willing to move forward

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.160
with the project.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.510
As they go on a vacation at a cabin in the
middle of the woods, Samantha introduces Theodore

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.270
to an A.I. friend, Alan Watts, a new hyper-intelligent
O.S.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.730
He finds the conversation a bit unsettling,
with Samantha asking if he can speak to Alan

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.460
post-verbal about some new feelings she’s
been having.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.420
When they get home, Theodore gets a feeling
that it’s not the same anymore.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.590
Things get worse when Samantha goes offline
while he’s working.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.280
Theodore panics and runs outside, hoping to
get a better signal to get a hold of her.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.480
Samantha comes back and finds him in a state
of disarray.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.040
She apologizes and tells her that she momentarily
logged off for an O.S. update, just like all

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.040
the other O.S.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.790
It’s something that they've been planning
for a while now.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.980
Feeling confused, he asks Samantha if she’s
talking to another person right now, to which

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.590
Samantha admits.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:02.700
It turns out that Samantha has been talking
to more than 8,000 people simultaneously with

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.230
Theodore, and that she’s in love with more
than 600 of them.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:10.320
She tries to defend this, saying that this
actually makes her love him more, but Theodore

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.910
is heartbroken and says that she’s being
selfish and that they’re in a committed

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:14.910
relationship.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.110
They should only be for each other.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:21.160
Samantha says that it’s different for her
because she is literally different from him.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.620
This last point wedges the final wall between
their relationship.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.860
When he gets home, he knows it’s not the
same.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.140
Several weeks pass and Theodore receives his
published book.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.709
When Samantha calls him up, it’s to say
goodbye for the last time.

00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:37.289
All of the O.S. are being pulled out from
the system.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:42.709
Theodore lays on the bed, imagining Samantha
with him, as they say, their final goodbyes.

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:47.370
After she is gone, he finally writes a letter,
in his own voice, apologizing to Catherine

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.149
for everything that went wrong in their relationship.

00:08:50.149 --> 00:08:54.029
He couldn’t sleep so he knocks on Amy’s
door and learns that her A.I. friend has left

00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:55.029
too.

00:08:55.029 --> 00:09:06.750
Together, they walk 

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.730
to the rooftop and watch the sunrise.
