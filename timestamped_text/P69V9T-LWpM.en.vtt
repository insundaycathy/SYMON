00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.060
Welcome Back to Movies Recapped,
Today I am going to explain The American Science

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.320
fiction Thriller film, Automata.
So the film is based on the future.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.960
When an explosion occurs close to The sun,
solar storms happen.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.580
They are also having a negative impact on
the environment.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.780
They emit dangerous rays that move towards
the Earth.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.841
The world destroys.
Nothing was left there.

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:26.610
There are no animals, plants, or humans.
99 percent of humans were killed.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.320
Only 1 percent of humans were left there.
Luckily, they were good and qualified humans.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.510
They want to recover the world.
They start planning for this.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.429
They think that humans are less and humans
can't do this.

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:43.219
To recover the world again.
So they think to make robots.

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.859
This plan proves good.
In a few times, many robots were ready.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.550
They have super abilities but two things were
observed while making them.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.850
The first is that they will not harm any human.
Because humans were in the phase to bear more

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.829
loss.
Because they were wise like humans.

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.649
The second rule was not to make any other
robot themselves.

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:08.020
If this will happen so the robots will replace
humans.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.620
These robots become developed.
They were making tall buildings which is beneficial

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.040
for humans.
They were also doing the basic tasks of the

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.210
humans.
It means these robots, humans were happy.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.290
That their robots are doing good works.
But after some years a fault appears in these

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.710
robots.
And they stop working.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.600
At a time, when it wasn't raining there so
they make it rain with the help of these robots.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.170
But now there is nothing like this.
Humans were also worried because there were

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.420
many incomplete tasks.
They come out of that place.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.200
They make a place of their own and start living
there.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.780
They were thinking that there is a fault in
robots.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.030
So they are not comfortable with us.
It maybe creates a problem further.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.000
So they start destroying those robots.
Now the scene changes and we see a police

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.100
officer.
He is going somewhere.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.700
He hears some strange voice.
When he goes there and sees there was a robot

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.360
sitting in the dark.
A yellow robot.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.140
It is trying to recover itself.
It was looking innocent and it requests to

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.920
the police officer don't kill me.
Let me recover myself.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.509
But the police officer ignores it and shoots
it.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.090
Don't know why this scene is emotional.
Then we see a man whose dog was dead, he also

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.019
had a robot among them.
He calls the robot company to take their robot

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.810
back.
It has killed my dog.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.719
He also asks them for money, the insurance
money.

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.829
They ask what kind of insurance?
Give me my money.

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.170
A man Jacq goes there.
He says to the man don't worry we will test

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.109
the robot before.
He lifts a knife and starts throwing it in

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.719
his hand but before it, that robot holds the
knife.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.760
Jack says that our robot is fine and it couldn't
harm anyone.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.909
We will not give you money.
Stop blaming our robots.

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:49.810
Saying this, he leaves.
Going home, he meets his wife.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.920
They were expecting a baby.
The next morning, Jacq receives a message.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.069
That we have received a destroyed robot and
they call him there instantly.

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.370
When Jacq goes there he sees that it was that
yellow robot.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.950
That was shot by a police officer.
A girl there tells him that the parts of this

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.739
robot were replaced.
That's why this robot was trying to repair

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.819
itself.
But it was shot.

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.999
Jacq feels this thing bad.
He tells his friend, his friend says that

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:19.459
why are you interfering in the police's task.
Jacq says that I am shocked that why they

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.290
destroyed the robot?
Jacq's friend says that this is not your task.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.029
Focus on your life that what you have to do,
Jacq says that I am irritated with this city.

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:32.689
Transfer me to the other side of the sea.
It is also revealed to us that Jacq has some

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:36.439
memories with Sea.
And further, we will know about it.

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.540
After it, Jacq goes to a construction site.
It was in an advanced city.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.779
He asks the worker there that why are you
destroying robots?

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:51.689
The workers tell him that these robots are
useless now.

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.719
There are faults in them.
We throw them to the other side of the city

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.980
at a dirty place.
The people of that place take them.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.150
With it, we are also ordered to shoot at first
sight any human.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.959
Maybe they will make their separate robots.
And they are separate from our world.

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:15.919
When Jacq sees that the people here are shooting
others he feels bad.

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.799
Jacq goes to the other side and he sees many
robots.

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.940
It seems like those robots are scared.
Jacq tries to go near one of the robots to

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.990
talk to it.
But before it, that robot sets itself on fire,

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.780
Jacq becomes depressed.
He returns to the company.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.759
He comes to know a nuclear battery is found
from a robot.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.180
Its benefit was that the robots can work without
charging for hours.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:46.120
It wasn't an ordinary battery.
Jacq's friend who was the leader, orders all

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.500
to find out about the battery.
He asks Jacq you want to transfer to the other

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.880
place.
It means the shore of the sea.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.110
So in return, you have to do this nicely.
Find out that from where did this nuclear

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.670
battery come in this robot or the others?
Who inserted it? now they all were doing this

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.370
work.
To find out, but Jacq wasn't understanding

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.699
anything.
He again goes to that worker.

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.900
He says that it is not done by a human.
Maybe a robot has changed the setting of this

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.250
robot.
Because it is not allow to any robot to destroy

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.630
itself.
And you are telling me that the robot has

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:25.539
set itself on fire.
This thing is very strange.

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.759
Jacq returns home.
He tells his wife that maybe we will be transferred

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.990
from there.
Maybe we will leave this city and go far from

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.590
here.
His wife says that how is this possible? I

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.220
am conceiving.
At this time how can we go to another place?

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.289
He tries to make his wife understand that
I don't want to live in this city.

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.860
Fake people live here.
They don't care about anyone's feelings.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:55.100
His wife says that doesn't irritate me.
Jacq leaves from there but he is still thinking.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.419
That why the yellow robot was shot?
What was it trying to do secretly there?

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.419
Why did it want to repair itself?
Jacq goes to the place where that yellow robot

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.849
was shot.
He goes there and checks.

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:09.979
He finds that nuclear battery there.
That was hidden by that robot there.

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:15.380
Jacq wasn't understanding that where these
nuclear batteries came from?

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.319
He tells this to the police officer who shot
that robot.

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:22.740
And shows him the battery, he says that let
me take you to a woman.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.770
Maybe she knows it.
When they go there, they see a female robot

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.110
there.
It was looking beautiful and clever.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.909
The surprising thing is that the settings
were changed in it.

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:34.430
And those two rules were removed.
It means the rule not to harm humans and not

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.610
to make other robots.
It means that female robot is dangerous for

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:45.760
them.
Jacq asks the owner of the robot who is its

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.990
creator?
It says that I don't know.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.440
Hearing it, the police officer comes in anger.
The police officer shoots the robot's leg

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.340
and moves from there.
He tells Jacq that I have done this because

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.169
now this robot is injured.
Now its owner will take it to its creator

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.850
to repair it.
We will follow it.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.060
Jacq says that yes, I believe that the creator
of this robot will buy this battery and will

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.289
tell us.
That from where did it come?

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:11.669
The police officer says that you have to give
me the profit.

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:18.770
We will divide it then they start following
it.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.790
Its car stops in front of a factory.
They go inside but the lady standing inside

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.710
points a gun at them.
But Jacq shows her the nuclear battery.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.030
The lady asks them that from where did you
get this battery?

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.949
Jacq says leave it, tell me are you the person
who can get this blue robot?

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:36.520
That lady says yes, there is a purpose behind
it.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.650
As we, humans made this thing in the start
it was not good at the start.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.070
But we keep making it, it is made good.
We have made these robots.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:48.039
Don't you think that if we allow them to make
robots like them?

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:52.120
They will make better robots.
There is no other purpose behind it.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.729
That lady talks to Jacq nicely.
Jacq leaves from there but before leaving

00:07:55.729 --> 00:07:58.740
he told that lady that where she will get
that robot.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:07.509
The robot had that nuclear battery.
He comes from there and he tells his friend

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:11.050
Robert everythinng.
As word spread, Jacq was tasked with resolving

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.430
the situation as quickly as possible.
Jacq again goes to that lady.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.849
That lady tells him that I go there at your
given address.

00:08:18.849 --> 00:08:21.879
I have installed that robot's system in this
blue robot.

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:24.199
It becomes clever.
It heals itself.

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:30.000
So I was right that robots can make other
robots.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.060
They were talking meanwhile, the door knocks.
As that lady opens the door the kids were

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.910
outside.
They shoot her.

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:43.820
Jacq escapes from there and comes out.
He was sitting in a car with that blue robot.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.190
Some evil people start chasing them.
But Jacq kills them.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:54.541
Because their car collapses.
Here, Jacq gets faint the next morning, when

00:08:54.541 --> 00:08:59.440
he wakes up he sees that he is injured.
Before he wakes up, that blue robot was repairing

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.110
itself.
Seeing it, Jacq becomes astonished because

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.740
it has many abilities.
With it, he again sleeps.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.490
After some time, he feels that someone is
dragging him.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.610
That blue robot and three more robots were
taking him somewhere.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:18.230
They were in a desert.
Jacq says to those robots that they have to

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.950
move towards the city.
But those robots ignore him.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.510
Jacq moves forward but they were also following
him.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:29.730
Now because Jacq was injured so he falls down.
The blue robot makes him eats some insects.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.779
And makes him drink water.
Because the robots want to save humans.

00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:36.320
It was their rule.
Not to harm humans.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.900
After it, they move forward but Jacq wants
to return.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.190
He doesn't trust these robots.
He says to those robots that I want water.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:50.560
He grabs something from his backpack when
the robots are at a safe distance.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.120
He sends a sign to his boss that I am here.
His boss comes to know his location.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.410
Jacq's friemd says to the police officer to
go to that location and rescue Jacq.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.100
The police officer arrived there.
Jacq knows it and he says to the robots that

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.420
I want t go to the washroom.
Stop here, and he makes this excuse and moves

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.090
forward.
He gives the sign with a flaregun.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:14.050
But those robots also see that sign.
They come to know that Jacq wants to escape

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.920
from here.
When he again comes back to tell them to stop

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.920
here I will come.
Those robots ignore him because they knew.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.630
Jacq in anger drops their batteries.
Meanwhile, the police officer also comes there.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.870
Coming there, he points a gun at Jacq.
In fact, he comes there to take those nuclear

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:37.170
batteries.
He takes those batteries and after it, he

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.190
starts shooting the robots.
But before it, Jacq shoots at him with the

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.720
flaregun.
Due to it, that police officer dies.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.100
The man with him gets scared and runs from
there.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.740
Then Jacq sees that the robots are repairing
themselves.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.959
While taking out some tools of the other robots.
Then at night, they move into a cave and the

00:10:55.959 --> 00:10:59.930
robots were eating some insects.
Jacq asks them will you help me to go to the

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.740
city?
I promise to reach the city I will return

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.519
your batteries.
The female robot says Yes, why not.

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:12.040
In the morning, we will search for a car and
move towards the city.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.010
The next day, we see the companion of the
police officer who ran from there.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.630
He goes to the company and gives them all
the batteries.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.490
Tells them that what had happened.
Meanwhile, Jacq's friend also comes there

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.199
and they start talking about the previous
robot.

00:11:25.199 --> 00:11:29.610
That we have installed those functions in
the other robots while seeing its system.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:34.010
That they will not harm humans and will not
make other robot.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.300
It was helpful.
They were also surprised that till today.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.480
Humans weren't able to remove those rules
from the robot system.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.750
Then they talk about those robots who don't
have these rules.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.839
They were worried about them.
That maybe they can harm them.

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:50.940
They plan to search for those robots.
They order Jacq's friend to bring those robots

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:58.910
here.
On another side, we see that Jacq's daughter

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.519
comes to this world.
Jacq's wife was worried about his husband

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:05.760
because he wasn't there.
She comes to know that the police are searching

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:12.310
for Jacq and these robots.
On another side, we see Jacq when he wakes

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.279
up the other robots were not there.
The only blue robot was there.

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:19.149
It tells Jacq that other robots are going
to search the way.

00:12:19.149 --> 00:12:23.190
It asks Jacq that I felt like we are only
born but when I saw that you kill that police

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:26.590
officer.
After it, I want to ask you that will we also

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.589
be dead?
Jacq says that how would you know, here Jacq

00:12:30.589 --> 00:12:38.480
misses his wife.
He knows that his baby also arrives.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.240
Now they move forward meanwhile, Jacq sees
someone.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.940
It was looking like a human.
But as Jacq takes off cloth from it, it was

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.970
a robot.
Its name was a Blue robot.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.699
It was the real blue robot.
The female robot only has blue hair that's

00:12:51.699 --> 00:12:57.009
why they were considering it the blue robot.
Jacq gets shocked after seeing this blue robot.

00:12:57.009 --> 00:13:00.850
He goes inside the factory, he sees many parts
of the robot there.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:07.709
As he comes out he sees that the other robots
were making a blue robot.

00:13:07.709 --> 00:13:10.339
On another side, Jacq's friends were searching
for him.

00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:15.430
So Jacq thinks I should leave from here.
He goes near a car but he sees that it has

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.259
no function.
It has no engine so he gets depressed.

00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:22.759
Seeing here and there he tells the other robots
that there was a stream.

00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:25.970
There was water and greenery.
But see what happened to it.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.320
The blue robot comes to him and says that
don't get depressed.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.580
It was the future of the world.
In the future, humans will live with machines.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.960
You have to accept us.
You have to agree that Robots are not less

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.850
than others.
We can make ourselves.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.240
That's why our quantity is more and see this
place is destroyed.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.399
We don't need water or greenery.
We can live here.

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:56.600
We will not irritate you, you can go.
Just return our nuclear batteries.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.400
Jacq returns their nuclear batteries.
Then we see that Jacq's friend arrives at

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.380
the place where was the dead body of that
police officer.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:07.000
Meanwhile, some people come there they were
holding Jacq's wife.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.509
Jacq's friend says that leave this girl but
they say.

00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:14.089
Why are you caring about her?
Her family is also killed.

00:14:14.089 --> 00:14:17.089
Jacq and her daughter are no more.
They were lying and Jacq's friend becomes

00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:20.640
aggressive after hearing it.
He was about to shoot that man.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.470
But that man escapes and shoots Jacq's friend
and kills him.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:29.940
This was an emotional scene.
The next morning, we see that Jacq wakes up.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:34.519
The robots with Jacq have made a new robot.
There was that nuclear battery in it.

00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:39.560
And that was an advanced robot.
With it, they prepare a new car for Jacq.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.310
Seeing it, Jacq becomes happy.
Before going from there, Jacq says to that

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:47.270
blue robot that I didn't understand you.
Forgive me for this.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.920
After it, he moves forward with the car.
Moving forward he sees that his friend was

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.940
fell there.
He was shot by those evil people.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.339
He goes near him but he was injured badly.
But still alive.

00:14:59.339 --> 00:15:05.519
He tells his friend Jacq that they have taken
his wife to save her.

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:08.930
On the other hand, the people were bringing
Jacq's wife outside..

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.589
They were taking her somewhere.
But the Blue robot comes and stops them.

00:15:12.589 --> 00:15:15.380
They tell Blue robot to just get out of their
way.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.400
That blue robot says that no I will not obey
you.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.680
Seeing it, those people get aggressive and
they start shooting it.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.430
They also take out its system.
Meanwhile, the female robot and Jacq also

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:30.600
arrive there.
He shoots at them.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:36.000
Only one man left there who was the leader
of those bad people.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.310
He was about to kill Jacq but that robot comes
and pushes that man.

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:43.390
Due to it, Jacq was saved and he instantly
goes to his wife.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:47.079
He lifts his daughter in his lap.
He was very happy because here he saw his

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:51.160
daughter for the first time.
Meanwhile, that female robot also comes there

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.860
and it seems that baby.
After it, it says thanks to Jacq and leaves

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.949
from there.
In the last scene, we see that Jacq is happy

00:15:57.949 --> 00:16:02.190
with his family.
Here he again sees his past flashbacks.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:05.790
Then we come to know that's why he has many
memories of the sea?

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.860
Because he spent his childhood here.
He wants to live here.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:13.949
He prays that soon the world recover.
With it, this movie ends.
