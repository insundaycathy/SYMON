00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.240
Welcome to Slash Forward. In this episode, we’re&nbsp;
going to get just a little bit closer to the end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.200
of the franchise storyline with Saw 6, working&nbsp;
our way through the traps as we go. If you’ve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.160
done the math, you’ll recognize hitting the like&nbsp;
button to be the correct moral action. To start,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.360
I’ll unpack the storyline to see&nbsp;
what we can learn. Let’s get to it.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.160
We open on a young woman, tickled awake&nbsp;
by a playful cockroach. She stands up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.960
and pulls a tripwire, then realizes she’s&nbsp;
adjacent to her pal Eddie. Simone tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.680
warn him not to lean forward, but Eddie’s a&nbsp;
legit dum dum. With both of them activated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.880
they trigger Billy’s entrance, at&nbsp;
which point he explains to these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.200
payday loan sharks that it’s now their&nbsp;
turn to turn in their pound of flesh.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.520
They are in a competition to load as much&nbsp;
of their soft tissues into the trays before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.400
them as possible before time runs out. The&nbsp;
loser gets a pretty sweet skull piercing as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.080
a consolation, and then the bolts dig in&nbsp;
a little, just to make it real for them.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.880
Eddie has a thirst for life, and is real quick&nbsp;
to start cutting some bacon off his belly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.120
but Simone’s all trim and fit, oh no. So instead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.000
she focuses on density and ponders a&nbsp;
contribution of pure lean body mass. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
growing desperate when she gets stuck&nbsp;
on the bone and seeing his scale moving,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.040
she cleaves that sucker right off. This tips the&nbsp;
scale at the last moment, winning her the game.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.920
We then come in on the end of the last movie,&nbsp;
and watch Hoffman dust himself off as he circles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.720
around to reset and tidy up his kill room. Just&nbsp;
in case he has a need for it in the future.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.280
After that we meet up with William the doucher,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.840
cancelling birthday plans with his family so he&nbsp;
can have a drink with Debbie, his lead council.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.800
They have to review his deposition strats for&nbsp;
the case of Mr. Abbott’s policy cancellation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:56.000
and practice their David Caruso impressions&nbsp;
We see via flashback that William related&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.120
an oral surgery thirty years prior to Mr.&nbsp;
Abbott’s current heart disease, using this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.560
undisclosed prior condition as a justification&nbsp;
for ending his policy. He didn’t take it well.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.280
As Will nails his answers with ease, he clarifies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.680
for Debbie - our stand in - that the dog&nbsp;
pit identified this discrepancy for him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.560
because they’re all over it. They love&nbsp;
cutting policies and playing hard as hell.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.360
Meanwhile, Hoffman arrives at the most recent&nbsp;
crime scene where the feds are already in charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.880
Turns out, there were some prints&nbsp;
retrieved that match agent Strahm,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.840
a disappointing shock to them all. Confident in&nbsp;
their suspect, Erickson then reveals his secret&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.960
weapon - a still alive agent Perez. We find&nbsp;
out that she and Strahm had been investigating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.720
the building fire from the last film, but&nbsp;
had to cut it loose when their witness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.400
Mallick the tweaker, went missing.&nbsp;
Hoffman is sour about this deceit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.880
but they all make a pact to hold no more&nbsp;
secrets. The basis of any good friendship.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.680
When Hoffman returns, he finds journo Jenkins&nbsp;
looking for a statement. She wants a lead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.600
and she’s looking for a juicer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.520
admitting that she’s aware of the box&nbsp;
that Jill Tuck recently inherited. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.760
offers to dial back her sensationalist&nbsp;
rhetoric if he can get her close to Jill.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.040
We then learn, through Hoffman&nbsp;
interviewing the most recent victim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.840
there is still some confusion about duress.&nbsp;
Also, that Simone has declined to learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.280
anything about her ordeal, an unfortunate,&nbsp;
missed opportunity for personal growth.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.400
Circling back with Jill, then , we see her having&nbsp;
a wine and ultrasound party. She giggles about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.000
to herself, and then returns to her precious box,&nbsp;
embracing her inherited folders in rapturous joy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.960
When Pam Jenkins calls to request a meet up,&nbsp;
we learn that she’s actually folio number two.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.280
Hoffman has another flashback, this one as a&nbsp;
reminder that everyone is to be tested, and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.720
he learns that the federalis know the jigsaw piece&nbsp;
cut from Eddie was not made with the same knife as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.600
any of the other victims other than Seth Baxter,&nbsp;
Hoffman’s sister’s killer. So, they’re also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.800
looking deeper into the associated tapes to verify&nbsp;
if they reveal different voices at their core.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.280
Feeling the pressure now, he goes to meet up&nbsp;
with Jill at the clinic to announce that the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.080
begins tonight, and he’s going to retain total&nbsp;
control. He demands the envelopes, which she had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.640
conveniently forwarded to her office, apparently,&nbsp;
and then lets her know that when he’s done,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.400
they’re done. Then we get more insight&nbsp;
into Jill’s more recent willingness to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.360
be involved to some degree. Her&nbsp;
motivations are driven by her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.320
failure to see true rehabilitation at her&nbsp;
clinics. The drugsters always come back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.880
Except Amanda. She’s cleaned up her act&nbsp;
and is proof of concept for John’s method.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.280
We then check back in with old poopface Will,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:38.800
taking in some news which gives him a lot&nbsp;
to chew on. But then the lights go out and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.200
seeing a shrouded figure approaching with&nbsp;
a gun, he adopts a shoot first approach,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.800
resulting in a terrible mistake that he&nbsp;
does not have enough time to try to fix.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.000
He wakes up at an oxygen bar, sucking on that&nbsp;
mango pineapple O2. He gets a personal message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.080
from John that says hey, thanks, for giving me&nbsp;
a chance to learn how to live through dying.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.640
William has sixty minutes to pass four&nbsp;
tests or the explosives on his arms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.880
and legs will do what they do. Luckily&nbsp;
he’ll be provided motivation to proceed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.080
unluckily it comes in the form&nbsp;
of his incarcerated family.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.760
His first test is easy, though. He just&nbsp;
has to be able to hold his breath longer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.680
than this lifelong smoker, because every&nbsp;
time they move the accordion, their torso&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.560
compressor closes in a little. They each hold&nbsp;
their breath real hard but, try as they might,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.280
they just can’t go an hour without breathing.&nbsp;
Of course, Will’s got a pair of swimmers on him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.120
so he wins the chance to watch his partner&nbsp;
get squeezed like a ketchup packet while he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.360
released from the trap. Once out, he recognizes&nbsp;
there is a foreign object inside his body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.280
but also is able to grab a key to release one&nbsp;
of his wrist bombs on his way out the door.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.000
With a moment to breathe now, we see the&nbsp;
mother/son duo are in a cell with a huge tank of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.960
hydroflouric acid attached to a sprinkler system&nbsp;
and a lever that’s just begging to be pulled.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.600
Meanwhile, uptown, Ms. Jenkins arrives at Jill’s&nbsp;
apartment to show her a document she found.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.520
She asks her to take a look at it and give her&nbsp;
a call if it means anything to her. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.080
also where she gets snatched, and this is&nbsp;
where Hoffman keeps his special pictures.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.320
Back in the maze, William thinks back fondly&nbsp;
on his first meeting with John, who critiques&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.480
his underwriting formula for failing to consider&nbsp;
the human will to live *until faced with death*&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.040
we are talking about medical&nbsp;
conditions, correct? Coming out of this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.040
Bill finds his next test - he’s forced&nbsp;
to take up the pillars of Hercules,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.280
and then funhouse Billy drops in to point&nbsp;
out his policy would value this young,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.160
childless clerk over his older, child-bearing&nbsp;
assistant. Now he gets to see what it’s like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.560
to make a direct choice. Failure to do&nbsp;
so will result in both their deaths.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.560
As their chains are reeled in, he weighs&nbsp;
his options and makes a wise choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.640
In response to her gratitude, he offers&nbsp;
some kind words and then leaves Addy to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.960
disentangle her own barbed-wire noose so&nbsp;
he can focus on getting his hands free.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.760
Elsewhere in the facility we&nbsp;
see that Jenkins has her own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.960
cell full of acid. She wakes&nbsp;
up and also has her own tape,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.360
which lets her know she’s here due to&nbsp;
exploiting John’s pure message of redemption.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.120
Jill finds herself at the hospital&nbsp;
with a look of steely determination.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.400
As she walks the hall she flashes back to the rack&nbsp;
where John and Hoffman have a mild disagreement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.080
about how to treat the victims, and there is&nbsp;
a little bit of disciple jealousy as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.880
Jill met him here to ask him to stop. Instead,&nbsp;
he just assures her he’ll provide her a way out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.920
when it’s all done and gives her a key to the&nbsp;
box. She then drops the parcel and moves along.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.440
Back at the maze, William appears to&nbsp;
have fallen asleep, and is searching for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.760
Freddy Kreuger. This is the perfect time for an&nbsp;
inception back to a prior memory of when John&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.920
pitched an experimental therapy he wanted&nbsp;
to get in on. Not only did William deny it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.640
but if John did it on his own, he was going&nbsp;
to cancel the whole policy on his ass. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.320
was a very eye-opening meeting about culpability.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:48.080
When he comes to, he’s arrived at the next test.&nbsp;
Debbie has a brain-piercing device strapped to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.400
torso, rather than her head, and she has&nbsp;
to make it across a catwalk to the finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.920
William is meant to help her through and&nbsp;
be there at the end to assist with the key.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.680
She works her way along, occasionally&nbsp;
needing to take turns getting straight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.760
blasted in the face with some steam. And she&nbsp;
makes it across, where it’s revealed that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.320
key to her salvation has been inside him the&nbsp;
whole time. She attempts to extract it with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.560
overhead chops from a circular saw. She&nbsp;
must’ve forgotten how he helped with the steam,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.400
so he thrashes her soundly, and her&nbsp;
device goes off, effectively removing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.240
her impulse control. Completely. For&nbsp;
Will, it’s just on to the next one.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.400
Hoffman then gets interrupted from his evening&nbsp;
plans with a request to meet up about the Seth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.360
Baxter tape. When he arrives at HQ, it’s revealed&nbsp;
that they found some inconsistencies with Strahm’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.120
fingerprints, indicating they were not&nbsp;
made with a living hand. The tape they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.920
discussed is being analyzed, but it’s off site,&nbsp;
so they head out together to check the results.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.720
Meanwhile, William gets to a door and hears his&nbsp;
crew screaming for help inside. When he enters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.520
he finds them playing hard, natch, but&nbsp;
they’re sad despite twirling upon the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.680
best playground ride available. Then Billy&nbsp;
pops in to say what’s up. We learn the dog&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:57.040
pound here will spin around and get blasted&nbsp;
by a shotgun. He can only save two of them.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.880
He has barely a moment to think his way through&nbsp;
when the first victim gets racked up and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:06.480
just to show it’s for real, blasted in the chest.&nbsp;
When a young mother eases in, he makes his first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.880
selection. But this sets the rest of them to lying&nbsp;
about whatever they can think of to convince him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.920
they’re worthy, while also calling each other&nbsp;
out. This influx of information overwhelms him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.640
condemning some of them to death. He snaps out&nbsp;
of it to make his second selection, which is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:26.320
the final person, so he’s forced to listen as his&nbsp;
employee maligns him while he aligns with the gun.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.320
At that time, Hoffman and the others arrive&nbsp;
at the audio shack where the expert toils&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.280
away in a dark closet. She’s right on the verge of&nbsp;
breaking the algorithm to reveal the true voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.240
As the pressure rises, Perez starts questioning&nbsp;
Strahm’s motivations. Despite the fact that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.440
get a strong sense they suspect Hoffman, they are&nbsp;
taken completely unawares when his voice pops up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.080
He turns on them and only Perez gets off&nbsp;
shots, but it’s directly into her co-worker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.400
Once he gets her against the wall, he insists on&nbsp;
knowing who else knows before running to his trunk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.120
to get his finger-printing device. He tosses a few&nbsp;
around before dousing the room and firing it up.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.840
Jill arrives at the command post and sets up a&nbsp;
special document for Hoffman to find. While in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.800
the cell, Brent decides he’s a man of action and&nbsp;
goes for the lever. However, he does seek his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.520
mommy’s permission first. He switches it to live&nbsp;
and nothing happens, so he flips it a bunch and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.720
leaves it on die. His mom has a lightbulb moment,&nbsp;
though, and sets it back to neutral, just in case.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.440
At that time, William is searching for the exit&nbsp;
and Hoffman returns. When he does, he finds the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.640
paper. We find out this is a note that he wrote&nbsp;
to Amanda. She had been with Cecil on that fateful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.800
night, and was the one to entice him to do the&nbsp;
job. Hoffman held this over her, compelling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.440
her to kill Lynn to prevent him from spilling&nbsp;
the beans. Jill then waltzes in to reveal that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.400
Hoffman is sitting on an electrified chair. From&nbsp;
this we learn that the mysterious box we can’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.360
stop thinking about contained a bear trap for&nbsp;
Hoffman, because all will be tested in the end.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.440
As she works on this, William rushes through&nbsp;
the final door with only a moment to spare.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.400
Then the walls pull back and we learn that his&nbsp;
only family is actually his sister Pam Jenkins.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.120
The other pair are Mr. Abbott’s widow and son.&nbsp;
John then comes on to reveal that the game has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.080
shifted and William’s final judgement is to come&nbsp;
from them. Tara gets all high and mighty about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.880
her duty to prevent future deaths by killing&nbsp;
him, but still can’t bring herself to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.760
Although, her speech charged up Brent who pulls&nbsp;
the lever, swinging down a giant grid of large&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.160
gauge syringes that fill William with the&nbsp;
acid they’ve been staring at this whole time.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.640
Jill starts Hoffman’s timer and heads out.&nbsp;
So, as William melts away from the inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.480
Hoffman demonstrates his will to live&nbsp;
first by crushing his own hand to escape,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.480
and then cramming his face into the window&nbsp;
bars to limit the traps capacity to open.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.840
He’s then able to slip down and out of the head&nbsp;
gear and walk away with only minor injuries.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.760
Well that was both pleasant and enjoyable.&nbsp;
It really makes me wonder what we’ll bear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.480
witness to in the penultimate installment. But for&nbsp;
now, let’s focus ourselves on the task at hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.880
by working through these traps. We’ve gone&nbsp;
back to simpler times now, and find ourselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.080
with a single trap participant working his way&nbsp;
through a variety of fairly locked down puzzles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.400
The difference here, obviously, is that it’s&nbsp;
not so much about ensuring your own survival&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.560
as it is trying to bring as many additional&nbsp;
survivors out with you as possible.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.280
The movie opens with the flesh scale. If you&nbsp;
recall, Simone and Eddie had head devices with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.680
tension bolts applied to their temples. Whoever&nbsp;
lost the challenge, as determined by the scale,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.920
would get a full insertion resulting in&nbsp;
a permanent headache. This trap gives us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.840
very little to go on, focusing on the&nbsp;
character’s decision and will to win.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.600
We don’t get to see much about how this&nbsp;
headgear is attached or what their surroundings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.320
consist of. Although, I’m not sure searching&nbsp;
surroundings would be particularly effective,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.720
because they had a very tight timer on this one.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.240
I had several thoughts about this puzzle&nbsp;
that mostly hinge around winning rather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:41.040
than ensuring mutual survival. To that end, I&nbsp;
did wonder if it might be possible to work the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.520
flat portions of the two larger bladed&nbsp;
items between the bolt and your skin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.240
thus distributing the force across a larger&nbsp;
area. If the bolts decided to go for a drive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.560
your survival would come down to which gives&nbsp;
out first - the strength of the headgear and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.280
its various attachment points and joints,&nbsp;
or the structural integrity of your skull.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.160
Outside of that, I think this one comes down more&nbsp;
to psychological warfare. It would behoove you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.480
especially if you saw your competition going&nbsp;
to town on their flanks, to play it up like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.400
you didn’t have what it takes to strip&nbsp;
your flesh. Give them the idea that maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.200
they’re in for an easy win to slow them down&nbsp;
a bit. Simone’s area seemed to be fairly open,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.640
and there is a corner back here that has some&nbsp;
stuff behind it. If there is anything there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:25.120
that could reach down the tubes to push the tray,&nbsp;
she could hold it down and score an easy victory.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.280
There didn’t seem to be any limited range of&nbsp;
motion for the victims, the trap just tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.400
keep them confined to the table by locking down&nbsp;
the tools. However, while the tools are chained,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.800
those chains appear to be attached to&nbsp;
wood. It seems like your next best bet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.640
after convincing your opponent you’re falling&nbsp;
apart mentally, would be to try to keep your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.560
back to them and use the cleaver to chunk out&nbsp;
wedges of the wood until you could wrench some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.960
of the tools free. Let your partner load up their&nbsp;
scale like they’re at a keto farmer’s market,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.880
and then turn at the last moment to load your&nbsp;
side up with a bunch of metal implements.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.360
We then move into William’s trials. Broadly&nbsp;
speaking, he has sixty minutes to complete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.720
his four tests. The problem is that most of these&nbsp;
tests do require someone to die, but I think there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.840
are a few opportunities contained throughout. When&nbsp;
he first wakes up, he finds himself in the oxygen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.160
exam. What we come to learn is that breathing&nbsp;
in causes the device to crush them little by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.120
little until they die. It’s not clear exactly what&nbsp;
kind of breathing device they have on them here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.280
The accordion portion seems to go up pretty&nbsp;
dramatically even when William was breathing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:28.160
normally while unconscious. If it’s a life&nbsp;
support-style device, any inhalation will likely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.480
result in it pushing air into you, meaning that&nbsp;
sensor is going to get tripped no matter what.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.800
This is important, because my first thought was&nbsp;
what if they just take shallow breaths to avoid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.640
moving the sensor? The problem, though, is&nbsp;
that there is no time limit here. If one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.360
them doesn’t die, releasing the other, the global&nbsp;
timer will run out and William will die along with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:51.040
his family. So, there really is no choice here&nbsp;
but to compete to win and, based on their mutual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.760
efforts to try to bypass this, it seems you’re&nbsp;
likely to beat this other guy no matter what.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.840
This quickly turns into a trap where it would be&nbsp;
ideal to try to put it behind you and move on.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.760
He then enters an area where he has&nbsp;
some time to scavenge for useful items.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.560
Just right off here I see some useful rocks, and&nbsp;
potentially useful shards of glass for cutting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.560
There is also tubing hanging down and all sorts&nbsp;
of other things. Who knows what other strange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.480
and useful items may be contained inside&nbsp;
these display stages. It should also be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.480
noted that the keys to his extremity bombs&nbsp;
are just hanging from strings beyond each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.800
task. Any puzzle that doesn’t require him&nbsp;
to be locked down or imperiled in some way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.960
could be skippable. However, they cover this&nbsp;
with a simple red light, implying there is some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.280
sort of proximity sensor connecting each&nbsp;
bomb with the trap that comes before it.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.360
This is actually very useful, because while&nbsp;
it’s intended to keep him in the general area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.920
of the test, it doesn’t specifically drive&nbsp;
him to start it at any particular time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.880
In the case of the iron cross here, he is again&nbsp;
forced to let someone die with rules set up that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:52.560
preclude him from saving them both via the game.&nbsp;
Either they both die, or he can save one. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.880
just because he can’t move past doesn’t mean&nbsp;
he has to pick up the handles right away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.760
In this instance a strong case could be made&nbsp;
for taking rock to glass. Once inside, you could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:06.000
unwrap their necklaces to prevent further injury.&nbsp;
You could even then go through with the process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.800
of the game to register your choice and make it&nbsp;
easier to ensure your ability to get the next key.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.200
Next up is the stomach piercer, which is a&nbsp;
confusing name, because it’s intended to shred&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.920
your frontal lobe. Nonetheless, they went with a&nbsp;
torso attachment. I immediately identified that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.800
you could just angle your body and head in such a&nbsp;
way to avoid full penetration, and was vindicated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.960
when they let slip a couple of frames that&nbsp;
reveal just that. Because I was looking for it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.800
it was clear they tried to shoot around this and&nbsp;
make sure Debbie never moved her body in such&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.680
a way that made it apparent. However, they tried&nbsp;
to jam me up at the end by having the contraption&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.560
do a little readjustment of its position prior to&nbsp;
delivering its load. I’m not sure this is the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.280
efficient way to take out a person’s brain, but I&nbsp;
understand the desire to introduce variety here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.360
Regardless, while it still may be possible to&nbsp;
shuck and jive your way out of this, there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.920
also just the raw power of teamwork as an option.&nbsp;
There’s a lot of tools inside the finishing area,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.320
many of which may have been a possibility for&nbsp;
opening up William’s wound to retrieve the key,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.640
but also he could have held onto a shard of&nbsp;
glass from the previous area as mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.400
With all the steam and heat, it seems like&nbsp;
they could have created a fairly safe and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:13.760
sterile surgical environment, and possibly even&nbsp;
had access to blood flow-stemming cauterization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.720
afterward. If Debbie could just refrain from&nbsp;
acting like an ass for a few seconds here.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.800
Before finishing with Hoffman’s trials, we’ll&nbsp;
take a brief moment to note the absurdity of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:27.200
Tara’s test here. The end result feels a bit&nbsp;
tacked on, and I’m not entirely sure what it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.840
supposed to prove or why it’s happening.&nbsp;
She recognizes this is her test, but why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.640
is she being tested? She is a victim of William&nbsp;
trying to raise her snotty son as a single mom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:42.160
Is she not paragliding on the weekends enough to&nbsp;
demonstrate she’s got life by the balls? And also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.400
what is the consequence here? It’s not&nbsp;
stated. He tells her only to pick live or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.320
die for William, there are no other rules&nbsp;
or requirements. There is no time limit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.040
and there is no other challenge. It’s not clear&nbsp;
why she has to pick live rather than do nothing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.840
or what would happen if she leaves it on neutral.&nbsp;
Perhaps it sprinkles the acid in their cell or in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.080
Pam’s cell? But these potential twists are&nbsp;
never stated. It makes me wonder if we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.320
some important scenes on the cutting room floor&nbsp;
that would have elucidated the point of all this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:12.160
Which is too bad because, without them,&nbsp;
this isn’t really a challenge at all.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.720
Finally we’ll talk about the two primary&nbsp;
challenges faced by Hoffman. The first is the kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:21.920
room where he managed to take out multiple, armed&nbsp;
FBI agents with a knife. Now, if you’re Hoffman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.840
you did well, but we’re going to examine&nbsp;
how lucky he got in the way this unfolded.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.240
First off, as I said in the summarization, the&nbsp;
agents were letting on like they had an idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.720
Hoffman was involved here. I’m not sure why they&nbsp;
wouldn’t have been watching him more closely.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:39.440
Erickson pulls back his jacket and, as experienced&nbsp;
G-persons, both of them should have their right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.760
hands open and available for their weapon. This&nbsp;
is drilled into them in training and becomes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:49.280
lifelong habit for law enforcement. But, if they&nbsp;
did it because they were preparing themselves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.520
they negated their ability to act by then&nbsp;
also lining themselves up with Hoffman in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.000
the middle. This is a recipe for disaster,&nbsp;
because it puts you in a crossfire situation.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.720
Of course, this didn’t stop Perez from putting&nbsp;
three rounds into the center mass of her desk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.640
jockey friend here, so I’m not really sure&nbsp;
where her mind was at. I think the coffee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.480
to the face was overplayed a bit. When&nbsp;
small droplets of liquid hit open air,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.840
they transfer their heat energy&nbsp;
fairly rapidly. He’s picking up an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.640
evening pot of stale ass coffee and tossing it&nbsp;
across the room. The result was probably more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.720
startling than painful, but I would expect&nbsp;
a trained agent to be prepared for this.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.640
Further, jamming a screwdriver into the power&nbsp;
strip would not have the desired outcome,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.280
so they would have had full vision. If you arc a&nbsp;
piece of conductive material between the two ports&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.760
of an outlet, you can get it to pop and possibly&nbsp;
burn out. A single port shouldn’t be a problem,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.840
but even if it is, this is a power strip.&nbsp;
It likely has built in surge protection,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.920
and it’s a separate unit plugged into an&nbsp;
actual wall outlet. It seems unlikely that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.640
it would trip the breaker for the entire room,&nbsp;
or that the entire room is on a single breaker.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.200
If agent Perez was suspicious, which the movie&nbsp;
led us to believe, her best position would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:57.120
to listen from the computer station, to the&nbsp;
left of the audio expert. This would have put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.520
her and Erickson at angles in front of Hoffman,&nbsp;
allowing either of them to draw down on him with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.720
no targets of concern downrange while still being&nbsp;
able to listen and watch him at the same time.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.120
Last up is the bear trap. Here is another one that&nbsp;
Hoffman successfully navigated, so I’m not sure we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.360
could find a better outcome. Hoffman got out of&nbsp;
the chair, and he cranked on it with some tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:20.000
Were better tools available for the job? Possibly,&nbsp;
but we didn’t get to see what all was there, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.960
this was his workshop. So, if he had a C-clamp or&nbsp;
some vice grips or something like that, presumably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.520
he would be the one to know and employ them. The&nbsp;
bar trick is actually a pretty slick move here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.960
and likely only possible because this&nbsp;
was a trap that didn’t have its own,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.840
purpose-built room in which it unfolded. But,&nbsp;
then again, this wasn’t really a “test” in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.760
traditional sense, because there was no&nbsp;
key to recover once the test was passed.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.840
I do wonder, after the trap was sprung, could&nbsp;
he not have just left it between the bars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.400
or reclosed it manually? The trap is set by&nbsp;
human hands so it seems like it could be.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.280
It also raises some odd questions here about&nbsp;
the viability of some of the other set ups&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.440
in that he was able to just slide his head out&nbsp;
of it despite how low it rested on the back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.200
Pulling down hard will now be a&nbsp;
reasonable last resort moving forward.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.800
Here is another installment where the average&nbsp;
person would come out looking pretty good.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.920
There is going to be pain, but the&nbsp;
challenges are mostly emotional,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.720
requiring the participant to choose who to save&nbsp;
while watching others die, rather than putting the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.760
participant in actual mortal danger. As a result,&nbsp;
I would have to say that you would survive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:24.080
but the degree to which you would be “okay”&nbsp;
is really dependent on how effectively you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:29.120
could compartmentalize your actions from their&nbsp;
consequences. Just remember that I believe in you.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:43.840
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;
my donors, memorialized in the hall of headshots.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.720
As an FYI, I have a website set up where you&nbsp;
can support the channel through donations or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.760
merch. Any donation unlocks uncensored movie&nbsp;
reviews of Lifeforce and Under the Skin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.640
with others to be added over&nbsp;
time. If you enjoyed the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:01.760
I’d love for you to become a part of the&nbsp;
channel by subscribing. Thanks for watching.
