reveals that sarah's doctor told him that her eye&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.040

the hospital the inspector tells julia about&nbsp;
isaac's suicide letter he had an affair with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.480
sarah for six months before her death he killed&nbsp;
himself because he couldn't lie to julia anymore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.400
a few days later julia goes through a surgery she&nbsp;
has to live with the bandage around her eyes for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.640
a week only after that will we know if the surgery&nbsp;
has been successful during this time she will stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.240
under supervision in her twins house the hospital&nbsp;
provides julia with a caretaker named ivan to help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.280
her around the house he gives her a device to hang&nbsp;
around her neck so that she can call him any time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.400
she wants that night julia gets a nightmare about&nbsp;
isaac and sarah trying to get her bandage off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.440
she wakes up terrified then she hears footsteps&nbsp;
from outside she calls ivan through the device he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.840
tells her to get out of the house she escapes just&nbsp;
then someone takes the key crespillo had given her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.360
the police come in the following day but&nbsp;
they do not find any evidence of invasion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.600
ivan lovingly changes julia's bandage for the next&nbsp;
few days he takes great care of her changing her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.280
bandages cooking for her listening to music with&nbsp;
her and whatnot but throughout all those times we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.120
never get to see ivan's face on the third day&nbsp;
julia asks him to stay for drinks they have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.600
conversation about isaac after which she kisses&nbsp;
him that night julia is woken up by a nightmare as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.480
she reaches for her wedding ring on the side table&nbsp;
we see a set of hospital tools similar to one from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.920
the night of sarah's death someone from behind her&nbsp;
tries to inject her with a drug this wakes her up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.440
and she finally touches the man terrified she runs&nbsp;
out of the house to her neighbor blasco's home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.320
his daughter leah is home too he lets&nbsp;
her inside but starts to harass julia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.560
shortly she is surprised to find sarah's&nbsp;
key in his house she takes it with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.960
she escapes from his house and hides in a corner&nbsp;
calling ivan for help finally ivan comes to save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.480
her she is too scared to go into her own house so&nbsp;
he takes her to his there she tells him that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.440
found sarah's key at mr blasco's home she&nbsp;
suspects that blasco is the invisible man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.960
ivan leaves for some time when leah approaches&nbsp;
julia she has followed them here and snuck into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.360
the house through the windows leah tells julia&nbsp;
that she was the one who stole the key from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.040
her house and that she knows who killed sarah&nbsp;
and isaac it is the invisible man ivan himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.760
leah reveals that she used to be close to&nbsp;
sarah and knows a lot about the invisible man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.520
julia doesn't believe it but leah insists that&nbsp;
the key unlocks one of the locks in ivan's house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.800
ivan has been drugging julia to make her go&nbsp;
blind as he did with sarah leah tells julia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.160
to go to the bathroom and stay there until leah&nbsp;
finds a way to escape when ivan comes back she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.040
asks him to take her to the bathroom she then&nbsp;
opens her bandage four days before the schedule&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.560
luckily the operation is successful and she&nbsp;
is happy to have gained her vision back she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.760
quickly goes outside and enters one of the rooms&nbsp;
she is shocked to see many pictures of sarah and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:02.000
herself on the wall julia leaves the room to look&nbsp;
for leah but sees her body stabbed to the wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:08.640
ivan had killed her too terrified she sits down&nbsp;
in the corner crying just then ivan comes into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:14.960
the room we see his face for the first time it is&nbsp;
splattered with leah's blood julia poses as though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:20.480
the surgery was unsuccessful and pretends that&nbsp;
she is still blind ivan expresses his love for her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.080
now she is in the kitchen with him&nbsp;
she sees him drugging her cup of tea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.520
julia then replaces her cup of tea with his&nbsp;
ivan doesn't notice but he gets suspicious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.120
he takes her to the freezer and asks her&nbsp;
to open it inside it is the dead body of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:41.440
real ivan julia gasps giving away that she can&nbsp;
actually see the imposter ivan calls her a liar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.200
he then takes her to sarah's house but julia&nbsp;
manages to run away from him into soledad's house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.480
there she asks her to call the police but ivan&nbsp;
comes in before she can he calls soledad mom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.680
revealing that he is actually her son angel&nbsp;
julia pleads with soledad to call the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.960
but angel convinces her that he is not a killer&nbsp;
then soledad hits julia on her head with a phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.040
angel realizes that his mother can see soledad&nbsp;
reminds him he will be nothing without her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.760
this agitates on hell so he chokes her he&nbsp;
wants her to go back to being blind again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:20.240
he pokes her eyes with a needle when julia wakes&nbsp;
up she is in the basement of sarah's house angel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.280
sits in front of her he has packed all her clothes&nbsp;
and plans to take her away to live with him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.800
as he starts to kiss her julia takes&nbsp;
a knife and stabs him on his legs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.000
she quickly runs out of the basement and locks&nbsp;
him there but she can't get out of the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.600
she calls the police just as angel breaks the&nbsp;
door julia cuts off all the lights in the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:46.160
it is pitch dark angel uses his camera flash&nbsp;
to look for julia and finds her as he tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.920
stab her the police come in but they too cannot&nbsp;
see anyone in the dark room julia takes one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:57.360
the torchlights from them and shines it to angel&nbsp;
in the corner the shadow finally comes to light&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.080
angel cannot handle being looked at by so many&nbsp;
people so he slits his throat killing himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.360
cut to a few weeks later julia is at the&nbsp;
hospital she finds that the damage to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.760
new eyes is irreversible as she had been&nbsp;
continuously injected by her fake caretaker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.360
using her last few hours of vision julia says&nbsp;
goodbye to isaac's corpse it is revealed that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.400
he was the one who donated her with his eyes the&nbsp;
movie ends as the camera zooms into julia's eye&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.960
now for the explanation sarah and julia both&nbsp;
have a condition called degenerative vision&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.880
this causes them to lose their vision&nbsp;
progressively eventually going blind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:39.600
sarah loses her vision before julia angel has&nbsp;
a fascination for blind girls he calls himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.400
an invisible man this is a metaphor for him&nbsp;
trying to say that he has no friends or family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:50.400
no one notices him when he's around because he's&nbsp;
not worth noticing over time angel has developed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.840
the ability to be stealthy and stop victims&nbsp;
efficiently he took care of his mother soledad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.200
for 10 years thinking she was blind soledad&nbsp;
was the only person who he talked to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.320
filled on hell with resentment towards everyone&nbsp;
who did not notice or care for him however he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:11.600
fell in love with sarah and then julia according&nbsp;
to him only blind girls could feel his presence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.320
sarah tells her other blind friends at a center&nbsp;
for the blind that she's been dating someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:22.080
this person is on hell once she has her eyes&nbsp;
operated she goes with angel to a hotel in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.840
bella vista for a week at this point she has her&nbsp;
eyes bandaged we are not told what circumstances&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:33.040
she meets with angel perhaps he was posing as her&nbsp;
caretaker and his empathy was winning sarah over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.560
angel doesn't want sarah getting her eyesight&nbsp;
back he ensures that he sneaks up on sarah in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.320
the nights and injects her eyes with&nbsp;
chemicals that destroy the optic nerve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.520
the doctor declares that the operation has failed&nbsp;
sarah gets to know that someone is following her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.960
she could feel his presence and&nbsp;
resented him so he killed her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.320
when julia came looking for sarah angel&nbsp;
saw it as another opportunity at love&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:04.000
but julia had her husband always by her side hence&nbsp;
angel killed him as well however the neighbor girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.280
leah helped julia find out about angel's real&nbsp;
intentions before he could blind julia fully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.560
at the end finally julia makes him visible&nbsp;
to everyone he had always been a lonely man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.680
so when the police officers had their eyes on&nbsp;
him he could not handle it killing himself at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.520
the end that's my explanation for the movie&nbsp;
