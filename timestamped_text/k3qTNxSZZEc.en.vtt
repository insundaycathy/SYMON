00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.720
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today, I am going&nbsp;
to explain an episode called “White Christmas”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.440
from the British science fiction&nbsp;
series “Black Mirror.” 
&nbsp;

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:18.800
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care!
The episode begins in a tiny cabin in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.480
middle of nowhere. Joe Potter wakes up on&nbsp;
Christmas eve to loud music playing outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.920
His roommate, Matt Trent, is in the Christmas&nbsp;
spirit, but Joe is not in the mood for it. Matt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.520
and Joe have been living together for five years,&nbsp;
but have barely talked to each other. Matt asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.120
Joe his reason for being in the cabin, but he&nbsp;
is hesitant to talk, so Matt goes first to ease&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.000
Joe into the conversation. He starts talking&nbsp;
about his life prior to living in the cabin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.320
Matt used to be a love guru, someone who helped&nbsp;
nervous boys to flirt with women and seduce them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.320
He used an advanced technology fitted in the eyes&nbsp;
of the man called the Z-eyes to watch how the date&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.040
went, and listen to their conversations. 
Matt talks about one particular case of a man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.120
named Harry. Harry is a nervous man around girls&nbsp;
and needs Matt's help to seduce one. It is night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.800
time and Harry has to get ready to crash a random&nbsp;
office party. Matt starts by turning the Z-link&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.120
on. Now, he can see and hear everything that Harry&nbsp;
does. He asks Harry to change from his clothes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.640
something more “masculine”. Harry obliges and&nbsp;
gets ready. When he first gets into the party,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.720
Harry looks around and his eyes land on a&nbsp;
dark-haired girl hanging out with a blonde&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.640
girl and a man. Matt advises him to join the&nbsp;
group but talk only to the blonde girl. He does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.640
a reverse image search to look for the girl’s name&nbsp;
and personality on a device. The blonde introduces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.160
herself as Amy and the other girl as Jennifer. 
Jennifer then excuses herself and leaves the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.800
conversation. Harry goes to the washroom&nbsp;
and asks Matt to not watch while he pees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.160
Just then, we get to know that Matt isn’t alone&nbsp;
but a whole group of his friends are watching the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.000
interaction online. When Harry goes back, Jennifer&nbsp;
is sitting alone far from the party. Matt makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.280
him approach her. Jennifer finally seems to be&nbsp;
opening up to him. While talking, she reveals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.880
that she used to take pills but isn’t taking them&nbsp;
anymore. The statement unsettles Harry and Matt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.840
but they don’t think much of it. Jennifer goes&nbsp;
to the bathroom and Harry starts talking to Matt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.200
He genuinely likes the girl and feels like he is&nbsp;
cheating her by taking Matt’s help. As he chats,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.960
Jennifer returns and sees him talking to himself.&nbsp;
She immediately asks him to come over to her place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.480
and Harry obliges. She claims that the little&nbsp;
voice in her head is asking her to invite him. 
&nbsp;

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.440
When they reach her home, Jennifer goes to get&nbsp;
drinks after telling Harry to go to her room. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.120
guys watching them are excited anticipating sexual&nbsp;
advances from her, but Harry retaliates saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.000
that he isn’t comfortable with Matt watching.
Jennifer comes back with the drinks and demands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.880
Harry get on the bed. He hesitantly agrees&nbsp;
when suddenly, she forces him to take a gulp&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.240
of the drink. Jennifer thinks that Harry too has&nbsp;
voices in his head, and assumes Harry is insane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.160
like her. Turns out she has poisoned the drink to&nbsp;
kill herself and Harry so they don’t have to hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.240
the voices anymore. Matt and the others watching&nbsp;
are horrified when Harry starts coughing blood.
&nbsp;

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.760
She eventually forces him to drink the juice and&nbsp;
kills him. Matt quickly turns his computer off and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.880
asks the other guys to destroy any video evidence&nbsp;
they have of the interaction. He doesn’t want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.520
be associated with the murder, as his wife doesn’t&nbsp;
know he is a love guru. Matt gathers the evidence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.240
in a bin and sneaks out of the room to throw&nbsp;
them out. However, he is caught by his wife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.520
Claire. She finds out about his involvement with&nbsp;
the crime and him being a perverted love guru.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.400
The two get into a fight and Clair blocks him.&nbsp;
With the new technology of human blocking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.200
the person being blocked will only appear as&nbsp;
an anonymous shape to the blocker. The two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.400
cannot talk or communicate. Back in the present,&nbsp;
Matt reveals that being a love guru was his side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.640
hustle, his main job was somewhat unusual. 
He starts by talking about a woman named Greta.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.800
She is sitting on a hospital bed when a nurse&nbsp;
comes and asks if she is ready to perform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.720
the procedure. When the process starts, Greta&nbsp;
falls unconscious under anesthesia. Then we see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.760
something being taken out of the woman’s head.&nbsp;
A nurse keeps an egg-like device on the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.960
The device has a mind of itself that we can hear&nbsp;
her talking. It turns out, Greta’s whole memory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.120
has been coded and put into the device. So, now&nbsp;
the egg is a second Greta that cannot move, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.240
still has her consciousness and personality. 
In the following scene, the device is in front of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.280
Matt. He explains to the voice that he works for&nbsp;
a company called smart intelligence. The company&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.480
has figured out a way to make digital clones of&nbsp;
people and store them in an egg-shaped object. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.320
clones are called cookies and are used as personal&nbsp;
assistants by real people. The real Greta has made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.800
her cookie to help her through her daily life.&nbsp;
A control panel in front of the cookie controls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.680
everything in the house like the temperature,&nbsp;
lighting, and all the electronics. She has to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.200
them to help Greta with basic things. However,&nbsp;
the cookie refuses to be a slave to Greta.
&nbsp;

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.320
Matt has expected this, so he sets a one-minute&nbsp;
timer on the device. During this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.600
the cookie Greta will live one year of life in one&nbsp;
minute. When the minute is over and Matt talks to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.800
her again, she is startled. After spending a year&nbsp;
in isolation, she begs Matt to give her something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.080
to work on. Matt happily says that she will be&nbsp;
working as Greta’s assistant from now on. We see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.040
then the cookie monitoring the real Greta. She&nbsp;
turns the light and alarm on in the morning. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.640
makes a shot of espresso for her and makes a voice&nbsp;
narrate her schedule. That is her life now.
&nbsp;

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.760
Back in present, Joe finally feels comfortable&nbsp;
and starts opening up about his life. He had a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.680
beautiful fiancee named Beth. On a snowy day, the&nbsp;
two go out as Beth’s father tells them to be back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.120
home soon. In the following scene, we see Beth&nbsp;
and Joe having dinner with two of their friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.240
Beth doesn’t feel good after dinner so she&nbsp;
goes to sleep early. As Joe cleans after her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.440
he spills the contents of the bin and finds a&nbsp;
positive pregnancy kit. Shocked, he confronts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.720
Beth about it. She dismisses it and says that she&nbsp;
wants an abortion and is too young to have a kid.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.280
Joe tries to convince her, saying that he will&nbsp;
take care of the kid, but Beth is strictly against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.040
it. When he starts to scream at her, she blocks&nbsp;
him. Joe’s voice changes into a muffled tone and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.160
the two only see a shadow of each other now. 
He throws a vase to the wall and storms out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.080
room. The following morning, Beth rushes to her&nbsp;
car outside while a still blocked Joe follows her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.000
Beth drives away somewhere and never comes back.&nbsp;
The block stops Joe from calling or texting her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
so he has no means of communication. A week passes&nbsp;
but she doesn’t return. Joe gets to know that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.280
has left the job without any explanation&nbsp;
and no one knows where she is. Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.320
he cannot even look at images of her as the block&nbsp;
option covers every image of the person. 
&nbsp;

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.800
A few months later, he is in town when he&nbsp;
sees a silhouette nearby and recognizes her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.920
as Beth. It is clear to him that she is still&nbsp;
pregnant. Surprised that she had kept his child,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.120
he approaches her and asks her to turn the block&nbsp;
off. But all Beth hears is a muffled voice and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.560
yells for help. Eventually the police arrest Joe.&nbsp;
He is desperate to meet his child, but doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.760
know where Beth is. He knows where her father&nbsp;
lives and is sure that Beth is going to be there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.680
at Christmas. So, next Christmas, he goes to her&nbsp;
father’s home which lies in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.800
There, he finally sees Beth and their kid.&nbsp;
Since the block option blurs offspring as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.320
he cannot see if the baby is a boy or a girl.&nbsp;
Joe is beyond confused as to why Beth kept the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.760
baby but doesn’t want him in her life. A lot&nbsp;
of time goes by, Joe has made it a ritual to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.800
visit Beth’s father every Christmas eve and look&nbsp;
at them from a distance. He claims it was like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.080
watching his kid grow up even though he couldn’t&nbsp;
see the kid’s face. Four years later, he realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.120
that the child was a girl for the first time. 
One day, Joe is searching through channels on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.960
TV and sees Beth’s picture on it. She had died&nbsp;
in a train crash, so the block was turned off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.200
Joe can see her face for the first&nbsp;
time in years. The next Christmas,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.000
he wraps a Christmas globe as a present for his&nbsp;
daughter and heads to Beth’s grandfather’s home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.600
When he gets a glimpse at her, he is sure she is&nbsp;
not his daughter. Shocked, he follows her into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.560
the house. He realizes Beth had been cheating&nbsp;
on him with her co-worker. Beth’s father is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:20.480
shocked to see him at his house and asks him to&nbsp;
go away. In anger and frustration, Joe hits the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.412
old man with the snow globe, injuring his head.&nbsp;
Joe looks towards the wall and sees a clock. 
&nbsp;

00:08:23.609 --> 00:08:25.200
cabin slowly changing into Beth’s father’s home.&nbsp;
Back then Joe had left the old man unconscious in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.480
the kitchen and never came back. He died in the&nbsp;
very spot and the little girl stayed in her room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.920
for the day. The following day, she gave her dead&nbsp;
grandfather a gift she had made him. Realizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.720
that no one is going to come, she went out to&nbsp;
search for help, while it was snowing heavily.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.240
Since the house was in the middle of nowhere, she&nbsp;
died of cold. As he finishes telling the story,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:52.800
Joe is in tears, he asks God to forgive him.
Matt asks him if he confesses his crime and Joe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:59.600
admits he does. He seems to be interviewing Joe at&nbsp;
this point. All of a sudden, Matt talks to someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.040
else claiming that he has done “it” and asking&nbsp;
them to let him out now. The scene changes to Matt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.560
at a police station talking to some officials.&nbsp;
In front of him lies a egg-like cloning device.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.680
As it turns out, Matt has been talking to Joe’s&nbsp;
cookie this whole time. Using the technology,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.560
he created his own cookie to try to make Joe&nbsp;
confess his crime. Matt had made a deal with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.680
police that if he can make Joe confess, he will&nbsp;
be let free for not reporting Harry’s death and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.560
conducting illegal dating services. The police&nbsp;
say that he will be on their sex offender list&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.520
and will be permanently blocked from everyone. 
When Matt goes out, he sees that everyone around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:41.440
him is just a silhouette. The world is blurred and&nbsp;
muffled for him. Moreover, everyone sees him as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:47.200
red shadow, indicating that he is a sex offender.&nbsp;
A police officer sets a timer of a thousand years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.720
per minute on Joe’s device and leaves him like&nbsp;
that. The cookie Joe now lives a thousand years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.640
in a minute in isolation. We see him struggling&nbsp;
to keep himself sane. As the camera pans out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.840
he seems to be inside a loop of snow globes.
