Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:08.069
Today I will show you a comedy, fantasy, horror
film from 2014, titled Life After Beth.

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.260
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.270
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.520
Beth really likes hikes, so she goes on one
herself.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.730
In the next scene, we see her boyfriend Zach,
buying napkins for her funeral because she

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.650
got bit by a venomous snake and died on her
hike.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.410
He and his parents arrive at the Slocum household
for the wake where they are greeted by Beth's

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.950
dad, Maury.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.610
Her mom, Geenie is inconsolable and Zach doesn't
know what to do with himself when he's approached

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.060
by Mr. Levin.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.950
They return home after the funeral, where
his brother Kyle, the security guard for their

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.340
gated community, asks him some inappropriate
things.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.430
In the following days, Zach's mental health
declines as he mourns for Beth, culminating

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.690
with him going to the Slocum's, just as their
housekeeper Pearline gets out of there.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.860
When he enters the house, he sees Geenie boxing
up Beth's things and later he plays chess

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.219
with her dad until 3 am.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.579
Maury gets a box with "cigarettes" which they
smoke together and have an honest talk about

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.059
Beth when Zach tells her dad that before she
died they had some problems in their relationship,

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.860
but Maury says that he has to let that go
and remember her for the good things.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.270
Beth's parents are really nice to him and
her mom gives him Beth's scarf before he leaves.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.310
Zach comes back the next day, but he doesn't
find the Slocum's at home and when he returns

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.560
home, his family thinks that he's acting strange
and that he should see a neurologist.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.819
The day after, Zach goes to see Beth's parents
again.

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:26.850
He can hear music and talking inside, but
no one answers the door for him so he decides

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.499
to check out the house.

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:32.420
When he gets to the back of the house he sees
Beth inside and he freaks out, calling for

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.880
her and banging on every window and eventually
the front door.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.380
Kyle suddenly arrives at the house and tells
him that he shouldn't be there, disturbing

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.289
their peace, so he escorts his brother in
his car out of the property.

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.259
Zach comes back to the Slocum's that night,
sneaking to the house and breaking in, only

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.889
to run into Maury who tells him to leave,
blocking his way in.

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:54.060
He thinks that Beth isn't dead and that it
was all some kind of game being played on

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.060
him.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.919
Zach pushes Maury away and finds Geenie trying
to put Beth in the closet.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:02.700
They all begin to argue and no one can explain
it to Zach without letting Beth know that

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.179
she died so the parents act like nothing has
happened while Zach thinks that she faked

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.289
her death.

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.899
Beth is confused and has trouble remembering
what has happened even before she died while

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.950
Zach gets angry and leaves.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.790
When he comes home he tells his parents that
Beth's death was a big hoax, so the next day

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.610
his mom takes him to get a test in a hospital.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.080
After a while, Zach visits Beth's grave only
to find a massive dug-out hole in it.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.700
He goes back to Beth's and asks Maury about
it so he finally tells Zach that she died

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.120
and returned from the dead, but that he doesn't
care why because he has his daughter back.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.740
Zach still has a problem believing that it's
not a grift and that Beth just dug herself

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.770
out of the grave and came back home like a
zombie, when Geenie joins them and says that

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.940
it's a miracle and she's resurrected like
in the Old Testament.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.190
Beth joins them too and kisses Zach like everything
is normal, then drags him up to the attic,

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.570
even though he's reluctant to go up with her.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.280
When they get there, Zach and Beth have an
awkward conversation with him scared as heck,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.950
and Beth is confused as to why everyone is
acting strange around her.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.260
Beth doesn't remember anything, not even hiking
alone or breaking up with Zach, she believes

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.420
that she has a test the next day and is really
worried about it.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.960
Zach makes her upset with his questions so
he calms her down by telling her that she's

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.150
the only person he can think about.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.250
They tell each other that they love each other
and decide to leave the house so they can

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.310
make love away from her parents.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.900
Beth's parents wait for them downstairs and
don't like the idea of the two of them going

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.520
outside in broad daylight so they suggest
they go out at night and spend the day with

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.520
them instead.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.410
However, when night comes the parents still
don't like them going outside of the house

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.930
and make them stay there to swim in their
pool.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.160
Later, Beth waits for Zach at the pool, telling
him she's worried about the test so he sits

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.220
down next to her and sees the bite wound on
her thigh.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.930
He asks her if she wants to eat him, but Beth
misunderstands and tells him not with her

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.480
parents around.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.380
She instantly forgets what she was talking
about then jumps into the pool.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.160
The next day, Zach talks to her on the phone
in a lovey-dovey way, then he goes to talk

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160
to Kyle who's cleaning his gun.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.130
He apologizes to his brother and tells him
that Beth is alive, but Kyle still doesn't

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.130
believe him.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.290
Zach goes to the kitchen, where his parents
are having breakfast, happy that he's looking

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.960
better, but suspicious about his behavior.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.590
When he leaves the house to go back to Beth's,
Zach has a weird encounter with their old

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.209
mailman, who he hasn't seen in a while.

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.020
At the Slocum's Beth's behavior is getting
increasingly weird and Zach tells Maury that

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.599
they should tell Beth that she died, however,
her father doesn't think that they should

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:20.509
do it because she'll just get confused and
upset.

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:25.229
Maury makes Zach promise not to say anything
if he still wants to see Beth, so he agrees.

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.449
Beth wants to go for a hike with Zach and
even though Maury doesn't think it's a good

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.030
idea, he still lets the kids leave.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.150
In the car, Beth starts touching Zach, so
they stop at a playground and make love on

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.990
the sand in broad daylight.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.759
They lie in the sun, so when they come back
to her home her parents notice a huge burn

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.969
on her cheek and freak out about it.

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:46.650
Maury scolds them and says that it's the final
time they go out while Geenie tries calming

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.720
the situation saying they'll just put some
makeup on it, making the dad angry because

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.319
she's not on his side.

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.189
Zach returns to the conversation about telling
her and Beth scares them for a sec when she

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:59.510
says that she knows, only she's talking about
her test.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.650
They act like that's the reason they've argued
and Zach leaves.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.779
Maury confronts Zach again before he goes
and tells him that he can't come back anymore.

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:10.689
Nevertheless, Zach comes back that night and
sneaks to the house, getting Beth out of the

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:12.150
house secretly.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.350
She falls from the roof, but she's fine, then
Zach takes Beth to the beach, where he has

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.960
a surprise for her.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.889
Zach plays a song he wrote for Beth with the
lyrics saying what actually happened to her,

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.419
she doesn't like the music so she begins to
yell at him and freaking out.

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.139
Beth asks him what he's doing to her and rips
apart the entire lifeguard tower.

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.889
Zach can't calm her down as Beth gets progressively
more confused, feeling really strange and

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.809
sick, while the tower begins to flame behind
her.

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:40.249
She tells him to help her and he takes her
screaming back to the car, but when they get

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:44.270
there her behavior just gets weirder breaking
the window in one moment, asking what happened

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.580
to it in the next when he gets into the car.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.860
The only thing to calm Beth down seems to
be smooth jazz she finds on the radio.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.509
Zach gets her home and she tells him that
she really likes the music, then kisses him

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.090
and he takes her back to the attic by climbing
the wall.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.699
There, Beth puts on smooth jazz on her boombox
and begins to undress when Zach notices that

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:03.590
her walls are covered with mud.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.430
Beth begins to undress him too and throws
him on the floor, but Zach sees her autopsy

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.400
scar and is put off by her violent behavior
so he bolts out of there as fast as he can.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.189
As he leaves, she pops out of the roof and
asks him where he's going, he lies to her

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:17.520
and runs away.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.759
Later, Zach's in a diner and asks the waiter
to change the smooth jazz they have playing

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:24.009
when Erica shows up and greets him.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.960
It takes Zach a moment to remember her because
she's the daughter of one of his mom's friends,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.490
but when he does Zach asks Erica to join him.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.729
Erica sits down and they have a nice lunch
date and conversation about Beth.

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:38.659
Zach says that he almost wished she stayed
dead, scaring Erica a bit.

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:42.650
While they talk, one of the cooks in the diner
acts strangely and Zach asks Erica if she's

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.360
noticed more people behaving like that lately.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.110
She hasn't, so they continue talking about
Beth and Erica tells him that he needs to

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.869
move on like she had to when her grandmother
died.

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:55.580
Zach gets the check and leaves but when he
gets into his car, he doesn't see Beth running

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.600
toward him and slams into her.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.089
When Zach gets out of the car, he sees that
she's trapped under the wheel so he moves

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:02.259
the car.

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:05.969
Beth gets up like nothing even happened and
scares the people that have gathered.

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:09.939
They argue for a bit, when Erica comes out
of the diner and calls to him, getting Beth

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:10.939
angry.

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:15.360
Zach introduces them and when Erica hears
her name, she asks if there's another Beth,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.000
getting her even angrier.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.189
She acts chummy toward Zach, so Beth grabs
her until he has to pull them apart.

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:25.389
Beth asks him to tell her what's going on,
so Zach actually takes her to her grave, telling

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:28.210
her that she died a week ago and dug herself
up.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.349
She thinks that's impossible and that her
parents would have told her.

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:35.490
Beth asks how she can be both dead and alive,
so Zach tells her that her parents think she

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.199
might be resurrected or possibly a zombie.

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:42.610
He tells her that he can't be with her anymore
because he's scared, so she gets extra angry,

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.840
pushes him over, and steals his car.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.069
Zach gets to his house later that night and
hears gunshots from inside.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:53.740
He walks in, to Kyle freaking out and pointing
a gun at their dead grandfather, who has also

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.740
returned.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.310
His parents try to calm him, but he keeps
pointing the gun around, confused and scared.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.810
Zach tells them that all of it is real, but
that he's not one of them.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.330
The grandpa wants to go to the attic and Zach
tells them to let him go because they love

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.009
attics as Beth does.

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:11.460
His parents and brother are losing it when
the doorbell rings and two other returnees

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.990
walk inside, possibly the previous owners
of the house.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.749
Zach tells them that they need to get out
of there and Kyle shoots one of the returnees,

00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:20.539
with no impact on his "wellbeing".

00:08:20.539 --> 00:08:24.629
Police sirens can be heard outside as his
family watches a returned newscaster on the

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:29.169
TV and his dad comments that they finally
stopped the emergency broadcast.

00:08:29.169 --> 00:08:32.880
Maury calls Zach and tells him that he's waiting
for him outside and before he leaves the power

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.090
goes out.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.430
He tells Zach to get in the car because he
needs him to tell Beth that she isn’t dead

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:41.200
and that it's his fault for everything that's
happening for breaking his promise.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.100
Zach thinks that Pearline can fix everything
because she's from Haiti, where they make

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.410
zombies, and makes Maury give him her address,
but not before he talks to Beth.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.330
Maury gets them to the house, where Zach sees
his crashed car and as soon as they walk in,

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.910
Beth shows up and walks through the window,
hunting someone down outside and eating them

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.560
like a proper zombie.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.280
Geenie runs in when Beth comes back as well
and they ask her what she did.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.660
Beth's senses have deteriorated significantly
since last Zach had seen her, but Maury still

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.090
wants him to tell her that they'll be together
forever.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.740
Zach asks Maury for Pearline's address, but
Geenie gets it for him, so Zach runs back

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.630
out and gets in his car.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.870
Beth follows him out and gets in the car with
him when he drives off.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.720
They argue about the guy she ate and she asks
him what he expected since she is a zombie

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.770
and zombies eat guys, then turns on the radio
to play smooth jazz.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.470
When they arrive at Pearline's, he leaves
her in the car and goes to talk to the Haitian

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.470
woman.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.770
Unfortunately, she's not there anymore as
her cousin tells Zach.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:38.380
Her cousin can't believe that Zach thinks
she had anything to do with the zombies, just

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.800
because she's Haitian, and tells him that
she quit her job with the Slocum's because

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.920
Maury made an advance on her.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.350
Before he returns to the car he runs into
another zombie and Maury arrives to get Beth.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.890
He knocks Zach out with his shotgun and takes
Beth back home.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.050
The following morning, Zach wakes up with
a zombie standing over him, gets in the car,

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.840
and returns to his home.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.230
There he discovers a pile of burned bodies
and thinks that it's his parents and brother.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:06.240
Zack quickly packs a bag and leaves the house,
then goes to a store when he hears shooting

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.260
outside.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.250
He gets all the canned food he can find, then
drives back to Beth's house to get her.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.890
Zach finds Maury's car splattered in blood
and the house a complete mess.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.620
He follows Geenie's voice to the kitchen where
she feeds a restrained Beth part of her hand

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.880
and tells Zach that Beth ate Maury.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.630
Zach dresses her wound and tells her that
everything is going to be okay.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.240
Left alone with Beth they argue a bit but
Zach makes her understand that he does want

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.470
to be with her and says that they should just
go on a hike together.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.880
Beth asks him if he's afraid of her and he
says that she's all he has but tells her not

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.070
to eat him.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.350
She gets up and they are about to leave when
Kyle shows up in front of the house ready

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.590
to shoot her.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.760
Zach stops him and asks about the burned bodies,
but tells him that his parents are alive and

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.080
at the Levins'.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.110
Kyle apologizes for not believing him about
Beth and says that he's a part of the resistance

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:54.880
against the zombies now when Beth freed herself,
prompting him to want to shoot her again.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.810
Zach convinces Kyle to let him take her for
a hike, so his brother gives him the gun and

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.190
tells him to shoot her in the head and end
her suffering, then meet him at the Levins'

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.500
by 16 hundred.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.640
Later, Zach and Beth are on a hike and they
stop to enjoy the landscape.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.010
He knows what he should do and he tries to
say goodbye to her, thanking her for coming

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.220
back and giving him a second chance.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.440
Zach takes the gun out and tells her that
he'll always love her and when she says it

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.310
back and turns back around he shoots her in
the head.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:20.980
Her body topples into the ravine.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:25.210
Later, Zach gets to the Levins', finding the
place all boarded up.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:29.050
Mr. Levin opens the door for him and his parents
run over to see him.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:33.030
They show him that Erica is alive, traumatized,
but okay.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.490
Zach tells Kyle that he killed zombie Beth
then he tells everyone that they need to get

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:37.490
to safety.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:41.280
Suddenly, the power comes back on and the
news reports say that everything has come

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.810
back to normal.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.910
After a while, Zach says goodbye to Beth and
Maury at their graves, then gets into the

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.910
car with his parents and Erica.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.430
He asks her out on a date and Erica accepts
Zach's advances.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:58.580
They drive out of the graveyard smiling.
