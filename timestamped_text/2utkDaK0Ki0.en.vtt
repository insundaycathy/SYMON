00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.680
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.&nbsp;
Today I will show you an action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.200
horror film from 2019, titled Escape Room.
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.280
The interior of a cozy, old-timey room can be&nbsp;
seen. Suddenly, someone drops from the roof and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.360
runs toward a wall with a 10 number puzzle,&nbsp;
requiring a 4 digit code to get through.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.440
One of the walls starts moving in toward&nbsp;
him and he panics as he looks for clues.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.800
He thinks he's found it in a book, but then he&nbsp;
falls on the ground. He interprets the clue on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.600
4 paintings in the room, but the wall is coming&nbsp;
closer. The code he enters doesn't work so he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.640
starts panicking even more, screaming that there's&nbsp;
no way out. His leg gets crushed by the wall.&nbsp;

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.240
Three days earlier, Zoey can be seen walking&nbsp;
to school. She's in class when the professor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.560
asks about the quantum zeno effect. She's&nbsp;
written down the answer in her notebook,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.680
but struggles to get her hand up to answer. The&nbsp;
bell rings and the professor dismisses the class,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.240
but calls Zoey over to talk to her. He tells&nbsp;
her that her paper was great and he tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.640
help her get out of her shell, by asking her&nbsp;
to do one thing that scares her over the break.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.600
A motorcycle arrives in a business area, then&nbsp;
we see Jason talking on the phone in his office,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.720
closing a business deal. His assistant tells&nbsp;
him he has another call, which Jason thinks is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.000
about a client giving him a gift. He's right and&nbsp;
feels great about it. Ben is labeling groceries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.880
in the back of a store, when his boss comes&nbsp;
in. He asks him for a new job position, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.520
he doesn't want to give it to him. His boss tells&nbsp;
him to stop drinking if he wants to move forward.&nbsp;

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.240
Back at Jason's office, a gift arrives&nbsp;
for him in the form of a black box,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.280
that looks like it can't be easily opened.&nbsp;
Jason thinks his client sent it to him. Zoey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.000
goes back to her room and talks to her roommate,&nbsp;
who isn't impressed by her nerdy rant and leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.840
She's anxious and trying to calm herself, when it&nbsp;
looks like her mirror is shaking. She experiences&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.480
something like airplane turbulence, when suddenly&nbsp;
she wakes from a nightmare, her roommate asking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.200
if she's ok. Before Zoey's roommate leaves for&nbsp;
the holidays she finds a package in front of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.760
their room addressed to her and gives it to her,&nbsp;
saying it's from her professor. The same black&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.360
box is in her package too. Ben gets to work early&nbsp;
and sees one of the black boxes waiting for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.920
He tries to open it, by hitting it and throwing&nbsp;
it, when it suddenly opens by itself and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.600
continues the process. Meanwhile, Zoey also tries&nbsp;
to open the box and she figures it out quite fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.840
Simultaneously, Jason watches YouTube&nbsp;
videos to help him open the box.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.720
The three of them succeed in opening the&nbsp;
box when a piece of paper comes out of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.880
It's a voucher for a Minos Escape room, which&nbsp;
if escaped would win them 10 thousand dollars.&nbsp;

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.200
The next day, Ben is waiting in front of the Minos&nbsp;
building, smoking, when a car parks behind him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.640
Amanda comes out and they have a small exchange,&nbsp;
when she eyes him about smoking. She walks inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.200
and gives the guard her ID as well as her&nbsp;
phone. Before she walks into the elevator,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.480
he thanks her for her service in the army. Danny&nbsp;
walks into the elevator with her, last minute. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.760
takes out a phone which he has sneaked in. Amanda&nbsp;
walks into the waiting room first, where Mike,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.880
Jason and Zoey are already sitting. She goes to&nbsp;
the reception desk, but the rest tell her not to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.720
bother. Danny walks in second to her, as Mike is&nbsp;
ranting about a childhood pet with heterochromia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.760
Jason and Danny have an exchange about the scar&nbsp;
on Jason's hand, and Amanda asks Zoey if they know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.440
each other, because she seems familiar to her. Ben&nbsp;
walks in last and greets everyone. Amanda reads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.040
a newspaper about a fire and gets anxious. Danny&nbsp;
tells the rest that he has been to 93 escape rooms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.240
before. Jason messes with him about that, but Mike&nbsp;
tells Danny that his nephew is just like him and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.880
that he was the one that suggested he tries the&nbsp;
Minos Room. Amanda says she's only there for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.480
money. Danny explains to the rest how the Rooms&nbsp;
usually work and Zoey asks how the game starts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.080
He tells her that they have to wait for the&nbsp;
Games Master to take them to the Escape Room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.200
Ben stands up to smoke another cigarette, but&nbsp;
the door knob breaks off when he touches it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.840
Mike goes over to try and fix it, but Danny&nbsp;
thinks that they already are in the Escape Room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.960
He comes over to the door and sees the oven dial.&nbsp;
He says that it's probably a combination lock,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.640
so he tells everyone to look for clues. Everyone&nbsp;
searches around the room. Zoey sees a mug with an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.080
airplane and Amanda finds the name Dr Wootan Yu,&nbsp;
thinking it might be a clue. Mike picks up a copy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.560
of Fahrenheit 451 and finds a screwdriver hidden&nbsp;
inside of it. Zoey thinks that 451 might be the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.480
combination to the lock and inputs it in the door.&nbsp;
Suddenly, the celling starts glaring red. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.480
realize it's actually throwing off heat too. Zoey&nbsp;
tries to turn off the dial, but it's stuck. Danny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.680
says that they can ask for a hint, so Amanda goes&nbsp;
to ask at the reception. Jason finds a globe with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.400
a boat, which throws him off for a second, but&nbsp;
then sees the lock on the window. Ben wants to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.480
break the window with a fire extinguisher, but&nbsp;
when he sees that it's fake he throws it away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.000
The four columns in the room start heating up&nbsp;
too. Everyone is freaking out, except Danny and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.640
Zoey finds a key in the extinguisher. She opens&nbsp;
the window and they see that the receptionist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.920
is actually a manikin. Suddenly, the phone&nbsp;
rings and they all expect Jason to pick up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.560
The message is automated, saying they should&nbsp;
follow the rules. When he drops the phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.440
the window shutters go up and more heaters appear.&nbsp;
Zoey and Amanda go to get some water because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.360
Amanda is having an anxiety attack. Zoey sees the&nbsp;
burns on her neck. The men are looking for clues,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.480
but have no idea what to do as the room is getting&nbsp;
hotter. Zoey sees another clue about the coasters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.400
on the table, she runs over to it and presses&nbsp;
one of them which opens an exit in the ducts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.760
The exit opens a little, so they all have to press&nbsp;
the coasters simultaneously to open it completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.720
Jason goes in the duct and finds a way out.&nbsp;
He needs the screwdriver that Mike has,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.080
so Amanda switches places with him and lets him&nbsp;
through. Jason opens the other exit. The others&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.960
send Amanda next through the vent, while they hold&nbsp;
the coasters with both hands. Zoey gets another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.840
idea about the puzzle. She fills a glass of water&nbsp;
and places it on the coaster, pressing it down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.200
Meanwhile, Amanda panics as she's crawling&nbsp;
through the duct. She has a flashback from her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.840
time in Afghanistan. Zoey hears her scream&nbsp;
and the rest tell her to go after Amanda.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.960
Danny and Ben fill the glasses with water, but&nbsp;
they're half a glass short. They argue and a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.080
burner comes down in the room. Ben pours his&nbsp;
liquor in the glass and the exit opens. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.800
escape in the last second as the room burns. They&nbsp;
jump through the fireplace into the next room.&nbsp;

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.840
Danny is still excited thinking all of it is&nbsp;
still a safe game, but Amanda thinks that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.800
was all real and wants to get out. Jason finds&nbsp;
another lock and Danny tries to convince Amanda&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.160
not to call the police. He still gives her the&nbsp;
phone, but there's no signal. Meanwhile Zoey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.480
and Jason are looking for clues and he finds&nbsp;
the first key to one of the locks on the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.880
Then he finds the second lock on the&nbsp;
door, which needs a 7 letter word to open.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.040
They all try to figure out the words,&nbsp;
when Ben sees animal skulls on the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.040
He has a flashback in which he's driving drunk&nbsp;
with his friends and sings Christmas songs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.320
He tells the others to try with Rudolph and&nbsp;
it works. Jason opens the door and they start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.120
walking outside of the house, but Zoey and Ben&nbsp;
stay back. When the two of them exit the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.840
and it locks behind them. The next room looks&nbsp;
like it's actually outside and it's really cold.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.280
Danny hits his head on the walls of the room,&nbsp;
which are giant monitors. He falls on the ice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.280
and it sounds like it's cracking. Danny&nbsp;
is still convinced that the room is safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.080
Freezing air starts shooting through the vents.&nbsp;
He tells the rest to look for clues again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.760
Jason is the one to find the door. Zoey sees the&nbsp;
phrase "true north is a lie" etched on a sled.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.760
Simultaneously, Mike finds a fishing rod on a tree&nbsp;
and Ben is trying to light a cigarette. Amanda&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.640
finds one coat and says that they'll share it,&nbsp;
then gives it to Zoey. Ben falls into a fishing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.440
hole and Danny says that there might be a clue in&nbsp;
the water. Suddenly Mike brings over the fishing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.080
rod. While the rest of them are trying to figure&nbsp;
out the puzzle, Zoey finds a compass in the coat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.800
pocket. She follows it north, but remembers what&nbsp;
she read on the sled and goes the other way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.840
Zoey finds another clue in the mouth of a stuffed&nbsp;
bear and comes back to the group as Ben walks off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.480
to smoke his cigarette away from them. Zoey&nbsp;
attaches the clue, which is a magnet, to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:00.400
fishing line and Mike drops it inside again. Jason&nbsp;
asks for the coat. Mike gets something on the rod,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.080
but it's really heavy. They pull out&nbsp;
a frozen cube with the key inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.360
Jason asks for Ben's lighter and he throws it at&nbsp;
them, prompting Danny to get it. When he gets the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.320
lighter and turns around, he falls into the water&nbsp;
and under the ice. The others see him and try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.760
break the ice to get him. Eventually they loose&nbsp;
sight of him and he drowns. Jason gives Amanda the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.880
coat, saying she was right that the game is real.&nbsp;
Mike and the group attack Ben, thinking that it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.000
his fault that Danny fell. They think he's the&nbsp;
Games Master. He starts insulting all of them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.560
but Jason stops him and tells them that it's&nbsp;
more important to survive. Then he tells them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.720
that they should use their body heat to get&nbsp;
the key out of the ice. The temperature drops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.000
in the room. Jason has a flashback of himself&nbsp;
on a boat with his friend wearing a red coat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.560
Mike faints, but Jason gets they key out.&nbsp;
They find the door and it opens behind them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.240
As they start moving toward it, the ice breaks&nbsp;
and they jump inside in the last moment again.&nbsp;

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.440
The next room is a bar where everything is upside&nbsp;
down. The room starts moving up and when it stops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.640
the phone rings. Mike walks under the phone and it&nbsp;
drops in his hand. There's a deafening noise and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.520
then music starts playing. Jason sees the door&nbsp;
to the other room, but it's missing a doorknob.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.480
Mike notices the eight ball from the pool table&nbsp;
missing and starts moving to look for clues, when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.280
the noise reappears and Ben stops him from falling&nbsp;
over because a piece of the floor falls off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.640
Amanda climbs the bar and finds a lock box with&nbsp;
four numbers. Zoey finds a sliding puzzle on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.280
adjacent wall and climbs over the hole to it.&nbsp;
Mike climbs over to her side too and helps her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:35.040
up. As she's solving the puzzle, another part of&nbsp;
the floor falls off, almost taking Jason with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.520
Ben jumps over to the puzzle side and Zoey&nbsp;
finally solves it. They figure out how to read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.240
it and get a four digit code, but it doesn't&nbsp;
work when Amanda inputs it in the lockbox.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.560
Another part of the floor falls and Mike and&nbsp;
Ben grab on to the puzzle, but they're too heavy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.600
for it and it starts tipping over. Mike is too&nbsp;
afraid to climb off, so Zoey does it and falls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.400
on the floor, hitting her head. They all call&nbsp;
to her to get up, when she has a flashback of an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:04.160
airplane accident she was in, calling to her mom.&nbsp;
Jason wakes her up and gets her back on the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.040
Zoey tells Amanda to try the code in reverse&nbsp;
and it works. She finds the doorknob inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.640
lockbox. Another part of the floor falls off.&nbsp;
Amanda jumps over to the pool table trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:20.080
get to the other side, but drops the knob on the&nbsp;
last part of the floor. As she drops down as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.880
the noise starts again so she throws the knob to&nbsp;
Jason and grabs onto the phone, swinging over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:31.040
hole. She slips and falls. Jason opens the door&nbsp;
and Mike follows him. Ben gets Zoey to go into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.080
the other room and stays with her to calm her.
The next room looks like a hospital. They all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.760
begin looking through it, when they realize&nbsp;
all of the hospital beds look familiar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.400
Those are their beds when they were in the&nbsp;
hospital. Zoey checks one of the other beds and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.920
sees that it's Amanda's. She was the sole survivor&nbsp;
in an explosion. Zoey tells her own story as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.680
She was the sole survivor of a plane crash. Jason&nbsp;
was the sole survivor of a boating accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.520
His story is that his friend lost his mind because&nbsp;
of hypothermia and swam off. Ben shares that he as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.240
well was the only survivor in a car crash and&nbsp;
Mike the only survivor in a mining accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.800
He has a flashback of the mine, as he tells&nbsp;
them that his brother died in that accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.280
They start connecting all of their accidents&nbsp;
to everything that was in the rooms. Zoey finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.320
Danny's documents, he was a sole survivor in an&nbsp;
accident as well. She thinks that the game is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.600
one of survival, to see who is the luckiest of&nbsp;
the lucky. The TV starts playing and it shows a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.080
countdown to get out of the room. The three men&nbsp;
start looking for ways to get out of the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.520
They find ex-rays as clues, which Ben figures&nbsp;
out are actually sign language and they mean EKG.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.320
Zoey starts smashing the cameras, thinking that&nbsp;
if they keep watching them, the group won't be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.200
able to win. Jason finds the poison that will be&nbsp;
released in the room when the countdown stops,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.040
then finds the EKG machine, saying that&nbsp;
the right heartbeat will open the doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.080
First he tries with Ben's heart rate, but when&nbsp;
it doesn't work, he convinces Mike to try it as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.280
well. His heart rate is high, but not high&nbsp;
enough. Jason wants to shock him to get his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.760
heart rate higher and manages to convince&nbsp;
him to do that too. He gets his rate up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.720
but ends up killing him. Ben is trying to revive&nbsp;
Mike, as the poison starts filling the room and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.720
Zoey is still breaking the cameras. Jason attaches&nbsp;
the EKG to himself and gets his rate low enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:20.160
The door opens. Jason goes out, but Zoey&nbsp;
doesn't want to go. Ben follows Jason out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.960
through the vents and the door closes. Zoey is&nbsp;
suffocating and crawling toward an oxygen mask.&nbsp;

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.080
Jason and Ben make it to the other room and&nbsp;
they start arguing. Ben accuses him that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.960
not only killed Mike, but his friend on the&nbsp;
boat as well. Jason tells him that surviving is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.160
a choice and continues to look for clues, finding&nbsp;
a hatch. They both grab on the hatch and open it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.960
Suddenly, they start hallucinating. There&nbsp;
was poison on the handle and the puzzle on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.680
the hatch tells them to find an antidote. Ben&nbsp;
finds the antidote, but there's only one dose.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.800
Jason jumps him and they fight for it. Ben ends&nbsp;
up killing Jason and injects himself with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.680
antidote. Ben jumps into the other room. It's&nbsp;
the same one from the beginning of the film.&nbsp;

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.560
Meanwhile, the cleaning crew walks inside the&nbsp;
hospital room and they think they've found two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.120
bodies. They find the oxygen mask hanging&nbsp;
from the celling, when suddenly Zoey wakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.960
up and knocks them both over. She grabs a&nbsp;
gun from one of them and leaves the room.&nbsp;

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.800
Simultaneously, Ben is at the other room,&nbsp;
after he's messed up the code. He gets into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.520
the fireplace as the wall closes in and manages&nbsp;
to escape the room. When he walks inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.960
a disembodied voice starts talking to him, telling&nbsp;
him that his money were on Jason. The Games Master&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:34.160
appears telling him that he's won. Ben antagonizes&nbsp;
him, but he just starts explaining what the point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.880
of the game is. The customers of the game are&nbsp;
actually the most powerful people on the planet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.600
and they want entertainment with real stakes. The&nbsp;
man tells Ben that he didn't think it was possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.640
for him to win as he gives him a cigarette. Then&nbsp;
he tries to kill him, but Ben suddenly stabs him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.280
with the piece of wood that was stuck in his leg.&nbsp;
The monitor shows that Zoey and the man are both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:58.160
still in play, then she comes out shooting at&nbsp;
him. The man tackles her and almost kills her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.240
when Ben knocks him over and then shoots him.&nbsp;
The both of them walk out of the building.&nbsp;

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:09.200
One day later, Ben is in the hospital and is in a&nbsp;
stable state. Zoey is seen sitting by his side. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.760
detective comes in the room and asks her to come&nbsp;
with him. He takes her to the Minos building,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.920
which is surrounded by officers. When&nbsp;
they walk inside, nothing of the rooms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.240
remain. The detective doesn't believe what&nbsp;
she's telling him about the escape rooms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.280
because they haven't found any evidence. She sees&nbsp;
the words "no way out" and realizes that it's an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.840
anagram for "dr wootan yu". But the detective&nbsp;
doesn't care and tells her they need to leave.&nbsp;

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.920
Six months later, Ben and Zoey are having coffee.&nbsp;
She shows him a file she's put together about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.760
rest of their group and how their deaths&nbsp;
were made to look like accidents. He tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.160
her that she needs to let it go, but she continues&nbsp;
explaining what she has found out about the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.600
Zoey had deciphered the logo and found out that&nbsp;
it was the coordinates to a building in Manhattan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.920
She's even bought the two of them plane tickets&nbsp;
to get there. Ben doesn't like her plan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.760
but ultimately agrees to go with her.
A plane whooshes through the air with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:05.520
one engine on fire. A stewardess is looking for a&nbsp;
clue and finds it in a bag. The tool doesn't open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:11.040
the cockpit door, but opens to another riddle. As&nbsp;
the two stewards try to figure it out, a third one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.160
tells the passenger to brace for impact. The other&nbsp;
two figure out the code and go inside the cockpit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.800
only to find the pilots dead. The stewardess&nbsp;
tries to pilot the plane, but it crashes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.840
Suddenly, two people appear and it becomes&nbsp;
obvious that the plane accident was a simulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.960
A disembodied voice tells one of the people from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.880
the simulation that Zoey's and Ben's tickets&nbsp;
were intercepted and that the game continues.
