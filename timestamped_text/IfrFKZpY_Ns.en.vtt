00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.070
Welcome Back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.180
Today I will show you a horror film from 2013,
based on a true story, titled The Conjuring.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.220
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.150
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.849
Annabelle is a doll connected to a demonic
spirit, lying to two girls that it's possessed

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.639
by a 7 year old girl.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.100
The Warrens are interviewing them for their
archives and to find out more about the problem

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.100
with Annabelle.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.530
They tell them that the doll didn't do much
at first, but then started moving around from

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.000
room to room.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.640
One day it left a note for them, which scared
them enough to throw her away.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.250
Unfortunately, it came back to their apartment
in the middle of the night.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.210
So they called the Warrens to help them.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.660
The two of them are seen showing the footage
from the interview at a seminar.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.440
They take questions from the audience and
a man asks them what they call themselves.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.860
The husband says that they are demonologists,
paranormal researches, ghost-hunters and the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.430
wife tells the audience that they prefer to
be called Ed and Lorraine.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.510
They've dealt with thousands of cases over
their carriers, but the one you are going

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.300
to see today is so malevolent, they've kept
it locked away until now.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.070
The year is 1971, the place - Harrisville
in Rhode Island.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.190
A family arrives in their new home.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.909
The young ones are more excited than the eldest
daughter.

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.730
Roger and Carolyn think her behavior is just
part of being the first child.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.580
Their dog is probably least excited about
the new house, since it refuses to even enter

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.580
it.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.930
Later, the family is seen moving their things
inside the house and unpacking them slowly.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.900
Cindy takes a wind chime up to their porch
and calls out to April to come back inside.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.330
April wants to show her the music box that
she's found in the yard.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.660
That night the girls are playing hide and
clap in the house.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.680
Two of them run off, leaving Christine to
search for them blindfolded.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.090
They clap their hands so that she can find
them.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.880
She asks for a second clap.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.220
Cindy cheats and doesn't clap, so Christine
enters the closet and finds Nancy, who manages

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.670
to break something.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.460
When Roger comes inside to check what it was,
he finds a boarded up cellar.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.080
He lights a match and goes down the long stairway.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.390
He finds a lot of old stuff in the cellar
and when he comes back he tells the girls

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.120
not to go down there.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.130
The next morning, Carolyn wakes up and walks
though the house greeting the kids.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.180
Andrea tells her that there was an awful smell
in her room.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.600
She walks downstairs and sees that the clock
has stopped at 3.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.479
Carolyn finds Roger in the cellar, setting
up a light.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.520
She has no idea what they'll do with the stuff
that's in there.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.519
He thinks that there might be some antiques
worth a lot of money.

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.599
Roger stays down there to get the furnace
working and Carolyn goes to make coffee.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.079
Another clock can be seen stopped at the same
time.

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.310
April looks for their dog so she tells her
to search outside.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.279
In a few moments, the parents hear April scream
outside and run over to her.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.709
They find the dog dead.

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.120
Meanwhile, Ed shows a reporter inside the
room with their collection of things that

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.540
have been taken from cases they have worked
on.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.209
The reporter asks him if it's safe to have
it all there than to have it destroyed, but

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.379
Ed tells him that sometimes it's better to
keep those things in one piece so they can

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.530
contain what might be inside of them.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.510
He wants to see the Annabelle doll and Ed
takes him to her.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.790
What stops the entities attached to the things
from latching onto them, the reporter asks.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.069
Ed says that they have to take great precautions.

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.290
Suddenly, there's a crack in the room.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.159
Ed finds that his daughter Judy has sneaked
in.

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.760
He scolds her, reminding her that she is forbidden
to go inside the room.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.719
Later, the girl is with Lorraine and Ed walks
in to bring her some coffee.

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.680
They send Judy down for dinner and talk about
the reporter.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.879
Lorraine can see that Ed is thinking about
an incident that happened a while ago and

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.809
tells him no to blame himself about it anymore.

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:17.579
Back at the farmhouse, the girls are sleeping
in their rooms and Christine feels like someone

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.079
is grabbing her foot.

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.830
Roger wakes up at his desk.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.590
He hears something in the house and follows
it to the kitchen.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.499
The window is open so it looks like it was
just the draft.

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.970
He hears something on the second floor and
finds Andrea on the stairs, who tells him

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.609
that Cindy is in her room, sleepwalking.

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.099
They see the girl banging her head on the
wardrobe.

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.269
They don't wake her and take her back to bed.

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.010
The next day, Roger tells Carolyn about it
and she's worried about what they can do about

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.329
the sleepwalking.

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.620
He notices that she has another bruise on
her, but she has no idea where she got it.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.459
He tells her to see a doctor.

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.439
When Roger walks out of the door he hears
a bird slam into the house and die.

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.640
Carolyn sends the girls to school and checks
on April who is talking to someone in her

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.309
room that isn't there.

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:01.529
She says that she's talking to Rory, her new
friend, then gives her the music box she found

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.599
and tells her that to see him she has to play
the music box.

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.019
When the music stops, she'll see him in the
mirror standing behind her.

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.299
Carolyn gets really invested in the game and
thinks she sees something in the mirror and

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.829
when the music stops, April scares her.

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.209
She begs her mom to play hide and clap with
her.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.220
The mom counts down, then goes to look for
April.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.320
She hears the first clap and follows it.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.300
The clock chimes and she asks for the second
clap, getting to Andrea's room.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.260
She asks for April and the wardrobe door opens.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.380
Carolyn asks for the third clap and gets one
from the wardrobe.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.660
She goes toward it and can hear breathing,
but suddenly hears the girl running outside

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.760
of the room.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.040
April walks in and Carolyn is confused about
what just happened.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.460
That night, Roger comes home and he gest a
call for a job.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.700
They go to bed.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.510
Christine is sleeping when something grabs
her leg and drags her down the bed.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.630
She sees that her sister is sleeping in the
other bed and then peeks under her own bed.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.080
The bedroom door creeks and the girl sees
something next to it so she wakes her sister

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.900
and asks her if she sees the person behind
the door, looking right at them.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.870
Nancy goes to check, but still sees nothing,
while Christine tells her that it's standing

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.210
right behind her.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.260
Suddenly, the door slams and Christine screams,
prompting the parents to barge into the room.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.510
They ask what happened and she tells them,
but they see no one.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.860
She says that it talked to her, saying it
wants her family dead.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.350
Some time later, Carolyn can be seen taking
some supplements.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.590
She's covered in bruises.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.220
Then, she folds the laundry and hears clapping
in the house, thinking it's the girls.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.060
She goes to check on them, but all of them
are sleeping.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.950
When she checks on April, suddenly children’s
laughter can be heard and the photos all drop

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.400
from the walls.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.640
Carolyn goes downstairs and the clock chimes
3 times, while she looks around.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.830
She hears clapping again and goes to investigate,
when suddenly the piano in the basement starts

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.830
playing.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.360
Carolyn goes inside and tells whoever is down
there that she'll lock the door, then she

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.050
turns around and the door shuts in her face,
sending her hurling down the stairs.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.280
A ball falls from the neighboring wall and
when she climbs up the stairs, the light bulb

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.550
shatters.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.421
Carolyn strikes a match, when someone asks
her if she wants to play hide and clap, then

00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:00.950
claps next to her.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.250
In the meantime, Cindy is in Andrea's room
banging her head on the wardrobe again.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.680
Andrea gets her to the bed.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.180
Suddenly, the banging noise continues and
Andrea walks up to the wardrobe.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.520
Cindy wakes when Andrea opens the door.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.990
A creature appears on top of the wardrobe
and jumps on the girl.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.940
Roger comes home and hears screaming from
inside the house.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.500
He gets Carolyn out of the cellar and then
goes up to Andrea's room.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.250
She's screaming on the floor.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.080
The Warrens are giving another lecture on
demonic possession and exorcism.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.250
Ed says that he's not authorized to perform
exorcisms, but he's observed many.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.880
Next, he explains the stages of demonic activity:
infestation, oppression and possession.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.580
Carolyn attends the lecture, then she meets
with the Warrens outside asking them to come

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.120
to her house and investigate it, because she's
afraid for her daughters.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.200
Lorraine agrees.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.700
Later, the Warrens are seen arriving at the
farmhouse.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.530
Carolyn opens the door for them.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.000
Roger greets them, then they meet the kids.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.380
Carolyn explains that they all sleep in the
living room because the girls feel safer and

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.280
that the house is always cold.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.150
She tells them that there is an awful smell
like rotting meat that moves around the house.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.240
Ed explains that something like that could
mean demonic activity.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.389
He checks the locked door behind him and Roger
tells him that if they don't keep it like

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:13.410
that it will bang in sets of threes all night
until dawn.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.670
Ed says that might be meant as an insult to
the holy trinity.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.880
Carolyn also tells them that the clocks keep
stopping every night at 3 a.m.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.010
They even stopped hanging the photos up, because
something kept knocking them down.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.120
Carolyn tells them that the wardrobe was there
when they moved in and that the cellar has

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.100
many things that were there as well.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.220
Lorraine asks to see the cellar.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.100
Once there, she senses that something awful
happened there.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.900
Later, Ed sits down to interview the couple.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.280
He asks why they don't move out, but all of
their money are tied into the house and they

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.830
have nowhere to go.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.480
Ed records the interview, with Carolyn starting
to explain what had been happening in the

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.480
house.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.610
Lorraine talks to April about Rory.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.870
The girl says that he's always sad, probably
because something bad had happened to him.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.490
She gives Lorraine the box so she can see
Rory.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.700
The music plays as she looks at the mirror.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.280
Lorraine sees the boy.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.740
Then she walks out to the giant three next
to the lake and Ed joins her.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.530
She turns around and sees someone hanging
over Ed's head and she almost faints.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.710
Roger and Carolyn explain that they don't
know who lived there before.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.370
Ed and Lorraine tell them that their house
needs an exorcism, but that the entity has

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.180
already latched onto them.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.170
Lorraine has seen it and it was following
the family everywhere, feeding of them.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.650
She tells Carolyn and Roger that there are
a lot of spirits there, but that entity is

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.140
the worst one.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.130
Performing an exorcism is a complicated process
that takes a long time and requires a lot

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.450
of evidence which they will have to acquire.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:35.139
As the Warrens leave they tell Roger and Carolyn
to baptize their daughters for a little protection.

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:38.760
Ed tells them that they'll have someone research
the property to see what they're up against.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.719
Back home, Judy gives Lorraine a locket with
her picture in it and tells her that she misses

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:43.880
her and her dad.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.220
Later, Ed tells her that Carolyn's voice didn't
record and plays the tape for her.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.470
Lorraine then tells him what she learned about
the house and who built it in 1863.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.210
The man that built the house was married to
a woman named Bathsheba, related to a woman

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.839
hung for witchcraft.

00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:00.740
She sacrificed her child when it was 7 moths
old.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.240
Then she proclaimed her love for Satan, cursed
anyone that took her land and hung herself

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.410
on the tree.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.959
Her death was pronounced at 3 in the morning.

00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:11.329
Another woman that lived there had a child
named Rory who disappeared in the woods after

00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:13.399
which she killed herself in the cellar.

00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:16.999
Lorraine found more people that have died
or committed suicide on the property.

00:09:16.999 --> 00:09:20.040
Suddenly, the tape begins to play by itself.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.240
They hear a ghastly voice recorded on the
tape at 3 in the morning.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.110
The Warrens arrive at the house with Drew
and are joined there by officer Brad.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.500
They set up ghost-hunting equipment all over
the house.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.379
Ed, Roger and Drew set up a camera with a
thermostat switch at the three as well.

00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:38.139
Roger asks if they've ever caught anything
on film and Ed says that they have.

00:09:38.139 --> 00:09:41.779
He tells Roger about the witch that killed
herself right above where he's standing.

00:09:41.779 --> 00:09:44.000
Lorraine and Carolyn talk in the house.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.970
She tells her about what the witch had done
and that killing their baby was the way that

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.509
witches believed they would get closer to
Satan.

00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:52.399
Drew shows Andrea how an UV light works, then
Ed comes in.

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:57.660
A door creeks open and everyone is on standby,
when Brad comes out of the toilet.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.170
That night, Ed and Drew check the equipment.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.869
Then Ed puts crosses and holy water around
the house to piss off the entities.

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:06.779
Suddenly, the same door creeks open again.

00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:08.199
The camera snaps a photo.

00:10:08.199 --> 00:10:12.279
Ed gets the camera, then goes down to the
cellar with Lorraine and Brad.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:14.790
They ask for the entity to communicate with
them.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.269
Ed looks though and records the sounds of
the cellar.

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:20.519
Lorraine feels sick and says that there is
definitely something there.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:24.199
They leave the basement and suddenly the door
slams shut, scaring Brad.

00:10:24.199 --> 00:10:27.660
Drew makes fun of him about that later, but
he says he believes the clock which doesn't

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.600
stop at 3:07.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.420
The next day, everyone is having pancakes
for breakfast and Roger promises to take the

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.500
girls out for ice-cream later.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.129
Carolyn will stay and rest.

00:10:37.129 --> 00:10:40.369
She tells Ed that they all feel much safer
with him and his team around.

00:10:40.369 --> 00:10:44.220
Later, Lorraine and Ed enjoy the fresh air
and talk about the family.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.829
Lorraine really wants to help them.

00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:50.379
Suddenly, a storm begins to brew and the wind
moves one of the sheets Lorraine is folding,

00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:51.680
revealing an entity.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.889
She sees it in the house again, where Carolyn
is sleeping.

00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:58.420
Another bruise appears on her arm and the
malevolent entity shows up above her, vomiting

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.569
in her mouth.

00:10:59.569 --> 00:11:03.390
Lorraine goes after Carolyn, but she doesn't
open the bathroom door for her, then lies

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.930
that nothing happened.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.880
Roger and the girls come back to the farmhouse
and he sees Ed fixing his car.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.220
He thanks Ed, even though he was skeptical
when they first came.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.749
Ed says that he didn't want them to come because
every time Lorraine senses something it takes

00:11:15.749 --> 00:11:17.019
a toll on her.

00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:20.369
He tells him about the last case they worked
when she saw something that really disturbed

00:11:20.369 --> 00:11:21.369
her.

00:11:21.369 --> 00:11:25.029
When they came home she locked herself in
a room and didn't come out for 8 days.

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:27.750
She never told him what she saw and he'll
never ask.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.589
That night, everything is set up and they
begin the wait.

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:32.760
Brad goes to the kitchen to get more coffee.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.170
He thinks he sees something on the porch and
goes outside after he hears "look what she

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.480
made me do".

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.860
When he comes back he sees one of the ghosts
that killed themselves on the property, he

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.660
follows it and it attacks him.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.649
He screams for Ed and everyone flocks to his
position.

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:49.000
As he tells the others what he saw, Cindy
triggers a trap.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.040
Ed tells Roger not to touch her because she's
not alone.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.269
Cindy walks inside Andrea's room and the door
slams shut.

00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:58.029
Drew checks the audio and hears someone in
there with her.

00:11:58.029 --> 00:12:01.440
Lorraine listens as well as someone is telling
the girl to follow them.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.980
When the men open the door, they can't find
her.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.629
Brad gets the UV light.

00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:09.560
Ed follows the girls footsteps to the wardrobe
and finds a trap door that leads inside the

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.560
walls.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.439
They find Cindy there and take her out.

00:12:12.439 --> 00:12:15.709
April tells Loraine that that's where Rory
hides when he's afraid.

00:12:15.709 --> 00:12:18.800
Lorraine crawls inside the wall and finds
Rory's toys.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.470
She places the music box in the place without
dust.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.029
Lorraine finds a rope and pulls out a noose.

00:12:24.029 --> 00:12:27.000
Suddenly, she drops down through the walls
in the cellar.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.269
Ed freaks out and runs out to find her.

00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:32.350
She hears someone's laugh, then activates
the music box.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.819
The laugh turns into a cry and a woman saying
that "she made her kill him".

00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:39.660
The entity sees her and shows up in front
of her, repeating the same words.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.110
She points her in another direction and as
Lorraine turns, she sees the witch hanging

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.679
herself in the house.

00:12:44.679 --> 00:12:48.339
The witch chases after Lorraine and grabs
her necklace, when Ed hears her screams and

00:12:48.339 --> 00:12:50.120
opens the door to the cellar.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.480
Lorraine knows what the witch does to her
victims - she possesses the mother to kill

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.629
the child.

00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:57.230
She says that the witch is feeding off of
Carolyn.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.749
Suddenly, something grabs Nancy and flings
her across the room.

00:13:00.749 --> 00:13:04.800
It keeps dragging her and no one can stop
it, until Lorraine cuts off her hair.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.300
They all storm out of the house and Ed tells
Roger that they've got it all on tape which

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.730
will be enough evidence for an exorcism.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.889
He'll be back to the house with a priest,
but without Lorraine.

00:13:13.889 --> 00:13:17.790
Simultaneously, she senses something that
leads her to the lake, where she sees a vision

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.220
of Judy in the water.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.529
Lorraine calls her mom to check on Judy.

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:23.019
The girl is alright.

00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:25.920
She tells Ed about it and says that it's some
kind of warning.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.600
The family goes to stay in a hotel in the
meantime.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.800
Later, Ed and Lorraine show the footage to
a priest.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.500
He tells them that it's complicated because
the children aren't baptized and the family

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.000
isn't part of the church.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.279
The priest looks over the pictures again and
is convinced that the family needs help so

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:42.709
he says he'll push it though himself.

00:13:42.709 --> 00:13:45.850
Back at the Warren's house, Judy is in her
bed sleeping.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:49.629
Her locket begins to move together with Lorraine's
locket at the farmhouse.

00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:51.110
Something wakes up the girl.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.100
She gets up and calls for her parents.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.540
Judy looks for them in the house and goes
into the room with all the trinkets from their

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.540
cases.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.230
Annabelle is out of her box.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:03.399
The girl runs back up the stairs and the lights
go out, so she calls for her grandma.

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:07.309
Darkness approaches her and something bangs
on the door of the room where she hides.

00:14:07.309 --> 00:14:10.209
It stops suddenly, then the lights go out
again.

00:14:10.209 --> 00:14:12.129
Annabelle and the witch are in the room.

00:14:12.129 --> 00:14:15.220
Judy cries for her grandma again and finally
wakes her.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.029
The grandma can't open the door.

00:14:17.029 --> 00:14:20.300
Lorraine and Ed arrive at the right time,
running into the house.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.279
Ed tries to knock down the door.

00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:24.970
The chair keeps swinging and almost hits Judy.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.069
She tells them that there was someone rocking
in the chair with Annabelle.

00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:30.850
Ed checks the doll and tells them that she's
still in the box.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:35.029
Meanwhile, Roger comes back to the motel and
the girls tell him that their mom took Christine

00:14:35.029 --> 00:14:37.430
and April and simply left with the car.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.499
Christine asks her where they are going.

00:14:39.499 --> 00:14:42.279
Roger calls the Warrens and tells them what
happened.

00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:45.550
Andrea has also told him that her mom smelled
like rotten meat.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:50.050
Lorraine says that Carolyn will go back to
the house, so Ed tells Roger to meet him there.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.519
Drew drives Roger to the house.

00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:55.689
Ed doesn’t want to let Lorraine go, but
she convinces him that she must.

00:14:55.689 --> 00:14:58.449
Brad arrives at the farmhouse the same time
as Roger.

00:14:58.449 --> 00:15:00.680
He shoots through the door with a shotgun.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.540
They find Carolyn in the cellar wanting to
kill Christine.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:07.529
They manage to subdue her, but April disappears
as they drag the mother away to take her to

00:15:07.529 --> 00:15:09.459
the priest for an exorcism.

00:15:09.459 --> 00:15:12.829
They start bringing Carolyn out and Lorraine
tells them that the witch won't let her leave

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:13.910
the house.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.739
If they take her out she'll kill her.

00:15:15.739 --> 00:15:18.139
The witch drags Carolyn back to the cellar.

00:15:18.139 --> 00:15:21.759
Drew leaves Christine in the van and runs
back to the house to find April.

00:15:21.759 --> 00:15:23.940
The rest are with Carolyn in the cellar.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.699
She bites off a chunk from Brads face, then
they grab and restrain her.

00:15:27.699 --> 00:15:31.510
Ed needs to do the exorcism because Carolyn
is running out of time, but he wants Lorraine

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:32.679
to leave.

00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:35.519
She doesn't listen to him and gets the bible
from their van.

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:37.489
Drew can't find April anywhere.

00:15:37.489 --> 00:15:42.149
Lorraine gets back and Ed starts reading from
the bible, then sprays Carolyn with holy water.

00:15:42.149 --> 00:15:44.749
She screams making the entire cellar shake.

00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:47.040
Birds begin to attack the van and the house.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.739
The exorcism continues regardless, as Drew
looks for April.

00:15:50.739 --> 00:15:54.119
He hears something under the kitchen floor
and begins to break it open.

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:58.189
Meanwhile, Carolyn spits blood and Roger wants
them to stop, but Lorraine tells him that

00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:59.930
they're now fighting for her soul.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.629
Ed commands the entity to reveal itself.

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:06.129
It screams and the entire house shakes, then
it suddenly stops.

00:16:06.129 --> 00:16:09.420
The chair begins to levitate and Ed continues
to read.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.259
Then Ed commands the entity to put her down.

00:16:11.259 --> 00:16:15.220
It tries to drop a cupboard on him, but he
dodges it and tells the others to hold her

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.220
still.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.050
Roger tells the entity to let Carolyn go,
but it turns to him saying that she's already

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.069
gone and that they will all die.

00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:26.050
Simultaneously, Drew finds April under the
house and tells everyone.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.209
Carolyn hears him and goes after the girl.

00:16:28.209 --> 00:16:31.490
They all chase after Carolyn, but she finds
the kid first.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:35.379
Suddenly, Ed calls the witch by her name and
gets her attention, then orders her back to

00:16:35.379 --> 00:16:36.379
hell.

00:16:36.379 --> 00:16:40.629
Meanwhile, Lorraine speaks to Carolyn directly
telling her not to hurt her child.

00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:42.279
Carolyn vomits out the witch.

00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:45.420
They take her out in the sun and the family
happily reunites.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.379
April approaches Lorraine and gives her the
locket back.

00:16:48.379 --> 00:16:52.549
The Warren's come back to their home and Ed
goes to the room to place the music box there.

00:16:52.549 --> 00:17:00.600
Lorraine tells him that the Vatican had approved
the exorcism.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.419
They close the door and the music box starts
playing.
