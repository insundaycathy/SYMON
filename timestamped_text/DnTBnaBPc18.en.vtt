00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.280
﻿If you got stuck in a remote Alaskan&nbsp;
village that hungry vampire’s descended upon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.840
what would you do?
In this How to Beat video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.720
we’ll follow Barrow’s townsfolk, see if we can&nbsp;
make better decisions, and ultimately attempt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.440
to beat the Bloodthirsty Vampires in, 30 Days of&nbsp;
Night. If you think you have a better way, let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.240
me know in the comments! If you like these how to&nbsp;

&nbsp;

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.120
We start out getting a little backstory on a&nbsp;
town full of innocent people who’re about to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.840
massacred. It’s a real town called Barrow, Alaska&nbsp;
with about 4000 residents. They go on to say it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.840
the Northernmost town in Alaska surrounded by 80&nbsp;
miles of roadless wilderness, and that for 30 days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.840
of their winter season, it’s completely&nbsp;
cut off from the rest of the world.
&nbsp;

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.800
Since it’s a real town, I think we can dig up some&nbsp;
more background on it that might be helpful. 
&nbsp;

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.960
The movie is correct about it being the&nbsp;
Northernmost town, as well as having 80&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.760
miles of roadless snowy tundra between it&nbsp;
and the next closest town, but their point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.560
about the town being completely cut off for&nbsp;
30 days of the polar night is incorrect.
&nbsp;

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.080
Because the town is isolated by roadless&nbsp;
tundra and resupply by truck is treacherous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.600
the only real way the town gets food and supplies&nbsp;
is by plane. Every ounce of food is flown in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.440
which is why flights to Barrow are&nbsp;
completed using planes that are half&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.960
passenger seats and half cargo space. Multiple&nbsp;
flights come in and out of Wiley Post-Will Rogers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.920
Memorial Airport on a daily basis, and they&nbsp;
don’t stop because it’s dark outside.
&nbsp;

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.160
Boats do supply the town as well, but only&nbsp;
in the summer when the ice surrounding the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.480
coast is broken and melted enough.
It is possible for trucks to make the drive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.680
to neighboring towns in the winter polar nights&nbsp;
when the tundra is frozen solid. It’s risky, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.120
if there was an emergency and a bad storm grounded&nbsp;
all aircraft or all the pilots were murdered,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.440
you could make it out of town to get help.
This is good news for our protagonists,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.000
because they aren’t as cut off&nbsp;
from the world as they think.
&nbsp;

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.360
It’s not all good news though, the polar night&nbsp;
is not 30 days long as the movie suggests,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.160
it’s actually over 60 days long.&nbsp;
The vampires have twice the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.240
for their feeding frenzy. I don’t think the&nbsp;
vampires will need this much time though,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.480
if they do things right, they likely could suck&nbsp;
out everyone's blood in less than a week. I might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.840
play both sides on this one because the vampires&nbsp;
undoubtedly are going to do dumb shit.
&nbsp;

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.840
A mysterious ship arrives at the coast,&nbsp;
probably around the Elson Lagoon area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.320
which would be remote enough that nobody would&nbsp;
see the ship. They likely chose this area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.640
because if the ship was seen, people would&nbsp;
be suspicious of it. Like we talked about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.960
normal ships need to wait until a&nbsp;
narrow window of time in the summer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.960
when the ice is melted enough for the ship to&nbsp;
get close enough to drop supplies off. 
&nbsp;

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.560
The next morning Josh Hartnett and Crixus find&nbsp;
a bunch of satellite phones torched in the snow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.160
For all they know, it could just be&nbsp;
thieves, vandals, or pranksters. 
&nbsp;

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.000
With some of the townsfolk on the&nbsp;
fictional last flight out before the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.400
fictional 30 day polar night, the strange&nbsp;
happenings in the small town continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.000
Someone is shanking all the sled dogs. 
I get the vampire’s strategy of eliminating any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
transportation or communication out of the town,&nbsp;
but killing sled dogs? Is that really important at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.560
this stage? What dumb son of a bitch would try to&nbsp;
escape a vampire attack on a dog sled with a bunch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.920
of howling Alaskan Malamutes pulling some dude&nbsp;
at a breakneck speed of 5 miles per hour. 
&nbsp;

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.120
The vampire’s next objectives are to have the&nbsp;
human destroy the town’s helicopter and cell tower&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.200
right before the polar night begins.
I gotta commend the vampire’s here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.160
destroying most of the satellite phones first&nbsp;
before destroying the cell tower was key.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.880
If they had destroyed the cell tower first,&nbsp;
obtaining and destroying the satellite phones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.840
would have been much more difficult since it’s the&nbsp;
only remaining means of communication and people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.120
will hold onto them tightly. The sat phones being&nbsp;
destroyed wouldn’t raise any immediate red flags,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.600
and then all you’d need to do to cut the town’s&nbsp;
comms is take out the single cell tower.
&nbsp;

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.320
Shortly after losing comms with the outside world,&nbsp;
the town will send people out to get help via&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.760
plane or helicopter, so disabling these aircraft&nbsp;
quickly is important. Once that option is off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.960
the table, the townsfolk will resort to sending&nbsp;
some truck drivers to nearby towns to get help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.280
I don’t think the vampires would need to&nbsp;
worry about a mass exodus 2 fast 2 furious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.160
style because it’s risky and there’s no need if&nbsp;
you only need a few drivers to make the trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.880
While it’s a roadless tundra, i’m sure there&nbsp;
are established routes in and out of town.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.600
All you’d need to do is have some vampires&nbsp;
guard these routes and kill any escapees. 
&nbsp;

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.520
The next problem is the daily resupply flights.&nbsp;
This is a tough one. If you destroy the landing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.520
planes, the airlines will be alerted&nbsp;
immediately. It might take a few days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.280
of no contact and planes being destroyed&nbsp;
for the National Guard to be called in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.240
but a few hundred soldiers with Blackhawks showing&nbsp;
up will definitely ruin the vampire party. 
&nbsp;

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.800
Damaging the runway could be a way to get the&nbsp;
town to suspend flights for a while, but when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.720
the town survives on that runway, it’ll get fixed&nbsp;
quickly. As a vampire attacking this town, I’d say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.800
realistically the feast can only last maybe a week&nbsp;
max before your welcome is overstayed. But this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.160
a fictional world where no flights come and go for&nbsp;
a month, so let’s continue with that premise.
&nbsp;

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.360
The remaining problem is world awareness&nbsp;
of your vampirical existence. As a vampire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.360
you don’t want the world to know about&nbsp;
your existence because 4chan will find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.000
you and the military will kill you. This is a&nbsp;
difficult task because every person you bite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.440
or slash gets infected with the vampire virus,&nbsp;
which spreads evidence of your existence.
&nbsp;

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.560
Leaving bodies in the open where&nbsp;
the sunlight will vaporize them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.800
after the polar night ends won’t work, because&nbsp;
you need to be out of town within a week,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.960
and the polar night lasts a couple months. 
I think that if you cut off comms and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.560
transportation like they did, destroy any planes&nbsp;
that land, kill everyone as fast as you can,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.440
then on the last day of the week, burn the village&nbsp;
down which will destroy any evidence as well as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.400
flush out the remaining victims who you can kill&nbsp;
and toss into the fire, you should be good.
&nbsp;

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.160
People are going to be suspicious as&nbsp;
to what caused everyone to die and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.240
town to burn down, but nobody will&nbsp;
suspect it was a vampire pack.
&nbsp;

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.920
Their current plan is a bit over the top and&nbsp;
risky. They could just visit the coastal towns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.920
and abduct a few people from each town per&nbsp;
year. Then harvest their blood on their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.080
ship for the rest of the year before killing&nbsp;
them and abducting a few more the next year.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.640
It’s not crazy that few people might go&nbsp;
missing from each town once out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.640
year due to wolves or polar bear attacks. This is&nbsp;
just a much more long term sustainable strategy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.280
and sustainable living is really what we’re&nbsp;
after right, not some one time gluttonous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.960
feast that destroys the town causing&nbsp;
you to be deprived for decades.
&nbsp;

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.360
Back to the movie. So the vampire human&nbsp;
shanked some dogs, and Stella's trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.200
to make the fictional last flight out&nbsp;
before no more flights for 30 days. 
&nbsp;

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.960
How the hell does that even happen. You're on&nbsp;
a lunar landscape with open sightlines. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:20.080
Stella’s not getting to the airport in time.
Eben sends Billy to go pick Stella up while he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.640
chats with the owners of the murdered dogs.&nbsp;
Maybe this dude just pissed someone off.
&nbsp;

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.200
Back at the Sheriff’s office, reports are&nbsp;
coming in about a vandal at the Utilidor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:35.040
That’s not good. Utilidors typically carry lines&nbsp;
for electricity, steam, water supply, sewage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.680
communications, and other important stuff.
This is a small town with low crime and most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:45.200
people know each other. These events all happening&nbsp;
on the same day is strange. It’s likely it’s one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.904
pissed off person. It might be wise to contact&nbsp;
neighboring towns to let them know that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:54.240
are having issues with people attempting to&nbsp;
destroy essential systems, and that you may&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.040
need assistance if communications go down. 
With all that’s happening, and with no aircraft&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.760
at the airport, I'd be worried about someone&nbsp;
vandalizing the cell tower and gas stations.
&nbsp;

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.320
Stella missed the last flight out for the month.&nbsp;
I’m guessing they are anticipating a storm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.040
arriving that would ground the planes, because&nbsp;
otherwise flights should still be arriving.
&nbsp;

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.400
Down at the Utilidor, one of the men mentions that&nbsp;
his helicopter was scrapped and the parts tossed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.000
into the muffin monster. God those things are&nbsp;
terrifying. All it takes is one simple mistake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.880
like a loose shoelace you trip on, and all&nbsp;
your memories, hopes, dreams, your love for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.240
your family, your connection to your community,&nbsp;
all gets instantly grinded up into a red pulpy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.520
soup which’s flushed down the sewage pipes.
I think by now it’s reasonable for Eben to realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.720
that someone is purposefully removing any&nbsp;
communication or transportation out of town. I’d&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.880
be trying to contact all the other vital utility&nbsp;
managers to take precautions, and radioing nearby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:56.000
towns and the national guard that they may be in&nbsp;
trouble if the vandals destroy the cell tower too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:08.400
because they won’t be able to call for help.
Not that it will matter. Oh come on, who would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:14.160
actually go outside after hearing that noise. If&nbsp;
you go to check some weird occurrence out, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.280
better have a plan for how to deal with it&nbsp;
if your worst case scenario comes true. 
&nbsp;

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.960
I mean yah, he doesn’t know there are&nbsp;
vampires outside, but there are still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:28.560
polar bears and wolves that kill humans from time&nbsp;
to time. It’s just not wise to go wandering out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.880
into the snowy abyss by yourself with no weapons&nbsp;
when you heard some animalistic shrieking outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.760
Seriously, what the hell is this guy going to&nbsp;
do if a polar bear or pack of wolves show up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.000
He’s going to get mauled, drug off into the&nbsp;
snowdrift, and turned into wolf shit.
&nbsp;

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.560
Pretty much just like that, except he’s&nbsp;
getting turned into vampire shit. That said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.360
it never really mattered what this dude did&nbsp;
anyways. The first person to realize there’s a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:13.120
problem is usually in trouble, especially if that&nbsp;
problem is a pack of blood sucking vampires.
&nbsp;

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.400
I know I don’t have much room to talk, but c’mon,&nbsp;
the apocalypse hasn't even started yet bro.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.400
Pump the breaks a bit. And you’re not&nbsp;
even a vampire, just a wannabe who’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.040
likely being played for a fool and who will&nbsp;
definitely get sick from eating raw meat.
&nbsp;

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.960
Eben finds the new guy in town causing trouble, a&nbsp;
likely suspect for all the shenanigans going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.600
A tussle ensues, which is promptly ended by&nbsp;
Stella putting a gun to the man’s head.
&nbsp;

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.320
Thanks and all, but Stella, you do realize&nbsp;
that the gun is pointed at my head too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.320
and if you pull that trigger the bullet&nbsp;
will go through his head and into mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.760
Maybe come around to the side so&nbsp;
i’m not in the line of fire.
&nbsp;

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.760
I'd take that seriously. This dude was likely&nbsp;
the one cutting off the town's transportation and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.880
communication. The good news is this dipshit can’t&nbsp;
keep his mouth shut, so Josh needs to interrogate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.400
him to figure out his motives and what’s&nbsp;
going on. Best case this guy is just a loon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.840
but what’s the worst case?
Damn,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:33.840
these vampires are freaky fast. That kind of&nbsp;
speed and strength is nearly impossible to counter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:39.360
without firearms and expert marksmanship. Hand to&nbsp;
hand combat is pretty much a death sentence. 
&nbsp;

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.520
So far nobody in town has been able to&nbsp;
identify the problem and sound the alarms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.240
because the Vampire’s have been doing a good job&nbsp;
of stealthily knocking off isolated people.
&nbsp;

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:53.600
Eben interrogates the man, asking how he got&nbsp;
into town, because clearly he's not from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:58.160
Is that really an important question to ask&nbsp;
right now? I think figuring out his motive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.400
and if he has friends is more important. The&nbsp;
interrogation is interrupted when the phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.600
lines and internet go down. 
Either that’s pure coincidence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.320
or this guy has friends with ill intentions too.&nbsp;
Eben should be considering the latter. 
&nbsp;

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.880
Time to lock and load. Whoever these people&nbsp;
are, whatever they are up to, they slaughtered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:18.000
someone’s dogs, so at minimum they are armed and&nbsp;
dangerous. And with no rescue efforts available&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.200
and limited resources, you should stock up,&nbsp;
find shelter and weapons, and watch your back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.000
No help will arrive if something bad happens&nbsp;
or a dipshit runs into you with a backhoe.
&nbsp;

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:41.280
Come on Eben, there is no way you should be as&nbsp;
nonchalant about this as you are, what happened to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:47.840
having a healthy level of paranoia. Eben decides&nbsp;
to check out the cell tower situation by himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.240
I’m sorry, where is deputy Crixus again? I also&nbsp;
find it odd that the Sheriff’s office doesn’t have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:58.960
it’s own satellite phone they could use.
Hmm. Maybe the wind blew the tower down...&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.840
or the polar bear's situation&nbsp;
is getting out of hand. 
&nbsp;

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.720
They are not fucking around anymore. Everything&nbsp;
before this was the covert setup phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:20.240
This is a declaration of war. Get back and tell&nbsp;
everyone to get out their guns and shelter in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.720
place because people are now being murdered&nbsp;
with their corpses put on public display. 
&nbsp;

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.000
Then, get your deputy and load&nbsp;
up yourself and start trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:41.680
to hunt down whoever is doing this. 
Yes! I’ve thought about this as a solution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:46.720
in some movies like the blob, because it’s just&nbsp;
such a good way to raise awareness quickly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.600
but I always thought you’d seem crazy and nobody&nbsp;
would listen. I think the idea is always good,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:57.280
but people screw the execution up by sounding&nbsp;
crazy. You have to dial it back, so for example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.520
even if you know it’s vampires, you just&nbsp;
say it’s serial killers or something.
&nbsp;

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.480
Josh’s execution is solid, and considering he’s&nbsp;
the Sheriff and all the power and phone lines are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.960
out, his words are gonna carry weight.
His plan he’s disseminating is that whoever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.120
has a backup generator should head home,&nbsp;
and everyone else should go to the diner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.040
which has a backup generator itself.
Again, based on what they know at this point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:25.840
that’s about the best plan you could offer.&nbsp;
Too bad it’s also woefully insufficient.
&nbsp;

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.360
With how lightning fast and strong the vamps are,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.800
you don’t stand a chance unless they are&nbsp;
way out in the open or funneled into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.520
chokepoint. These vampires can dive through&nbsp;
windows and smash through wood with ease.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:50.160
Racking a shotty and backing up to a concrete&nbsp;
or brick wall is most people’s best bet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.304
but most of these little piggies only&nbsp;
have their stick houses to hide in.
&nbsp;

00:15:54.304 --> 00:15:57.920
Ebens dumbass brother falls for the&nbsp;
oldest prisoner trick in the book,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.600
which is to emotionally trigger someone&nbsp;
so they get close enough to grab.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.840
It’s a good thing Eben was on his way back to&nbsp;
save the day, because Stella just stood around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:10.640
useless while Jake was getting choked out. 
Eben and Stella decide to ride out and look for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:21.840
the murderers, because deputy Billy&nbsp;
is on vacation apparently.
&nbsp;

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.800
Stella was hauling ass when that dude jumped on,&nbsp;
I know the Vampires are fast, but that is insane.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.800
The fact that the dude caught up to them,&nbsp;
shrieked, and was out there in the snow drift and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.760
hadn’t frozen to death in the negative 20 degree&nbsp;
temps means some spooky shit is going on.
&nbsp;

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.920
Back at the town, it doesn't look like the&nbsp;
shelter in place order helped much.
&nbsp;

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:53.280
I think it’s underestimated how fast apocalypses&nbsp;
happen. You could have the best doomsday prepper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.840
setup, but if you’re at taco bell when shit&nbsp;
goes down, you aren’t making it. You’d be lucky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:03.200
to get half a Nacho Cheese Dorito Loco taco down&nbsp;
your gullet before a vamp breaks your car window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.120
and sinks their teeth into your neck. 
Saying that just made me hungry. Back in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.480
day when I would play video games until 3am, I'd&nbsp;
naturally get really hungry and go to Mcdonalds to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:18.800
get a 20 pack of nuggets and orange hi-c. But you&nbsp;
know what, I never let my guard down. Seatbelt on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.600
car gear in reverse with my foot on the break,&nbsp;
windows up, parked in an area where you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:29.440
open sightlines, 1 nugget 1 look procedure. My&nbsp;
point is that you gotta anticipate the worst&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.840
case situation no matter what you’re doing,&nbsp;
and develop mental models and procedures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.200
for handling those situations.
I really hope I'm not the only one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:42.000
who from time to time thinks, what if all of&nbsp;
the sudden I heard a scream outside my home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.680
looked outside, and zombies were ripping someone&nbsp;
apart. What would I do right in that moment?
&nbsp;

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.520
I’m starting to wonder if something really&nbsp;
awful happened to me in my childhood that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.840
I'm currently repressing. Probably best not&nbsp;
to look into it, back to the movie.
&nbsp;

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.720
Stella and Eben get back from their field trip.&nbsp;
There's blood everywhere and Jake and Helen are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:06.000
both gone. Judging by Helen’s screams on the&nbsp;
radio earlier, she’s already vamp food.
&nbsp;

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.600
Jake must have ran for it while Helen, being&nbsp;
a slower old lady, got slaughtered. I see he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:17.920
took my advice from the end of my last video. That&nbsp;
leads me to my next semi-pro tip, always be faster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.960
than at least 1 person around you. If you are&nbsp;
the slowest person in the room, figure out a way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:28.480
to sabotage someone else who’s faster to buy you&nbsp;
time. Don’t hate the player, hate the game.
&nbsp;

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:33.840
The jail bro is now complaining that the vamp&nbsp;
god didn’t turn him into a vampire too, so he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:40.720
wants Eben to finish him off. Eben decides not to,&nbsp;
seemingly for moral reasons, but i’d like to add&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.920
that it would be a terrible decision also because&nbsp;
a desk pop is going to attract unwanted attention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.960
from whoever, whatever is doing the killing.
The people that went to the diner are all freaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:56.240
out, it seems like they know there are murderers&nbsp;
outside. What I don’t get is if you realize that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:01.920
the power is out with multiple attackers outside&nbsp;
killing people, why are you making so much noise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.160
why do you still have the lights on and why&nbsp;
are you all sitting around casually with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.720
some morons sitting with their backs to the&nbsp;
windows. You might as well hang up a Krispy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.480
Kreme hot light and get on your knees.
The funny part is that the people at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.960
diner are the smart ones. Everyone else&nbsp;
apparently decided the best course of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.840
action is to run outside like chickens who&nbsp;
can’t wait to get their heads cut off.
&nbsp;

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.640
Everyone at the diner is lucky Eben shows up&nbsp;
and shuts the lights off before the vampires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.440
notice the one building in the middle of town&nbsp;
that’s glowing with lights when the power is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:47.200
out in every other house. He also locks the doors,&nbsp;
which might seem futile, but it’s actually a good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.680
call because the vampires would have to break&nbsp;
in which would give you slightly more time to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:57.200
react than if they were able to sneak in.
Eben proposes his plan to load up a truck with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:02.560
bear traps and flares to distract the vamps&nbsp;
while everyone else runs for a nearby house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.480
that has an attic which is only accessible&nbsp;
by a hidden pulldown ladder. 
&nbsp;

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:11.520
Honestly, I don’t think it’s a bad strategy&nbsp;
to create a diversion, like lighting a house's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:16.240
curtains on fire, while you sneak off to&nbsp;
your truck a block away. The vamps are fast,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:20.880
but by the time the fire became noticeable and&nbsp;
attracted the vamps, you’d have enough of a head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.120
start to where they couldn’t catch up to you.
If everyone else can hold out and stay hidden in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.040
the attic for a couple days, you might be&nbsp;
able to make it to the next closest town of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.840
Atqasuk, and use their airport and radio to&nbsp;
call for help from the National Guard.
&nbsp;

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.720
Welp, things don’t seem to be&nbsp;
going according to their plan.
&nbsp;

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:51.280
I get that vampires are fast, but stopping&nbsp;
an SUV going 35 mph is ridiculous.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:51.280 --> 00:21:01.840
With that speed and strength a gunshot to&nbsp;
the head is definitely your only chance.
&nbsp;

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.800
Well I guess that works too. I think we can go&nbsp;
ahead and wave that citation from earlier.
&nbsp;

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.320
So they can catch a suv&nbsp;
going 30-40 miles per hour,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:16.080
but not josh and stella running on foot, k.
The only explanation for this incongruence is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.560
that the vampires are hunting them for fun, and&nbsp;
they let the humans go for a little chase. 
&nbsp;

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.520
Our band of survivors make it to the hidden&nbsp;
attic where they can take a nice slow deep breath&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:31.760
and let how fucked they are really sink in.
I’m sorry, where have you been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.480
the past 6 hours. 
Let’s walk down the vampire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:40.240
lore stat sheet that anyone would know.
Super fast. Super strong. Voracious appetite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:46.080
for human blood. Shrieky sounds. Sharp teeth.&nbsp;
Black eyes. Intelligent. I’d say they check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:51.040
out. At least they acknowledge that vampires&nbsp;
exist, that’s better than most movies.
&nbsp;

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:56.080
Their plan is to take shifts, ration food,&nbsp;
and hold out until the polar night ends. 
&nbsp;

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:01.200
Based on the movie's fictional 30 days of night,&nbsp;
and Alaska Airlines halting flights for a month,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.480
this is probably the best strategy&nbsp;
unless something changes.
&nbsp;

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:10.160
Based on realistic circumstances where the polar&nbsp;
night lasts 60 plus days, and Alaska Airlines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:15.360
would continue to make flights to Barrow, the&nbsp;
strategy is pretty much the same. The airlines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:20.080
will notice there’s a problem and help will arrive&nbsp;
within the week. Unfortunately, there’s no way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:25.360
to signal to the plane that the town is under&nbsp;
siege and that landing is a death sentence. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:31.120
first airline to land will be massacred.
Jail bro finally got his ticket to vampire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.280
heaven. Why would you even want to join&nbsp;
this type of vampires. They are dumb,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.080
ugly, and live in a busted as ship docked&nbsp;
in some isolated arctic island with no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.080
hot vampires or anything to do. 
If it was the underworld variety, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:49.360
has sophisticated culture, highly intelligent&nbsp;
citizens, superhuman physical abilities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.840
aesthetic physiques, sustainable food&nbsp;
sources, incredible architecture and cities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:59.200
and most importantly, hot vampires, I'd understand&nbsp;
his motives, but not these wild animals.
&nbsp;

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:04.080
Outside they hear vamps searching nearby homes,&nbsp;
which means their current strat isn’t going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:09.120
work for much longer. Especially with the old&nbsp;
man with dementia freaking out every 30 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:14.240
I hate to say it, but that man is a liability.&nbsp;
Even if they can keep him quiet should a vamp&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.480
enter their home, and even if the attic ladder&nbsp;
is hidden, the vampires do have a heightened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.000
sense of smell which they could track you&nbsp;
down with if they got close enough.
&nbsp;

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.280
Their new plan is to sneak over&nbsp;
to the general store for supplies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:29.280
then make a second break for the utilidors&nbsp;
to hold out there. It’s not too far away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.760
but with vampires potentially anywhere&nbsp;
outside it’s extremely risky. 
&nbsp;

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:38.560
Food will be a problem, but I think they should&nbsp;
try to hold out as long as humanly possible before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.840
risking going outside, or at least wait for an&nbsp;
opportunity. Maybe the vampire’s will get bored,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:48.240
something will provide a good distraction or&nbsp;
a whiteout storm will provide them with cover.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.120
I would also advise against going to any&nbsp;
supermarket or general store. These are prime&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:58.320
targets for vampire’s to watch over as survivors&nbsp;
start to get hungry and run out of supplies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:03.520
Raiding other houses is less risky.
Their combined body heat in the attic with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.480
blankets and coats should keep&nbsp;
them warm enough as well.
&nbsp;

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:11.680
Going to the utilidor makes sense in some ways&nbsp;
because it’s a strong building with choke points&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.920
you can guard with guns, but that’s only really&nbsp;
relevant if they have enough ammo to kill the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:21.040
attacking vamps, which they don’t. They’d have&nbsp;
to stop by the police station to get more ammo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:26.000
which further increases the chances they get&nbsp;
caught on top of an already risky plan.
&nbsp;

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.480
Is there anything else our&nbsp;
protagonists can do?
&nbsp;

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.560
Trying to drive out of town is&nbsp;
clearly out of the question, but man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.560
if only we had some sled dogs, right?
They could try sneaking into houses they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.160
heard the vampires search already because&nbsp;
they aren’t likely to search it again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.400
but having your big group which includes&nbsp;
a man with dementia traverse open ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.520
just isn’t worth it the risk. The new house might&nbsp;
not have super secret hiding spots either.
&nbsp;

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.680
I think they should stay put in the attic, and&nbsp;
to prevent a vampire from sniffing them out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.840
they could try to throw their scent off with&nbsp;
household chemicals like ammonia, vinegar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:02.960
or bleach. This might be their best option.
You want to avoid getting into hand to hand combat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:08.240
at all costs, but should you need to, it’s better&nbsp;
to be wielding weapons with range. They could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.984
break some chairs up and sharpen the legs to use&nbsp;
to shank the vampires. The old wooden stake to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:11.984 --> 00:25:16.880
heart. You still have almost no chance, but you&nbsp;
have a better chance than using your fists.
&nbsp;

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:22.800
Guns are the preferred means of vampire disposal,&nbsp;
but ammo is sparse, so you want to make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.440
whoever you’re with who has a gun doesn’t blow&nbsp;
their ammo like Russ did in The Crazies.
&nbsp;

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.840
On the vampire front, they really should maintain&nbsp;
a perimeter around the town and start burning the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:36.160
buildings down to flush out any remaining&nbsp;
survivors. Manually searching each home is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.960
ineffective with only 10-20 vampires in your&nbsp;
tribe. You could search a house and then go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:45.520
the next one, and humans could sneak over to the&nbsp;
house you just searched. By burning the houses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:50.960
down you eliminate their hiding places.
Day 7.. Wait, 7 days since the polar night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.560
started? Isn’t this the 1st day&nbsp;
of vampire attack. I guess time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:04.000
is hard to judge during the polar night.
No, we do not. That’s bait. Eben confirms this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.480
suspicion by looking through a peephole in the&nbsp;
attic and seeing a vampire on the rooftop behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.760
her lying in wait. Stella, stella, stella,&nbsp;
you would have gotten killed right there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.160
had it not been for Eben.
Even if Eben didn’t spot the vampire, with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.120
the lady screaming and how fast the vampire's are,&nbsp;
there is no way you could get to her in time. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.800
only reason this lady isn’t dead yet is&nbsp;
because the vampire’s are trying to get a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.600
2 for 1. Even if you could rescue her, do you&nbsp;
really want a lady in the same attic as you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:37.840
that thought walking in the middle of the&nbsp;
street yelling for help was a good idea?
