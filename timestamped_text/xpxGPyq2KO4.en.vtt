00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.040
What happens when four russians are stuck&nbsp;
in a cable car with nowhere to escape well

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.720
just kidding but in this video we follow these&nbsp;
five characters as always we scrutinize their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.080
behavior gently point out their mistakes and&nbsp;
impose our humble but most definitely superior&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.680
opinions upon them god have mercy nastrowje&nbsp;
our characters are these people right here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.600
we got katja and kirill a dysfunctional couple&nbsp;
because that's what every survival movie needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.560
she is pregnant with his baby but he doesn't&nbsp;
know because she will break up with him after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.840
the holiday at least that's her goal the&nbsp;
plan that her boyfriend has on the other hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.360
is basically bribing a cable car operator to get&nbsp;
to the mountaintop to celebrate new year's eve in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.160
a special kind of fashion which is kind of a weird&nbsp;
thing to do no i mean i can't imagine anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.280
worse than freezing my butt off while looking at&nbsp;
the blurry fireworks through the clouds beneath&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.680
not to mention the way up and the way&nbsp;
back down is just a waste of time really

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.600
As they get to the gondola station they walk&nbsp;
through it as if this was their grandma's chalet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.360
which makes me wonder how that's possible but&nbsp;
then i remember that they're in russia so i don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.480
think we should question these things anyway the&nbsp;
operator denies them access claiming the station&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.320
has been closed for over an hour now and new year&nbsp;
is only an hour away this upsets our characters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.920
because they have made a deal with them weeks ago&nbsp;
as things start to get messy dennis this guy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.360
by the way the only reasonable person around here&nbsp;
takes the operator to the side and convinces him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.800
to let them go as they are about to take&nbsp;
off kirill realizes that he has lost his bag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.240
he decides to stay back but his girlfriend katya&nbsp;
remains inside the cabin at this point let me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.320
introduce it to the other 3 characters otherwise&nbsp;
we might miss the chance if you know what i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.320
this is dennis as mentioned the only reasonable&nbsp;
person around his girlfriend vika and mikhail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.160
undoubtably the most annoying person here as they&nbsp;
move upwards he keeps hitting on katya which if i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.080
were her would push me to 619 outside the gondola&nbsp;
no joke they pop the first bottles of champagne&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.560
and start to warm up after all it's new year's&nbsp;
eve but just a few moments later the gondola gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.840
stuck before we continue here let me point out the&nbsp;
obvious how are they going to get back down anyway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.960
i mean they brought skis in snowboards which&nbsp;
implies they will ski back down right fair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.480
enough i mean there are many places where you can&nbsp;
safely ski down after sunset however as we see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.160
they aren't on an ordinary ski lift right they're&nbsp;
literally in a cable car going up very steep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.120
to get down again just with skis and snowboards&nbsp;
seems to require an incredible amount of skill and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.560
luck because you cannot control the weather and&nbsp;
without the moon it would be pitch dark up here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.000
meaning just one cloud or one storm and you will&nbsp;
be stuck up there anyway i guess the point that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.080
i'm making is that even if they arrived up&nbsp;
there getting back down again without the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.560
cable car seems to be almost impossible the cable&nbsp;
car seems to trespass miles up on miles so unless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.440
the slopes are highlighted forget getting back&nbsp;
down again before sunrise i mean look at this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.800
everyone who has been skiing knows that these&nbsp;
outages tend to happen and when they happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.400
they usually last for just a few minutes at a&nbsp;
time however the guy we bribed before is a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.600
responsible person because he stayed back and&nbsp;
fixed the problem just in time at the same time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.200
our characters find the backpack of Kirill and&nbsp;
inside they find more bottles of champagne great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.080
and to the surprise of katya an engagement&nbsp;
ring but that's not the weird thing okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.040
the weird thing is the parachute i mean i have&nbsp;
no idea what these people plan to do up there but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.880
i am very confused however we now know at&nbsp;
least why Kirill insisted on finding the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.920
backpack before entering the cable car katya&nbsp;
too feels a bit bad about the situation she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.840
thought that he was just making a scene back&nbsp;
at the station but finding the ring she now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.400
understands the importance of the lost backpack&nbsp;
we cut to the cable car operator who enters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.640
the basement to check on the malfunction from&nbsp;
before and oh boy isn't this final destination

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.680
great his dangling keys got stuck in the machinery&nbsp;
and he strangled himself there are worse ways to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.400
die but this is very bad and now our characters&nbsp;
are stuck for good okay the good thing about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.600
being stuck in a cable car is that you are in&nbsp;
a confined space it isn't an airtight space so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.040
coldness will still enter but at least it isn't&nbsp;
all too windy which makes it much more comfortable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.760
and safe in the long run the bad thing&nbsp;
though is that cable cars are usually much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.120
much further away from the ground than ordinary&nbsp;
ski lifts which makes an escape very difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.440
the biggest threat as always in freezing&nbsp;
environments is hypothermia which as you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.320
kicks in when the body loses heat faster&nbsp;
than it can produce the lack of food sleep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.760
and appropriate clothing all boost the risk&nbsp;
of hypothermia but luckily our characters all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.480
wear pretty decent winter clothing but let us&nbsp;
have a look at what a real life scenario says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.680
people get stuck in cable cars all the time if&nbsp;
you look up the news this stuff almost happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.520
weekly normally however you don't bribe officials&nbsp;
and use these gondolas outside service hours right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.120
in 2016 for instance a hundred and ten people&nbsp;
were stuck in multiple gondolas above mont blanc&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.960
which if you didn't know is the highest peak in&nbsp;
europe good luck out of these 110 people only a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.080
few dozen could be rescued all others had to&nbsp;
spend the night up there and they were not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.360
freezing to death now that doesn't mean it was&nbsp;
comfortable but it does mean nobody died meaning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.320
to spend the night up there doesn't mean you will&nbsp;
freeze to death instantly but what does it mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.680
for our characters well it means that if you can't&nbsp;
reach out to anyone which they can't because their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.040
phones can't connect then waiting in doubt is the&nbsp;
single best option you have the mistake they make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.800
though is they party and vibe with their bottles&nbsp;
of champagne granted why not it's new year's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.160
eve and you don't have anything better to do but&nbsp;
drinking alcohol in this situation is a bad idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.520
you see despite the warm feeling you get after&nbsp;
drinking alcohol what it actually does is cooling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.200
down your body temperature even further now this&nbsp;
would be a fatal mistake the best thing to do is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.320
sit tight together zip up your jackets for god's&nbsp;
sake and try to get a mobile connection going the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.280
days aren't the problem you will hardly die from&nbsp;
hypothermia during these the biggest issues are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.800
the nights and if you happen to be stuck up there&nbsp;
for more than three days then starvation enters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.680
the chat our characters wake up completely hung&nbsp;
over which if you ask me is another good reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.880
to avoid alcohol in this situation Dennis went&nbsp;
on top of the gondola to check out the situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.000
unlike ski lifts cable cars traverse much longer&nbsp;
distances making it difficult to reach any of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.640
the towers these gondolas usually pass but&nbsp;
whatever you do okay this is not a good idea

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.320
standing on top of a frozen metal surface&nbsp;
looking 100 meters down into death itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.720
should be avoided if you can meanwhile&nbsp;
vikka found an emergency torch and is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.880
screaming for help now say what you want&nbsp;
about her screaming but she was the only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.160
person that actually went through&nbsp;
the cabin to find helpful items&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.920
and these torches are very useful at the same&nbsp;
time the two babushkas have entered their shift&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.560
complaining about why they have to work today&nbsp;
they don't seem too enthusiastic about their job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.240
can't blame them everyone who has been to&nbsp;
countries with very low wages know how painful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.200
it is to deal with any sort of authority it's&nbsp;
just frustrating often offices are closed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.320
you don't even know why and neither do they tell&nbsp;
you nor do they themselves know when their service&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:02.320
is up again and this is exactly what happens here&nbsp;
as well both babushkas question why the cable cars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.320
aren't working but are quick to brush it off&nbsp;
as they sit down to enjoy their russian salad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:15.280
i mean briatnova at the same time we cut to Kirill&nbsp;
the only reasonable hope our characters have left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.840
waking up with a hangover as well he receives a&nbsp;
call from his mother and tells her that he will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:25.600
be coming home today not being able to see any of&nbsp;
his friends nor his girlfriend makes him even more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.280
angry about last night's situation meanwhile our&nbsp;
characters find a harness and a very lengthy rope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.920
they plan to get down vertically and escape the&nbsp;
mountain with their skis and snowboards fair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.760
play but executed completely wrong now they fasten&nbsp;
the rope on the railing while dennis our main guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.560
straps on the harness and fixates the rope around&nbsp;
his torso the other three characters will guide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.440
the rope slowly to grant him a safe journey&nbsp;
as he's going down he drops his snowboard to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:57.360
prepare for his jump the snowboard however causes&nbsp;
a huge avalanche to go loose discovering a massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.400
crevasse realizing that there is no chance for him&nbsp;
to escape like that he tries to communicate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.920
event to the others up above however all of them&nbsp;
are busy giving him more and more rope none of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.360
them observed dennis way down which of course is&nbsp;
a huge mistake two people would have been enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.160
to control the rope while one other person would&nbsp;
stand by above the opening observing dennis while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.880
also guiding the rope that way if necessary&nbsp;
they could have just pulled him swiftly up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.840
and we would not have lost a valuable member of&nbsp;
the team because that is exactly what happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.880
now dennis almost falls causing mikhail to lose&nbsp;
control and drop through the opening as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.440
at the same time the railing breaks loose&nbsp;
and injures vikka in the process both guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.400
are about to die but mikhail the one above pulls&nbsp;
out his knife and swiftly cuts through the rope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:52.400
underneath causing dennis to fall into his death&nbsp;
now what seems to be very insensitive and cruel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.960
is something that actually happens often when&nbsp;
professional mountain climbers cross crevasses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.320
if someone falls and there is no chance of pulling&nbsp;
that person back up often the only solution is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:08.480
cutting them off in any way it's three people left&nbsp;
not only did we lose the most reasonable person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.520
but the gondola is now also susceptible to extreme&nbsp;
coldness entering through the massive opening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.080
the first thing i would do at this point is&nbsp;
using the snowboards and all else i can find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.960
to block these openings from cooling down the&nbsp;
cabin once this is done i will check on vikka&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:29.120
and then i suppose it's wait for better days now&nbsp;
as vikka is badly injured and katya is taking good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:34.080
care of her a helicopter sounded tones from&nbsp;
afar they climb on top of the gondola to wave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:39.760
for help now katya grabs the torches lights them&nbsp;
up and screams for rescue the helicopter though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:45.920
has already turned around and is flying away if&nbsp;
there was a chance for help i guess this was it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.440
now mikhail of course becomes very angry and&nbsp;
assaults her in the process she almost falls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:57.440
and the only opening back to the gondola shuts&nbsp;
itself causing both of them to be locked outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.080
meanwhile we cut to kirill who is leaving to the&nbsp;
airport now even though he is very angry with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.560
his friends the point that he can't reach them&nbsp;
after they have illegally climbed the mountain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:12.000
should ring the bells no if he's really concerned&nbsp;
he should have just swallowed his ego and go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.560
check on them now we cut back to the gondola&nbsp;
where mikhail is becoming more and more a problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.000
he's screaming at katya blaming her&nbsp;
for virtually everything and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.760
even forcing her into a very risky stunt a&nbsp;
fight breaks out at the same time the screws&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:31.200
spring loose and the whole construction gets&nbsp;
unstable now with a lot of luck katja makes it in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.960
and of course locks him out at the same time&nbsp;
he grows even more angry and eventually falls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:42.960
into his death as well one problem less i think&nbsp;
it's safe to say that now he's gone the chances&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:48.720
of survival are quite a bit better now kirill who&nbsp;
has arrived at the airport at this moment tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.480
to reach out to his friends one last time when he&nbsp;
calls the hotel he finds out that his friends have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.840
never checked in resulting in him realizing that&nbsp;
something must have happened he calls a taxi and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:05.840
is now on his way back now meanwhile katya the&nbsp;
sole survivor so far is slowly freezing to death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:11.200
she realizes that her friend vika has sadly passed&nbsp;
away but because of that she's able to recover her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.640
jacket and at least can get some warmth back she&nbsp;
isolates the cabin as good as possible and tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:22.320
to light a fire with the items and paper she&nbsp;
finds and it works but at the same time a loose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:28.080
structure bumps into the window again and again&nbsp;
causing the window to give away cracking noises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.520
in my opinion you should hear that loud bang&nbsp;
and act accordingly the last thing you want is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:39.920
a broken window a second after you have lighted&nbsp;
the fire and that is exactly what happens at this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.480
point as harsh as it seems but you should strip&nbsp;
off your dead friend's clothing and put on layers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:50.480
up on layers onto you the more layers the better&nbsp;
katya is giving up hope okay she takes out her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:56.800
phone and starts recording her last message to the&nbsp;
world and Kirill meanwhile kirill who ended up in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:03.680
a traffic jam somehow decides to go for a casual&nbsp;
run through the blizzard to rescue his love he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.640
eventually arrives at the foot of the mountain and&nbsp;
tries to convince the snow groomer to get him up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:14.400
he at first declines but eventually agrees after&nbsp;
he has seen how serious kirill is now while they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.920
are getting up the mountain katya is struggling&nbsp;
to stay alive at this point it's getting serious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.040
the loose structures caused by mikhail's outburst&nbsp;
from before are even more unstable now causing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:30.720
gondola to almost fall for good as she seemingly&nbsp;
falls into her death Kirill arrives at the gondola&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.520
station and realizes that his friends are&nbsp;
probably dead he understands that without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.920
him bribing the official at the beginning&nbsp;
of this movie this would not have happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:46.000
and before we think the movie is over we cut one&nbsp;
last time to katya who has surprisingly survived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.240
she somehow survives as long as necessary until&nbsp;
Kirill and a team of rescuers come to save her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.680
in the end she was the only person to survive&nbsp;
and something tells me that she probably won't go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:03.680
skiing again anytime soon and there was this movie&nbsp;
for this week now this wasn't the perfect how to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.560
beat example uh i want to apologize for that i&nbsp;
hope you could still enjoy that we got an updated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:15.520
plan coming in next week so stay tuned for that&nbsp;
and uh yeah looking forward to see you again peace
