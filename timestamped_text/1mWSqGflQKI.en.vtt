00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.000
in this video we will attempt to single-handedly&nbsp;
avoid a future parasite invasion threatening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.240
mankind we will follow a Japanese high schooler&nbsp;
whose hand is hijacked by an alien parasite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.280
we will analyze all the stupid mistakes he&nbsp;
makes and figure out what we would do instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.720
and ultimately beat the parasites in parasyte&nbsp;

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.240
our main character is having a great night's&nbsp;
sleep while soft harmonious Japanese punk rock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.440
is blasting through his earphones in the next&nbsp;
scene we can see a transparent shrimp-like thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.440
throwing itself from the ceiling imitating James&nbsp;
Bond the little guy tries to enter Shinichi's body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.880
through the nose but Shinichi wakes up, pulls&nbsp;
the thing out and throws it into the corner&nbsp;

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.080
Now this situation kind of reminds me of those&nbsp;
jungle stories where people end up having spiders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.200
in their ears everyone thinks it would never&nbsp;
happen to them until you're examining doctors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.960
screams backs up and tells you to get the f- outta&nbsp;
his practice while you start having a full-blown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.640
panic attack not something i'm keen to experience&nbsp;
but having an alien-like thing trying to crawl up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.040
my nose while i'm trying to sleep - that's worse
The parasites in this movie are like any other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.600
parasites they need a host to survive that means&nbsp;
the best chance you have against any of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.600
is before they enter your body&nbsp;
and mess with your sensory system&nbsp;

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.760
they may be swift in their original&nbsp;
form but aren't very powerful&nbsp;

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.680
a quick stomp and some flying books should be&nbsp;
enough to save you from becoming a parasite hotel&nbsp;

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.960
but this parasite seems to be very determined&nbsp;
plus can enter your body anywhere through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.560
your skin - sort of like this tech shrimp in the&nbsp;
matrix series that entered Neo through his navel

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.840
While it attempts to make his way up&nbsp;
Shinichi's arm to gain control over his brain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.480
Shinichi unleashes his otaku powers - he grabs&nbsp;
a piece of cord in a split second, wraps it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:08.400
around his arm and blocks the parasite from moving&nbsp;
upwards I mean those reflexes were insane the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.480
thing i would have done would be to grab the next&nbsp;
sharpest thing around me and cut my arm open as if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.200
i were attempting to get the key jigsaw has hid in&nbsp;
there but his mother interrupts and well does what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.680
the mother does - calm him down while she refuses&nbsp;
to listen to her son who is trying to explain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.360
that a snake has entered his arm through his palm&nbsp;
- to be honest if i were his mother i would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.560
called the ambulance and looked for the pipe&nbsp;
while inspecting the color of my son's eyes&nbsp;

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.720
but let's be real for a second if something like&nbsp;
that happens to you you're most likely on your own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.000
nobody right in their mind would believe you but&nbsp;
the worst thing you can do in this situation would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.240
be to lose faith and disregard it as an odd dream&nbsp;
or hallucination unless of course you're crazy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.080
stuff like this happens to you frequently
the best way to go therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.680
would be to do some research
instead of going to school the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.520
next day i would check out a local hospital and&nbsp;
insist of a blood test x-ray and a bottle of xanax&nbsp;

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.160
we cut to another victim of the parasites and well&nbsp;
he definitely needs to start wearing glasses now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.160
in the next cut, god bless&nbsp;
his wife, he swallows her hole

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.600
The one interesting thing here is that the&nbsp;
parasite not only takes control over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.120
mental landscape of the infected person but&nbsp;
also seems to be able to freely control the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.480
physicality of the body meaning they can&nbsp;
re-organize cells according to their will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.000
and basically take on any shape and or&nbsp;
material that is possible with human cells&nbsp;

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:59.840
the next day Shinichi surprise surprise&nbsp;
realizes that his hand is acting weird

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.040
i would never touch another person&nbsp;
inappropriately but if i do i promise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.760
it was a parasite living inside of me in&nbsp;
the next few scenes we witnessed multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.000
times his hand acting completely on its own from&nbsp;
becoming Steph Curry to painting like Van Gogh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.960
Shinichi is transforming rapidly now&nbsp;
mind you there is an actual syndrome&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.040
called alien hand syndrome it is an extremely&nbsp;
rare condition in which the hand of a person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.120
starts to develop their own independent free will&nbsp;
and starts to act aggressively towards their owner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.640
if you had to choose which one would you pick the&nbsp;
alien parasite or the alien hand syndrome at home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.440
Shinichi is researching what is going on&nbsp;
with his hand but before he can make it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:55.840
the alien hand syndrome wikipedia page he&nbsp;
gets eyeballed from the side by his hand

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.520
Maybe it's just me but that&nbsp;
looked like a deep sea creature&nbsp;

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.600
now the good thing is the parasite has only&nbsp;
hijacked his arm allowing him to keep control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.280
over the majority of his body the bad thing&nbsp;
is you can't get rid of it because it probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.440
wouldn't hesitate to prevent you aggressively from&nbsp;
cutting it off but let's be honest here this thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.040
in its normal hand form is pretty cute
cat and dogs? Nah i don't think so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.680
i'll stick with my parasite hand
plus it has remarkably beautiful teeth for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:39.200
a Japanese speaking entity the newly formed team&nbsp;
decides to call the right hand Migi let us quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.920
highlight what the circumstances are Shinichi&nbsp;
shares his body with an alien parasite called Migi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.200
they can't get rid of each other without killing&nbsp;
themselves or injure themselves many other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.680
parasites have currently taken over people as&nbsp;
well and started to kill and eat other humans it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.600
is important to determine what those parasites&nbsp;
intend we have already concluded that the sole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:10.320
purpose of a parasite is survival meaning if they&nbsp;
manage to find a host then they must inevitably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:17.440
start gathering the means to prolong their lives&nbsp;
which means they need to eat if we consider each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.440
of these points i think it is safe to say that the&nbsp;
ultimate goal of the parasites is to establish a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:33.840
world where parasites rule and feed off of humans&nbsp;
just like the machines did in the matrix universe

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.400
How could we prevent the parasites from&nbsp;
becoming the new apex predator you might ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.160
well the quickest way would be to kill those that&nbsp;
are hosting parasites but that would lead to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.000
significant loss of human lives i could easily&nbsp;
see an alternate future where people are screened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.920
before entering certain parts of cities and denied&nbsp;
access if a parasitic context is to be found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.560
sort of like our global situation right now or in&nbsp;
a nerdier context the aliens that are prevented&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.640
to visit more noble parts of the city in the&nbsp;
attack on titan universe therefore it would make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.320
sense to eradicate the parasites before&nbsp;
a substantial colony could come to exist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.320
there are a few ideas that stand out but before&nbsp;
that let's have a look on how Migi and Shinichi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:30.320
maintain their new relationship Migi is a curious&nbsp;
little thing and learns pretty much everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:36.400
there is about this world besides theories from&nbsp;
books he seems to be able to collect a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.400
hands-on knowledge by just looking at people&nbsp;
doing stuff indicating that he develops skills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.240
through visual observing he is pretty fascinated&nbsp;
by a lot of things and it comes at no surprise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.960
this world is his new home and Shinichi is his&nbsp;
first family looking at existing structures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:01.360
helps us orient ourselves in a rather chaotic and&nbsp;
fast-paced world that makes little to almost no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:12.240
sense while i sincerely appreciate Migi's&nbsp;
curiosity this is where i would draw the line too

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.560
ain't no parasite allowed down there

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.360
In the next scene we witness one of the key&nbsp;
moments in this movie that will later help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:25.760
us defeat the upcoming parasite army before the&nbsp;
time is over Migi is able to sense other parasites&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.440
allowing him to actively search for them the&nbsp;
first encounter doesn't look all promising but we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:37.920
can see that Migi is very capable of attacking and&nbsp;
defending our main character however the one thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:44.400
we learn here is that normal humans have zero&nbsp;
chance against any parasite in a one-on-one combat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.720
the only way for mortals to efficiently defeat&nbsp;
parasites would be through long-range combat but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:56.560
generally it is not possible to kill the parasite&nbsp;
without killing the human host the only way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:02.000
achieve something like this would be to invent&nbsp;
the vaccine that would target only the parasitic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.680
cells in a human body perhaps somebody should&nbsp;
call Pfizer at this moment the biggest asset&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:13.680
humanity has therefore are people like Shinichi&nbsp;
through people like him humanity can benefit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.200
from the strength of both entities especially&nbsp;
the ability for parasites to sense each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:25.360
is a big advantage and should be used to eradicate&nbsp;
all parasites before they gain more control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:31.280
however you would need to breed human parasite&nbsp;
crossings which in itself could be a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.720
questionable and something you would probably&nbsp;
find in a Full Metal Alchemist episode 4 or the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:42.720
darker chapters of the SCP foundation i guess&nbsp;
the best way to get rid of them is still with&nbsp;

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:51.680
"what do you need?" -"Guns, lots of guns"
The next day Shinichi picks up his mom from work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:57.360
and they walk back home he is understandably under&nbsp;
stress but he is still in the position to make the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.960
right decisions it isn't too late for that yet&nbsp;
but he is the main character meaning we all know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.720
he will screw things up even though he ponders&nbsp;
about confessing everything to his mom he doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.720
but he should the biggest disadvantage in sensing&nbsp;
other parasites is that the other parasites can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:20.960
sense you too this fact alone should convince&nbsp;
him to stay away from every person he cares about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.720
he should tell his mom everything&nbsp;
including everyone else that he cares about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.800
he should send them off to a country abroad or&nbsp;
at least as far away as possible within japan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:37.200
the new school semester starts with an incredibly&nbsp;
stupid move from Shinichi Migi senses another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:42.480
human eating parasite and tells Shinichi to&nbsp;
avoid eye contact it should be clear that if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.920
the parasite residing in you tells you to avoid&nbsp;
eye contact then you should probably stop staring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:53.680
down this woman like a horny preschooler Shinichi&nbsp;
doesn't seem to realize that whenever Migi is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.680 --> 00:11:00.160
sensing another parasite they are sensing him too
in this scene he actually for once had the upper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.280
hand because he was hidden among hundreds of&nbsp;
other students making it impossible for the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:11.280
parasite to detect him if he had listened to Migi&nbsp;
they could have drawn a pretty powerful advantage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.880
here if he made it out without being discovered&nbsp;
he could have concluded that the parasites are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:22.960
making moves they seem to try to cover important&nbsp;
positions where it is easy for them to feast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:29.600
and or gain positions of power for more control if&nbsp;
you can escape this situation without being seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.640
then coming back to school is no option anymore&nbsp;
however you could plot the strike and take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:40.640
these parasites out before your schoolmates&nbsp;
end up as midday snacks i am normally not a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:46.080
fan of government interference especially&nbsp;
when i'm inhabited by an alien parasite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:51.360
but considering there are multiple very powerful&nbsp;
parasites out there that try to murder me every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.560
single day i think the best thing Shinichi could&nbsp;
do at this point would be to team up with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:02.480
government and systematically start hunting down&nbsp;
the parasites it would probably be a challenge to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.360
convince Migi and the government to team up but&nbsp;
the options are scarce and the stakes are high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.640
the only other option would be to fight on&nbsp;
his own and he isn't the most heroic guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:18.880
the only downside of that plan could be that the&nbsp;
government will capture you and experiment on you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:25.760
objection granted but you own strong powers&nbsp;
plus the ability to track down other parasites&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.760
therefore the government would be very interested&nbsp;
in using your powers but unfortunately he doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:37.840
seem to grasp the situation and gets involved with&nbsp;
the new kind of hot parasite working at his school&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:43.120
i mean being lectured by a teacher is annoying&nbsp;
but being lectured by a parasite is also next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:49.200
level s**t a short while later they throw a small&nbsp;
parasite welcoming party at the local aquarium&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.880
we get to see two new parasite-possessed&nbsp;
humans and no i don't like either one of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.600
one is smiling awkwardly much and&nbsp;
the other one well he's a policeman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.400
they try to have Migi join their&nbsp;
network but of course he declines&nbsp;

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:10.240
Apparently the killing and eating of the past&nbsp;
few days has drawn the attention of the local&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:15.600
authorities therefore they are looking for a&nbsp;
safe haven where they can eat humans in peace&nbsp;

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.720
say what you want against parasites but&nbsp;
they do have class and a rather high IQ&nbsp;

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.400
the alarming thing though is that they have&nbsp;
already started connecting with each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.160
creating a much bigger threat than&nbsp;
just parasites acting on their own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.840
oh and also one of them is&nbsp;
pregnant with a human baby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.920
talking about sick stuff
if you were in Shinichi's position&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:44.480
right now what would you do? Rationally speaking&nbsp;
you are the only one capable of saving mankind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:50.640
on the other hand who cares and our character here&nbsp;
can't even hold a conversation with his own mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:56.400
for more than two seconds she often tries talking&nbsp;
to him about what's going on but he just can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:02.320
man up and come clear i mean i kind of get it&nbsp;
but i can't stress enough how important it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.600
to let your mother know because she lives in&nbsp;
the same household as you and is therefore a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:14.160
potential target for every parasite nearby i know&nbsp;
Japanese kids aren't very open with their parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:20.160
but this is a life or death situation and being a&nbsp;
stubborn teenager will lead to a real problem here&nbsp;

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.800
During the following night our main character is&nbsp;
approached by the douchey parasite police dude&nbsp;

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.240
We end up in a pretty epic&nbsp;
yet somewhat ridiculous battle

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:38.480
While the parasites are busy slapping each&nbsp;
other Shinichi is being completely useless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.520
however in the end Shinichi transforms into&nbsp;
something useful and is able to pierce his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:51.040
opponent with a metal pole and thus proves his&nbsp;
not so unworthy worth he escaped successfully but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:57.680
horror 101 he should have made sure that the&nbsp;
parasite is 155 dead it would have been easy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:04.480
for Migi to attack one last time and batter his&nbsp;
brain leaving a not so quite dead parasite behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:10.240
is probably a bad idea if anyone during that&nbsp;
time comes for rescue it is easy for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:16.400
parasite to move over and hijack the new body&nbsp;
surprise surprise that is exactly what happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:23.440
it not just happens it happens in the worst way&nbsp;
possible in the following event Shinichi's mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:30.240
gets taken over by the parasite he failed to&nbsp;
kill talking about bad luck huh the two biggest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.840
mistake he has made was not telling his mom about&nbsp;
everything that happened as well as not making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:41.440
sure that the parasite was dead in the scene&nbsp;
before both could have been completely avoided&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.320
if he stopped being an idiot for a second and&nbsp;
thought carefully about the situation he is in

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.080
This right here is probably&nbsp;
the worst possible outcome&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:01.200
but again as mentioned before it would have been&nbsp;
avoidable if he thought about those around him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:07.360
first instead of whining about the situation
as bad luck predicts he has to fight his mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:13.040
but fails miserably and i can't blame him for&nbsp;
that i would probably prefer death over that too&nbsp;

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:20.000
So his heart gets pierced and he seemingly gets&nbsp;
killed until he surprisingly rises from the dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.360
and let's be honest if you had to kill your own&nbsp;
mother because a parasite has hijacked your body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.000
you would be pretty devastated and&nbsp;
probably pissed at the same time this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.280
is the perfect reason to go on a bloody vendetta
even if you gave up and intend to kill yourself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:41.360
after that horrific event the parasite inside of&nbsp;
you wouldn't let you which is kind of depressing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:48.160
if you aren't able to fully decide over your own&nbsp;
life then what are you exactly? On the other hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:53.040
you have nothing to lose anymore your family is&nbsp;
gone, you're half alien and you don't have any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:58.480
friends either it really doesn't matter anymore
Shinichi seems to think alike something has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.840
changed he has seemingly overcome his tendency&nbsp;
to be a whiny introverted little teenager&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.920
he stopped caring what other people think and&nbsp;
all he cares about right now is pay back his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:15.680
debts and kill the parasite that has taken over&nbsp;
his mom's body after his heart got pierced he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.960
would have not survived if Migi hadn't closed&nbsp;
the wound with his own cells what has saved his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:27.120
life came also with some changes the good things&nbsp;
are he has become physically stronger and faster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:33.040
surpassing human abilities by a wide margin this&nbsp;
is a cool upgrade and i wouldn't mind if it was me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:39.280
however at the same time he has also lost a&nbsp;
bit of his humanity his sense of compassion and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:45.600
kindness has taken a hit quite significantly&nbsp;
to be honest and this scene for instance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:51.600
this dude legit disposes a dead puppy by throwing&nbsp;
it into the next garbage bin that's a terrible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.600
thing to do but doing so while being on a date&nbsp;
with a girl is uh is freaking savage another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.800
big change that has emerged is that Migi now&nbsp;
needs four hours of sleep every single day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:09.440
and once he's asleep he can't be woken up meaning&nbsp;
Shinichi will be entirely on his own if that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:15.760
happens so facing parasites could become a little&nbsp;
bit more problematic meanwhile it seems like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:21.520
the police investigating the recent murders are&nbsp;
somehow starting to conclude that parasites are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:28.320
behind the chaos i have no idea how they figured&nbsp;
that out but Light Yagami was lucky facing L only&nbsp;

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.680
They figure out that in order to successfully find&nbsp;
out if the person in front of you is a parasite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.000
you must rip out a hair, if it&nbsp;
curls itself in awkward manner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.680
you better freaking run if it doesn't then in&nbsp;
my opinion you still better freaking run in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:49.920
case you ripped out a hair from your girlfriend
Suffice to say it is a bad idea to test anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:55.600
of being a parasite unless you have a plan or&nbsp;
a death wish the girl in the following scene&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:02.080
didn't think very far let me tell you this&nbsp;
unless you're armed have backup or possess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:07.280
secret power-ups you should not rip out&nbsp;
other people's hair in our situation here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:13.600
are 8 students and all are about to die one of&nbsp;
the girls reacts quite fast and throws a bottle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:19.920
containing a chemical at the parasite causing&nbsp;
it to completely lose control a very smart move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:25.600
but everything that followed wasn't really&nbsp;
smart so the best way to beat this hopeless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:31.600
scene is to divert the parasite's attention by&nbsp;
throwing stuff into the other side of the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:37.520
since he stands in between them and the exit one&nbsp;
of the windows could be used as a temporary shield&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:43.200
climb out in a way so that you can hang yourself&nbsp;
down on the other side to avoid any direct hit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:49.120
to save your spot you might have to push away&nbsp;
your classmates but you know it doesn't matter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:55.680
if you can't escape you need to survive as long&nbsp;
as you can and pray someone will come in time no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:02.720
matter what pretty much everyone has gotten killed&nbsp;
besides Shinichi's friend he comes for rescue but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:09.520
out of nowhere the pregnant parasite joins throws&nbsp;
a self-made molotov at the crazy gone parasite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:15.840
and disappears Shinichi picks up the girl and&nbsp;
jumps out of the window as if he were superman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:21.840
this pretty cool scene all mistakes aside i'm&nbsp;
starting to like this new bad ass Shinichi he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.200
walks over to a building a few hundred meters&nbsp;
away from school and after having a quick chat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:33.840
with the pregnant parasite she passes him the&nbsp;
location of the parasite that killed his mom

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:45.120
but before he gets his epic bloody revenge though&nbsp;
Shinichi the boss climbs on top of the nearby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:51.600
building epically transform his right hand into&nbsp;
a legendary bow and does the job after all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:57.600
this Shinichi finally meets up with the parasite&nbsp;
that has killed his mom and they for some odd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:03.760
reason rendezvous under an epic looking highway&nbsp;
bridge seems like they care about cliches too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:08.800
but if Shinichi was just aiming to get&nbsp;
his revenge the best and quickest way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.960
would have been to do the job from a&nbsp;
distant point with his legendary bow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:18.400
that way the other parasite would not have&nbsp;
been able to predict the attack and Shinichi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:23.840
would not have needed to face his own mother in&nbsp;
a death battle who would want that anyways right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:30.000
the main benefit of that strategy though would&nbsp;
have been to stay safe since Migi state can change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.200
from one to the next second i personally&nbsp;
wouldn't take any chances the only thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:41.520
worse than slicing open your mom's body is being&nbsp;
sliced open by her while knowing that a parasite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.600
will keep on living inside of her
Now before the fight starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:52.000
of course Migi passes out and Shinichi has&nbsp;
to face this heartbreaking moment on his own&nbsp;

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.560
however Migi was friendly enough&nbsp;
to leave him a handy sword&nbsp;

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.800
an epic fight breaks out in which&nbsp;
Shinichi floats like a parkour runner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:06.640
and uses his sword art offline like a real hero
with the help of his mom's love that is breaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.840
through the consciousness of the parasite he&nbsp;
can strike one last time ensuring his victory
