Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.480
Before we start, WARNING!

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.840
Spoilers Ahead!

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.360
Today, I’m going to recap a 2020 Korean
Thriller movie, called Search Out.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.760
This movie tells the story about a Hacker
who tracks a serial killer that kills using

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.480
social media.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.160
So, what are the methods?

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.960
What is the motive behind the killings?

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.240
Let’s find it out.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.040
The movie starts with a Sociopath who receives
and complies with strange missions from Instagram.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.480
The missions involve watching a mysterious
video overnight, isolating himself for 24

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.320
hours, hurting himself, and a last mission
which is yet to be revealed.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.400
Enough with the mystery, we are introduced
to our main protagonists.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.840
A kind young man named Joon who wants to be
an office worker.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.200
But in real life, he works as a cashier.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.280
He also has a religious friend, Sung.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.440
Who wants to be a police officer, but works
as a courier.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.120
They live in the same building together.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.960
In Instagram, Joon is actually an influencer
with 12,000 followers who loves to help people

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.840
promote their business.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.320
This is how Joon meets a woman to help grow
her Psychology Consulting business.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.760
Her name is Won.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.840
She gives free career counsel for low-income
people, for the good cause.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.360
One day, Joon and Sung’s Neighbour receives
an odd message with a black and white whale

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.760
photo from Instagram account, ereshkigal.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.040
She is asked about the meaning of her life
and gets more depressing replies upon messaging.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.480
Neighbour is also among the Joon’s 12,000
Followers.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.360
She wants to meet Joon to&nbsp;
talk about her depression&nbsp;

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.760
of becoming an idol star in Seoul, but Joon

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.520
rejects her because he is afraid of Neighbour
knowing that he is a loser in real life.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.920
A mysterious person stalks the housing and
takes photos of Neighbour.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.720
On Sung’s way home, he almost crashes into
Stalker, but Stalker doesn’t say a word

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.680
and leaves.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.840
The next day, a Detective came into their
building and inform that their Neighbour has

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.800
committed suicide.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.760
He also questions Joon and Sung about it.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.920
Due to his guilt of rejecting his Neighbour,
Joon determines to investigate it further.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.200
One day, Joon is also messaged by ereshkigal,
and asked about the meaning of life.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.080
Seeing the strange message, Joon deletes it.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.720
Suddenly, Neighbour’s Instagram account
messages Joon and ask to answer the question.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.040
Surprised by the incident, Sung accompanies
Joon to investigate the motive.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.320
They came to ereshkigal’s Instagram page
that is full of dark and depressing contents,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.560
with the black and white whale photo among
them.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.560
They confront and accuse ereshkigal of killing
Neighbour in Instagram.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.760
In another place, a Sociopath is seen looking
at the whale photo that usually appears in

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.120
the odd messages.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.760
Due to the oddity, Joon and Sung report it
to Detective who handles Neighbour’s case,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.160
but Detective refuses to investigate deeper.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.720
Detective states that the investigation is
closed since the motives are already clear.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.280
They desperately ask a Gangster Boss to help
them investigate.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.360
A gangster member named Noo-Ri.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.200
Decided to join the team as a Hacker.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.400
She found out that ereshkigal is actually
an alias for a Summerian underworld Goddess.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.080
Noo-Ri tracked ereshkigal’s IP but she failed.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.680
So, she decided to retrace those who have
visited the account.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.240
To their surprise, a lot of people who have
visited the ereshkigal Instagram account are

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.560
dead.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.360
Joon and Sung visit the victim’s families
but are rejected due to their trauma.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.480
While visiting the families, a Stalker stalks
them.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.960
Upon realizing this, Joon and Sung chases
Stalker but he can get away.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.000
After the chase, Joon and Sung receive unsettling
news.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.160
ereshkigal comments on Noo-Ri’s post with
the same question.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.280
what is the meaning of life?

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.560
Upon realizing that she is being watched by
Stalker, she lures and captures him with a

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.040
taser.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.440
Stalker reveals that he knew ereshkigal from
Social Media.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.840
They became friends and kept in touch.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.320
However one day, ereshkigal threatened to
reveal Stalker’s secrets if he didn't do

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.800
his bidding.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.360
So, he is sent by ereshkigal to get information
about the victims.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.360
Although Stalker was threatened at first,
he became addicted to looking into people’s

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.920
private lives and continues to help ereshkigal.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.800
With the information from Stalker, ereshkigal
will get into the victims’ consciousness

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.040
through Social Media and provoke stress to
the point the victims kill themselves.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.000
The next day, the detective accuses Sociopath
of being ereshkigal and raided his place.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.920
However, Sociopath has shot himself and died,
as his last mission from ereshkigal.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.400
Detective informs Joon that ereshkigal is
dead, and he can rest assured.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.160
However, Noo-Ri is still curious and investigates
further.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.600
After that, ereshkigal messages Noo-Ri and
provokes her stress.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.040
Due to her personal depression, Noo-Ri finally
gets into the trap and wants to commit suicide.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.240
But, she is saved by Joon and Sung.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.960
Seeing that ereshkigal has gotten to Noo-Ri,
Sung enrages and provokes ereshkigal through

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.560
his Live-Streamer-friend’s streaming.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.080
Then, Sung is contacted by ereshkigal.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.240
But it turns out that he falls into his trap.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.400
Sung is given missions similar to what ereshkigal
gave Sociopath.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.160
Luckily, Joon suddenly breaks into the room
and saves Sung.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.400
In the hospital, Noo-Ri talked to Joon about
the reason behind her attempt.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.080
She also provides information on ereshkigal
to Joon in order to help him capture the culprit.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.280
In addition, Joon also asks his Live Streamer
friend for help.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.240
During the action, Joon is followed and confronted
by many ereshkigal followers.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.960
Sung comes to Joon’s rescue and saves him.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.560
However, the Detective is there and aims a
gun at Joon’s head.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.600
Joon is kidnapped to ereshkigal headquarters.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.520
After kidnapping Joon,&nbsp;
Detective demands ereshkigal&nbsp;

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.520
to fulfill the promise of letting his secrets

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.240
go.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.280
It turns out that ereshkigal is actually Won,
the woman who contacted Joon previously.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.920
And Sociopath was only one of her pawns.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.960
Won asked Sociopath to commit suicide and
Detective to raid the place, to cover her

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.440
identity.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.720
Won explains that she wants to take her revenge
on Joon.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.240
Three years ago, Joon complained about a mouldy
fried chicken using his social media.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.440
The post went viral and the restaurant was
boycotted.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.240
The parent of the company was also investigated
by authorities and went bankrupt.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.840
The owner of the company is actually Won’s
father who died after the incident.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.600
Won tried to kill Joon using psychological
trauma, induced by her messages on ereshkigal.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.800
But, things got out of hand and she hurt many
people, especially those around Joon.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.920
In the headquarters, Won commands the Detective
to kill Joon.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.000
Meanwhile,Won's followers try to kill Sung
in a parking lot.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.880
However, Noo-Ri and the gang members come
and rescue them.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.400
Joon chases Won to the rooftop to confront
her once more.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.960
Won is composed because she knows that Joon
doesn’t have enough evidence to incriminate

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.680
her.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.960
However, Joon actually recorded Won’s confession
in the headquarters, on a hidden camera provided

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:45.840
by Live Streamer.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.960
Won desperately jumped from the building to
kill herself.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.720
Fortunately, the police are there and prevents
her from suicide.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.680
Won is incriminated for the killings then.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.760
At the end of the movie, Joon reworks his
approach in Social Media.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.920
He posts the whole story of the mouldy fried
chicken and Won’s confession, saying that

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.320
he will accept any encouragement or criticism.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.000
In addition, he also confesses his profession
as a part-time cashier without hiding it.
