00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.440
Welcome back to Movie Recaps. Today I will show&nbsp;
you a thriller film from 2016, titled Hush.&nbsp;

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.160
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.960
A small house can be seen in the forest.&nbsp;
Inside the house someone is making dinner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.880
throwing asparagus in a pan, checking on&nbsp;
the rice and the lamb rib in the oven.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.360
Maddie reads the instructions about the sauce she&nbsp;
needs to prepare and later she tries it, disliking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.560
it horribly. She sees a message from her neighbor&nbsp;
asking to come over and she says yes. Maddie plugs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.800
her computer to the charger and continues the&nbsp;
conversation with her neighbor on her phone. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.880
she calls her cat in for dinner and feeds her.&nbsp;
Her neighbor can be seen approaching the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.600
Maddie comes out to greet her. Sarah immediately&nbsp;
tells her that she read her book and tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.480
converse with her in sign language because Maddie&nbsp;
is deaf. She can read lips, but Sarah insists that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.720
she let her practice signing with her. Maddie asks&nbsp;
her what she thinks of the book and she says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.200
she loved it. She even tried to guess the ending&nbsp;
but missed it completely. Maddie tells her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.520
her writer's brain is the reason why she can come&nbsp;
up with different types of endings - any possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.320
outcome plays out in her brain like a movie. She&nbsp;
finds it hard to quiet the voices in her head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.960
Sarah asks her how her inner voice sounds like&nbsp;
and Maddie answers that it sounds like her mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.000
Suddenly, the fire alarm goes off in the house.&nbsp;
They run inside and Maddie takes the alarm down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.960
while Sarah takes the lamb out of the oven. Her&nbsp;
cat escapes. Sarah says that the alarm is very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.040
loud, but Maddie tells her that it needs to be&nbsp;
very loud so she can feel the vibrations in her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.320
sleep. Later, they sit on her porch talking about&nbsp;
her cat. Maddie tells Sarah not to worry about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.800
because she's very independent. Sarah asks her&nbsp;
to come over and order something to eat because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.680
her food got ruined, but she tells her that she&nbsp;
has to work. Before Sarah leaves, she rehearses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.240
the new signs she learned from her. After she's&nbsp;
gone, Maddie gets a message from Craig, saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.880
that he's thinking of her, but she deletes it.
Later that night, Maddie is on her computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.280
eating and working on her new novel. She thinks&nbsp;
through the ending of the book, but can't decide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.840
what would be the best one. Maddie reaches a&nbsp;
hurdle in her writing so she decides to face time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.640
Craig. She drops the call before it can establish&nbsp;
a connection. He keeps trying to reach her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.040
but she neither picks up on her laptop or her&nbsp;
phone. Maddie goes to clean the mess she made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.960
in the kitchen when she was preparing dinner,&nbsp;
when suddenly Sarah starts banging on her door in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.440
a panic. She hopes that Maddie would see her, but&nbsp;
she gets shot with an arrow and then killed right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.920
in front of her window. Maddie doesn't notice a&nbsp;
thing. The killer observes through the window and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.040
knocks on it to see if she'll hear him. When he&nbsp;
realizes that she doesn't, he drags the body away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.600
Craig keeps calling Maddie, but she doesn't&nbsp;
want to pick up. She sits down to write again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.720
but doesn't do much better than before. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
the killer enters her house and walks up to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.400
Completely oblivious to his presence,&nbsp;
she laughs about her writer's block.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.040
Suddenly, she gets a face time call from her&nbsp;
sister and the killer backs away from the camera.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.600
They talk about her novel for a moment, then&nbsp;
Maddie tells her about Craig. Her sister tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.160
to get back in the dating pool, but she doesn't&nbsp;
want to. Then she asks Maddie to come back to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.800
city and live with her, to stop isolating herself.&nbsp;
The killer grabs her phone from the counter and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.520
her sister notices it on camera. Maddie says that&nbsp;
it's probably her cat, but that she needs to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.480
find her. They say goodbye, then she calls her&nbsp;
cat by using the sound of the food in her bowl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.120
She doesn't come to her calls, as Maddie continues&nbsp;
to look for her through the house. The cat isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.840
upstairs either. Maddie opens the door and calls&nbsp;
the cat again, but leaves it open when she doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.560
come to her. She sits down to write again.&nbsp;
Suddenly, she gets a picture message from her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.040
own phone. The images are from her looking for the&nbsp;
cat and the exact moment she looks at them on her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.080
computer. Maddie is scared and walks toward the&nbsp;
door cautiously. She sees the killer standing on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.480
her porch. He shows her that he has her phone and&nbsp;
she immediately runs to close the door in the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.440
second. The killer keeps trying every door of her&nbsp;
house, but when he realizes that he can't come in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.400
he circles to the other side of the house and&nbsp;
almost gets inside. Maddie goes to call 911 on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.800
her computer, but he turns the power off.&nbsp;
She tries to join Sarah's network, but she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.840
doesn't know the password. He tries to mess with&nbsp;
her, then walks off. Maddie goes to the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.920
only to see him slash the tires on her car&nbsp;
and hide in the woods. She writes a message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.080
on the glass of the door and lights it up with a&nbsp;
flashlight. The killer reads the message and takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.040
off his mask. He asks if she can read his lips and&nbsp;
she nods affirmatively. The man tells her that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.040
knows that she lives alone and that there is no&nbsp;
boyfriend coming. Then he tells her that he can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.360
come in the house whenever he wants, but he will&nbsp;
only come for her when she'll be wanting to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.480
She nods that she understands. Before he walks&nbsp;
away, he tells her that they can have fun. Maddie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.320
goes to her kitchen and gets a knife and a hammer,&nbsp;
then goes back to the living room and checks it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.520
Next, she gets to her bedroom, barricades the&nbsp;
door and pulls the curtains on her windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.840
Maddie peeks through the window, but doesn't&nbsp;
see him out. Suddenly, there's a shadow on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.480
her window. He knocks on it and she sees him&nbsp;
doing that in the shadows cast on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.200
When she checks it, she sees that he's knocking&nbsp;
on her window using Sarah's body. Maddie drops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.840
her weapons and goes back to the living room,&nbsp;
crying. Suddenly, she remembers Sarah putting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.400
her phone in her back pocket. She takes her car&nbsp;
keys out and tries to activate the car alarm,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.440
but can't do it through the window. She opens the&nbsp;
door and quickly manages to activate it. The man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.080
hears it and she sees him walking over to the car.&nbsp;
Maddie runs back to her room and looks for Sarah's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.440
phone in her pockets, but he comes back. She pulls&nbsp;
back inside and slams the window on his fingers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.240
In a fraction of a second she grabs her knife and&nbsp;
stabs him. The man is bleeding so he rips a piece&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.640
of Sarah's shirt and wraps his arm with it. He&nbsp;
realizes that she was looking for her phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.200
so he shows her that he has it, then he leaves it&nbsp;
on the body. She walks back to the living room and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.320
he tries to open the window again. Moments later,&nbsp;
Maddie sees him moving outside and hides from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.400
He peeks though the glass door and doesn't see&nbsp;
her, but he figures out where she's hiding.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.880
She opens the door and leaves the house, hiding&nbsp;
when she sees him. He walks right past her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.440
hiding under the porch, then she feels for the&nbsp;
vibrations from his steps on the wooden floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.280
The man walks around the house again, tricking&nbsp;
her to get out of hiding and when she runs he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.360
shoots at her a few times with his crossbow,&nbsp;
but he keeps missing. She gets back to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.160
house and locks the door again. Maddie gets up&nbsp;
to the second floor and observes him from there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.000
When she sees that he's at the front door,&nbsp;
she opens a window and climbs out on the back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.640
of the house. Maddie is careful to be extra&nbsp;
quiet. He's at the front side of the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.280
so she throws her lit flashlight in the woods to&nbsp;
distract him. The man follows the flashlight and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.760
she climbs down from the roof, when he shows up&nbsp;
and he shoots her. He shoots her again and climbs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.400
up to see if he got her. Meanwhile she takes the&nbsp;
arrow out of her leg and when he reaches the roof,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.800
she pushes him off and grabs his crossbow. Maddie&nbsp;
doesn't know how to load it which gives him time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.600
to climb after her. She manages to get back&nbsp;
inside the house before he reaches the window.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.240
Maddie points the crossbow at him and scares him&nbsp;
away. She gets to her bathroom to take car of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.520
wound. Maddie pours alcohol on it and wraps her&nbsp;
leg to stop the bleeding. She's in her bathroom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.080
crying and trying to figure out what to do, then&nbsp;
she takes the crossbow and sees markings on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.560
Maddie tries to load the weapon, but she can't&nbsp;
get the bow to the mechanism that holds it drawn.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.400
She tries again, but this time the man&nbsp;
can see her through the bathroom window.&nbsp;

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.200
Suddenly, another man knocks on her front door,&nbsp;
looking for Sarah. Maddie doesn't hear him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.240
but the killer does. The man is Sarah's boyfriend&nbsp;
John. He sees the message on the door and wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.480
to call the police, when the killer appears&nbsp;
pretending to be a cop. He tells him to drop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.800
the phone, but John tells him that it's not a&nbsp;
weapon and says that he doesn't want any trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.840
The killer tells him to drop on his knees and show&nbsp;
him his ID. John says his ID is in his wallet and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.000
that he'll put his phone down to take it out. He&nbsp;
takes the wallet out and the man takes it from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.600
him. The killer looks at his ID, then asks if he&nbsp;
lives next door. John nods and the man apologizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.400
for scaring him. He lies to him that he responded&nbsp;
to a call and that he found the place like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.960
Someone was inside the house and ran past him&nbsp;
when he arrived, knocking him out. He says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.040
the person also took his gun as well as his&nbsp;
radio and that he needs to call the sheriff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.960
John begins to doubt if he's a cop, but he tells&nbsp;
him that he's a deputy and that he's new at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.600
job. The man asks to use John's phone and he&nbsp;
gives it to him. He pretends to call his station&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.080
for John's benefit, but doesn't give him his phone&nbsp;
back when he's done and he puts it in his pocket.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.320
The two of them talk about Maddie and John&nbsp;
tells him that she pretty much keeps to herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.400
He sees that the man's arm is bleeding and asks&nbsp;
him about it, so he lies that the man that jumped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.640
him did it. John wants his phone back and when he&nbsp;
gives it to him, Sarah's earring falls out of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.760
pocket. John recognizes it. He starts asking the&nbsp;
man questions to see if he would be able to catch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.040
him in a lie. The man dodges all of them. In the&nbsp;
meantime, Maddie is still trying to draw the bow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.280
and gets nowhere with it. John is still trying to&nbsp;
figure out who the guy is, but at this point he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.440
sure that he isn't a police officer. He tells&nbsp;
him that Maddie has a key hidden in a planter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.680
at the bottom of the stairs. When the man goes&nbsp;
down there to check, John picks up a rock and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.080
starts getting closer to him, chatting still, so&nbsp;
he doesn't realize that he's planning something.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.240
The moment he gets a chance to hit him over the&nbsp;
head, Maddie starts banging on the window and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.680
man stabs him. John still goes after him, but the&nbsp;
man runs around him until he falls on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.600
Maddie is seeing it all happen and the man&nbsp;
thanks her for showing up at the right time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.400
He leans toward John and he jumps him, tackling&nbsp;
him over and grabbing him tightly. He tells Maddie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.560
to run. When she goes out the back door the man&nbsp;
runs after her and hits her over the head with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.360
rock, killing her. That was just an outcome of&nbsp;
her running away playing out in Maddie's head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.160
Her inner voice tells her that she can't run.&nbsp;
She's still inside the house. John dies before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.400
he could kill the man. Maddie keeps going through&nbsp;
all the different possibilities and outcomes of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.280
her situation. She wonders is she could shoot&nbsp;
him or go outside and get the power back on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.040
She thinks about the places she could hide&nbsp;
in the house like the bathroom or the loft.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.200
Whatever she chooses if he doesn't find her,&nbsp;
she can still bleed to death. Outside of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.200
house she can hide in the crawlspace, but he&nbsp;
knows that she hid there once. She's running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.440
out of time because she's getting dizzy, cold&nbsp;
and her vision is starting to blur. Her inner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.320
voice tells her that he has the advantage, one&nbsp;
way or the other. She can't run, she can't hide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.760
and she can't wait. Maddie suddenly realizes&nbsp;
what she needs to do to save herself. Kill him.&nbsp;

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.600
Meanwhile, the man is going through John's&nbsp;
pockets and finds a pack of cigarettes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.840
He goes over to Maddie's car and takes out the&nbsp;
wrench. Sitting down on the car, he lights a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.840
cigarette and decides that he'll go inside the&nbsp;
house in a little while, until she looses a bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:47.200
more blood. Suddenly, her cat appears. He crouches&nbsp;
down to her and is about to kill her, when Maddie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.760
shoots him with the crossbow. She runs back inside&nbsp;
and he goes after her, catching her hand with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.480
door and breaking it. He lets her hand go and&nbsp;
she locks the door. The man breaks the arrow and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.280
tells her that he's coming in. Maddie stands up to&nbsp;
face him, then uses her own blood to write "do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.520
coward" on the glass. He walks to the car to get&nbsp;
the wrench and Maddie writes down his description&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.080
in the open document on her laptop. As he's&nbsp;
breaking down the glass on her door, she writes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.800
a message for her mom and dad. Maddie hides in the&nbsp;
bathroom and waits for him there. She begins to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.960
loose consciousness and doesn't notice him coming&nbsp;
in from the window behind her. The man lets out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.520
a breath which she can feel on her neck, so she&nbsp;
turns around dodging his knife and she stabs him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.760
She runs out of the bathroom and gets to the&nbsp;
kitchen, seemingly passing out on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.320
He limps toward her, ready to kill her when&nbsp;
suddenly she sprays his eyes with wasp repellent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.720
She grabs the fire alarm and activates it, further&nbsp;
incapacitating him until he drops the knife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.840
Maddie grabs the knife, but he pushes her on&nbsp;
the floor and they fight. He almost kills her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.000
when she reaches the wine opener and kills him.&nbsp;
She regains her strength and takes her phone out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.040
of his pocket. She dials 9 11 and passes&nbsp;
out. A bit later, Maddie walks out of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.920
house and sits on her porch. Her cat sits next&nbsp;
to her. The police finally arrive at the scene.
