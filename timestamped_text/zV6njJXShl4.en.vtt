00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.480
Detective Recapped here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain an Indonesian thriller film called,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:16.240
"Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts".&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.640
Act One: The Robbery
A man on a dirt bike weaves through the fields&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.880
of the island of Sumba. He makes his way to a&nbsp;
lone hut in the middle of nowhere. In this place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.880
the nearest neighboring house is miles away,&nbsp;
making it the perfect place to commit a crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.040
The man on the dirt bike is named Markus,&nbsp;
an aged man who is a criminal and a fiend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.280
Markus enters the hut where a young and beautiful&nbsp;
woman named Marlina lives. Upon seeing Marlina,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.960
Markus asks if her husband is home, and&nbsp;
she answers that he will be back soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.920
Markus immediately knows that she is&nbsp;
lying because her husband's corpse is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.280
sitting right in the same room they're&nbsp;
in. It's unnoticeable at first glance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.800
but from the dark corner, he could be&nbsp;
seen, sitting while wrapped in a blanket.&nbsp;

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.640
Markus must have heard of Marlina's late husband&nbsp;
and the beautiful widow he left behind, all with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.880
their material possessions. Then, Markus does&nbsp;
something that only an evil-hearted man could do:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.240
he starts explaining to Marlina the cruel&nbsp;
intentions he has for her in a disturbingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.720
calm manner. He will be stealing all of her money&nbsp;
and livestock, and soon, more men will arrive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.960
and they will violate her as a group. With his&nbsp;
twisted mind, he even implies that Marlina would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.120
be lucky to have multiple men at the same time.&nbsp;
After demanding Marlina to make them dinner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.680
Markus takes out and plays his prized jungga, a&nbsp;
native instrument. In spite of his vile promises,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.960
Marlina stoically exits the room and&nbsp;
braces herself for the upcoming danger.&nbsp;

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.280
Later that day, several men come in a truck and&nbsp;
another dirt bike. Marlina counts six men in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.000
total, including Markus. When the men got off the&nbsp;
truck, they ordered a man named "Franz" to inspect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.320
the livestock before loading the animals into&nbsp;
their truck. Afterwards, four of the men go inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.320
the hut's living room area to meet with Markus.&nbsp;
The heartless and disgusting men all discuss how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.080
they will violate Marlina as if it were such a&nbsp;
trivial thing. Markus then gets up and leaves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.600
his friends to take a nap. While listening&nbsp;
to their conversation from the next room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.440
Marlina feels a shiver down her spine as they&nbsp;
talk about taking turns with her. Still, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.600
fierce and determined Marlina doesn't give in to&nbsp;
the fear, and she resolves to survive the night.&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.760
She enters the living room to join the thugs, who&nbsp;
are sitting near her husband's corpse. Most of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.760
them barely have the guts to look her in the eye,&nbsp;
knowing the evil intent they carried with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.360
Marlina feigns courtesy and greets them a good&nbsp;
evening before entering her room where Markus is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.520
staying. Marlina sits by the mirror and pretends&nbsp;
to comb her hair while retrieving a wrapped item&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.920
from the drawer without Markus's notice. Just as&nbsp;
Markus demanded earlier, Marlina begins cooking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.480
dinner for them. However, the chicken soup she's&nbsp;
making has a special ingredient. The wrapped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:45.120
item she retrieved contains a potent and lethally&nbsp;
poisonous fruit, and she mixes it with the soup.&nbsp;

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.800
Suddenly, Franz comes in from the backdoor and&nbsp;
sees her cooking the soup. Marlina then steps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.520
on the fruit, concealing its existence from her&nbsp;
assailants. With Franz asking for a taste, Marlina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.520
is about to prepare it for him when one of the men&nbsp;
shouts at him for trying to eat ahead. He orders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.680
Franz to leave and come back tomorrow instead.&nbsp;
Being the newbie of the group, Franz complies.&nbsp;

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.320
Finally, it's time for dinner. Marlina&nbsp;
has prepared several plates for the men,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.400
and she serves them chicken soup. Every one of&nbsp;
them enjoys the food, and they even compliment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:39.920
Marlina's cooking. All Marlina has to do next is&nbsp;
wait, and soon, all four men are lying down on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.880
ground. Now, only Markus is left. With the rest&nbsp;
of his crew lying dead in the living room, Marlina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.120
brings a plate of the poisoned soup directly to&nbsp;
Markus, who's still taking a nap in her room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.440
However, Markus can no longer contain his&nbsp;
vile urges, and he ends up dumping the food.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.680
He then forces himself on Marlina and starts&nbsp;
moving on top of her. When Marlina tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.840
to resist, Markus hits her in the face.
Fortunately, she spots Markus’s machete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.320
on the bedside table and sees&nbsp;
it as a way to free herself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.000
all while the perverted Markus is convinced&nbsp;
that Marlina secretly likes what he's doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.840
While pretending to enjoy what Markus is doing,&nbsp;
she skillfully motions herself so that she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.920
on top of him. At the same time, she grabs&nbsp;
the machete and hides it behind her. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.640
unsheathing the blade, she swings it at Markus,&nbsp;
making the perfect cut to behead him. Afterwards,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.880
Marlina takes Markus's instrument and burns&nbsp;
it. With everything that happened, Marlina is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.560
still in shock, and she sorrowfully leans on her&nbsp;
husband's corpse in an attempt to find comfort.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.080
Act Two: The Journey
Marlina walks the long and winding road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.040
with Markus's head dangling from a piece of cloth.&nbsp;
Marlina soon meets her friend, Novi. Strangely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.520
enough, Novi isn't as shocked as she ought to be&nbsp;
when she sees the dangling head. Heavily pregnant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.680
Novi goes on and on about her issues at home.&nbsp;
She also explains that she's trying to find her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.160
husband, who she fears might be late for their&nbsp;
baby's due date. In turn, Marlina tells Novi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.720
that she intends to take the head to the police.&nbsp;
Finally, the public service truck stops by, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.200
Marlina tries to get on, but the driver refuses&nbsp;
for fear of getting in trouble. In response,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.600
Marlina takes out her blade and forces the driver&nbsp;
to take her. Upon seeing this, the rest of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.840
passengers leave the truck, not wanting to get&nbsp;
caught up in anything. Left with no other choice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:37.760
the driver takes Marlina and Novi to the city.
Eventually, the odd group happens upon an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.440
elderly woman who stopped right in front of&nbsp;
the truck. Despite the driver's warnings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.760
she still gets on. The woman explains that she's&nbsp;
in a hurry to get two horses to her nephew,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.080
who will use them for a dowry. The woman cares&nbsp;
little upon seeing Marlina with the blade against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.840
the driver's throat and eventually boards the&nbsp;
truck along with the two horses. With her is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.600
another young man tending to the animals. The&nbsp;
recent addition to their peculiar group starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.080
exchanging stories with Novi despite the oddity&nbsp;
of it all. Then, the elderly woman notices that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.840
Marlina's getting tired of holding her hand&nbsp;
up, so she invites her to the passenger car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.320
assuring her that the driver won't leave. When&nbsp;
Marlina enters the passenger car, the errand boy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.480
Ian, asks why she was carrying the severed head.&nbsp;
Marlina replies that the head is her prisoner.&nbsp;

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.680
On their journey, a truck drives past them with&nbsp;
two gruff men sitting in front. Marlina sees the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.480
truck from afar, and there, she spots Franz. She&nbsp;
successfully hides from Franz's gaze, and they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.880
able to pass by safely. Franz and his companion&nbsp;
go straight towards Marlina's hut, where they find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.960
the bodies of their dead companions. The two men&nbsp;
hurriedly go on their way to hunt down Marlina.&nbsp;

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.800
Meanwhile, Marlina and Novi stop by the side of&nbsp;
the road to urinate. Novi goes on and on about her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.480
pregnancy experiences while Marlina envisions&nbsp;
Markus's headless body playing his little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.360
instrument. Here, Novi asks Marlina about the&nbsp;
truth, and Marlina explains that she was violated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.760
and that she killed the men. Confused, Novi asks&nbsp;
why she would report the men in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.400
After all, Marlina will only be incarcerated&nbsp;
for a murder she can't defend in court.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.400
Novi then invites Marlina to stay with her&nbsp;
to keep safe, but she declines. Just then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.400
the two gruff men drive up to Marlina's truck.&nbsp;
They pull out their machetes and demand the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.880
passengers to reveal Marlina. Novi walks up to&nbsp;
them and sends the men in the wrong direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.040
The men then order all of the passengers to board&nbsp;
the truck, and they drive off. With them gone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.440
Marlina spots a horse. She goes to ride it while&nbsp;
continually being haunted by the headless Markus.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.600
Act Three: The Confession
The nearest police station&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.280
is situated in the middle of a humble&nbsp;
village with only a handful of inhabitants.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.280
Before arriving there, Marlina finds a box that&nbsp;
she could conceal the severed head with. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.440
hitches her horse to a tree, then brings the box&nbsp;
with her to a nearby shack that's serving food.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.360
With Marlina sat there, a little girl approaches&nbsp;
her, asking if she wants to order a plate of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.440
their famous satay. Marlina takes a liking&nbsp;
to the girl who introduces herself as Topan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.680
Upon hearing the name, Marlina's heart softened&nbsp;
as she explains that she was to have a son named&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.480
Topan, but she lost him to a miscarriage. In turn,&nbsp;
Topan shares that she was given a boy's name in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.120
hopes that she'd be as strong as one. Smiling,&nbsp;
Marlina orders a plate of satay, and she has her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:28.640
lunch while Topay accompanies her. After eating,&nbsp;
Marlina leaves the box with the severed head in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.800
Topan's care, instructing her not to open it.
Marlina then heads to the police station,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.800
where she finds the police wasting their time&nbsp;
away on table tennis. It takes a while before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.720
anyone attends to Marlina because of their table&nbsp;
tennis game, but eventually, a policeman takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.880
her report. She hesitates on whether she should&nbsp;
tell the whole truth, but she decides against it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.400
The policeman tells Marlina it will take two&nbsp;
to three days for them to inspect her house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.440
and it will take a month to have a&nbsp;
special check-up with her defilement case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.320
Either way, the police will need&nbsp;
evidence for any action to be taken.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.600
Realizing that the law won't help her, Marlina&nbsp;
returns to the food shack with tears in her eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.920
Topan comes by with the box and embraces Marlina,&nbsp;
comforting her and telling her not to cry.&nbsp;

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.400
The kind Topan has Marlina stay in her home for&nbsp;
that evening. The two grow close with one another,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.840
and Topan tells Marlina that her mother must&nbsp;
have been as pretty as she was, hinting that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.320
she's an orphan. The following morning, Topan is&nbsp;
still asleep when Marlina leaves on her horse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.840
and she brings Markus's head with her.&nbsp;
She then picks up her phone to call Novi.
 &nbsp;

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.040
Act Four: The Birth.
Back to Novi's group, the truck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.680
driver had been killed by the two bandits. The&nbsp;
other bandit, Niko, starts shoveling dirt a yard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.880
away from the rest of the group. As for Franz,&nbsp;
he's guarding Novi, the elderly woman, and Ian.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.520
While they're waiting, a scared Novi receives a&nbsp;
call from her husband, Umbu. Novi tries to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.480
to him, but Franz hijacks the call, pretending to&nbsp;
be Novi's lover. This angers Novi, and Ian takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.960
advantage of the commotion to overpower Franz.&nbsp;
With Franz knocked down, Novi and the rest of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.840
the party board the truck, leaving Franz and Niko&nbsp;
behind. Furious, Niko punches Franz a couple of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.840
times. He then leaves, deciding to quit their&nbsp;
operation after having failed more than once.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.800
Later, Ian and the woman drop Novi off at her&nbsp;
meeting place with Umbu. After they part ways,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.600
the husband and wife are reunited. However, Umbu&nbsp;
is furious at the phone call he received earlier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:39.840
and he accuses Novi of having a breech baby. In&nbsp;
Indonesian culture, it's a sign of infidelity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.080
This leads to Umbu pushing and hitting Novi&nbsp;
several times before leaving her in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:48.800
middle of nowhere. Unbeknownst to her, Franz has&nbsp;
been watching everything from up a small hill.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.960
He then approaches Novi and takes her hostage.&nbsp;
Since he still has Novi's phone from earlier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.800
he demands that she speak with Marlina. Novi&nbsp;
takes the ringing phone to tell Marlina that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.320
Franz has her before Franz takes the phone,&nbsp;
ordering Marlina to meet them at her house.&nbsp;

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.120
Franz and Novi arrive there first. The moment&nbsp;
Novi steps down from Franz's motorbike,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.120
her water breaks, and she's suddenly going into&nbsp;
labor. But the poor Novi is left to take some of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.440
Marlina's clothes and put them on. Franz and Novi&nbsp;
then settle down at Marlina's house while waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.160
for her arrival. When Franz isn't looking, she&nbsp;
makes preparations for the upcoming standoff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.320
Novi retrieves one of the dead men's machetes then&nbsp;
hides it away in the kitchen. While there, she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.040
finds some of the poisonous fruit still left over.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Franz takes Markus's headless body and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:41.280
positions it in the living room. Now, there are&nbsp;
two corpses in Marlina's living room: on one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:47.840
side is her husband and on the other is Markus.
After dark, Marlina finally arrives, and she finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.560
Novi and Franz waiting for her. Marlina returns&nbsp;
Markus’s head then surrenders her weapon to Franz.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.360
In turn, Franz takes the machete before placing&nbsp;
Markus's head on top of his body. Novi and Marlina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.520
attempt to leave, but Franz orders the two of&nbsp;
them to stay. He has Novi cook him dinner in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.520
the kitchen while Marlina stays with him. Novi&nbsp;
goes inside the kitchen, trying to cook a batch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.280
of poisoned chicken soup, but she faces extreme&nbsp;
difficulty in doing so as she is about to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.680
her baby. While Novi is boiling the water, she&nbsp;
hears Marlina crying for help in the other room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.160
Novi takes the machete that she stashed earlier&nbsp;
and barges into Marlina's room, where she finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.280
Franz lying on top of her. Novi swings down the&nbsp;
machete on Franz's neck, severely injuring him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.040
Marlina manages to slide away from underneath&nbsp;
him, and she holds him down for Novi to deliver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.080
the final blow. In the end, Franz is beheaded the&nbsp;
same way Markus was. Now that everything's over,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.480
the heavily pregnant Novi howls in pain as she&nbsp;
slumps down the floor. Marlina immediately assists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.960
her, and fortunately, Novi manages to deliver&nbsp;
the baby successfully. The two women laugh and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.640
embrace one another, knowing that in the end, the&nbsp;
two of them prevailed in the cruel world of men.
