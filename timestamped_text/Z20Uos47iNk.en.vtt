Horror Mystery film called “Regression”,&nbsp;
Spoilers Ahead, watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.440
The movie starts In the year 1990, in Hoyer&nbsp;
Minnesota, we see, John Gray, praying inside his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.800
car, while outside a Police station. A man calls&nbsp;
out John and signals him to come to his office.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.000
John sits down anxiously, as the deputy informs&nbsp;
him, that his daughter lives in a church with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.600
a man named Reverend Murray. He then shows him a&nbsp;
paper, saying his daughter has already signed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.720
Another man named, Detective Bruce Kenner, enters&nbsp;
the room, and speaks his name as he records their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.840
voice. He places the recording machine near John&nbsp;
and tells him to say his name and occupation.&nbsp;

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.120
The Detective interviews John regarding his&nbsp;
daughter. John claims he has been praying, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.080
he still thinks it is impossible, since he cannot&nbsp;
remember anything. But he is sure of one thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.000
his daughter, Angela, never lies. John then tells&nbsp;
Detective Bruce that Angela has been avoiding him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.960
making him worried. Detective Bruce interrupts and&nbsp;
approaches John and tells him to take the hat off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.600
We see John is going bald because of the&nbsp;
stress. The Detective walks out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.240
room saying John confessed, but he does not&nbsp;
remember, which makes the case confusing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.640
Detective Bruce, claims that John needs a&nbsp;
psychologist, and he needs to meet Angela.&nbsp;

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.680
The next day, Detective Bruce drives&nbsp;
to a house, with many police officers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.760
and he meets a crying woman holding her cat. The&nbsp;
woman is named, Mrs. Gray, Angela's grandmother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.720
Detective Bruce asks her if she knows anything&nbsp;
about the case. She claims that Reverend already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.000
told her, and that her son John, started raging&nbsp;
up, when she asked him about it, She denies all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.720
the claims of police, then Reverend suggests&nbsp;
that Angela should rather stay at the church.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.080
Detective Bruce asks permission to&nbsp;
let him take a look at Angela's room.&nbsp;

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.520
He enters Angela's immaculate room, unlike&nbsp;
the other room. He walks and looks at their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.080
family photo. He hears some noise and he looks&nbsp;
outside the window and learns that the door of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.040
a workshop was making the noise, opening&nbsp;
and closing by itself. An officer named,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.520
George Nesbitt, interrupts him. The officer&nbsp;
suggests that they shouldn’t enter the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.000
without a warrant, but The detective claims that&nbsp;
the lady already allowed them in, He then asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.960
for the son's whereabouts. George claims he left&nbsp;
two years ago and does not know where he is now.&nbsp;

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.040
George insists, that they&nbsp;
should not mention her grandson,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.280
since it is not a good time to discuss it.&nbsp;
Bruce ignores him and proceeds to ask her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.880
if the grandson is running away from&nbsp;
his father, she claims his son held her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.800
hands last night and prayed, and she then&nbsp;
looks at her necklace, with a cross in it.&nbsp;

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.480
Later that night, the rise of people praying to&nbsp;
Satan is mentioned. The police officer George,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.560
who claims to be close with the Gray family,&nbsp;
insists that John cannot force himself on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.080
his own 17 year old daughter Angela. Detective&nbsp;
Bruce says that he heard, Angela is a shy girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.160
George claims he has seen her growing up. He has&nbsp;
seen the way they live. He also concludes that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.200
lost her mom, and maybe she wants to run away&nbsp;
from reality. Bruce questions George's theory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.000
on a seventeen-year-old girl sending her dad to&nbsp;
prison just because she wants to change her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.280
Detective Bruce then sarcastically agrees.
At the police station, the Chief of police,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.120
Mr. Cleveland, asks for a report on John Gray.&nbsp;
A professor named, Kenneth Raines, who is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.320
a psychiatrist claims John's mental state is&nbsp;
normal. They cannot find any reason for his sudden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.720
amnesia, The professor claims that John denied&nbsp;
having a lawyer which means he is not trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.680
protect himself. Bruce mentions that John already&nbsp;
made a confession but he cannot remember what he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.800
did, resulting in the people not believing him,&nbsp;
they speculate he has now repressed his memories,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.200
hiding them at the back of his head, and it is&nbsp;
not easy to find a key to unlock it and provoke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.000
a Regression, He says a famous saying that a&nbsp;
mind is a whole universe. Then he suggests to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.840
use Regressive Hypnosis. Later, Detective Bruce&nbsp;
quotes Angela's confession stating how John forced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.040
himself on her step by step, John feels uneasy&nbsp;
hearing it. Professor Raines, who is also in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.640
room, tells Bruce to reread it and urges John to&nbsp;
concentrate. John begs to God, to ease his pain.&nbsp;

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.400
John is being hypnotized and he sees a vision in&nbsp;
his mind. He then describes it to the Professor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.000
and Detective. Professor is confused on why John&nbsp;
would use the word, he, John says he sees another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.120
man tying to force himself on his daughter to the&nbsp;
bed, but he assumes it is him. Professor Raines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.080
claims he must have let someone in, someone he&nbsp;
knows. As John focuses on the face of the man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.200
he finds himself taking pictures of the man while&nbsp;
he is doing it, he sees George. Detective Bruce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.320
is shocked to hear this, and he runs from there in&nbsp;
sports mode, to find George Nesbitt, he catches up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.720
with him in the parking lot and informs him about&nbsp;
it, that they have the pictures of him doing it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.680
and George is scared, and Bruce arrests him.
Later, the lawyer of George,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.240
she is being aggressive about them accusing&nbsp;
her client and she leaves. Detective Bruce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.040
and Professor Raines leaves the police station to&nbsp;
meet with Angela, to identify George as a suspect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.000
Bruce claims he already suspected George since&nbsp;
the beginning because of his strange behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.840
As they arrive to the church, they meet, Hermione&nbsp;
Granger, I mean, Angela, a gorgeous young woman.&nbsp;

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.600
They inform Angela about the man in her room and&nbsp;
the rituals that her father mentioned. Detective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.040
Bruce lays out photos for Angela to see. Bruce&nbsp;
calmly suggests, if Angela can write it down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.560
Angela is hesitant at first, but she requests&nbsp;
she would do it alone. Then they leave the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.120
to talk with Reverend. He claims he saw her one&nbsp;
day at the church during one of their gatherings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.440
and she started crying suddenly. He claims&nbsp;
that God has spoken to him during that time.&nbsp;

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.880
Later, Bruce reads the paper written by Angela,&nbsp;
and it mentions all the horrors she went through,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.360
He also sees a drawing of an upside-down&nbsp;
cross. He feels disappointed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.760
He questions Angela on who else was&nbsp;
with her father. Angela feels uneasy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.480
but then points out George Nesbitt's photo.&nbsp;
Bruce slowly grabs her hand to comfort her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.800
but she rejects it and she leaves the room&nbsp;
with tears in her eyes. Reverend gives a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.440
paper written by Angela to John, to make him&nbsp;
remember about the satanic ritual he did, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.960
he leaves. Later that night, The chief of police&nbsp;
watches the news at a bar about satanic rituals,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.760
and he calls Bruce and he asks him to turn on&nbsp;
his TV and see the news about satanic ritual.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.320
Few hours later, John is sleeping, and he wakes&nbsp;
up horrified scared from something he saw.&nbsp;

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.920
The next day, the police officers held a&nbsp;
meeting about the case and satanic rituals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.120
A police officer claims he already&nbsp;
red the book and describes it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.720
as like a pile of trash. Bruce claims this case is&nbsp;
complicated, and they should be serious about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.880
After the meeting, Bruce and Cleveland are&nbsp;
talking and Bruce speculates that he feels this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.440
case is a part of something bigger. An officer&nbsp;
interrupts them, claiming they have located&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.720
the whereabouts of John’s Son, who ran away.
Professor Raines and Detective Bruce flies to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.320
Pittsburgh, in order to find Roy Gray. They find&nbsp;
Roy living in an abandoned building with a cat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.120
They inform Roy about his father and the&nbsp;
happenings. Roy claims John practices Satanic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.120
rituals, and made his wife kill herself, from his&nbsp;
drinking problem. Bruce claims the report he saw,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.000
that her mother was killed in a car accident. Roy&nbsp;
then is confused after claiming that these things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.480
did not happen. Professor suggests they might&nbsp;
find the answer through reviewing his memories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:10.320
with hypnotism. As they start, Roy describes,&nbsp;
he is in his room. A bunch of people wearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.520
black hoods surrounds Roy in the bed. He says&nbsp;
their faces are like witches. Professor urges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.160
him to describe what they are doing, but Roy&nbsp;
stops as he is too scared and he breaks down.&nbsp;

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.080
In the plane, Professor Raines claims that&nbsp;
there is something different with his memories,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.600
that he was a child in his vision and&nbsp;
he saw six people doing the ritual,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.920
and there are 6 family members in their house.&nbsp;
Bruce suspects the grandmother Rose Gray.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.840
Later, Police officers are investigating inside&nbsp;
her house, and she is not happy about it. Bruce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.400
informs her that they have talked with Roy, and&nbsp;
she is hiding where the photos are. She then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.680
slaps him in the face, claiming he is lying. She&nbsp;
then runs back into the house, mourning about it.&nbsp;

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.640
Later, Bruce is watching George answering&nbsp;
the questions with a lie detector test.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.000
The chief shows him the FBI report&nbsp;
on Satanists and the rituals,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.840
and they believe it is something bigger.&nbsp;
He then gets a call and he arrives in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.840
hospital. The doctor claims he&nbsp;
wants to inspect Angela's mark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.600
Bruce then enters the room with Angela alone. He&nbsp;
then comforts her with his words. Angela decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.240
to let him see the mark, she lifts the shirt&nbsp;
and the mark is placed on left of her stomach.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.320
She claims the cult will have to kill them&nbsp;
both, since she has now exposed the mark to him.&nbsp;

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.360
Later, Bruce plays the recordings of Angela as&nbsp;
she describes what happened during the ritual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.560
in the house, and it was her grandmother dressed&nbsp;
as satanists. Bruce follows Angela's description,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.600
and imagines the vision in detail. The workshop&nbsp;
door Bruce notices earlier is mentioned,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.480
he enters her dad's workshop, they used to force&nbsp;
themselves on people and torture people in a cell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.680
A woman gives everyone a juice to drink while&nbsp;
saying this is not happening and it’s all a dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.360
They brought out a baby, and they started&nbsp;
stabbing it, and they burned the remains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.440
of the baby and buried them on John's&nbsp;
property. Bruce is absorbed in the vision,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.400
and he feels that they are staring at him. He&nbsp;
then quickly runs outside, and catches his breath.&nbsp;

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.200
In the next meeting, a lot of police&nbsp;
officers are involved to the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.400
Bruce notices Angela in the police station, she&nbsp;
claims someone is following her. Bruce tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.040
that the city is shocked about the news, so it&nbsp;
must be ordinary people who are staring at her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.880
Angela claims further that there is someone&nbsp;
who was following her, right before her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.280
mother died. Bruce suggests he should get her&nbsp;
statement, and walks out to get his recorder.&nbsp;

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.200
Later that night, Bruce drops off Angela to the&nbsp;
church. Angela gives him a bible and claims it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.320
would protect him. She then says goodnight, and&nbsp;
Bruce thanks her for the bible. Bruce drives to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.280
the road slowly where Angela claims someone is&nbsp;
watching her, as he plays the recording of Angela.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.800
Her mother told her it is one of their&nbsp;
tactics to stare at people as a death threat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.440
Sometimes they would call in the middle of the&nbsp;
night and hang up, which served as a warning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.880
an invitation to be one of them.
Bruce is now reading the book that he saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.200
on the television, then suddenly the electricity&nbsp;
cuts off, and he goes to his bed to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:57.440
He then sees a light outside his room, soon, a man&nbsp;
in a black hoodie grabs him and covers his mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.280
as another man injects something on his&nbsp;
arm, he tries to grab the telephone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.800
but the man ties his hands to the bed. A lady in&nbsp;
a red hood is brought. They take off her hood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.920
and she then forces herself on him. The people in&nbsp;
the black hood start taking pictures as the lady&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.520
turns into Rose Gray, the grandmother, with white&nbsp;
eyes and no pupils. Bruce jumps out to realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.320
it was just a nightmare, until the light goes on,&nbsp;
and he sees his telephone hanging below his table.&nbsp;

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.200
Professor and Bruce visits John in the prison,&nbsp;
where he hanged up the drawings of Devil on his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.960
walls. Bruce claims John is the Devil and urges&nbsp;
him to confess about killing his wife. The two men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.320
then proceed to visit Angela in the church with&nbsp;
Rose. Angela sheds a tear, as she claims Rose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.600
does not remember anything during the ritual. Rose&nbsp;
gets mad and grabs her hand, but Bruce stops her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.800
Professor shows her the drawing that John drew&nbsp;
of them stabbing a baby. Rose claims she knows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.280
she will never kill a baby and she rages up.&nbsp;
Reverend suggests he should take her home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.840
Angela continues to cry. Bruce approaches her&nbsp;
and holds her hand. This time she did not reject,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.880
instead, she hold him with her other hand.
On the ride to drop off Rose, she is looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:10.240
at John's drawing. Reverend Claims they are up&nbsp;
against a devil. Rose then sees a picture with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.600
red eyes. Later that night, Bruce receives a call&nbsp;
on the telephone, he assumes it was the Chief,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.840
but no one answers. He then grabs his&nbsp;
gun, and locks the door of his room.&nbsp;

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.360
Rose notices her cat meowing from a distance.&nbsp;
She follows the voice and discovers that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.920
cat is inside the workshop. She points the&nbsp;
flashlight above her cat, and she is scared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.560
to see another cat with red eyes just like what&nbsp;
she saw on the drawings of John. She gets back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:40.240
to house and locks the door. She hears voices&nbsp;
on the TV even when it is already off. She then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.200
sees blood coming out below the doors, cries of a&nbsp;
baby is heard, She then jumps out from the window.&nbsp;

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.480
In the morning, Bruce meets Angela, they are&nbsp;
waiting for Rose to confess and that she is now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:56.240
staying at the hospital. Both of them then sit in&nbsp;
front of her mom’s grave, Emil Gray. Angela lays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.960
her head on Bruce's shoulder. Then they both start&nbsp;
kissing each other, they realize what they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:06.640
doing. Bruce looks behind and discovers Reverend&nbsp;
has seen them. Bruce apologizes and he leaves.&nbsp;

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.800
Later, Roy visits his grandmother in the hospital.&nbsp;
He then orders Bruce not to talk to her anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.080
She is now delirious. He claims Professor&nbsp;
Raines is a fraud as a Psychiatrist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.680
and he also insults Reverend as a&nbsp;
Preacher. He then orders everyone to leave.&nbsp;

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.480
Outside the hospital, Reverend offers&nbsp;
them a necklace with a big cross.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.200
Bruce accepts the necklace, and then Reverend&nbsp;
leaves. Professor claims that Bruce is scared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.640
because he is not using his head anymore. Before&nbsp;
leaving, a man in a hoodie stares at Bruce, making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:42.320
him feel unease. At home, he gets another phone&nbsp;
call but no one answers. It is revealed that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:48.000
was Angela, who was calling him from a payphone.
Bruce gets another nightmare. One men in the black&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.120
hoodie appears to be George. Then he is surrounded&nbsp;
by the group, and he hears a baby crying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.600
he screams, no, as he tries to run away&nbsp;
but discovers himself covered with blood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.480
already killing the baby. The woman offers him a&nbsp;
bowl of blood and tells him this is only a dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.920
Bruce wakes up as he points the gun in front of&nbsp;
him. Later during a redlight, he notices a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:13.280
of people are now staring at him. At the police&nbsp;
station, he discovers that George is now free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:18.800
He panics and grabs his gun, and points it at him.
The Chief and Professor tries to calm him down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.680
in an office. They inform him that George&nbsp;
already cleared the polygraph test twice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.240
Professor explains they have received Angela's&nbsp;
medical report, showing the mark was recent and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.040
self-inflicted. He also explains to Bruce that a&nbsp;
lot of people are staring at him because of how he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.320
looks tired. The Chief suggests he should get some&nbsp;
rest and forget about the case for a few days.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.520
Professor offers him a small pill,&nbsp;
and Bruce puts it in his mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.320
As soon as he gets out of the office, he takes&nbsp;
out the pill, and throws it in the trash.&nbsp;

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.800
Bruce gets in his car and plays the recordings&nbsp;
of John when he first interviewed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.080
Bruce does not notice that a car is following&nbsp;
him. He interviews John once again and he wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:01.680
to know more about the family. John claims it is&nbsp;
about his son Roy. That his son is not straight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.680
and he likes men, which is why he kicked&nbsp;
him out of their house. In their church,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.320
they are called sodomites, sins that people&nbsp;
always learn from some unregulated stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.480
Bruce then realizes John is just taking the&nbsp;
blame for forcing himself on his daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.960
to hide the sins of his son from the church.&nbsp;
John then starts breaking down and he cries.&nbsp;

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:25.280
In a Bar, Bruce rips off his notes as he realizes&nbsp;
they are all worthless. He then looks outside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.920
window, he goes out and he sees a billboard of&nbsp;
the woman, who was handing out blood to drink.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:35.600
He then visits Professor in his house. He explains&nbsp;
the woman in an advertisement, was in his head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.640
He theorises that It is not memories, but&nbsp;
fantasies induced by the police and the people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.920
Professor asks if it is true about George Nesbitt.&nbsp;
Bruce still believes George Nesbitt is guilty,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:51.200
they argue and he leaves. When he arrives back&nbsp;
to his home, two-masked man then attacks him. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.640
gets the upper hand, and he points his gun to the&nbsp;
men, and tells them to unmask themselves. He finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.760
out that the two are, Nesbitt and another police&nbsp;
officer. Bruce claims he would not report this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.520
but instead, he wants to know what&nbsp;
Nesbitt knows. Nesbitt claims he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:10.880
already told him everything, that day in the car.
Bruce then arrives to the church, and he demands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.840
to Reverend, that he needs to meet Angela because&nbsp;
he has already solved the case. Angela comes out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.640
of the room in her nightgown, shedding tears of&nbsp;
joy to hear the news. Bruce asks her questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:26.400
like, if the Satanists forced her to eat the baby,&nbsp;
to Angela to clarify the case. Angela seems to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:32.240
agree to everything he says, but Bruce has nothing&nbsp;
in the notes. He shows them the note. Reverend is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:38.400
shocked, Bruce claims he made it all up. Angela&nbsp;
asks him why he is lying. Bruce explains Angela&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.880
does not love her family. She hates them all,&nbsp;
and thinks they are a bunch of drunk losers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.160
George revealed this to Bruce, that he and&nbsp;
Angela were sleeping together. George rejected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.800
her because he does not want to run away with a&nbsp;
minor. Angela then decided to change her life.&nbsp;

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.760
Reverend still claims Angela is innocent&nbsp;
and says the Lord has already spoken to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.880
Bruce then kicks him out. Bruce claims Angela&nbsp;
wanted to get rid of her family and went too far,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.360
and now she cannot stop. Angela threatens&nbsp;
him, that no one will believe him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.160
especially when she tells everyone, what he did&nbsp;
in the cemetery in front of her mother's grave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.800
Bruce then leaves the church and tells Reverend&nbsp;
he was right all along. Evil does exist.&nbsp;

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:22.000
In the news, a TV reporter states that&nbsp;
the police has no leads with the satanic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.240
ritual. Reverend and Angela are shown on TV,&nbsp;
claiming they saw Satanists killing a baby. Roy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.800
and Rose are in a hospital, they see the news&nbsp;
and they ignore it with dissapointment. Bruce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.760
visits John in the prison, who is confused about&nbsp;
what he saw and what he did not. Bruce explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:43.600
they saw what the police made them believe. It was&nbsp;
all made up. John claims he was drunk entire time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.080
and that ruined their family, it is his&nbsp;
fault for making Angela into what she is now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.960
Bruce claims it was his fault to be stupid, Bruce&nbsp;
wants to help John so he stops punishing himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.000
John demands that he wants to plead guilty and&nbsp;
take the blame, and he is doing this for Angela,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.880
so that one day, she will realize it, and&nbsp;
she will stop hating him. And the movie ends,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:08.000
