00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.750
Hello everyone, this is Mr. Brain Junkie here!

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.920
And today we'll be talking about a fantasy
action film called A writer's Odyssey!

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.160
Be ready for some spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.589
Somewhere far away in the lands of an ancient
city, a little girl's voice can be heard shouting

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.020
for her father inside the underground caves.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.380
A man runs desperately towards the sound of
his daughter, but only see the presence of

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.730
a deity's aura blocking his way.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.119
It turns out that everything was a dream that
belongs to a man called Guan Ning, and his

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.000
daughter Tangerine has been missing for over
6 years.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.920
He waits patiently on the hill top, and eventually
sees a truck driving by on the road, causing

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.820
the man to tremble in fury.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.120
The two men in the vehicle drive slowly in
the fog and suddenly, numerous rocks begin

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.280
to fly towards the truck, breaking the windshields
and knocking off the mirrors.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.180
It's revealed that Guan Ning is responsible
for the attacks as he throw rocks towards

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.739
the men in blinding speed, somehow making
it curve along the way.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.739
The truck crashes towards the side of road
and stops, while Guan Ning rushes towards

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.079
the driver, beating him continuously using
a stick.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.050
He shows the man a picture of his daughter
and demands to know where the driver took

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.560
her, but before the interrogation's over,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.120
the second man come out and knocks Guan Ning
down, giving them a chance to run away.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.360
The police arrive soon after and captures
the the man, confusing Guan Ning as one of

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.410
the human traffickers

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.630
Luckily, he begins attacking one of the officers
when the man was left alone, and manages to

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.530
break free after escaping into a woman's car,

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.010
who seems to have been purposely waiting for
him.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.350
It turns out that the woman's name is Ling,
and she knows every minute details about the

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.650
man, including his reoccurring dreams about
his daughter.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.390
She bring Guan Ning to her office and shows
him that they have located five different

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.310
girls who might be the man's daughter, using
their company's vast resources.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.270
Unfortunately, the man can no long recognize
his child after so many years, preventing

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.810
him to identify his daughter from the pictures.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.570
Ling promises to use their DNA technology
to find the man's daughter, but she also demands

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.770
Guan Ning to complete a task for her superior,
Li, who's also the owner of the company.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.100
Ling is aware of the man's powers to control
projectiles that he throws, and wants the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.229
man to kill a writer named Kong, who uses
himself as the main character for his novel.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.960
Apparently, there's an evil deity called Redmane
in the author's book, and every time the character

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.290
is wounded, her boss also falls into great
illness.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.350
They tried everything to stop the author from
writing the story, but the man refuses to

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.060
comply, and her boss decided that the only
way to end this curse is to end the author's

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.060
life.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.120
Guan Ning has a hard time believing this ridiculous
tale, but he has no choice but to take the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.490
deal, as he sees no other way in finding his
daughter.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.310
The man begins to listen to the audio books
of the author as he travels on boat, and realizes

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.400
that the contents are almost identical to
his dreams.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.530
In the lands that he sees every time he sleeps,
The main character Kong is running away from

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.100
the bounty hunters, who attacks him with supernatural
powers.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.770
He continues to run despite being heavily
wounded, but eventually arrives on edge of

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.620
a cliff, surrounded by enemies who try to
take his life.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.570
Luckily, his sister rushes in to the rescue
and kills the attackers by using her spear.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.730
She tells her brother to run away from the
city, and pushes him over the cliff, causing

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.890
the man to fall into the waters below.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.770
The woman begins fighting the hunters by herself,
slashing at the enemies furiously and dodging

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.150
their attacks with her amazing agility.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.210
She manages to kill many of the soldiers as
their leader watches her from a distance and

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.490
plans to attack.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.490
The old man finally charges in and strikes
at the woman, knocking her backwards using

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.920
incredible strength.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.480
At the same time, Kong has recovered inside
the water, but instead of listening to his

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.400
sister, the man begins climbing back onto
the mountain, unable to leave his family behind.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.910
When he finally makes it back on land, Kong
sees the sister heavily wounded on the ground,

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.890
who still tries to protect him by telling
him to run.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.850
Before the woman can finish talking, the old
man steps on her body and stabs her right

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.360
in the back, killing her in front of her brother.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.130
Kong runs to the woman and cries hopelessly
as he sees her take the last breath, but soon

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.040
realizes that the enemy is also heavily damaged
by the fight.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.490
Apparently, the hunter was hired by the deity
called Redmane, and the man laughs while telling

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.560
Kong that he has nowhere to run.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.190
In a fit of rage, he pulls the spear out from
the man's back, causing the hunter to scream

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.190
in agony.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.630
Kong ignores the man's plead for mercy, and
stabs him right in the heart, finally avenging

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.240
his sister's death.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.560
After burying his family, Kong decides to
go after the evil God instead of running like

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.300
his sister told him, refusing to be the prey
any more.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.620
However, before the man leaves, the armor
from the hunter's body disassembles and rushes

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.070
towards Kong, latching onto him like a parasite
and sucking into his blood vessels.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.850
A horrific eye forms in the center of the
armor, and reveals that this demon was drinking

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.760
from the old man's blood before Kong ended
his life.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.440
The armor finds the man's desire to slay a
deity amusing, and demands to be a spectator

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.300
for the journey, as it shows Kong the way
into the Redmane's temple.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.590
At the same time, Guan Ning has arrived in
the city where the author resides, and eventually

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.510
finds the man leaving his home.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.660
He begins following the writer in order to
isolate the man for the kill, but is quickly

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.630
led to a library instead.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.650
With no other choice, he grabs a book and
tries to blend in, but Kong has noticed the

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.680
stalker very quickly, as the place is basically
empty.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.320
The writer walks over and confronts him by
questioning his motivations, but Guan Ning

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.960
is able to react quickly by claiming to be
one of the author's fans.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.690
Kong is exhilarated by the recognition, and
begins asking a series of question about Guan

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.190
Ning's past, eventually finding out that the
man came all the way across the seas.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.230
Guan Ning's unexpected appearance has apparently
cured the writer's mental block for his new

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.530
character, and Kong begins writing immediately
from the sudden inspiration.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.980
He continues the story where the main character
is traveling across the great seas, avoiding

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.790
the monsters in the waters while he heads
closer to the deity's temple.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.210
Kong eventually arrives inside a city and
sees the people celebrating in a festival,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.860
where colorful statues are being displayed
while the drums are being hammered.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.100
Unsure of what's going go, he follows the
people into the outer edges of town, where

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.160
a giant statue of the Redmane appears in the
center.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.740
The people begin to worship the deity by bowing
continuously, while the statue raises the

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.669
arm and points towards the neighboring town.

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.400
To the man's shock, everyone starts taking
out their weapons and begins chanting the

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.620
God's name, preparing to battle their neighbors
to death.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.120
The demon armor explains that the deity thrives
on humanity's suffering, and is responsible

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.590
for destroying most of the cities, leaving
only two standing.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.730
The townsmen begin to charge across the battlefield,
as the neighboring archers shoot desperately

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.130
at the invaders, killing many of the people
as they fall from the sea of arrows.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.550
However, the tides quickly turns when numerous
dragons made from hot air balloons appear

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.680
and heads towards the neighboring town, scaring
the archers into shooting aimlessly at the

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.680
sky.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.389
The people on the dragons begin to throw numerous
jars of tar onto the enemies below, covering

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:46.910
them with extremely flammable materials.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.160
Flame arrow are quickly shot by the followers
of the evil god, heading towards the enemy's

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.440
gates and creating a sea of fire.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.650
Kong watches in utter disgust as he sees the
people screaming while being burned alive,

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.820
all because of the unholy deity.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.290
After the furious battle, the main character
walks into the city, only to see the men pillaging

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.440
and killing everyone in sight.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.540
Before he can make sense of this reality,
a battle horn sounds from far away, and the

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.870
people all bow down in fear, as multiple knights
in crimson armor rush in on their horses.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.889
Kong watches while hiding behind the buildings
and recognizes their flags as resembling the

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:24.139
mark on the hunters, revealing that the knights
are diciples of the evil god.

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:27.900
The horsemen rides away while sounding the
horns once again, prompting the people to

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.050
run in fear as they scream that the curfew
is in place.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.371
Meanwhile, Guan Ning is trying to lure the
author away from the population centers, so

00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:38.580
that he may have a chance to kill the man
without being noticed.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.540
They head into the abandoned field that's
covered in plants, and Kong begins hearing

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:47.130
a lullaby from the far distance, while Guan
Ning is too tense to notice the music.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:51.639
The author has a sudden inspiration once again
after listening to the song, and immediately

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:54.880
begins writing a new character that's based
on the lyrics.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.009
The novel continues as the main character
chases recklessly behind the red knights,

00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:02.199
and notices a young girl by the alleys trying
to save her friend,

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:05.860
but upon examination, the boy has died a long
time ago.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.979
Kong helps the girl bury her friend, and learns
that the Redmane disallows anyone to leave

00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:14.169
their homes after sunset, threatening to kill
all who disobeys the orders.

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:18.100
The girl begins playing the flute in memory
of the fallen friend, but the music seems

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.830
to have attracted the attention of one of
the knights, who appears quickly at the graveyard.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.680
Thinking that the warrior is here to slay
them for disobeying the curfew, Kong quickly

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.759
runs away with the girl while the knight jumps
towards them and chases closely behind.

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:34.849
They run into the cities and tries to climb
onto the buildings, but the warrior crashes

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:38.829
through the barriers with incredible strength
and leaps onto the rooftops.

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:42.939
Kong tries to carry the girl and run, but
the warrior jumps once again and barely misses

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:46.290
them while breaking through the ceilings and
landing inside the buildings.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.660
The knight continues chasing after them as
he breaks through the walls like paper,

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:54.080
but what he doesn't realize is that Kong plans
to trick him by switching the girl using a

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.080
strawman.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.819
The main character jumps down from the buildings
and barely misses the attacker, sending him

00:08:58.819 --> 00:09:00.440
crashing towards the ground.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.570
The man continues to run while evading the
attacks, but eventually gets trapped by the

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.629
knight as he grabs onto the decoy, revealing
that it's nothing but straws.

00:09:08.629 --> 00:09:12.990
Kong charges at the enemy and lands a direct
hit on the head, but the attack was ineffective

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.269
as the knight recovers quickly and kicks the
man across the field.

00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:20.180
The warrior pulls out the weapon from his
mask, and surprisingly reveals Guan Ning's

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.800
face from underneath.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.580
Before the knight can deal the final blow,
the girl shouts for him to stop, and the warrior

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.300
begins turning around, switching the attention
to the young child.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.949
However, as the sun finally sets, the knight
begins to act strangely as he loses control

00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:38.610
of his body, eventually stopping completely,
giving Kong the chance to escape with the

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:39.610
girl.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.009
At the same time, Guan Ning sneaks behind
the author while the man is engulfed in writing

00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:47.389
the story, but strangely he begins having
visions as if he was chasing the girl in the

00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:48.389
novel.

00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:52.429
Kong eventually realizes that his friend is
missing, but suddenly gets hit by rocks that

00:09:52.429 --> 00:09:55.360
knocks him to the ground, causing him to scream
in pain.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.019
Guan Ning continues throwing the stones, landing
a devastating hit on the writer's forehead,

00:10:00.019 --> 00:10:01.670
knocking the man into the trenches.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.339
He rushes out from behind the buildings and
tries to end the man's life, while singing

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:09.439
the lullaby for his daughter, trying to justify
for his terrible actions.

00:10:09.439 --> 00:10:14.160
Surprisingly, Guan Ning begins hearing the
same song that Kong was talking about earlier,

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.339
and realizes that it's the lullaby only his
daughter would know.

00:10:17.339 --> 00:10:21.920
The man runs quickly as he tries to follow
the music, eventually arriving back into the

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.740
city and sees a homeless boy on the ground,
going through the garbage while singing the

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.740
song.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.230
Guan Ning demands to know where he learned
to sing the lullaby, but the man's extreme

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:35.199
emptions only manages to scare the boy away,
as they both run desperately in the streets.

00:10:35.199 --> 00:10:40.009
The man chases furiously behind the boy, but
he suddenly begins having the visions again,

00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:43.300
like he was chasing the young girl in the
novels as the crimson warrior.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:47.490
Guan Ning ignores the visions and keeps running,
but as the night approaches and the street

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.029
darkens, he eventually losses track of the
young boy as well.

00:10:51.029 --> 00:10:55.000
With no other choice, he calls the writer
to meet up once more, so that he can finally

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.589
finish the job that he stared.

00:10:56.589 --> 00:11:01.589
They meet on the roof top and the author begins
talking about his novel, but surprisingly,

00:11:01.589 --> 00:11:05.470
Kong reveals that he wrote a new character
that's based on Guan Ning, and used the lullaby

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.120
that he heard earlier to construct the little
girl called Tangerine.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.930
Shocked at hearing this revelations, Guan
Ning immediately takes the notes and begins

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:17.870
reading them, realizing that his visions match
perfectly with the Crimson knight's stories.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.920
This means that somehow Kong has created a
parallel universe through his writings and

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.740
made alternative version of characters from
this world, including his own daughter Tangerine.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.980
It would also explain why Li wants to kill
the writer, as the novel has the power to

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.290
affect the events of this world as well.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:38.160
After the epiphany, Guan Ning calls Ling to
tell her that he quit, as he wants Kong to

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.410
finish the book so that his daughter can be
saved in the other world.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:46.030
At the same time, Kong manages to escape the
red knight alongside the girl, and they continue

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.920
across the city that contains nothing but
suffering.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.040
The two eventually arrive inside the girl's
home, where Kong learns that her parents have

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.869
died as well after disobeying the curfew.

00:11:55.869 --> 00:12:00.120
Before they can rest, numerous followers of
the Redmane rushes inside and tries to pillage

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.089
the home, robbing everything that they can.

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:06.889
Tangerine refuses to let go of her parent's
possessions, and plans to fight against the

00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:10.499
evil men while Kong decides to protect the
girl no matter the cost.

00:12:10.499 --> 00:12:15.480
The people charge at them with fury, but suddenly,
Kong's demon armor becomes awakened and slashes

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.569
at the enemies, killing them easily with his
swords.

00:12:18.569 --> 00:12:23.199
The men try to fight back, but the demon strikes
at the people using incredible speed, killing

00:12:23.199 --> 00:12:26.819
them one by one with little efforts, as the
blood flies everywhere.

00:12:26.819 --> 00:12:31.549
The monster's body is immune to normal weapons,
making the attacks against him useless while

00:12:31.549 --> 00:12:34.819
he dismantles the people by slashing them
continuously.

00:12:34.819 --> 00:12:39.589
After killing all the enemies, the armor tries
to launch at Kong as well, but surprisingly,

00:12:39.589 --> 00:12:43.540
he's not able to harm the man in any way,
as his movements are controlled by the main

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.560
character.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.980
Seeing the demon's evil intents, Kong makes
the monster stab himself and forces the creature

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.999
to kneel down, driving the demon into submission.

00:12:51.999 --> 00:12:56.199
The armor realizes that Kong's blood which
he drank must have celestial origins, and

00:12:56.199 --> 00:13:00.139
returns onto the man's body, promising to
never disobey him again.

00:13:00.139 --> 00:13:04.660
With the newly obtained ally, Kong decides
to head straight for the Redmane's temple,

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.839
eventually arriving inside a massive courtyard,
where they find numerous crimson warriors

00:13:08.839 --> 00:13:10.500
sitting on the ground.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.119
Surprised that the enemies did not attack
them on sight, Kong approaches the knights

00:13:14.119 --> 00:13:15.119
carefully,

00:13:15.119 --> 00:13:19.100
and realizes that they are not responsive
at all, allowing him to topple many of them

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.350
as if they are sleeping.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:24.180
It turns out that the purpose of the curfew
was to hide the secrets of the red knights,

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.949
as they all become immobile right after sunset.

00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:31.519
They continue forwards and eventually enters
a large building, and Kong shouts for the

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:35.660
deity to show himself, but hears no response
except for what appears to be drums playing

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.980
in the background.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.110
Suddenly, Tangerine notices something frightening
as the giant statue in front of them begins

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.449
moving, revealing that the drums were actually
heart beats.

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:48.319
The giant deity raises the arms while the
rocks on his body crumble from the deafening

00:13:48.319 --> 00:13:49.470
vibrations.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:53.529
He grabs onto a massive stone and throws it
at the pillars, blocking the exit so that

00:13:53.529 --> 00:13:57.769
no one can escape and demonstrating the incredible
power that he possesses.

00:13:57.769 --> 00:14:02.259
The giant deity charges at the two and stares
at them closely, while they tremble in fear

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:04.459
at the shear mass of their enemy.

00:14:04.459 --> 00:14:08.689
Redmane looks at Kong intriguingly, and begins
smelling the man like an animal, confirming

00:14:08.689 --> 00:14:12.439
that he's in fact the son of Tian, his greatest
rival and friend.

00:14:12.439 --> 00:14:16.939
The deity becomes furious at the thought of
his nemesis, and dares the young man to avenge

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:18.040
his father.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.339
He offers to show Kong the place that he killed
the old man, so that he can kill the son of

00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:25.170
his rival by using the exact same methods.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:29.309
On the other side, Guan Ning has taken the
author back to his home so that the man can

00:14:29.309 --> 00:14:33.680
finish writing the book, but soon finds a
curious picture of Ling's boss, Li on top

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.730
of the shelf.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:38.989
It turns out that Kong's father was the business
partner of Li, and the man was supposedly

00:14:38.989 --> 00:14:42.309
killed during a fatal accident while Li was
also present.

00:14:42.309 --> 00:14:47.309
Guan Ning realizes that Li's true motivations
might be more sinister than previously thought,

00:14:47.309 --> 00:14:50.819
and tells Kong to pack up so that they can
go to a safer place.

00:14:50.819 --> 00:14:54.959
What they don't realize is that Ling has also
heard about their conversations, and finally

00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:59.689
becomes aware of her boss's evil intentions
to hide the truth about his partner's death,

00:14:59.689 --> 00:15:02.279
which was likely not an accident after all.

00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:05.949
Ling calls her boss and demands to know the
truth, but the business man only threatens

00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:10.529
her as a result, assuring the woman that only
bad things can happen to those who betray

00:15:10.529 --> 00:15:11.529
him.

00:15:11.529 --> 00:15:15.540
She goes back to her car and throws away the
phone, planning to quit as well, but is quickly

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.880
knocked unconscious by one of Li's men, who
electrocutes her inside the rain.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.160
Meanwhile, Guan Ning takes Kong to the library,
so that the writer can finish the book while

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.029
he loads up numerous golf balls and prepares
to fight if necessary.

00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:31.859
Just like he predicted, the assassins from
Li followed them to the building, and begins

00:15:31.859 --> 00:15:33.579
attacking the man on sight.

00:15:33.579 --> 00:15:37.949
Guan Ning is able to trick one of the assassins
and lands a direct hit on the man's head,

00:15:37.949 --> 00:15:42.509
but the attack was ineffective as the enemy
manages to recover almost immediately.

00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:47.339
The electricity man pours water on Guan Ning,
and shocks him using high voltages, forcing

00:15:47.339 --> 00:15:51.720
the man to run and tackle the other assassin,
knocking them both onto the floor.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.869
He continues throwing the golf balls at the
assassins, but the electricity man takes a

00:15:55.869 --> 00:15:59.939
giant fan and charges forwards, trying to
slash the man into pieces.

00:15:59.939 --> 00:16:04.470
Luckily, Guan Ning is able to fend off the
two attackers long enough so that he can find

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.609
the chance to escape from being killed.

00:16:06.609 --> 00:16:11.470
However, the electricity man soon discovers
Guan Ning's whereabouts, and corners him with

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:12.720
no where to run.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.119
The assassin approaches closer and tries to
make the kill, but surprisingly, when he touches

00:16:17.119 --> 00:16:20.869
the man, the attack backfires and sends him
flying across the room.

00:16:20.869 --> 00:16:24.819
It turns out that this whole thing was a trap,
and Guan Ning has prepared for this ahead

00:16:24.819 --> 00:16:26.879
of time by insolating his hands.

00:16:26.879 --> 00:16:30.929
Guan Ning goes back to the lobby and strikes
the other man when he's not looking, knocking

00:16:30.929 --> 00:16:32.819
the assassin onto the ground.

00:16:32.819 --> 00:16:37.300
Just when he think the fight is over, the
enemy injects a serum into himself, giving

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.660
him superhuman strength as he knocks the furnitures
flying and jumps out like a beast.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:45.639
The assassin charges at Guan Ning, dodging
all the projectiles and punching the man into

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:46.639
the walls.

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:51.359
Luckily, Ling is able to regain consciousness
and free herself, as Guan Ning is being tossed

00:16:51.359 --> 00:16:52.999
around like a rag doll.

00:16:52.999 --> 00:16:57.410
Before the man can be killed, the woman jumps
onto the assassin and stabs him repeatedly,

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.739
but the attacks are not effective and she's
thrown off very easily.

00:17:00.739 --> 00:17:05.010
She strikes the man multiple times, but the
woman is no match for the assasin's strength,

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:07.190
as she gets pummeled to the floor as well.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:11.150
In the last moment, Guan Ning takes the golf
balls and throws it at the assassin, while

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.690
the man tries to knock the projectiles away.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:18.050
However, it turns out that Guan Ning threw
a trick shot using two balls, and it hit with

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.920
tremendous power, knocking the enemy out.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.630
Meanwhile in the other world, Kong has followed
the Redmane into an open field, where a giant

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.150
tree stands in the middle.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:31.120
The deity tells the young man that this is
where he murdered Tian, so that he can be

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.870
reminded everyday of his best friend's betrayal.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:38.180
The giant launches towards Kong and attacks
using his enormous fist, but the man splits

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.680
up with the armor and charges towards the
God.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:45.120
The two cuts away at the deity's legs, but
eventually misses as the Redmane demonstrates

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.570
incredible speed despite his massive size.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:52.070
The giant retaliates immediately and sends
Kong flying in the air as he barely dodges

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.180
the kick.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.380
Redmane launches at them once again and creates
a massive shockwave, knocking the demon armor

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.510
across the field.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.560
The deity then turns the attention towards
the man and attacks viciously, while Kong

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.750
tries desperately to run for his life.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:09.260
The armor recovers quickly and charges in
to help his friend, slashing furiously at

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.180
the evil god and forcing a temporary stalemate.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.791
Kong takes the chance and jumps down from
the mountain, trying to strike at the deity

00:18:15.791 --> 00:18:20.390
from above, but Redmane is too strong and
counter by knocking both of them away.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:24.750
The giant grabs onto Kong and tries to torture
the man by squeezing him to death, but the

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:29.130
armor manages throw his weapon and cut the
deity's hand, saving his friend in the last

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.130
moment.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:34.860
However, the attack only results in angering
the god even more, as he grabs onto the demon

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.020
armor and crushes the creature into nothing
but dust.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:42.620
Redmane turns the attention towards Kong and
crushes him slowly by using one finger, but

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:47.090
before the man can be killed, the deity hears
a song being played by the girl's flute.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:51.340
He walks towards Tangerine and wonders why
she's playing music at a time like this, as

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.240
she's going to be killed very soon,

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.220
but the girl continues to play as her father
told her that he would come if he ever hears

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.540
her tune.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:03.190
Redmane becomes angry at the child's persistence
and grabs onto her using his tentacles, devouring

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.260
her completely inside his stomach,

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:09.310
but the story pauses right at this moment
as the author hesitates about what to write

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:10.310
next.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:14.330
However, little does he know that a another
assassin is sneaking behind him, waiting to

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.860
strike the man down.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:20.010
Ling hears the struggle upstairs and rushes
to help the author, subduing the attacker

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:24.150
while Guan Ning makes it into the room, but
they're too late as Kong is already heavily

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:25.150
wounded.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:29.000
They call the ambulance right away and sends
the man to the hospital, but Kong's life is

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.360
now at stake and the book was never finished.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.430
To everyone's surprise, Li arrives into the
room and makes the last attempt to bribe the

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:36.430
two,

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.570
offering to give them millions of dollars
if they finish off the writer and keep their

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:40.640
mouths shut.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.980
The man's pathetic attempt at negotiation
is quickly rejected by Ling, as she knocks

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.610
him onto the bed and strikes him across the
face.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:51.970
With no other choice, Guan Ning decides to
finish the novel himself, trying desperately

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:54.100
to save his daughter from the other world.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.250
The story continues as Redmane thinks that
he's won the battle, Knocking Kong away like

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.520
a fly and causing the man to spit out blood,

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:05.290
but soon begins hearing the music once again,
as Tangerine continues to play her flute despite

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:06.310
being devoured.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:10.910
Suddenly, a cloud of red smoke appears out
of nowhere, while Guan Ning from this universe

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:14.000
arrives in the form of the red warrior to
save his daughter.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.800
The man begins firing his Gatling gun towards
the evil god, forcing the deity back and destroying

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.800
his mask.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.610
Guan Ning Continues firing at the Redmane
as the giant tries to run for the hills and

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.620
desperately evade the attacks.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.890
Eventually, the god is able to get closer
and launches at the red knight, knocking the

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.230
man backwards as he drops the massive gun.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:37.090
However, Guan Ning is able to recover quickly
and leaps towards the sky, jumping down with

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:40.370
a devastating strike that cuts off the giant's
fingers.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:44.800
Redmane becomes furious at the mortal and
strikes the man using incredible force, sending

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.550
Guan Ning flying into the walls as he launches
a barrage of punches.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.450
After hearing his daughter's cries, the red
knight gathers all his might and manages to

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:57.020
push back the giant's fist, knocking the monster
away and running quickly towards the massive

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.020
tree.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.650
Kong takes this opportunity and jumps down
towards the god, grabbing onto the creature's

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:06.150
sword on the forehead, and tries desperately
to pull it out, realizing that it's the deity's

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:07.150
weakness.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.911
The giant struggles and tries to stop the
man by using his tentacles, but Guan Ning

00:21:10.911 --> 00:21:13.410
jumps up and grabs onto the weapon as well,

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.370
ripping it out from the god's head and cutting
him across the body, finally defeating their

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.360
enemy as Redmane kneels motionlessly on the
ground.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.110
The deity throws out the girl from his teeth
while the red knight catches her in the last

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:27.130
moment, revealing that tangerine is still
alive.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:31.220
The girl takes off the warrior's helmet and
finally sees her father's face, as the two

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.270
embrace with tears in their eyes.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:37.420
Meanwhile in the other reality, Guan Ning
has finished writing the novel, and the nurse

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.360
reveals that Kong has survived the wounds
on his stomach.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.480
The father looks out from the windows and
suddenly sees something very important, causing

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.750
him to immediately run to the outside.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:50.891
The man rushes out from the hospital and sees
the homeless boy from before along side a

00:21:50.891 --> 00:21:51.970
young girl,

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.390
prompting the man to begin singing the lullaby
as Tangerine slowly turns around, realizing

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.440
that it's her father.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.360
