00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.080
If you were trapped in a house hunted&nbsp;
down by a blind special forces soldier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.480
and you can't make a sound, what would&nbsp;
you do? The characters in this movie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.280
thought robbing a blind man would be an easy&nbsp;
job, only for it to turn into a trap that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.280
takes a surprising turn towards the end.&nbsp;
I'm going to break down the mistakes made,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.520
what you should do, and explain how to&nbsp;
beat the blind soldier in "Don't Breathe."

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.800
Rocky's a small-time burglar, who's trying to make&nbsp;
as much money as she can to leave Detroit and head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.360
to California with her sister. She finds out from&nbsp;
her partner there's a house in skid Row where a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.320
veteran lives alone. And a whole lot of cash is&nbsp;
sitting around inside. She doesn't have a clue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.280
that this will be the last robbery of her life.&nbsp;
The burglars scatter the veterans neighborhood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.160
and spot him outside of walking his dog. And they&nbsp;
notice he has a cane. This man is blind as a bat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.080
The job appears to have gotten a whole lot&nbsp;
easier. But if they took it more seriously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.000
they would have seen a few red flags.&nbsp;
They noticed the cane, but not that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.040
was extremely fit for his age. That means he's&nbsp;
exercising and active. This guy's a war veteran,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.440
with a killer instinct and a body to&nbsp;
match. He probably even sleeps with a gun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.080
and his Rottweiler already has it in for&nbsp;
you. So maybe not as easy as they all think.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.880
Later that night, the team begins their&nbsp;
robbery. They slip the guard dog some sedatives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.560
but find that the front door has several locks&nbsp;
they can't open.- Wait, this doesn't make sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.920
They have the key for the man's home security&nbsp;
company. Why would he have extra locks? So far&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.800
they've been smart about this. Thorough research,&nbsp;
24 hour recording of neighborhood activity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.600
but this is a bad start. Four locks is a sign&nbsp;
that he's not going to make things easy for you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.600
especially since he's a military man. I would&nbsp;
bring brass knuckles or other self-defense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.240
weapons, so that we have a better chance in&nbsp;
a confrontation. Nothing they try works. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.120
side door to the house is locked-shut, and so is&nbsp;
the cellar door. But Rocky spots a window above&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.920
them, and clambers up the side. She breaks in&nbsp;
through the bathroom window and sneaks as fast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.960
as she can then shut off the burglar alarm before&nbsp;
it goes off. This girl knows what she's doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.800
The problem is he's blind, not deaf. Cracking&nbsp;
glass with a rock is noisy, and stomping around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.120
in boots is going to wake him up. The blind&nbsp;
develop enhanced hearing and the ability to track&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.040
movement. Also, the statistical majority of U.S.&nbsp;
soldiers experienced terrible insomnia, and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.080
just lost his daughter. He would definitely be a&nbsp;
light sleeper. Considering who they're up against,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.240
being silent here could save you. For this, they&nbsp;
could have used duct tape. It pads the sound and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.880
keeps most of the glass shards intact. And while&nbsp;
taking your shoes off is smart, it's another loose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.760
end. With everyone inside, they begin searching&nbsp;
the house for the cash. One of the guys enters the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.720
veteran's bedroom where he's about to fill it with&nbsp;
sleeping gas. But the soldier suddenly gets up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.920
It's time to acknowledge that this man is crazy&nbsp;
alert. Just puncturing a plastic bottle wakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.320
him up. If that doesn't change your strategy, then&nbsp;
you might as well write your will and testament.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.560
But it's a lot of money. And if you've come&nbsp;
this far, I wouldn't call it quits just yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.720
What you should do now is lock him in. This could&nbsp;
be done by tying the knob to a heavy piece of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.240
furniture or using a specialized security bar to&nbsp;
force it shut. None of them have found any money,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.040
but they do find this door with some crazy locks&nbsp;
on it. They try forcing it to open with a pry bar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.520
and when that doesn't work, one of the burglars&nbsp;
pulls out a gun and shoots the lock off.&nbsp;

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.360
Alex here begins to realize this&nbsp;
can only end badly for them. So far,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.320
they broke into his house, damaged his property,&nbsp;
and brought a gun into the home of a veteran,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.640
with superior skill and knowledge and firearms.&nbsp;
The castle law dictates this guy could defend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.560
his home. And if you think shooting into a&nbsp;
plastic bottle is going to keep it quiet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.440
you're dead wrong. The best homemade silencer&nbsp;
would be a modified oil filter. It might be bulky,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.800
but it's gonna do the job. Alex decides enough is&nbsp;
enough and leaves. And he's the only one thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.800
straight because things are about to go&nbsp;
terribly wrong. As a blind man suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.520
appears behind them. And they're definitely&nbsp;
underestimating how much this Gulf war vet can do.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.760
The burglar tells him he just stumbled and&nbsp;
drunk. But the vet steps on the broken bolt lock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.640
and knows exactly what it is. He threatens him&nbsp;
with his gun, shooting a warning shot, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.440
alerts Alex outside. He moves in, grabs the gun&nbsp;
and disarms it. It's officially time to freak out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.120
They're completely outmatched. He slammed the gun&nbsp;
to his neck, asking one simple question, who else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.840
is with you? In this moment, we need to take stock&nbsp;
of some important facts. You won't overpower him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.840
you can't sneak up on him, you can't find&nbsp;
the money and there is no way to save your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.960
friend. If you're the first to bolt? You might get&nbsp;
away. Heartless. I know, but that's the life of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.440
criminal. He will definitely shoot if he hears you&nbsp;
running. So, I'd throw something as a diversion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.560
stay low to the ground and spring for the door. If&nbsp;
I'm still alive, I can make new friends and never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.760
mentioned this to anyone. Instead, they all panic&nbsp;
and solidarity. The burglar tells him that he came&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.760
alone and gets promptly shot. Horrified, Rocky&nbsp;
hides herself in a closet. As Alex comes back in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.720
and finds the blind guy is locking things down.&nbsp;
Literally locking the door-shut, and boarding-up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.320
the broken window. This is terrifying, but he has&nbsp;
a shot here. The gun is near the sink within arm's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.120
reach. I would grab it and shoot him dead, wipe&nbsp;
the prints and place it in the hands of my dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.520
friend. That's at least what I like to do but&nbsp;
I'm way too much of a coward for that. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.320
just close our eyes and hope this all goes away.
From the closet Rocky sees the veteran open a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.360
safe and input the pin code. A simple four&nbsp;
digit combo. That's going to pay off big.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.040
Alex finds her, and together they discover that&nbsp;
inside the safe are bundles of cash. Now they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.120
got what they came for, but how are they going to&nbsp;
leave? Remembering that there is a storm cellar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.840
outside, they head for the door only, to find&nbsp;
the veteran blocking their only escape plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.520
He begins to drag the dead body out, but as they&nbsp;
slowly back away, he hears the floorboard creek.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.640
Wood floors are impossible to beat. It's too late&nbsp;
for WD 40. The only option is to cover your mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.080
and stay breathless and motionless until he leaves&nbsp;
the room. That's what I would do. But the truth is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.960
it might get me killed just as quickly. When your&nbsp;
heart is racing, it's using up your body's oxygen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.280
reserves making it very difficult to hold&nbsp;
your breath for long. The right strategy is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.760
to breathe through your mouth slowly as it's&nbsp;
less noisy, because it's a wider air passage.&nbsp;

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.160
The burglars phone goes off and he shoots at it.&nbsp;
It's a distraction that saves their life. And if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.200
I'm seeing this, I'm losing all hope. His aim was&nbsp;
incredible for a blind man. It definitely makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.840
running for an exit, a bad strategy. He continues&nbsp;
carrying the body out of the room. Giving them the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.840
chance to find a way out. But they're about&nbsp;
to find a horrifying surprise awaiting them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.400
in the basement. They can barely see anything.&nbsp;
They're stumbling around with no exit in sight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.000
When out of nowhere, a woman leaps at them.&nbsp;
She's gagged, tied up and chained to a wall.&nbsp;

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.080
This just got way more intense.&nbsp;
Killing an armed burglar is one thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.880
but this is insane. They now understand who&nbsp;
they're dealing with. A psycho-killer, who plays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.000
by his own rules. And upstairs, he just figured&nbsp;
out, that these guys are still in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.200
I told you those shoes are a bad idea. Rocky goes&nbsp;
to rescue her, and realizes that she's the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.880
who killed the blind man's daughter. This is his&nbsp;
revenge. She directs them to a safe, and lucky for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.760
them. He used the same combo. Inside they find&nbsp;
keys and used them to free her. Not realizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.840
this kind of act, was their biggest mistake&nbsp;
of the night. Now it's good to help people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.640
but right now it's not smart. Escape gets a&nbsp;
lot harder with three people, let alone two.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.880
And it's strange they never think to take off her&nbsp;
gag. She might have told us about the bell she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.960
rigged with. And from there, an ambush could be&nbsp;
planned by luring him down with it. As long as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.280
we stay silent, we've a chance to knock him out&nbsp;
and lock him in. But let's not kid ourselves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.800
this is a gamble because if you have&nbsp;
to fight him, you've already lost.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.720
The cellar door gets unlocked and the man starts&nbsp;
firing grazing Alex, shooting at Rocky. As she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.440
breaks her phone and accidentally killing the&nbsp;
girl, they were trying to rescue. Taking cover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.400
they retreat into the basement. The man cautiously&nbsp;
steps down and slips in blood, realizing the woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.600
is dead and begins crying. This is not what you'd&nbsp;
expect If she killed his daughter, there might be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.240
more to this than it seems. They watched from the&nbsp;
shadows as the blind man locks the door and breaks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.200
the Key in the hole. Guaranteeing no scape. The&nbsp;
burglar's only plan left is to make a break for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.000
the other room and get to the front door. But&nbsp;
suddenly, all the lights in the basement go off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.400
It's pitch-black and they have to reach out&nbsp;
to find their way around, while the veteran is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.280
literally sprinting through the dark corridors.&nbsp;
It's the perfect death trap for a blind man. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.160
starts firing at them and taking cover. The two&nbsp;
split up as they try to navigate the basement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.320
Rocky moves along the shelf, and has no idea&nbsp;
that she's about to bump into the veteran. She's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.440
practically breathing on them and is only saved&nbsp;
by Alex's calls, luring the blind man towards him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.240
The veteran somehow finds out and grabs him,&nbsp;
shoving a gun against his head. But realizing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.480
gun is empty, he starts strangling him. Luckily&nbsp;
he's able to knock a shelf onto the veteran&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.360
before running away to get the girl. we've lost&nbsp;
our single advantage over him. Sight. How do we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.560
escape? You can start by confirming where he is.&nbsp;
Draw him in for noise in height, on a lower shelf,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.560
to hear him walk by. Effectively mapping part&nbsp;
of the room for you, to run in the opposite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.680
direction. He has the whole place memorized but he&nbsp;
will follow what he hears. Once he's distracted,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.680
make your way towards the light quickly. They&nbsp;
scrambled to get out of the basement in gen the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.400
door's shut. but find themselves staring down&nbsp;
a massive Rottweiler. Rocky goes to unlock the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.760
front door while Alex tries his best to keep the&nbsp;
dog calm. He knew these exceeds, until the veteran&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.880
tries to break down the basement door, setting the&nbsp;
dog into attack mode, and forcing them upstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.600
They barricade themselves in one of the bedrooms&nbsp;
and try to escape through the windows. But they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:21.360
barred. It's a bad situation that only gets worse.&nbsp;
As the veteran start to break in through the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.120
Alex suggests pressing the panic button on&nbsp;
his remote, making the point that the cops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.360
will overlook their robbery, when they discovered&nbsp;
that this man is a murdering psychopath. And he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:35.200
right, this lets them live, but not keep the cash,&nbsp;
something Rocky isn't willing to do. The vet is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.280
still pushing through and they're running out of&nbsp;
time. But they suddenly spot an air vent above,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.600
that's big enough for one of them to slip&nbsp;
through. Rocky squeezes into the crawl space,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.320
just as the dog Rams Alex, knocking him out of&nbsp;
the window and on the skylight below. As if that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.880
wasn't enough, the psycho-dog then climbs its way&nbsp;
into the shaft and makes its way towards Rocky,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.840
to finish the job. With no other option, she&nbsp;
throws herself down the shaft head-first slamming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.960
into the ground. Alex is dangerously suspended&nbsp;
on the skylight. He tries moving slowly as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.360
glass cracks under him, but looks up only to see&nbsp;
the blind man shoot the glass, holding him up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.600
sending him falling to the ground. Hurt from&nbsp;
the fall, he walks through the house, trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:17.840
use his remote to activate the burglar alarm. Now&nbsp;
it's risky, but we now have an open path outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.960
I might have tried going back up to the&nbsp;
skylight. We'd be wearing gloves so we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.040
wouldn't get cut too badly and judging by&nbsp;
their height, It's possible to jump up to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.600
but it's too late because the blind man finds&nbsp;
them first and fires his revolver, forcing him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.160
to hide in this laundry room right next to his&nbsp;
friend's corpse. The veteran tracks into the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.240
but gets ambushed and disarmed, but he should&nbsp;
have gone straight for his head because he grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.200
Alex who quickly gets overpowered and beats the&nbsp;
snot out of him. But the washing machines turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.560
on disorientating the man. Alex takes his chance&nbsp;
and reaches for the gun on the floor. Now, if I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.800
was in this situation with my honed abilities,&nbsp;
as a coward, I would have run out of the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.280
but kicks the gun out with me. Get out of the&nbsp;
closed space because it forces you to fight him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.920
And you won't win that. The veteran manages to&nbsp;
turn off the washing machines and stop Alex from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.800
grabbing the gun. Rowing punch after punch, before&nbsp;
finishing the burglar off with garden sheers.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.040
Recovering from her fall, Rocky struggles&nbsp;
to reach the end of the ventilation shaft&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.120
that leads straight out of the house. She's able&nbsp;
to turn herself around and kick out the grate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:22.080
but it's too late. She's ripped out of the&nbsp;
crawl space by the veteran and gets knocked out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.640
She wakes up, locked into the same harness as&nbsp;
the woman before her. The veteran very clearly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.960
tells her, he won't let her go after what she's&nbsp;
done and intends to keep her as a replacement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.920
For what exactly? A baby maker. He was using&nbsp;
the woman, to make a new daughter for him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.800
to replace the one she had killed. Rocky is&nbsp;
gonna stay with him for the next nine months.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.840
It's almost impossible to escape from this, unless&nbsp;
you're prepared in advance. Handcuffs have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.320
universal one-fits all lock. If you're a criminal,&nbsp;
they'll likely come in handy. You can tuck it in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.800
your waistband to access when you're cuffed. It's&nbsp;
looking hopeless for her. The blind man has one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.840
and there's nothing she can do. But upstairs Alex&nbsp;
gets up from the floor. He's still alive. Because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.960
the other burglar's body was stabbed instead&nbsp;
of his. Now he has his best chance to escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.480
With some quick thinking, he's able to trick&nbsp;
and lock the dog inside the laundry room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:13.280
giving him time to unlock and open the front&nbsp;
door. He needs to leave. It's not about money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:18.480
anymore. This is pure survival. If both of you are&nbsp;
caught, it won't help anyone. He's had the drop on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:24.640
you at every turn. And without even being able to&nbsp;
see. Get out and get help. Back in the basement,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.120
the veteran disposes of the girl's corpse and&nbsp;
hoists up Rocky to prepare her for what's to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.000
come. Now, he's not going to force himself&nbsp;
on her. A whole no. It's way worse. He grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.280
his bottle of frozen GU from a fridge, gets it&nbsp;
nice and warm and fills a turkey baster with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.680
It's an absolutely horrifying moment for Rocky&nbsp;
who tries to rip her way out of the harness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.560
but there's no escape. This is going to happen.&nbsp;
Just as she's given up all hope. Blood splatters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.520
on her face and the blind man gets knocked away&nbsp;
by Alex. He came back to set her free taking the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.880
cuffs off and placing them on him. She swears that&nbsp;
she'll get the veteran arrested but Alex points&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:04.160
out that it would end badly. They've broken into&nbsp;
his house, stolen his money and assaulted him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.920
It would be child's play for the guy to turn&nbsp;
the cops against them. They have to let him go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.640
If they want to get away. It appears to be over,&nbsp;
but just as they make it back upstairs and open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:18.000
the front door, Alex gets killed by the blind man.&nbsp;
Leaving Rocky, the sole survivor who makes it out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.880
of the house. It seems like she's safe, but then&nbsp;
his dog comes bolting out of the house. You can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.200
out run a Rottweiler. It's not going to happen.&nbsp;
If you're being chased by a dog standing still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.240
and slowly walking away, will usually work in this&nbsp;
situation, but this dog might be related to Cujo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.320
So I can't blame her for running. But she might've&nbsp;
had a better chance to run around the back of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.800
house where there's more cover, and more obstacles&nbsp;
to put as much between yourself and this crazy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.840
canine as you can. It chases her all the way&nbsp;
back to her car. It snags ahold of the money bag,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.000
leaving her stuck inside and to make matters&nbsp;
worse. She dropped the money outside the car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.200
the keys are nowhere to be found she's trapped.&nbsp;
But she comes up with an ingenious plan that would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.440
have made MacGyver proud. She opens up the trunk&nbsp;
to lure the dog inside and then yanks on the rope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.400
she attached to trap him in, while at the same&nbsp;
time pushing the passenger seats back into place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:09.280
Effectively caging the dog, at least for&nbsp;
a moment it before rips its way out, man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:14.560
this dog has no chill. It gets so close that it's&nbsp;
almost able to bite her and this gives her the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.040
chance to hook the release latch onto the dog's&nbsp;
callus, pulling it back, and giving her the space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.760
to get out and grab the bag. Now, if only she was&nbsp;
a bit more careful, she would have gotten away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:29.680
Dragged back to the house and dropped by, next to&nbsp;
Alex's corpse. It's utterly hopeless. but maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.640
she's got one last trick up her sleeve. She grabs&nbsp;
Alex's remote and activates the panic button.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.720
Alarms are blaring throughout the house and&nbsp;
overwhelm the veteran. Rocky picks up a pry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:43.680
bar and blitzes the blind man. Hitting him as she&nbsp;
cleverly takes advantage of his confusion. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.480
just as she's about to land, one more blow, the&nbsp;
alarm shuts off. The veteran hears the floorboard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:54.160
Creek behind him, and he turns, but he's too slow&nbsp;
on the draw. It gets sent flying. Knocked into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.200
basement floor, where his gun goes off, shooting a&nbsp;
leaky hole into himself during the fall, she takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.760
a breath as if for the first time, all night.&nbsp;
With the money in hand and the veteran dead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.320
Rocky leaves the house, just in time before the&nbsp;
police arrive. Later, as she and her sister are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.880
waiting at a train station, she sees a news report&nbsp;
about the robbery. There's no mention of her or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:18.400
any money being stolen, but the veteran is still&nbsp;
alive recovering in the hospital. He hasn't told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.840
anyone about what really happened. But who knows&nbsp;
what he'll do once he's finally out. But what do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.480
you think? How would you beat the blind soldier?&nbsp;
Let me know, with a comment down below. Thank you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.960
so much for watching, leave a like and subscribe.&nbsp;
And until next time have a damn good day.
