00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.960
People throughout the world pour out into the&nbsp;
streets to celebrate a very special occasion-&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.600
the night of the comet's passage. No one would&nbsp;
miss the chance to see the stunning event.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.680
The following morning, the sky is&nbsp;
strangely covered with a dark reddish mist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.160
and there is no sign of life except piles&nbsp;
of red dust and clothes all over the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.000
Where were the crowds last night? This is Movie&nbsp;
Shortens. Follow us to the movie titled: Night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of the Comet. Be aware: there are spoilers.
There are high chances the planet Earth will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.800
face a Comet, which has not occured in&nbsp;
65 million years. A few scientists see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.360
this as more than just a coincidence. They&nbsp;
believe it would cause mass extinctions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.480
so they lock themselves in a bunker outside Los&nbsp;
Angeles. However, most people choose to party&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.440
all night for this one in a lifetime event.
During the night, Regina, an usher at a movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.240
theater, ignores her boss and focuses&nbsp;
on playing arcade games. She then makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.440
a phone call home lying that she’ll be with her&nbsp;
science class for the comet observation. Instead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.560
she sneaks into a steel-lined projection room and&nbsp;
has a fun night with her boyfriend Larry, who also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.520
works at the theater as a projectionist.
At home, Regina’s sister named Samantha has a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.160
fight with Doris, their stepmother. The girl&nbsp;
accuses Doris for cheating on her father,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.120
who is away for work at the military base. Doris&nbsp;
hurts Samantha and sends her out of the house.
&nbsp;

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.360
The following morning, Larry wakes Regina up,&nbsp;
telling her that he’ll go home and shower.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.200
As Larry opens the door, a zombie&nbsp;
attacks and drags him outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.440
Regina stays back to continue her gam. Later, she&nbsp;
decides to leave the theater, only to find the sky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.800
is in a strange shade of red and lots of clothes&nbsp;
are left on the street. On the way home, she finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.480
Larry’s motorbike abandoned nearby. Suddenly,&nbsp;
there is a zombie approaching her. As trained&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.080
self-defense by her dad, Regina fights back the&nbsp;
zombie, managing to drive off on Larry’s bike.
&nbsp;

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.120
On the streets, there is no vehicle and traffic,&nbsp;
only red dust and abandoned clothes on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.440
sidewalks. Regina soon realizes there is something&nbsp;
very unusual today. Regina rushs to go home to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.520
check on her sister, only to find the house is&nbsp;
empty. Getting upstairs, she runs into Samantha,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.920
who doesn’t realize what is happening yet.&nbsp;
Samamthan tells Regina that she spent a night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.960
out in the family storage shed after fighting with&nbsp;
Doris. She then takes some breakfast as usual and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.760
complains Regina about her terrible look today.&nbsp;
Regina explains to her sister the fact that there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.600
is nobody left in the city, but Samantha doesn’t&nbsp;
trust it. Regina has to drag Samantha out and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.200
show her the reality. She picks up Doris’s outfits&nbsp;
on the ground and proves Samantha what she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.360
Samantha steps back into the house, having&nbsp;
a hard time accepting the truth. 
&nbsp;

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.320
As the two hear the radio is operating, they&nbsp;
decide to drive to the radio station to see if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.600
there is anyone. The sisters learn that the radio&nbsp;
programs are actually set up in advance and run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.640
automatically. All of a sudden, a man named Gomez&nbsp;
holding a gun pointed at the two, thinking they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.600
are zombidized humans. He forces the girls to show&nbsp;
up their faces with their eyes open in the light&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.400
to make sure they are real humans. Convinced&nbsp;
by the girls, Gomez reveals about the current&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.240
situation they are in. He is a truck driver. As&nbsp;
being exhausted, he spent a night in the back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.440
of the truck until he woke up and found the city&nbsp;
was completely deserted. He saw people being torn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.560
apart for flesh by zombies. They attack all the&nbsp;
living things around them, including pets. 
&nbsp;

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.760
At this point, Regina becomes shocked, knowing&nbsp;
Larry was eaten. Gomez stands in front of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.560
ladies room to make sure Regina is alright. She&nbsp;
tells him that they’ll be killed soon by those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.840
monsters. Gomez; however, believes there&nbsp;
are probably more survivors like the trio.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.320
He gives Regina a gun and decides to make&nbsp;
their way to the military base in Honduras,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.040
hoping to meet Regina’s father there. Gomez&nbsp;
also wants to check on his parents on the way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.200
if they are alive in San Diego. 
Meanwhile, Samantha decides to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.040
on the air and asks anyone who is&nbsp;
still alive to phone the station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.680
She then runs to the ladies room to inform&nbsp;
Regina and Gomez that she’s got a phone call.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.400
It turns out to be the phone call from the group&nbsp;
of scientists at the bunker outside Los Angeles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.760
Samantha tells the two, as told by the scientists,&nbsp;
that the comet has caused most of the population&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.640
to turn to red dust. Those who only got&nbsp;
partial exposure will turn to zombies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.440
eventually they will become dust. The trio is&nbsp;
advised to stay where they are and a rescue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.560
team would be sent tomorrow at the earliest.
Meanwhile at the bunker, the scientists still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.640
hear the conversation from Gomez and&nbsp;
the sisters. One of the scientists,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.760
Dr Audrey argues with Dr Carter that it is too&nbsp;
dangerous to take the survivors in the bunker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.400
because they might be infected and soon will&nbsp;
transform. Carter insists that they do not have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.120
a choice now. The survivors need somewhere safe&nbsp;
to hide and maybe their blood may be a cure. 
&nbsp;

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.640
Back to the radio station, Samantha has&nbsp;
nightmares about the zombies attacking her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.720
Regina and Gomez both comfort her to stay calm and&nbsp;
wait for the rescue team. Later, Regina and Gomez&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.000
sit together and talk about their lives before the&nbsp;
disaster. Knowing Gomez will not follow the rescue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.440
team but to go to San Diego for his parents,&nbsp;
Regina advises him to be with her and Samantha.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.400
However, Gomez is very firm about his decision&nbsp;
and promises Regina that he’ll be back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.280
The two share a lot of fun together while Samantha&nbsp;
is alone and notices some rash on her body.
&nbsp;

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.120
The following morning, to make Samantha feel&nbsp;
better, Regina suggests they practice shooting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.760
as their father used to teach them. Just then,&nbsp;
Samantha reveals to be jealous about Regina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.560
and Gomez. She thinks Regina always tries&nbsp;
to steal good things from her, even now as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.680
Gomez is probably the last human man on Earth.&nbsp;
However, the two sisters become friends again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.640
realizing they are fighting over a strange man&nbsp;
who is now gone with his truck to San Diego.
&nbsp;

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.360
Arriving at the family house, Gomez enters&nbsp;
and learns that his parents didn’t make it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.920
just like most people in the country. While&nbsp;
collecting some items in the house for mementoes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.600
Gomez is chased by a kid zombie.&nbsp;
Can’t shoot at the little boy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.320
Gomez finds the way to escape. He runs&nbsp;
as fast as he can out of the house.
&nbsp;

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.800
Back in the city, Regina and Samantha are&nbsp;
enjoying their fancy outfits in the shopping mall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.200
which they could never afford in the past. They&nbsp;
don’t realize their fun time is monitored over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.520
a camera by a group of former stock&nbsp;
boys, who claim they own the stores.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.240
The leader of the boys mocks the sisters on the&nbsp;
phone, alarming the girls. Regina immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.360
holds the guns and watches for the men while&nbsp;
Samantha distracts them to buy her sister time.
&nbsp;

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.200
Regina appears to be a very pro shooter. However,&nbsp;
on the way down the stairs, Samantha is captured&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.960
by the boys. Surprisingly, Regina also holds&nbsp;
one boy as a hostage, and requires them to let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.160
go of Samantha in return. The leader cruelly&nbsp;
opens fire at his hostage man instead. 
&nbsp;

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.480
Outside the street, the rescue team has arrived&nbsp;
on their helicopter, but they don’t see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.920
sisters as planned. Audrey is pissed and asks&nbsp;
to leave when seeing nobody alive in the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.160
Carter again tells the team to spread&nbsp;
out and look for the survivors around.
&nbsp;

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.120
Coming back to the store, Regina&nbsp;
and Samantha are tied up. The head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.160
stock boy removes his sunglasses, showing&nbsp;
that the boys have been partially exposed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.360
and are turning to zombies. As they are about to&nbsp;
torture the two girls, the scientists make it on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.680
time and pull the triggers at the zombie&nbsp;
boys. The sisters are finally rescued.
&nbsp;

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.320
The scientists, seeing Samantha itching,&nbsp;
assume she has been partly exposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.880
They do not tell her that, but tell her&nbsp;
to wait with Audrey and another scientist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.320
Oscar, for Gomez to come back. Regina gets on&nbsp;
the helicopter to head to the bunker first.
&nbsp;

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.440
After that, Samantha sits with Audrey and explains&nbsp;
that she’ll get rash if she becomes nervous.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.560
However, Audrey still sedates her. When Oscar&nbsp;
tries to understand why Audrey always makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.440
it tough on the survivors, he gets shot in&nbsp;
the head immediately. Audrey now has enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.000
with saving those turning survivors. 
Just a moment later, Gomez enters the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.840
radio station where he promised Regina to come&nbsp;
back. There, Audrey is already waiting for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:53.680
She tells Gomez that all the remaining humans are&nbsp;
exposed and soon will become zombies in 36 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.720
There is no serum invented&nbsp;
from the survivors anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.720
She then injects a toxin into her body,&nbsp;
attempting to die as a real human. 
&nbsp;

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Meanwhile at the bunker, Regina&nbsp;
is informed that Samantha is dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.800
She doesn’t believe it and manages to knock a&nbsp;
staff out, trying to escape from the bunker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.600
The scientists are now rushing to take blood from&nbsp;
the survivors to create the cure for them.
&nbsp;

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.400
At the fence outside the bunker, Samantha&nbsp;
is actually alright as Audrey only gave her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.200
a sedative. Gomez drives her to the&nbsp;
bunker. They trick and knock out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.480
guard to get inside the bunker for Regina.
At the shelter, Regina finds that the scientists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:36.160
are about to sedate two kids, apparently using&nbsp;
them as blood donors for the vaccin. Samantha&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.120
also reunites with Regina soon after that. 
When the scientists arrive at the operating room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.080
they only find the nurses are being chained&nbsp;
up on the tables. The sisters and kids have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.960
made it out of the bunker. They jump on&nbsp;
Gomez’s car, who has waited outside.
&nbsp;

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.560
As the group of zombidized scientists get on a&nbsp;
truck to chase the survivors, the truck explodes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:02.800
because Gomez has already set up a bomb there.
Back to downtown L.A, Gomez, the sisters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.920
and the kids decide to live as a family. The&nbsp;
sky is no longer deep in red clouds and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.280
rain washes all the dust away. Samantha runs&nbsp;
into a handsome boy, who is also a survivor.
