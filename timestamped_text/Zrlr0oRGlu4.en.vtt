00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.920
everyone in japan has disappeared and now you're&nbsp;
trapped in a deserted city and forced to compete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.400
in deadly games where every mistake is fatal&nbsp;
everything in this world is designed to kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.800
you but we can outsmart it with five simple&nbsp;
rules to stay alive by the end i will show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.040
you how to beat every single death game that&nbsp;
they have to face i'm going to break down the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.960
mistakes made which you should do in how to&nbsp;
beat the death games of alice in borderland

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.680
we meet this guy resu who's living life one game&nbsp;
at a time he looks like a loser but looks can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.240
deceiving he's an experienced gamer which makes&nbsp;
him a strategist he reads textbooks on math he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.120
familiar with mechanics and this digital dexterity&nbsp;
is impressive now this might look like a useless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.280
hobby but these games train your brain to make&nbsp;
fast and practical decisions in high pressure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.320
situations also being told you're a disappointment&nbsp;
every day by your family is going to put a serious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.640
chip on your shoulder and sometimes you just need&nbsp;
the right scenario to unlock that part of you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.440
he joins his friend kurubi the bartender and chota&nbsp;
nit guy all of them have had some bad luck today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.440
and wish they could hit the recent button on their&nbsp;
crappy lives karubi here imagines what they would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.000
do in a zombie outbreak and is convinced that his&nbsp;
friend arisu has the most potential to survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.600
this guy seems to understand everyone's strengths&nbsp;
and weaknesses and this immediately makes him a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.320
leader when things go bad he does have a massive&nbsp;
weakness however and that's situational awareness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.800
as they run out of the road the it guy hears a&nbsp;
loud boom from what looks like strange fireworks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.440
the noise gets the attention of everyone else on&nbsp;
the sidewalk including the station police thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.520
they're in trouble they hide in a bathroom stall&nbsp;
the lights go out mysteriously and don't come back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.640
on and everything outside has gone quiet what just&nbsp;
happened the friends leave the stall to find the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.680
entire city is completely abandoned what's even&nbsp;
creepier is that their phones aren't even working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.560
this is seriously unsettling but the&nbsp;
important thing right now is to stay calm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.960
there's a lot of information out there because we&nbsp;
have a whole city to ourselves we don't know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.000
else has disappeared so i would scout the city to&nbsp;
look for food fire water animals and any signs of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
life we won't find all the answers but at least&nbsp;
we can't confirm what we have to work with in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.480
this new reality that night a nearby building&nbsp;
lights up with a message welcoming players to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.560
a game and guiding them to the gm building the&nbsp;
only place in the neighborhood with any power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.520
okay we obviously shouldn't trust any of this&nbsp;
so i first want some protection i'd also grab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.080
a battery-powered flashlight and a backpack before&nbsp;
investigating what's out there they arrive to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.960
location but nobody is there now i would scatter&nbsp;
the perimeter of the building before entering we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.280
have no idea what this is and we might find out&nbsp;
more from our surroundings they enter the building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.680
and only pass through lasers trapping themselves&nbsp;
inside where they find a table full of phones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.680
they actually work and they all have facial&nbsp;
recognition but they don't have any signal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.560
this is highly suspicious a computerized voice&nbsp;
starts a two-minute countdown waiting for other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.360
players to join that's when this foxy lady waltzes&nbsp;
in and drops a truth bomb there are no players in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.640
the game and running away is not an option this&nbsp;
guy's id tag got shot with a laser and it came&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.320
straight down through the top of the building&nbsp;
but it's important to keep calm because critical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.720
thinking and observation will be more important&nbsp;
to you than ever before if we were cautious and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.960
been more suspicious of our surroundings we might&nbsp;
have expected that these lights will learn us here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.880
for a reason we won't survive this new world&nbsp;
without learning how to be observant of every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.840
detail no matter how small another girl runs&nbsp;
in and passes laser grid trapping herself in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.720
with the rest of them if this is a game then&nbsp;
these are either our teammates or opponents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.960
now everything must be thought about in terms of&nbsp;
competition and survival and whoever realizes this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.360
first will have the advantage i would immediately&nbsp;
start looking for weaknesses in my opponents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.440
this woman is dressed to impress but it means&nbsp;
she's more about perception than practicality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.360
she also knows a lot but doesn't seem helpful so&nbsp;
she won't share knowledge without a trade-off for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.240
her benefit and all this means we can't trust&nbsp;
her at all they step out of the elevator into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.960
a square room with two doors live and die and all&nbsp;
they have to do is pick the correct one within the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.200
time limit it's got a difficulty rating of three&nbsp;
of clubs and if they win they'll be released from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.760
the building the it guy starts recording from his&nbsp;
phone this is a great idea because they can keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.600
track of information as it happens but they should&nbsp;
have been doing this from the very beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.200
the woman tells them to choose the door on&nbsp;
the right but doesn't give any reasoning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.240
now behavioral psychologists will look&nbsp;
for signs of line from shifting weight to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.880
defensive posturing and avoiding eye contact this&nbsp;
moment is showing all three so there's no way i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.960
walking through the door but we should first think&nbsp;
about the bigger picture here which is geometry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.760
and space we need to figure out the bounds of the&nbsp;
arena and its rules before anything else this is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.520
fake ceiling i would get on my friend's shoulders&nbsp;
and see if i could remove the panels to get a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.840
better view there's an obvious possibility that a&nbsp;
trap is waiting in the next room so i would even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.920
consider unscrewing the light bulbs and throw them&nbsp;
into the rooms to see if they trigger anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.760
smoke begins pumping through the floor they're&nbsp;
going to suffocate if they don't do something the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.000
woman pressures the school girl to pick a door&nbsp;
quickly she panics and rushes through a door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.360
getting killed on the other side this is a death&nbsp;
game mistakes are real all three men are horrified&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.520
but the woman doesn't blink and picks the other&nbsp;
door they follow after her as the room behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.880
explodes into flames and this time they have 10&nbsp;
seconds less the woman tries to manipulate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.680
others to open the next door and arisu here nearly&nbsp;
falls for it but he's too scared the bartender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.560
kurubi decides to take a wild guess and they run&nbsp;
through as the group escapes another close call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.720
each room is giving them less time than before and&nbsp;
they've been lucky so far but unless they find a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.280
pattern here they're all going to die now with&nbsp;
deductive reasoning we can extract quite a bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.520
of information to help us decide which doors to&nbsp;
choose next we know there are at least three rows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.200
of rooms for the door patterns from where they've&nbsp;
been so far and that we're on the left-hand side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.520
of the building because there are never doors on&nbsp;
this wall also the rooms are square so the three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.240
rows can make a grid of 9 or 12 depending on the&nbsp;
shape of the building itself but observation here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.920
is the key to beating this thing because if we&nbsp;
were paying close attention to our surroundings we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.320
would see for the evacuation map that the building&nbsp;
is square therefore it must be nine rooms total&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.720
and by the process of elimination it tells us&nbsp;
which rooms are safe from where we've already been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.120
arisu here figures this out another way since he's&nbsp;
a car fanatic he remembers the model and length&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.360
of the bmw downstairs and uses it to calculate&nbsp;
the building's dimensions he then measures the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.080
room size of his feet to extrapolate the complete&nbsp;
layout of the game this is the moment that hooked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.560
me into the series strategies like this just&nbsp;
blow my mind and the theory works perfectly as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.040
they make another escape until they reach the&nbsp;
last room when he realizes something's wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.800
they're in the back left corner of the building&nbsp;
the die door doesn't lead anywhere at all but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.400
if they take the live door they'll be back in&nbsp;
the trap room where the schoolgirl died he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.960
completely stuck okay every building is required&nbsp;
to have a stairwell for fire escapes and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.440
haven't seen one yet based on the evacuation plan&nbsp;
we can be confident that the exit is to the right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.680
but if i wasn't sure i'd encourage the woman to&nbsp;
open the door first she's more likely to trust me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.520
if we made it this far but if i'm wrong at least&nbsp;
it's on me or my friends to pay the price the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.000
gamer remembers his friend was recording and asks&nbsp;
to look the french video recording confirms that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.320
there's no door on the other side of the room they&nbsp;
barely make it out as the it guy burns his leg&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.240
they finally exit the building and get a message&nbsp;
that they've beaten the challenge the woman finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.760
a playing card to the three of clubs and their&nbsp;
phones say they've each earned a three-day visa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.320
which begs the question if they're not in japan&nbsp;
where are they suddenly another player walks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.640
down the alley seeing his visa expires today&nbsp;
the group watches as a laser falls in the sky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.960
killing him instantly that's when the power to&nbsp;
the whole building shuts off again they've got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.880
to find another game to play to extend their&nbsp;
own visa because if they don't it's game over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.360
okay it looks like we could be here for a while&nbsp;
so now is the time to start thinking about shelter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.320
food weapons and lifestyle changes canned food&nbsp;
is the obvious choice to start because it's quick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.320
stores well and there's a lot of it but it's not&nbsp;
going to last forever it will need to learn how to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.600
hunt cook and garden long term i would designate a&nbsp;
nearby park to plant and harvest vegetables squash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.320
potatoes and beans are filling high nutrients and&nbsp;
easy to grow a lot of if there's no electricity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.880
it means no refrigerators so cabbage will be good&nbsp;
because it can be fermented into kimchi and stored&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.120
for a nutrient-rich meal then i had dinner the&nbsp;
woman tells them she's been here for three whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.200
days when the guys have only been here for while&nbsp;
so when everyone disappeared it happened two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.480
days earlier for her how is this possible arisu&nbsp;
realized this means time doesn't work the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.280
way here the ity guy thinks there might have been&nbsp;
an emp bomb because after he saw the explosion the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.360
lights went out but with all the missing people&nbsp;
and the death lasers from the sky we should know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.080
there is no natural explanation for any of it&nbsp;
somehow we've crossed a border outside the normal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.640
world and we're playing by different set of rules&nbsp;
every game has a designer and we have to find out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.400
who that is the only way to do that right now is&nbsp;
to play more games to look for clues on that note&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.480
we can't assume every game will be exactly the&nbsp;
same others might be different types of challenges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.800
and we need to be ready now we can actually tell a&nbsp;
lot from the system they chose this was the three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.800
of clubs which is a low card so it tells me there&nbsp;
are a lot more games to play and they're going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.200
get a lot harder i would be training to improve&nbsp;
my conditioning work on improving memory functions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.600
and observational skills and calming techniques&nbsp;
like i was in a marshall special forces boot camp&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.080
and for a gamer who sits in a chair 14 hours a day&nbsp;
this is a major adjustment that needs to be worked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.480
out immediately later that night the two friends&nbsp;
make a plan they'll join a game hoping to win and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.880
buy time to find a doctor for their friend's leg&nbsp;
this it guy is an asset but if he doesn't heal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.960
he could get them all killed in the game this is&nbsp;
why friends shouldn't enter games with each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.000
because there might be serious injuries that&nbsp;
affect the group or even games that only have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.920
one winner if we split up we can all be winners&nbsp;
and learn from each other about the other games&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.400
mining information faster is how we all survive&nbsp;
and thrive they join the game where they get new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.440
phones and see a lot more competitors than last&nbsp;
time this one is going to be intense this guy is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.360
even using the electricity that charges music&nbsp;
player which is smart to take advantage of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.680
electricity when we have it but those old cassette&nbsp;
players are battery powered something suspicious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.000
is going on there these guys look battle tested&nbsp;
and have probably been here for a really long time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.280
i would try to learn everything i can&nbsp;
for them to better adjust this place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.440
because people in knowledge are the most valuable&nbsp;
resources here they're also the most dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.920
the game is a five of spades the number represents&nbsp;
its difficulty well the suit represents what kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.400
of challenge it is in this case it's a game where&nbsp;
physical ability has the advantage a player tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.640
them clubs represent team battles diamonds are&nbsp;
challenges of intellect and hearts involve games&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.040
of trust and betrayal this one is a game of&nbsp;
tag everyone must run away from the attacker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.200
and they've got 20 minutes to find a safe zone&nbsp;
before the building explodes they all spread out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.520
looking for a strategy as the tagger reaches the&nbsp;
top floor it begins the hunt now this guy wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.360
to funnel players downwards because there's&nbsp;
a laser blocking the exit below and a chase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.520
is always easier downhill that's exactly why i&nbsp;
would position myself at the top floor in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.680
corner near this pole because i can slide down or&nbsp;
climb up quickly and i can access it from every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.800
floor it also leads me to the roof which keeps me&nbsp;
completely safe these guys check the rooms for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.120
safe zone but they're all locked they hear gunfire&nbsp;
upstairs and peek around the corner narrowly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.680
docking a stream of bullets the guys run and hide&nbsp;
behind a wall as the killer continues downstairs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.160
it's risky but this is the perfect time to strike&nbsp;
we can't run forever and the majority of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.480
building works in his favor because they're long&nbsp;
narrow hallways but the stairwells give us the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.960
advantage because he can't shoot around corners i&nbsp;
would sneak up behind and push him down the stairs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.720
and into the wall he'll probably put his arms&nbsp;
up to stop his fall and it might free the gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.280
giving us a chance to grab it the gunman goes on&nbsp;
a killing spree taking a few more contestants out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.440
as the two friends move to a better vantage point&nbsp;
the killer turns in the direction but doesn't see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.720
them and the gamer realizes the mask impairs his&nbsp;
vision now they know his weakness the gamer yells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.320
to the other players that if they call out his&nbsp;
location they can find the safe zone as a team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.720
and stop the bomb this girl is the first to try&nbsp;
as she yells out the killer's location and climbs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.960
up to the next level this girl is scaling the&nbsp;
building like a freaking ninja the bartender wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.840
to ambush the killer and this guy agrees he's also&nbsp;
a tactical genius because he's able to figure out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.080
the killer's height weight and level of training&nbsp;
just from watching it but arisu here notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.720
something else both this soldier and his henchmen&nbsp;
have locker key wrist straps even though this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.800
a life and death situation this little detail is&nbsp;
important because it might mean they have valuable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.440
things to lock up and hide if either of them dies&nbsp;
i'm coming back and taking it off their wrists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.680
the climber girl offers to help check the first&nbsp;
and second floor for the killer it jumps down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.200
the gamer goes looking for the save zone with&nbsp;
the climber girl's help while the soldierly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.360
bartender plan to ambush the killer it's a good&nbsp;
plan because the killer will be distracted away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.960
from the main objective and they can beat the&nbsp;
game this guy lures him out of the stairwell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.840
but the soldier doesn't come to help and the guy&nbsp;
gets shot to death he's devious he was waiting so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.400
the killer would empty his magazine suddenly the&nbsp;
soldier sprays the killer with a fire extinguisher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.720
dodging a wild spray of bullets and now he's out&nbsp;
of the ammo they take turns fighting him and this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.760
killer is tough even taking several stabs on the&nbsp;
bartender like it's nothing and he slices a bloody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.320
wound into the man's side meanwhile arriso here&nbsp;
tries to figure out where the safe zone is and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:57.200
spots the door the killer shot at it doesn't make&nbsp;
sense that the gunman would shoot from so far away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.680
unless he's protecting something he's also not&nbsp;
the only one who realizes this as another player&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.880
shows up it's the same guy with the music player&nbsp;
arisu here slowly opens the door and takes a look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.680
inside a quick note if i'm opening this door i'm&nbsp;
doing it from the other side because i don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.800
what's coming out of there it doesn't hurt to&nbsp;
have some metal in front of you until you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.360
confirm there's no threat inside they spot a door&nbsp;
and investigate but there's another killer and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.320
two survivors have to run but the player slams&nbsp;
a taser into his side and the killer collapses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.240
further what we saw was him actually&nbsp;
charging his taser which he made from scratch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.600
this guy is really clever but it wasn't enough&nbsp;
to keep him down he runs into a room and realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.680
he's now trapped in the safe zone where he&nbsp;
sees two buttons to stop the bomb but both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:42.160
must be pressed at the same time he yells at the&nbsp;
location of the safe zone and that he needs a hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.560
now i would still give this a shot i can't&nbsp;
stretch far enough but i could take off my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.920
shoes and throw them hard at the buttons&nbsp;
to beat the game the killer breaks in and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.400
a resume here tries to fight him off luckily the&nbsp;
climber chick hops through the window and stuns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:59.200
him with the stranger's disguise taser with one&nbsp;
second left they jump for the buttons making it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.560
just in time the killer takes her mask off and&nbsp;
looks terrified as the collar suddenly explodes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.960
these killers were actually players and they&nbsp;
were playing against us for their survival&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.760
downstairs the bartender finds a walkie-talkie on&nbsp;
a dead player it hears two phrases the answer is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.720
in our hands and return to the beach and he's not&nbsp;
the only one looting this guy finds a note on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.960
killer with a strange design it's not clear what&nbsp;
this means but this is a lot more important than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.880
you might think i would definitely be checking&nbsp;
every dead body for anything useful or maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.040
even something i can learn from them every piece&nbsp;
of information is valuable especially when answers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.440
are so hard to come by the friends return with a&nbsp;
warm welcome they're grateful to be alive and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:40.240
group discussed what to do with the information&nbsp;
the bartender heard on the walkie talkie okay this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.720
thing is really useful because we can now listen&nbsp;
in on our opponents we need to use everything to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.640
gain a competitive advantage over others they&nbsp;
might talk about game strategies or food and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.280
weapon storage locations all this information&nbsp;
could make the difference between life and death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.120
the next night the group leave for shibuya&nbsp;
to enter another game hosted at the shinjuku&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.000
botanical garden this one's going to be unlike&nbsp;
any other they walk in and see a table weapons and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.560
some high-tech headsets okay if there's only four&nbsp;
people here and they're laying out weapons i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.960
thinking this isn't going to go well for any of us&nbsp;
but when push comes to shove and you have to kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.200
weapon selection is important here it needs to&nbsp;
be light enough to wield and run with but also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.920
very sturdy it also doesn't say you can't choose&nbsp;
two i would pick the hammer and the hand axe both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.160
are single hand weapons easy to swing and neither&nbsp;
of them will break from heavy impact when they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.240
put on the goggles the headsets lock around their&nbsp;
necks and turn on recognizing the players with an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.800
advanced eye tracking feature the game they will&nbsp;
be playing is simple hide and seek difficulty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:38.720
seven of hearts and we know hearts are about trust&nbsp;
and betrayal this is about to get real ugly one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:43.280
person will be the wolf the rest lambs and whoever&nbsp;
finds the wolf becomes the new one however to win&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.920
this game you must be the wolf by the end of 15&nbsp;
minutes whoever is the lamb afterwards will die&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.600
okay this is terrifying and trust is so important&nbsp;
here as soon as i see that this is the game of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.080
hearts i'm keeping a close eye on this one we saw&nbsp;
her throw someone under the bus in the first game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.840
and she'll do it again if we aren't paying&nbsp;
attention the first wolf is chota the i.t guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.160
and tries to remove the collar but is worried he&nbsp;
might explode if he does he turns and makes eye&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.800
contact for risu gear and suddenly he becomes&nbsp;
the wolf realizing the pattern this one gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.440
everyone's attention tricking a resume to look&nbsp;
at her she steals the wolf roll and runs away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.840
the wolf is not the hunter but the hunted because&nbsp;
only the wolf will be alive by the end of the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.240
the bartender chases her but he's too far behind&nbsp;
she ducks behind a bush to hide from the man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.200
trying to stab the wolf until time runs out this&nbsp;
girl is all about survival but she needs a better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.280
strategy to hide because she's wearing heels which&nbsp;
make distinctive marks they could use to track her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:38.080
down if i was the wolf i might consider climbing&nbsp;
a tree nobody can lock eyes with me even if they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.720
climb up to get me i can kick them down when they&nbsp;
try the bartender finds her it doesn't hold back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.440
but the woman slams a rock into his wound and&nbsp;
they end up making eye contact now he is the wolf&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.600
except his friend arrives and locks gazes with him&nbsp;
he gets cornered by the two of them who fail to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.080
convince him to switch roles this is why they call&nbsp;
it a hardscape because the game designers want you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.400
to choose between your life or your friends there&nbsp;
might not be a way for all of us to win but we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:05.040
have to try this is a botanical garden and there's&nbsp;
water here so maybe if we all look at the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.280
point in the water and our reflections everyone's&nbsp;
headset will register eye contact turning us all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.680
into wolves and we'll all survive the woman goes&nbsp;
to attack him but his injured friend tackles her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.000
to the ground and tells him to run a respirator&nbsp;
dashes off the hype and tries to remove the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.080
headset he's about to clip it but he remembers&nbsp;
seeing the collars explode in the previous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:27.120
game and refuses to go out like a coward karuga&nbsp;
hears distraught and starts hunting for his friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.360
urisu here is very emotional when he doesn't want&nbsp;
them to go out fighting and tells them he will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.160
sacrifice himself the bartender hears this and&nbsp;
has a change of heart since the very beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.160
he always knew his friend arisu at the most&nbsp;
potential of them all and he must survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.720
the gamer tries to find them but they've all gone&nbsp;
silent he finally finds his friend but by then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.360
it's too late this color explodes leaving&nbsp;
riso here the sole survivor and lucky winner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.760
of this death game this is the worst possible&nbsp;
outcome but keep in mind these games won't stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.640
i'm taking all these weapons back with me this is&nbsp;
seriously tragic but if i were a resu gear i would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.600
channel my grievant rage into the games from now&nbsp;
on i'm building a pre-built strategy for each suit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.720
of cards and training every day so that this never&nbsp;
happens again workouts aerobic endurance solving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.680
riddles and building a new team i can trust this&nbsp;
is what i'm focused on that way my friends won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.240
die in vain and i get more time on my visa the&nbsp;
climber girl from the tag game finds the gamer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.400
lying in the street and looking miserable so&nbsp;
she takes him back to her shelter for food and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.880
a pep talk even though she's been through her own&nbsp;
hardships she still keeps going and he should too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.040
whether he's ready or not his visa will expire&nbsp;
today and they both must join another game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.280
stay alive that night the two of them head to the&nbsp;
next game in this tunnel where they find a bus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:40.000
in the road inside there are three other men on&nbsp;
board and one of them has an injured leg they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.800
find out this game is called distance with the&nbsp;
difficulty of four of clubs and clubs is a team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.280
game now his injured leg is looking like it might&nbsp;
put them all at risk if he can't contribute their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.080
phones tell them to reach their goal in two hours&nbsp;
and shows a distance counter which starts at zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.480
this is the time to explore the parameters of the&nbsp;
game i would walk both backwards and forwards to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.480
see how the steps are counted to get a clear&nbsp;
indication of which direction the goal is one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:07.040
of the other players realizes that this older bus&nbsp;
doesn't need electricity to start so they could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.200
drive to their goal unfortunately there's no gas&nbsp;
so they'll have to run the injured man tells his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.120
friend to go on without him reassuring them that&nbsp;
he'll find his own way to survive and they leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:19.760
personally i hate running so i would have spent a&nbsp;
little more time investigating gas options closer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.760
to the bus maybe even pushing it to the next&nbsp;
car so we don't waste time going back we also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.160
don't know how far away the goal is so this bus&nbsp;
might be our only option if this is a club's game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.320
i'm inclined to strategize as a group so i might&nbsp;
have them all scout the tunnel to find gasoline or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:37.440
other working cars with keys left inside by the&nbsp;
time they reach 5000 meters they're exhausted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.520
okay this is already a clear sign that you're&nbsp;
doing something wrong so far you're physically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.440
drained and you're not working as a team and if&nbsp;
this is a club's game then you need to rethink&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.400
your approach because the strategy needs to match&nbsp;
the card suit they push forward making good time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:55.280
on their jog but then they see something coming&nbsp;
in the distance and realize it's a panther they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:00.080
split up dodging underneath cars and behind doors&nbsp;
as one of the guys gets evolved to death they find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.880
a flare inside of a car and manage to scare it&nbsp;
off but they have to keep going managing to escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.360
the remaining survivors see a truck with a royal&nbsp;
enfield on it a motorbike that uses diesel fuel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.680
it can't be started without electricity they don't&nbsp;
have the key but the gamer realizes that if they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.840
can take this back to the bus they can refuel it&nbsp;
and take the injured player straight to the goal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:23.040
the girl and the player keep going while risu gear&nbsp;
runs back with the motorbike diesel engines use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.200
compression ignition and gas-powered cars use a&nbsp;
spark plug to ignite the fuel but they can still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:32.320
use regular gas to power diesel cars so using&nbsp;
this motorcycle was a great idea but it's also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:37.040
completely unnecessary the other two have made it&nbsp;
to the end only to find the steel ball leaking out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.720
water and it's about to burst they're duped this&nbsp;
is no joke a water like this can crush you quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.720
because one liter weighs a full kilogram i would&nbsp;
have jumped in the car because a steel frame could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.800
protect me and i might be carried down the tunnel&nbsp;
the man trips and gets caught in the incoming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.680
flood leaving the climber to her impending death&nbsp;
but then she sees the bus in the distance arisa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.920
over there has managed to refuel it and leans&nbsp;
out to catch her arm she grabs on to him in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.800
nick of time as the waters tip the vehicle over&nbsp;
knocking them out they climb out of the bus they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.280
see that it was the goal this whole time those&nbsp;
numbers were indicating how far away they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.960
from it now if we had looked for the gas tank door&nbsp;
to begin with we would have seen the giant sign&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.120
that says gold but even if we missed that pushing&nbsp;
the bus to the next car for gas would show the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.840
distance meter remaining at zero giving us clear&nbsp;
indication that we're finding exactly where we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.200
outside the gamer tells her about a place called&nbsp;
the beach his friend heard about on the walkie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.960
talkie and proposes they look for it they don't&nbsp;
exactly know what to expect but they're bound to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:33.440
find some answers but i gotta say if i figured all&nbsp;
this out about diesel cars you could be damn sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.680
i'm not gonna be riding a bike anymore leaving&nbsp;
the greater tokyo area they're further from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.320
convenience of the city their loan supplies and&nbsp;
the gamer has three days on his visa they spend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.240
the night in the park and the girl teaches him&nbsp;
how to hunt and track wild boar there's a lot we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:51.280
can learn from this girl she's a survivor and has&nbsp;
more experience in nature climbing hunting camping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.440
and cooking we need to learn as much as we can&nbsp;
because you never know when you might lose another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.920
friend i would also be scouting all the possible&nbsp;
venues on my new surroundings because the more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.760
familiar we are with them the more advantage&nbsp;
it will have in the games like places to hide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.560
or tactical positioning that night despite a group&nbsp;
of participants about to play a death game and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.280
realizes these players are all wearing locker keys&nbsp;
on their wrists just like those guys in the tag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:17.600
game something is going on and they have to get&nbsp;
to the bottom of it this is clearly an organized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.760
society of players and i wouldn't trust any of&nbsp;
them life and death scenarios bring out the worst&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.920
in groups because they collectively take advantage&nbsp;
of others finding ways to blackmail and trap you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.480
in they follow them to a hotel that surprisingly&nbsp;
has running power unlike everywhere else in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:35.360
city but as their spine someone sneaks up from&nbsp;
behind and knocks them out i would really try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.280
be a little more secretive about it i would have&nbsp;
taken the locker bracelet from the killer in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.760
tag game and used it to try passing as a member&nbsp;
to find out more they wake up to these people in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:48.000
swimsuits interrogated them the gamer admits&nbsp;
they're here to find answers this guy hat or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.640
claims he has them as he reveals the small line of&nbsp;
giant playing cards he explains that if they clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.800
the games and get all the cards one lucky person&nbsp;
can go back to the normal world this is where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.280
beach was created to form a giant team of players&nbsp;
that collect cards and they have no choice but to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:07.040
join up i'm not buying it what if a single person&nbsp;
needs to earn all 52 cards himself in order to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.280
escape this rule isn't advertised and they simply&nbsp;
don't know groups like this aren't interested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:16.320
in governance or equality or representation it's&nbsp;
always about power and survival don't get involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.800
this is fool's gold and the truth is the more&nbsp;
people around you the more to stab you in the back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:25.520
on the plus side these guys have fuel electricity&nbsp;
water and guns so if we're caught we should take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:30.240
advantage they have three rules everyone must wear&nbsp;
swimsuits as that way no weapons can be hidden any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.320
cards one in the game will be taken and if anyone&nbsp;
breaks the rules or portrays the mission they'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.880
be executed they want to test the resu gear to see&nbsp;
what he's made of this scientist woman is here to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.120
observe his decision making the group enter this&nbsp;
room filled with water and a massive transformer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:48.080
above them the name of the game is light bulb&nbsp;
difficulty four of diamonds the goal find out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:52.400
which of these three switches turns on this light&nbsp;
but you can only flip one switch with the door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:57.600
open however if someone is in the room with the&nbsp;
bulb the door won't close they can only answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.560
once and if they get it wrong or the water touches&nbsp;
these electrical wires they die the water begins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.040
to rise and orisa gear isn't sure what to do but&nbsp;
he thinks he can eliminate the wrong answer easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.120
by quickly the first switch with the door open&nbsp;
the problem is if it doesn't turn on the door will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:16.000
close and they won't be able to confirm which of&nbsp;
the remaining switches works the lady challenges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.880
them is it worth risking all their lies on chance&nbsp;
the water is up to their waist so they have no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.360
time to argue so oriso over here goes to flip a&nbsp;
but he thinks about what's been said there's one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:30.240
chance to keep the door open to confirm that the&nbsp;
light is on or not and he has an idea they close&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:35.680
the door first and flip switch a then flip switch&nbsp;
b with the door open no light he has the player&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:41.280
touch the bulb and it's hot switch a is the answer&nbsp;
a reset here solves a puzzle in the nick of time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:46.000
and he's proven his work there is one thing they&nbsp;
didn't think of though this game gave them phones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.400
of waterproof cases and we saw in the first game&nbsp;
that they can record video i would put the phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.720
in the room and face it at the light to close the&nbsp;
door and flip every switch recording the sequence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:59.360
on the phone to tell which one the light is all&nbsp;
players return to the beach and the leader wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.520
to talk to the gamer he's impressed by his wit and&nbsp;
invites him to a meeting with the executives in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.600
the meeting the leader brings up that he needs to&nbsp;
renew his visa and the soldier shares a look with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.600
his men these people are dangerous and it looks&nbsp;
like there's a rivalry that we do not want to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.360
in the middle of and if i'm a result here i don't&nbsp;
want to be caught in someone else's drama because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:20.080
if we get close to someone else's enemy and we put&nbsp;
our lives at risk the strategic move is to stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.640
low stay humble and wait for your chance to slip&nbsp;
out unnoticed and forgotten the next day the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.640
warns the gamer that the militants are keeping an&nbsp;
eye on them when they start thinking about escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.080
he goes around asking different people what they&nbsp;
know about this world and learns that there might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.400
be lasers surrounding the entire country he&nbsp;
scouts on the compound and hears gunshots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.800
around the corner he sees some militants near a&nbsp;
dumpster waiting for them to leave he peeks inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.760
and finds a pile of dead bodies then a stranger&nbsp;
shows up the same person from the game attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:49.680
he explains that this is what happens when you&nbsp;
betray the beach and wants to do something about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:54.000
it he has a proposal for the gamer steal all the&nbsp;
cards from the leader and leave this place for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.200
good it's a dangerous plan but he feels he must do&nbsp;
something the gamer agrees and tells us from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.200
plan luckily she knows where the guns are stored&nbsp;
but they're heavily guarded later he's called to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.920
an urgent meeting and finds out that the leader of&nbsp;
the beach is dead he died from a bullet wound and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:12.480
they all wondered did he die from the games or was&nbsp;
he murdered the militants threatened the others to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:18.000
elect the soldier agony and they have no choice&nbsp;
this is the time to steal the cards and escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.560
orissa here is upstairs looking for the safe and&nbsp;
after finding it it inputs the code that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.440
guy tells him but it doesn't open the militants&nbsp;
catch him in the act this was all a part of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:32.480
guy's plan the gamer was being used to find out&nbsp;
where the actual safe is being kept in the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.920
we should know that all people shouldn't be&nbsp;
trusted and everyone is dangerous there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.720
also a better way to escape in the beach's regime&nbsp;
change everyone will be distracted enough for two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:45.120
involuntary members to escape i would be looking&nbsp;
for that opportunity more than worried about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:50.000
legacy of a place i don't even want to be in a&nbsp;
resource gag was bound in a room he's going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.320
be here until his visa expires and no one will&nbsp;
be coming to rescue him meanwhile the stranger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.400
returns to open the real safe find the box&nbsp;
of all the playing cards collected the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.120
gets dragged into a room by the second in command&nbsp;
and this guy is ready to do some terrible things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:07.920
when luckily the power of the entire resort goes&nbsp;
off confused they all look around and find a game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.960
sign in the room all the exits to the beach have&nbsp;
been closed off with lasers the entire hotel has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:18.640
become the arena for a whole new game difficulty&nbsp;
10 of hearts the last remaining new world card&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.200
everyone rushed to the lobby to grab a phone but&nbsp;
in the middle of the chaos the girl season woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.920
has been stabbed and everyone goes quiet the game&nbsp;
is called witch hunt and they have two hours to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.560
discover who killed the girl and burned them to&nbsp;
death the members interrogate the dead girl's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.720
friend they find it suspicious that she wasn't&nbsp;
with her since they're practically inseparable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.320
she claimed she was in her room but they don't&nbsp;
believe her and get ready to burn her at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:45.600
stake and she's saved when the executive members&nbsp;
step in okay this is a classic whodunit and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.920
have some information to work with here first&nbsp;
of all this is a hardscape the most dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.520
kind because the gamemaker wants everyone&nbsp;
to turn on each other and that's exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:58.160
why we can't do that there might be an obvious&nbsp;
choice but it also might be a trick of the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:02.560
now this girl was stabbed with an ordinary knife&nbsp;
and all the militants have firearms and samurai&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.880
swords we also know where they dump the dead so i&nbsp;
don't think it's them the best answers are with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.120
friend because we can learn about any behavioral&nbsp;
changes or if someone was stalking her or even if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.640
she was being blackmailed to do something they&nbsp;
all start accusing each other when the soldier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.600
agony finally steps in and threatens to kill&nbsp;
everyone if the real witch doesn't step forward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:24.560
his second in command fires his gun and sends the&nbsp;
crowd scattering okay the key to winning here is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.880
to understand the game maker's design they will&nbsp;
play tricks on the mind and have you so focused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.800
on your own survival that you don't see the big&nbsp;
picture so first we have to consider if there's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.360
way where no one has to die at all now we already&nbsp;
conveniently have a dead body i would throw her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:42.320
into the fire first to eliminate every possibility&nbsp;
before extreme measures are taken the girls run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.560
away to look for the gamer who is still tied up&nbsp;
meanwhile the swordsman is pouring gasoline in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.040
the basement they're going to burn this place to&nbsp;
the ground the dreadlock girl finds the forensic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.880
scientists snooping around she's looking for&nbsp;
superglue to get prints off the murder weapon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.960
which is really smart but i would tell her to find&nbsp;
out where the knife came from and find out who's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:03.920
been there recently instead the second in command&nbsp;
gets into a face-off with a shady guy who points&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:08.160
out the power supply at the beach has changed&nbsp;
since this witch hunt started meaning someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.720
working for the game has infiltrated the resort to&nbsp;
switch the power the only people who have access&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.440
to the power supply are the executives the shady&nbsp;
guy rushes the gunman and sets him on fire with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:22.480
diy flamethrower meanwhile a researcher scrapes&nbsp;
the tape off his mouth and calls out for help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:27.120
luckily his friend hears him crying and tracks him&nbsp;
down to the stool she rescues him and catches him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:31.840
up to speed he thinks the witch is also a player&nbsp;
in their own game having to kill the girl and stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:36.400
undetected that's when he realizes he's looking&nbsp;
at this the wrong way he should be thinking like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.320
the game designer they knew the leader died&nbsp;
and used the chaos to set this game up the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:45.360
witch could abort the victim's body an hour before&nbsp;
this all started and he thinks he knows who it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.600
there are 15 minutes remaining and the witch&nbsp;
still hasn't been found the remaining members are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.760
cornered in the lobby where the leader orders his&nbsp;
men to kill everyone but they're stopped when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.000
gamer arrives they know he's on the witch because&nbsp;
he's been tied up the whole time he begs the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.960
leader to work together to find the murderer and&nbsp;
gets attacked surprisingly the soldier confesses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:08.640
that he's the witch and arisu calls him a liar but&nbsp;
he knows a soldier did kill someone and it wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.600
the girl it was hatter the beach's old leader the&nbsp;
soldier's eyes tell him all he needs to know the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:19.200
knight had her wing to renew his visa the soldier&nbsp;
shot him in self-defense arisu here has figured&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.760
out there's one way to beat this game without&nbsp;
killing anyone that's if the girl killed herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.080
this revelation makes the new leader outraged as&nbsp;
he starts fighting everyone but they're running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.480
out of time it must put an end to this before they&nbsp;
all die the witch's friend knows a way to stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:37.440
this and getting everyone's attention announces&nbsp;
that she's the dealer of this game a laser pierces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:42.800
through her head and kills her instantly shocking&nbsp;
the beach the silence okay what the hell is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.960
dealer there's clearly some things that others&nbsp;
know about this game that we don't and she just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.360
got killed for telling us the forensic scientist&nbsp;
appears and confirms that the murdered girl did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:56.160
in fact kill herself because the fingerprints had&nbsp;
a reverse grip on the knife then someone starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:01.200
shooting at them it's the second in command still&nbsp;
alive he fires into the crowd but his rampage is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.440
stopped by the soldier taking several bullets as&nbsp;
he picks them up and carries them into the smoke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.880
with three minutes remaining the group carries&nbsp;
the witch's body to the fire and they all clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:13.040
the gate watching as the beach resort burns up&nbsp;
but the shady guy comes back inside to add the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:17.520
ten of hearts to his collection all that's left&nbsp;
are the face cards and it will be a complete set&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.920
the next day the gamer and the climber girl look&nbsp;
for answers on it they find a confession that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:27.600
they were both dealers a group specially chosen&nbsp;
to set up the games sometimes acting as taggers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:32.160
or pretending to be other players and they'll be&nbsp;
killed if anyone finds out who they actually are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.920
there must be other people who are dealers&nbsp;
pretending to be players this really sheds a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.760
new light on everything we've seen maybe this&nbsp;
chick was a dealer and wanted to make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:44.240
everyone was killed in the hearts game and this&nbsp;
guy who really stayed on the bus and insisted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:49.120
his friends leave was actually a dealer who set&nbsp;
up the game for his own benefit we need to be more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:54.160
suspicious of others than ever before in one of&nbsp;
the videos the two girls go through the subway and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:58.400
revealed the dealer's secret base it's a massive&nbsp;
surveillance room where others like to watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:03.440
the games and just like the players these dealers&nbsp;
have to play games for their visas too they trace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.760
the girls step navigating the metro tunnels and&nbsp;
find the door to the secret base has been opened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:12.080
someone has gone here before them finally&nbsp;
dealers are dead and their computers powered down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.920
that's when the shady guy and the dreadlock&nbsp;
girl find them he realized the drawing on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:20.000
note he found was actually a road map of this&nbsp;
subway station and came here to find out what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.680
happens when they get all the cards but instead&nbsp;
found these people dead it concludes that there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.000
someone above the dealers who is controlling the&nbsp;
games the computer screens suddenly turn on for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.640
a special urgent broadcast and to everyone's&nbsp;
surprise it's presented by one of the beach's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.120
executives she worked for the games this whole&nbsp;
time she congratulates all the players for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.920
victory and announces there's a prize courtesy&nbsp;
of her team tomorrow at noon there will be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.160
new round of games but this time they're playing&nbsp;
for the face cards they now begin to see there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.640
a grand design to this whole thing and this woman&nbsp;
has the answers they're looking for as they make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.440
their way outside they look up and see a giant&nbsp;
blimp carrying a massive king of spades city-wide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.840
more of these zeppelins fly in with face cards&nbsp;
of their own the next stage has officially begun
