00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.090
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:08.329
Today I will show you an Action, Adventure,
Drama, Sci-fi, Thriller film from 2007, titled

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:09.990
I am Legend.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.690
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.219
Watch out and take care.

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.950
Dr. Krippen is interviewed on TV about her
great discovery: she has genetically changed

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.900
the measles virus to attack cancerous cells.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.380
She explains that all the cancer patients
on whom the cure has been tested have recovered

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.600
so far.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.800
The scene jumps to three years later.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.180
New York City has become an empty and desolate
place, devoid of human life.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.320
Grass covers roads and buildings, abandoned
cars line the highways, and the city is silent.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.059
It seems that the apocalypse has arrived.

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.069
Robert Neville is driving through the deserted
town accompanied by Sam, his dog.

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:48.899
A herd of deer leaps across his path, almost
causing him to crash.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.030
He gives chase at high speed.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.979
He tries to shoot them, and we realize it's
a hunt.

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.940
The deer scatter and run down a road blocked
with abandoned cars.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.170
Robert gives chase on foot, trying to hunt
one deer down.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.000
As he rounds a corner, he gets the deer in
his sights only to be beaten to the kill by

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.730
a lion that presumably escaped from the NYC
zoo.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.770
Robert is torn as to whether to shoot the
lion and its family, who also enter the scene,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.350
or leave the deer to them.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.470
At this point, Robert's watch alarm starts
beeping, signaling that the sun is setting

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.620
and he has to go.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.170
We see Roberts home.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.380
It is the typical American detached house,
but it looks like it is in the middle of a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.630
war zone.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.150
He bleaches the steps to hide their smell.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.350
Robert and Sam are having a seemingly ordinary
evening, eating processed food and watching

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.770
recorded tv programs.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.750
After a bath, Robert shuts, locks, and protects
every door and window with massive steel shutters.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.260
He sleeps with Sam in a bathtub, rifle in
hand, with screams and screeches surrounding

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.470
the house.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.570
He dreams of how Zoe, his wife, their child,
Marley, and Sam, as a puppy, try to leave

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.780
New York.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.141
We see Robert dressed in a military uniform:
he decides to stay in New York on his own

00:01:59.141 --> 00:02:02.159
to try to stop the virus as he is an army
doctor.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.690
They tell Marley they are going on holiday.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.630
She sees her parents are in distress and tries
to calm them down by showing a butterfly with

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.300
her hands.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.610
The dream scene is interrupted by Robert waking
to face his lonely reality once again.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.640
Robert exercises and goes down to the basement
at his fortress-like home, where he keeps

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.920
a small but hi-tech laboratory.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.530
We see that he has been experimenting with
a vaccine for the virus that has wiped out

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.320
most of the human race.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.530
He's tried the vaccine, evidently only one
of the hundreds, on some mice to find a viable

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.530
cure.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.860
All the mice act incredibly aggressive, except
for one.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.270
Robert makes a note of this mouse and deems
that specific compound ready for human trials.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.550
Later, Robert gears up and goes to a video-rental
store where he talks to some mannequins he

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.570
has set up, his only form of human contact.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.930
It seems he has created a game for himself
to prevent madness from consuming him.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.830
There Robert takes notice of a woman mannequin
he would like to get to know better.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.240
While in the field, picking up corn, he promises
Sam he will talk with her tomorrow.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.170
Robert later visits some condo flats nearby,
searching for supplies.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.400
He comes upon a room with a bed surrounded
by plastic wrap and another room with two

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.400
cribs.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.270
We see the pain in his eyes as he empathizes
with the loss of loved ones.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.710
Robert has created a radio message and plays
it over all AM radio frequencies.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.290
It says that he's alive and that he'll be
waiting for any survivors at the docks of

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.100
the bay at midday every day.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.790
While playing golf on a military airplane,
Sam spots a deer, so both of them go after

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.090
it.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.020
The deer runs into an old building at ground
level, and Sam follows even though Robert

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.020
tries to hold him back.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.250
Robert enters the building as Sam would not
return of his own accord.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.100
Carefully, Robert searches the darkened rooms.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.210
He treads quietly, understanding that creatures
called Darkseekers might be in this building.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.630
Darkseekers react to light and sound, hoping
that he doesn’t awaken them by blocking

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.849
his flashlight with his hand.

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.820
Robert wants to leave the building but finds
it difficult to do without Sam, his only living

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.820
friend.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.709
He sees the corpse of the deer.

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.430
Relieved it is not Sam.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.050
He continues onward.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.739
He stumbles upon a room full of sleeping Darkseekers
and tries to get back carefully.

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.900
Robert spots Sam under a desk.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.430
Sam steps back as if signaling that someone
is there.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.910
An Infected male then leaps out of the darkness
to attack Robert and is shot dead.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.050
Both Sam and Robert start running away through
the building.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.660
Some more of the infected appear and chase
them.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.430
Some of them jump on him, but after he jumps
through the window, the Darkseekers on him

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.250
die in the sunlight.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.470
Soon afterward, Robert sets a trap to catch
one of the infected by breaking a blood vial

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.760
on the tarp.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.330
He succeeds, the leader of the Darkseekers
runs outside of the building, and after screaming

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.440
at Robert, he retreats to the safety of the
darkness because his skin burns as soon as

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.990
he comes in contact with the sunlight.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.260
Robert takes the captured female Darkseeker
home to his lab.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.100
He uses the vaccine that made the mouse less
aggressive.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.890
First, he sees positive results, but then
after a moment of struggle, the woman flatlines.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.700
He revives her with an adrenaline shot and
continues to adapt his serums in the hope

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.610
of finding a cure.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.970
That night, he again dreams of the past, when
his wife and kid tried to leave New York in

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.080
the chaos of its evacuation.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.320
He relives the panic and terror on the streets
as the city citizens try to escape before

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.229
the infected take control.

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.530
He seats his family in a plane, and by his
daughter’s wish, he takes Sam.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.240
As they are about to take off, Robert wakes
up again.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.169
Before heading out, Robert sets his clock
to 30 minutes before sunset.

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.919
He listens to old news about those cured by
Dr. Krippens vaccine exhibiting symptoms resembling

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.040
the early onset of rabies.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.250
After visiting the seaport at midday, he fishes
and talks to Sam about a party he might throw

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.240
for him since it’s his birthday.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.030
He wants to know now.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.570
Robert hates surprises.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.040
While driving around, he finds his mannequin
has been moved.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.070
He calls the mannequin Fred and is yelling
at him, what is he doing here.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.020
Robert has a mental breakdown and shoots Fred.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.900
During the night, the infected have set the
same trap he organized for them the previous

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.020
day.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.080
Robert is caught by the trap.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.080
He hits his head and passes out.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.360
When he wakes up, his watch is beeping, and
it’s dark.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.270
Sam is faithfully waiting for him.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.040
Finally, he cuts himself free just as dusk
falls, but he falls on his knife and impales

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.540
his leg.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.970
The infected leader then appears with infected
dogs.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.480
They attack him right as the last slimmer
of light disappears.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.630
Sam defends him, fighting off one of the dogs.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.740
Robert manages to crawl back to his car to
retrieve a pistol, shooting the infected dogs

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.740
dead.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.720
He looks over to see Sam collapse from a bite
wound and picks her up, and lays her in the

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.720
car.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.430
When he gets home, he puts Sam on a table
and injects her with an experimental vaccine.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.790
The vaccine fails in helping Sam as Robert
realizes her hair begins to fall out, and

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.700
she attempts to bite him, so he is forced
to kill her by strangling her as she struggles

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.040
in his arms.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.600
Tears stream down his cheeks as he says goodbye
to his only friend.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.960
He then goes and buries her in the streets.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.170
As promised to Sam, he visits the woman mannequin
at the video rental store and tells her Hello.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.270
He begs the mannequin to answer him.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.509
The darkness is suffocating Robert.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:10.780
In a grief-stricken rage, he decides to fight
all the infected face-to-face.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.060
He sets up a dummy at the pier and the infected
run at him.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.820
He drives his SUV at high speed into the hoards
of infected who roam the streets at night.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.510
He nearly runs off the end of the pier and
crashes.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.080
The infected overturned his SUV.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.400
Just as he is about to die to the leader of
Darkseekers, a bright light shines on him,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.600
scaring them off.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.639
The Woman tries to get information about Robert’s
house whereabouts, he tells her the address

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:37.560
and to only go there after dawn, so they can’t
track where he lives.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.860
Robert blacks out.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.020
While blacked out, he has dreams about the
past once more.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.360
This time he dreams of the helicopter his
wife and child used to escape New York.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.169
As it takes off, a nearby helicopter is attacked
by an infected and crashes into the helicopter

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:53.080
carrying his family.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.250
He wakes up in his house to Shrek playing
on the TV and stitches on his knife wound.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.889
He grabs a gun and goes to the kitchen, hallucinating
for a moment that it’s his family.

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:05.400
Robert hasn’t had human contact in so long
that he is confused.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.880
The people who rescued him are Anna and her
son Ethan, who have heard Robert's radio message

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.090
and went to find him the previous day.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.960
Anna makes them breakfast, powdered eggs,
and bacon.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:20.230
Anna explains a plan to leave New York and
go to a colony of immune survivors in Vermont.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.280
Robert, however, insists that everybody is
dead and doesn't believe that such a place

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.190
exists, which scares Anna and Ethan.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.289
Robert then explains he was saving that bacon.

00:08:29.289 --> 00:08:31.380
That’s why he acted out.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.729
After calming down, he apologizes to Anna
but still refuses to leave.

00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:40.330
He then shows Anna his laboratory and injects
another serum into the infected woman.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.300
While closing down the house, Anna again pleads
to Robert to come with them.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.750
He asks her how she knows that there is a
safe zone in Vermont.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.520
Anna says that God told her.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.120
He has a plan.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.730
Robert becomes irritated.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:57.160
He tells her facts about the infection, like
90 percent of the people died from the Kv

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:03.240
virus, less than 1 percent are immune, and
the other 588 million people turned into Darkseekers.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.899
Is that your god’s plan?

00:09:04.899 --> 00:09:06.130
He asks.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:10.560
A moment later, Robert realizes that the infected
are attacking the house.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.050
The previous night they had followed Anna
back when she rescued Robert.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.790
He activates his setup defenses, lights and
blows up cars.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.720
The infected are so great in number they breach
the shutters and few make their way into the

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.720
house.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.209
One of the infected is breaking the roof for
a better passage for other Darkseekers.

00:09:27.209 --> 00:09:32.040
After Robert shoots them, he, Anna, and Ethan
retreat to the basement lab.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.490
They realize that the infected female he had
captured earlier and tested the virus vaccine

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.010
on has returned to her human form.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:43.220
Robert shuts his bulletproof glass door before
the infected get in.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.670
As the leader comes, he starts to ram into
the glass, making the cracks in a butterfly

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.730
shape.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.670
Robert thinks that maybe it is God’s plan
after all, remembering his daughter.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.450
He takes a sample of cured woman’s blood
in a syringe and gives it to Anna, telling

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.920
her to hide in the incinerator with Ethan
until dawn.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.480
Robert grabs a grenade from his drawer, and
as the leader of the infected smashes the

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.690
glass, who has made a personal quest out of
hunting Robert down for taking his infected

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.370
wife, they collide, killing all the infected
in the room.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.240
Anna and Ethan reach a strange place in the
middle of the countryside: the road is cut

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.589
by a castle-like wall and a steel door.

00:10:17.589 --> 00:10:21.250
There, some human survivors live in that enclosed
community.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:25.100
Anna gives the syringe with the antidote to
the human leader of that small community,

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.060
and her voice-over tells us of the legend
that Robert Neville has become.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.060
The End.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.610
Thank you for watching!
