00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
that this is something different

that this is something different
the<00:05:38.720><c> self-termination</c><00:05:39.600><c> program</c><00:05:40.160><c> is</c>

the self-termination program is
 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.990 align:start position:0%
the self-termination program is

something that rick has clearly set up
