00:00:06.815 --> 00:00:07.903
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:12.383
today I'll show you a dystopian action horror film: "The Forever Purge"

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.519
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.679
in the future, America is suffering firearm abuse and violence

00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:23.583
it is normal to see people shooting each other with guns in the street

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:27.679
with the crime rate rising, the government cannot afford to sit still

00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:34.207
therefore, they institute the Annual Purge plan from 7 pm on March 20 to 7 am the next day

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:39.583
in other words, during these 12 hours, Americans can do anything without being punished by law

00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:41.600
killing is no exception

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.475
since the proposal is implemented

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:47.327
the unemployment rate in the United States has dropped to 1 percent

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.679
the crime rate plunged to its lowest on record, and violence cooled down

00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:56.415
as such, the U.S. government continues to carry out the program for several years

00:00:56.671 --> 00:01:00.383
overtime, however, the intent of the Purge begins to change

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:04.415
at first, they destroy the wicked, but now they wipe out the immigrants 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.167
and spark off issues about racial discrimination 

00:01:07.423 --> 00:01:11.263
the racial discrimination against blacks in the U.S. is very serious

00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:15.167
so the birth of Purge Day gives the whites a chance to eliminate the blacks

00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:21.503
Adela and Juan, a stowaway couple from Mexico, are preparing themselves for their first Purge

00:01:21.823 --> 00:01:26.687
before the annual Purge arrives, their life is not much different from the local Americans 

00:01:26.943 --> 00:01:31.487
Juan works in the Tucker Family ranch while Adela earns a living at a slaughterhouse 

00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:36.351
Juan is after the ranch owner's heart because he has excellent horse training skills 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.255
but the owner's son Dylan is somewhat jealous of his superb performance 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.303
and often stirs up troubles for him 

00:01:42.687 --> 00:01:45.823
Juan's anxiety heightens as the annual purge approaches

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.879
one hour prior to the Purge, Juan and Adela take refuge in a Mexican migrant community 

00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:55.423
in the meantime, most American civilians return to their own homes for safety 

00:01:55.807 --> 00:02:00.415
when the event kick-starts in the evening, the street is echoed with gunshots and screams 

00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:04.575
at the migrant community, Adela chats with their security guard on the rooftop 

00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:09.247
over there, she sees trucks of killers pontificating about cleansing America 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:14.047
Adela looks through the scope of a rifle and discovers that there are many black Americans 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.799
trapped in the container of the convoy underneath

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:21.471
noticing Adela's intention to rescue the victims, the security guard stops her

00:02:21.663 --> 00:02:26.271
it is not easy to maintain their own safety in such chaos, letting alone saving others 

00:02:26.591 --> 00:02:29.599
Adela has no choice but puts down the rifle 

00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:33.439
the security guard wonders why Adela is skillful with using weapons

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:35.999
but Adela leaves without answering him 

00:02:36.383 --> 00:02:42.015
actually, Juan and Adela fell out with Mexican drug cartels and were forced to flee to the U.S.

00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:46.239
before coming to the U.S., they were trained to use weapons for self-defense 

00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:49.887
upon returning to the ground floor, Adela falls asleep 

00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:55.071
fortunately, the 12 hour period comes and goes without any incident at the refuge 

00:02:55.263 --> 00:02:59.359
the next day, as the sirens sounds, normal life is then resumed

00:02:59.551 --> 00:03:02.047
people walk out of their homes one after another 

00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:04.607
to congratulate themselves on surviving the night

00:03:04.735 --> 00:03:07.999
on his way to work, Juan sees countless corpses lying on the street 

00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:09.919
and blood running down from roads

00:03:10.175 --> 00:03:12.991
cleaners are deployed to clean and sterilize the city 

00:03:13.183 --> 00:03:15.359
Adela also reports to her duty 

00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:19.263
during the break, she walks out of the workplace to get some fresh air 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.655
a goat trapped in an iron cage catches her attention 

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.831
Adela wants to release the goat

00:03:24.895 --> 00:03:27.967
so she stretches her head into the cage to reach for the switch

00:03:28.223 --> 00:03:32.639
as soon as she turns on the switch, a hidden switch above Adela's head is triggered

00:03:32.895 --> 00:03:36.799
to her shock, Adela is locked up and thrown onto the top of the cage

00:03:37.055 --> 00:03:42.111
then from the surrounding trash cans, several men with rabbit masks and machetes appear

00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:46.143
Adela cries out that the Purge is over, but the men ignore her 

00:03:46.143 --> 00:03:49.650
when Adela loses hope, her boss (Boss) shows up just in time 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.525
to kill the Purgers and save Adela 

00:03:51.722 --> 00:03:56.778
as a result, Adela and Boss are accused of murder and arrested by the policeman 

00:03:57.226 --> 00:03:59.750
meanwhile, Juan and his colleague (Colleague) arrive at the ranch

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.050
only to find the owner's family has been taken hostage

00:04:03.498 --> 00:04:05.866
the attackers are a group of underprivileged men 

00:04:05.994 --> 00:04:09.258
who resent rich men making money out of poor people

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.674
upholding the slogan of forever purge, they aim to get rid of the rich 

00:04:14.058 --> 00:04:17.898
ranch owner reasons that ever since the land was taken over from the natives

00:04:17.962 --> 00:04:20.650
the rich man has made their fortune from the poor 

00:04:20.778 --> 00:04:24.682
the annual Purge itself is proposed by the tycoons in Washington D.C.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.882
with the sole purpose of cashing in on the national crisis 

00:04:28.074 --> 00:04:32.426
he further explains that the mastermind is glad to see more chaos being created  

00:04:32.618 --> 00:04:36.458
agitated by such harsh truth, the thug shoots the owner dead 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.826
Juan and Colleague then rush in with their guns 

00:04:38.954 --> 00:04:41.450
and fire a volley of shots at the group of thugs 

00:04:41.706 --> 00:04:46.378
a number of terrorists fall dead, and some others flee into rooms to call for help 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.106
but are shot right off the phone 

00:04:48.426 --> 00:04:52.778
shortly after Juan and Colleague rescue the Tuckers, more cars are coming towards them 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.554
Dylan ushers everyone into his truck and flees the scene 

00:04:57.002 --> 00:05:01.162
from the radio broadcast, they are informed that none of the states is safe 

00:05:01.482 --> 00:05:04.682
fans of the night of killing have decided the Purge is "ever after" 

00:05:04.874 --> 00:05:07.178
and continue slaughtering Americans in the street 

00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:11.146
with the mantra of getting their America back and making America great again

00:05:11.466 --> 00:05:15.626
Juan gives a call to Adela to check her wellbeing, but no one answers 

00:05:15.818 --> 00:05:20.682
reading Juan's anxiety for his wife, Dylan decides to return to the city for Adela

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.794
out of gratitude for Juan's rescue

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.442
Dylan's wife and younger sister give their full support for the detour 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.922
Juan's kindness has indeed moved the heart of Dylan and changed his attitude 

00:05:31.178 --> 00:05:35.338
back to the city streets, gun-toting Purgers start to attack police vans 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.922
the police car which carries Adela is blown up by the thugs 

00:05:39.242 --> 00:05:44.554
Adela and Boss survive the explosion without any injuries, but the policemen have died

00:05:44.746 --> 00:05:48.074
merely seconds after the bombs, the car is ambushed by Purgers 

00:05:48.138 --> 00:05:50.826
who are banging against the door furiously 

00:05:50.954 --> 00:05:55.754
their aggression towards the patrol wagon suggests that their violence is well organized 

00:05:55.946 --> 00:05:59.594
in Adela's desperation, she hears gunfire outside the car 

00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:02.794
moments later, Juan opens the door to pick up Adela 

00:06:02.922 --> 00:06:07.210
while Adela boards Dylan's truck, Boss returns to his home to rescue his family 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.970
Dylan's truck leaves the mess behind and makes a few stops along the way to top up supplies

00:06:13.162 --> 00:06:15.722
the five of them finally rest at a hotel 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.010
and learn from the news the States has declared martial law across the country

00:06:20.074 --> 00:06:22.314
with the whole nation thrown into turmoil

00:06:22.378 --> 00:06:25.834
troops are deployed to deal with chaos and destruction in each city 

00:06:26.026 --> 00:06:29.738
in other words, not a single city in the U.S. is safe now 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.346
just as they are wondering what to do and where to go, there comes good news from the radio

00:06:34.538 --> 00:06:39.338
the prime ministers of Mexico and Canada, having seen the U.S. paralyzed by violence, 

00:06:39.402 --> 00:06:44.202
decide to open their borders to any unarmed American residents within the next six hours

00:06:44.394 --> 00:06:47.725
those who manage to enter these two countries are allowed to stay there 

00:06:47.725 --> 00:06:50.349
until law and order is restored in the U.S. 

00:06:50.672 --> 00:06:54.256
cheered up by the news, they set off immediately for Mexico to seek help

00:06:54.448 --> 00:06:59.440
unexpectedly, even at late night, some Purgers riding on motorbikes are preying on them 

00:06:59.632 --> 00:07:03.856
in the dire situation, Dylan's sister puts the purger's flag up on the window 

00:07:03.984 --> 00:07:06.352
and shouts out the slogan of forever purge 

00:07:06.544 --> 00:07:11.536
her strategy works as the Purgers mistake them for their companions and leave them alone 

00:07:11.856 --> 00:07:16.656
when they reach the nearest point to the Mexican border, the whole place is engulfed by flames

00:07:16.784 --> 00:07:20.368
a fierce clash between the army and rioters is taking place

00:07:20.624 --> 00:07:23.760
even worse, a heavy traffic jam jeopardizes their plan 

00:07:24.016 --> 00:07:27.664
the five of them can do nothing but to alight and walk to the border 

00:07:27.984 --> 00:07:31.760
they painstakingly take every step forward, fighting against the Purgers

00:07:32.144 --> 00:07:35.280
all of a sudden, their way is blocked by a Purger's tank

00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:39.440
so they plan to take shelter in a theatre nearby until the tank leaves 

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.896
even though they move rather fast, the Purgers have spotted them 

00:07:43.024 --> 00:07:44.752
and bombed the theatre entrance 

00:07:45.008 --> 00:07:50.576
in the chaos, only Adela and Dylan's wife enter the theatre while the rest are stuck outside 

00:07:51.024 --> 00:07:55.440
Juan cries out to Adela, telling her to meet at the other end of the theatre 

00:07:55.632 --> 00:08:00.944
and then Juan leads the rest to the back exit, but they are soon surrounded by the thugs 

00:08:01.328 --> 00:08:04.784
since the Purgers outnumber them, they lay down their weapons 

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.600
knowing that Juan and his colleague are Mexicans

00:08:07.664 --> 00:08:11.056
the sadistic captain of the thugs (Captain) orders Dylan's sister to kill them

00:08:11.248 --> 00:08:12.976
Sister refuses to do so 

00:08:13.104 --> 00:08:17.456
then Captain's mother shoots Colleague dead and continues to threaten the sister 

00:08:17.712 --> 00:08:21.488
fortunately, the government troops reach in time to suppress the Purgers 

00:08:21.808 --> 00:08:24.432
Juan seizes the opportunity to pick up his gun 

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.376
and kill Captain's mother, who is watching over them 

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:32.112
when Captain returns after defeating the soldiers, his mother is already dead 

00:08:32.368 --> 00:08:36.464
filled with fury, Captain swears that he will wipe out Juan's group 

00:08:36.592 --> 00:08:41.072
on the other hand, Adela leads Dylan's wife to evade the theatre through the back exit 

00:08:41.328 --> 00:08:46.000
they bump into a fellow Mexican outside the theatre and follow him to a temporary shelter

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.712
coincidentally Juan and the rest also flee to the same place 

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.576
however, their joy of reunion is quickly crushed by the latest update of the situation 

00:08:54.896 --> 00:08:57.840
to avoid being caught up in the attack on the military base

00:08:57.968 --> 00:09:01.360
the Mexican government decides to close the border immediately 

00:09:01.552 --> 00:09:05.072
this news is extremely sad for all the Mexicans present

00:09:05.328 --> 00:09:08.450
luckily the woman in charge of the shelter is capable enough 

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:10.599
to source a truck from a Mexican villain

00:09:11.047 --> 00:09:13.607
then they head for the border under cover of darkness

00:09:13.671 --> 00:09:17.447
preparing to cross illegally over a high mountain back into Mexico

00:09:17.767 --> 00:09:22.183
however, before they see the local villain in person, they are tailed by the Purgers 

00:09:22.375 --> 00:09:26.279
it is no surprise that this time the thugs are again led by Captain 

00:09:26.537 --> 00:09:31.785
as soon as Captain receives information about Juan's location,  he rushes over with his gangs

00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:36.137
Juan, Dylan and other capable men stay behind to fend off the Purgers 

00:09:36.265 --> 00:09:38.889
while other survivors retreat to the safe zone 

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:44.329
as soon as the Captain's team arrives at the firing range, shots ring out from all directions 

00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:48.809
at first, Juan's group manages to kill several Purgers by surprise attacks 

00:09:49.193 --> 00:09:53.545
however, their positions are soon exposed, and they are bombarded with bullets 

00:09:53.865 --> 00:09:56.105
overwhelmed by the intensity of the battle

00:09:56.233 --> 00:09:59.625
they finally hide in a safe wooden house on the way to the border

00:09:59.753 --> 00:10:01.673
now that all the bullets are run out

00:10:01.929 --> 00:10:05.513
they brace themselves with hand weapons such as machetes and bolts 

00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:08.073
under the leadership of the local Mexican villain

00:10:08.137 --> 00:10:11.721
the refugees tackle the Purgers in the form of guerrilla warfare 

00:10:12.041 --> 00:10:14.985
as expected, the rioters who are unfamiliar with the area 

00:10:15.049 --> 00:10:19.529
are besieged as soon as they get up the hill, and immediately suffer heavy casualties

00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:24.073
some rioters are shot dead by a bolt before they could see anyone

00:10:24.393 --> 00:10:26.825
seeing his companions all die one after another

00:10:27.017 --> 00:10:30.409
Captain takes advantage of the chaos to snatch away Adela 

00:10:30.537 --> 00:10:33.929
little does he know that Juan and Dylan are hidden right behind him 

00:10:34.185 --> 00:10:38.345
Juan and Dylan throw a harness around Captain's neck and strangle him dead 

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:41.865
then everyone joins forces to wipe out the rest of the enemy 

00:10:41.993 --> 00:10:44.937
and reunite with Dylan's wife and sister in Mexico 

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.481
by the time they arrive in Mexico safe and sound under police's protection

00:10:49.481 --> 00:10:51.721
riots are still ongoing in the U.S. 

00:10:51.977 --> 00:10:56.521
no one can tell what the great America would look like after the prolonged violence 

00:10:57.353 --> 00:11:00.297
this's Daniel CC movie channel, peace out
