00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.570
* Welcome To The Breakdown Where Breakdown
Some Fucked Up Shit.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.719
Today we are recapping a fake documentary
type film called Man Bites Dog.

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.960
This movie is about a killer named Ben who
is followed around by a camera crew as they

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.880
capture his deadly shenanigans.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.450
Wanna see who happens to be victim to complete
mayhem, stay tuned for the breakdown.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.020
Breakdown
* The Movie starts off with a innocent woman

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.570
trying to walk past this guy.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.329
As shes walking past the guy grabs her as
she's walking and suffocates her to death,

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.730
or maybe to just sleep for about 40 seconds
on screen.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.219
You can easily see that he is enjoying taking
away that women's breath.

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.010
* Then the title card comes up.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.030
Next the killer talks to the camera crew about
throwing bodies underwater and he's very knowledgeable

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.090
about disposing of people and shows it as
he throws someone else over.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.059
Then he visits his grandparents at their shop.

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.149
And we see the family is oblivious about his
murderous personality.

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.309
Next it cuts to Ben beating a mailman to death
which is a part of Ben's daily routine.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:25.500
Ben then plays with some kids and as one of
the kids shoot a toy gun, we get this montage.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.820
* Then he meets up with some woman named Jenny
for a while and we just get shots where we

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.980
learn more of Ben's personality.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.549
Then next it cuts to Ben killing a black man
and we see that he buries many bodies using

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:35.549
the cement.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.270
He also says something like he killed two
muslim's but made sure they face mecca in

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.270
their graves.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.649
The killer has the camera crew willingly help
him drag the dead black man.

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.540
Then he wants to see if the black guy follows
that stereotype where they all are hung like

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.069
horse and has the crew take his pants down
and he gets his answer.

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:57.079
* Then the killer knock on an old ladies door
pretending to be an interviewer.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:20.290
They start a fake interview but then he pulls
his gun out and starts screaming at the old

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:36.390
lady, giving her a heart attack easily since
she was a woman with heart problems, then

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.130
Ben says he saved a bullet.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.870
* Then they start robbing her house and find
money under the bed.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.450
Then the group have dinner at a restaurant.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.209
Ben talks bad to a waiter.Then as he's making
a speech, he starts throwing up as the waiter

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.870
looks on happily at his success of revenge,
(not really the food was just good)

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.950
* Next the killer forces a man to drive and
follow someone, causing chaos on the road.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.040
Then he shoots the driver and chases after
another random guy.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.870
Then in a big building, someone shots one
of the crew members.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.319
Ben sneaks up and hits the survivor with a
batman arkham asylum silent takedown.

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.860
* Then they throw another body in a taxi trunk
and then the crew stop at a bar.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.260
Ben tells the crew that he only kills small
insignificant people so he doesn't attract

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.260
attention.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.049
Next the sound guy cries on about his dead
crew member.

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.080
Next Ben pistol whips a woman and she convulses
on the floor.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.580
Then Ben kills the husband by smashing his
head on a mirror.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.580
Then he starts cracking his neck.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.769
A child sees it and runs away and escapes
Ben and the crew.

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.750
Ben catches the kid but he gets kneed in the
nuts.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.540
They catch the kid and Ben starts suffocating
the kid with a pillow.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.250
He says he doesn't like killing kids because
they cause too much attention.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.110
* Then as the crew is in another house, a
shoot out happens and another crew member

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.110
dies.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.150
Then the same sound guy cries about it again.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.200
Ben shoots a ceiling and somebody falls to
the floor.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.170
Then the crew come across another camera crew
and Ben murders them all.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.739
* We get another montage of killing and then
it cuts to them at the bar celebrating.

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.080
After a drinking binge the crew gets kicked
out and they walk the streets singing.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.200
Next the crew take turns raping a woman as
they force the husband to watch.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.090
The husband looks more mad that his weewee
aint as big as that black dude from the beginning.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.360
* Then we see they completely disemboweled
the wife and murdered the husband.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.739
Then they dump the bodies.

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.629
Ben gets his neck injured in a boxing match
and then once he gets out the hospital he

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:12.629
gets a birthday celebration.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:13.629
The crew give Ben a holster and he uses his
revolver to kill one of the party goers for

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:14.629
being annoying.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:15.629
Then he goes back eating as everyone else
sits in shock.

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:16.629
Then Jenny gives him her gift.

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:17.629
* The crew wrap up the body and try to dump
him but someone down there.

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:18.629
Then they dig a spot in a big grave with many
corspes.

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:19.629
It cuts to Ben taking down another mail man
but then out of nowhere we see that Ben has

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:20.629
been imprisoned for murder.

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:21.629
The mom believes Ben is innocent of all the
killings.

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:23.990
* Next Ben escapes off screen and calls the
crew to meet him.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.880
The crew pick up Ben and take him to one of
his female friends house.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.590
They girl has been murdered, and the flute
she played has been stuck up her anus.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.960
Ben cries for his friend and washes the flute
off.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.250
Then Ben gets dropped of at the family shop
and he finds his family has also been killed

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.070
similar to the girl Then back at a hideout,
the crew asks whats next, and as Ben recites

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.240
a poem, he gets shot in the head, then the
long haired sound guy dies too.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.190
The last surviving one runs only to die at
the door.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.140
The movie ends as we see the dead body of
the last camera man and the credits transisition.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.440
* Well that was a pretty messed up movie guys,
I thought it was pretty interesting but anyway

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.130
lets talk about the most disturbed moment
and most enjoyed moment in that Spooky Stuff

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.520
Spooky Stuff
* I Know everyone is glad to see Ben dead,

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.789
but I'm more glad to see the camera crew dead.

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.180
Not only did they film a murderer, they helped
him with his murders, they were just as messed

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.419
up as Ben!

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.780
The most disturbed moment goes to the death
of the old lady.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.259
I'm a sucker for innocent sweet women, and
the women died in such a messed up way when

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.640
she only expected to be interviewed.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.659
The most enjoyed moment goes to the end, fuck
Ben, fuck the camera crew, bite these nuts.

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:35.130
* And that's it, this movie was released in
1992, same year that CJ came back to San Andreas,

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:41.460
and the director, the long haired sound engineer
named Remy Belvaux Threw a pie at Bill Gates

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.460
once.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.400
