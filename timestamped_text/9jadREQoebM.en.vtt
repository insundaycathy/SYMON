Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.190
Today, I'm going to explain an action, adventure,
sci-fi film called “Oblivion.”

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.480
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.240
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.640
Fifty years after an alien race invades Earth,
humans have left and found a new home on Titan,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.179
Saturn’s largest moon.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.550
The alien race, the scavs, were defeated,
but the planet has been decimated.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.119
The moon has been destroyed, cities have been
reduced to ashes, and most of the land is

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.720
uninhabitable.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.939
Humans built the Tet, a massive satellite
orbiting the Earth serving as a temporary

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.359
space station before the migration to Titan.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.230
Only two people remain on the planet, technician
Jack, and communication officer, Vika, stationed

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.720
on Tower 49.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.680
They handle drone maintenance, protecting
hydro rigs that produce power for the new

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.360
colony by converting seawater into fusion
energy.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.850
Automated drones watch over the hydro rigs,
and Jack ensures the drones function correctly.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.719
Remnants of the alien scavs are still fighting,
destroying drones, and disrupting hydro rig

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:53.829
operations.

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.170
Jack and Vika are holding out on their last
task as they would be heading to Titan in

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.989
two weeks, or so they think.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.190
Jack and Vika’s day starts, and Jack gets
into his aircraft, assessing the drones.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.420
The Tet comes into range, and they start communicating
with their mission director, Sally.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.680
Jack flies his aircraft, looking for drones
and seeing if they’re functional.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.330
Jack then finds a downed drone, and he suspects
another scav sabotage.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.920
Jack heads to the drone and fixes it, but
a scav watches from the shadows.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.070
The drone goes back online but is unable to
detect the scav.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.640
Jack worries that the scav attacks are getting
more frequent, seeing that the drone he repaired

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.409
had its fuel cell stolen.

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.270
Vika reassures him, saying they’ll be gone
soon anyway.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.460
Jack then gets on his motorcycle to look for
a missing drone.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.580
Jack hears a homing beacon sound coming from
a sinkhole and descends the hole to investigate.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.210
Vika contacts Sally and requests a backup
drone to be sent to Jack’s location, as

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.920
the sinkhole could hide scavs.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.750
Jack drops into the hole and finds himself
in a cavern.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.310
He navigates through the hole, following the
beacon’s sound.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.590
He’s surprised to see the sound is coming
from a device, not a drone, and realizes he’s

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.590
in a trap.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.570
His foot gets caught in a rope and gets pulled,
but he breaks free and starts shooting at

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.710
the scavs.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.240
He runs back to his rope and manages to pull
himself up, but the rope snaps, and he falls

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.240
back in.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.549
Luckily, a drone has come to his rescue.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.640
The drone scans the cavern, detecting multiple
scavs, and starts blasting.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.360
It obliterates the scavs but turns its guns
on Jack.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.850
Jack identifies himself as Tech-49, but the
drone still needs to scan him to verify.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.940
Jack is relieved once the drone identifies
him and launches off.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.670
Before heading out, Jack spots a book and
takes it back with him.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.970
He arrives back on their tower and continues
repairing a faulty drone.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.710
He examines a book but puts it away upon hearing
Vika approaching.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.610
At supper, Jack happily shows Vika a plant
he found, but Vika throws it out the window.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.990
Vika then scolds Jack for bringing in a possible
contaminant into their home.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.810
At supper, Sally apologizes for disposing
of the plant.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.710
She says they’re close to leaving, and they
can’t take any risks.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.040
Jack says that he finds it odd how the scavs
seemed like they were trying to catch him,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.130
not kill him.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.560
Vika then heads into the pool for a swim,
and Jack tells her he wants her to go with

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.590
him to the surface.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.480
He wants to show her a place.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.230
Vika then pulls Jack into the water playfully,
and they share an intimate moment.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.790
They begin kissing in the water, but Jack
sees another woman’s face.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.400
They are awakened early the following day
by a massive explosion on the horizon.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.500
Jack flies off to investigate, and they see
that one of the hydro rigs has been destroyed.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.350
Jack surmises that the scavs may have weaponized
a stolen fuel cell and found a way to detonate

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.130
it inside the hydro rig.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.970
Sally is disappointed that Jack and Vika have
lost over ten drones and a hydro rig to the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:18.970
scavs.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.640
Jack detects a strange signal from a different
location and heads there to investigate.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.670
Vika sees the same thing and reports that
the signal is being directed into space.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.440
Jack arrives at what appears to be the Empire
State building, now buried almost entirely

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.990
underground, with just its top part exposed.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.730
Jack investigates and sees binoculars on the
building and gets a strange vision.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.220
Jack breaks into the building and sees that
the scavs have placed a repeater on the radio

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.310
tower, using the building as an antenna.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.940
Vika analyzes the signal and says it contains
coordinates for a location in the middle of

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.990
nowhere.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.080
Worried that the scavs could be contacting
more aliens, Jack shuts the signal down.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.210
Jack then does a perimeter sweep of their
area, careful to avoid radiation zones.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.000
He starts flying between canyons, losing radio
contact with Vika and flies into a hidden

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.530
valley with lush forests, green fields, and
a small wooden cottage.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.160
It appears that Jack had built this place
as his sanctum.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.600
He still feels wary about heading to Titan
as he believes Earth is still his home.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.450
Jack places the book he found earlier among
his collection and starts playing music.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.860
He spends several hours enjoying the tranquility
and says he’d rather stay there.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.319
Jack takes a nap and sees himself back on
the Empire State building in a time before

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.049
the scavs attacked, with the woman he saw
in the pool.

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.419
He jumps back awake and sees an object entering
the Earth from space.

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.009
Jack flies to the object and communicates
with Vika.

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.710
Vika says the object is landing in the same
area where the beacon coordinates were pointing

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.710
to.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.990
She requests backup from Sally, but Sally
advises her to stand down as Sally would be

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.249
sending drones to investigate instead.

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:41.710
Before Vika can clarify the communication,
the Tet goes offline.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.460
Jack arrives at the crash site and identifies
the fallen craft as a human spacecraft but

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.220
appearing to resemble something from before
the war with the scavs.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.949
Sally orders Jack to return, concerned that
it could be another trap, but Jack opts to

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.060
investigate the site instead.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.610
Vika watches from Jack’s aircraft’s cameras
and sees Jack darting around the debris-filled

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.610
site.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.770
Jack reports back to Vika that escape pods
containing human survivors are scattered all

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.960
over the area.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.180
Jack comes across one pod and sees that the
woman he’s been seeing in his dreams and

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.870
visions is inside.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.080
Drones then arrive and start firing at the
pods.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.800
Jack orders the drones to stop, but they continue
firing at the survivors.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.650
One drone gets to the woman’s pod, but Jack
stands in its way, shooting at the drone.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.620
The drone then decides to back off.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.099
In the distance, scavs are watching Jack.

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.449
Jack returns to their tower with the pod,
and Vika is terrified.

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:28.749
The pod opens, and Vika says they have to
report everything to Sally.

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:32.569
Jack agrees, saying they should start with
the drones killing the survivors.

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:35.310
They transfer the woman to a bed, and she
wakes up.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.449
Vika tends to her, giving her water.

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:43.180
The woman, Julia, starts asking questions,
and Vika tries her best to explain what has

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.180
happened.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.159
They tell Julia that her ship had crashed
and she’s the only one who survived.

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.500
They also inform her that she’s been in
hibernation for at least sixty years.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.780
Julia is dumbfounded, unable to comprehend
the information, and bolts out of bed, saying

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.819
she needs to get back to her ship.

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:00.400
The group later has dinner, and Julia refuses
to tell them anything about herself until

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.740
she gets her hands on her ship’s flight
recorder.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.550
Jack then tells her about the scav invasion
and everything that has happened.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.740
To their surprise, Julia starts giggling,
thinking this is all a joke.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.539
Vika is visibly insulted.

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:14.090
Julia then realizes Jack isn’t joking.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.030
Jack later talks with Vika, still thinking
about the drones shooting the survivors.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.969
Vika ignores this and says she wants Julia
gone by the morning.

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:24.279
Jack then asks Vika if she remembers anything
before the mission and before they got their

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:25.469
memories wiped.

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:29.249
Jack asks if she remembers Julia, but Vika
reminds Jack that it was a scav beacon that

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:30.860
brought Julia back.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.449
At dawn the following day, Jack speaks with
Julia, and she requests they return to the

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:35.490
crash.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.539
Wanting to learn more about Julia and the
crew, Jack agrees.

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:41.600
As they rummage through the wreckage, and
Julia finds the flight recorder, but they

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.330
get ambushed by scavs.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.120
Vika watches helplessly as scavs drag Jack
away.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.560
She informs Sally, and Sally sends drones
immediately.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.539
Jack finds himself bound to a chair, and a
man reveals himself from the darkness.

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:56.650
The man, Malcolm, tells Jack they have been
watching him.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.539
Malcolm then asks Jack why he’s curious
about the world and asks what he’s trying

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:00.979
to find in old books.

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:04.479
Jack says there’s no use interrogating him
as his memories have been wiped.

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:08.560
Lights turn on, and Jack sees he’s in an
underground base surrounded by humans.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.699
Malcolm shows him an old stealth helmet they
use to mask their voices.

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:15.690
He says it helps them hide from the drones,
which are programmed to eliminate humans.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.669
Another man, Sykes, approaches and says they’re
wasting their time with Jack.

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:22.800
They take Jack and show him around their base.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.332
Jack is in total disbelief as everything he’s
known being turned on its head.

00:07:25.332 --> 00:07:30.400
A lone drone locates Jack’s D.N.A. signature,
and Vika is elated.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.819
Malcolm reveals that the hydro rig’s destruction
was their doing and was achieved with a single

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:35.030
fuel cell.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.810
Their ultimate plan is to send ten fuel cells
to the Tet in a stolen drone along with weapons-grade

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.379
plutonium to eliminate the alien threat once
and for all.

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:44.250
They only need Jack to rewire the drone they’ve
stolen.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.669
Jack refuses, and they threaten Julia.

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:50.639
Before the altercation escalates, panic erupts
as a drone makes its way to their hideout.

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:54.659
Sykes and several men head out to take care
of the drone, but it starts firing at them.

00:07:54.659 --> 00:07:58.580
Sykes fires a skillful shot, hitting the drone
at a specific spot, causing it to lose all

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.229
function completely.

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:04.039
Jack tells them they need to let him and Julia
go as the drones will keep returning.

00:08:04.039 --> 00:08:06.810
Malcolm agrees, giving Jack back his motorcycle.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.199
Malcolm tells Jack that the answers he’s
looking for lie in the radiation zones.

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:11.879
Jack and Julia then leave.

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:16.069
Jack heads for the Empire State building and
sends a message to Vika via the radio tower.

00:08:16.069 --> 00:08:19.669
Vika intercepts the message and sends an aircraft
to retrieve Jack.

00:08:19.669 --> 00:08:23.319
Having too many questions boggling his mind,
Jack demands answers from Julia.

00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:25.620
Julia decides to tell Jack the truth.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.919
She reveals that she was on a test flight
to Titan when her crew got orders to investigate

00:08:28.919 --> 00:08:30.910
an object that appeared in deep space.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.200
The crew went into hibernation, and Julia
says that Jack and Vika must have been the

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.460
first to wake up.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.530
Jack is confused, but Julia continues, saying
the object they were sent to investigate was

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.530
the Tet.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.930
Julia then tells Jack that she is his wife.

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.680
Julia tells him that it was there, that very
building, where he proposed to her.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.010
Julia shows Jack her engagement ring, and
Jack remembers.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:54.010
He remembers being on the Empire State building
with people before the scavs ever arrived.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.740
The two hug but are cut short when the aircraft
arrives.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.400
Vika sees Jack and Julia hugging through the
aircraft cameras and realizes she has lost

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.550
her partner.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.980
Jack and Julia arrive back at the tower, and
Vika refuses them entry.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.230
Jack tries to explain what happened to them
and about the humans in hiding.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.300
Vika doesn’t believe him, thinking Julia
has manipulated Jack.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.220
Vika then contacts Sally and tells her Jack
could no longer fulfill their duties and they

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.230
are no longer an ineffective team.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.040
Sally acknowledges this, and the drone that
Jack had been repairing comes to life.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.090
Jack tells Vika that they need to leave, but
Vika says she wants to go to Titan.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.770
Suddenly, the drone appears and vaporizes
Vika.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:32.110
The drone approaches Jack, but Julia shoots
the drone down using the aircraft guns.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:35.260
Jack then heads to Vika’s office and finally
talks to Sally.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.120
Sally apologizes, saying the drone had malfunctioned,
and orders Jack to deliver Julia to the Tet.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.500
Jack realizes that Sally is acting unnaturally,
smiling and treating Vika’s death as a minor

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.600
accident.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.940
Jack and Julia leave on the aircraft, but
drones are sent after them.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.440
Jack tries maneuvering through a tight canyon
pass to lose the drones, but the drones keep

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.440
chase.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.700
Jack hides behind a wall of water and waits
for the drones to pass them by.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.760
As the drones pass, he pulls up behind them
and starts shooting.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.450
Jack eliminates the first two drones with
relative ease, but the last drone starts smashing

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:04.450
into them.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:08.280
Jack then flies through a small crevice, finally
leaving the third drone behind.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.840
Unfortunately, they have strayed into the
radiation zone, and the aircraft loses all

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.840
power.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.330
They drop from the sky, but Jack manages to
pull an ejection lever, and they touch down

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.800
with a hard landing.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.540
Jack gets up to look at his downed aircraft
but sees someone has already arrived, inspecting

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.620
the crash.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.820
He rushes to the man, shouting, but when he
approaches, he sees that the man is him.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.490
Jack tries to calm the other man down, telling
him they need to shut down the downed drone,

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.620
but the man keeps his gun pointed at Jack.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.950
Julia appears, and the man sees her, awakening
his memories.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.030
Jack capitalizes and attacks the other Jack.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:42.790
They struggle, and Jack tries to disarm the
other man, but they accidentally fire a shot.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.280
Julia is late to realize that she has been
hit.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.870
Jack finally overpowers the other man by placing
him in a leg lock.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.410
After the other Jack loses consciousness,
Jack rushes to the drone and removes its power

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.410
cell.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.700
He then rushes to Julia and sees she’s bleeding.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.100
He rests Julia on a rock and races to the
other man’s aircraft, which he sees is from

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.490
Tower 52.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:04.920
He ties up Tech-52 Jack and flies back to
the tower.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.490
He arrives at the tower and takes medical
supplies.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.030
On his way out, he runs into another Vika.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.490
Vika greets him, unable to tell that he’s
a different Jack, and kisses him.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.950
Jack then invites her to accompany him to
the surface, but she refuses.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.080
Jack then leaves, headed for Julia.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.220
He tends to Julia’s wounds and manages to
stop her bleeding.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.760
Julia then awakens, finding herself in Jack’s
cottage.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.440
Julia can’t help but smile, seeing that
even though Jack had lost his memories, a

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.220
part of him remains in the form of all the
things he’s collected.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.020
She then talks to Jack and tells her that
it was their dream to build a small cottage

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.110
by a lake.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.520
Jack says he is not the original Jack and
knows he is one out of countless other copies

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.670
but believes that he has loved Julia for as
long as he can remember.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.470
The two then kiss and spend a night together
in bed.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.000
The following day, Jack is preparing to leave.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.150
He tells Julia he wishes they could stay at
the cottage forever, but he knows he needs

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.660
to return to the humans and help them defeat
the Tet.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.750
Julia makes him promise to return to the cottage
once the fight is over, and he agrees.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:00.370
They find themselves back at the human hideout,
and Malcolm welcomes them.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:04.490
Back in Tower-49, Sally replays Vika’s earlier
transport when Jack went missing, and she

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.260
sends drones to look for Jack and the human
hideout.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.500
Jack starts reprogramming the drone and places
the bomb inside.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.450
Malcolm begins narrating how the alien invasion
truly happened.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.730
He remembers seeing the moon get destroyed.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.740
After some time, the Tet arrives.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.930
Hundreds of thousands of copies of Jack came
and initiated the attack.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.680
The copies were void of emotions, programmed
to kill.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.610
The surviving humans succumbed to natural
disasters.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:30.690
After the first wave of the invasion, the
Tet initiated phase two: resource farming.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.630
For half a century, the hydro rigs sucked
the planet dry.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.930
It was not until recently when Malcolm spotted
Jack collecting books when he realized that

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.550
humanity still had a chance.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:42.640
When he saw Jack rescue Julia, he knew that
Jack’s memories would resurface.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.340
Jack finishes rewiring the drone, and the
drone starts freaking out but calms down once

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.820
it identifies Jack.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.040
They prepare to launch the drone, but the
drones that Sally sent arrive and start shooting

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.190
at the humans.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.750
The drones enter the base, and chaos erupts.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.090
The soldiers fight back, but the drones are
too fast and powerful.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.110
Malcolm gets in a turret and starts hammering
a drone with bullets.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:04.950
One drone corners Julia and a group of survivors,
but Sykes shoots the drone down.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.300
Jack manages to eliminate the final drone
by shooting its weak spot.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.130
The drone then explodes.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.930
When the rubble clears, they find that Malcolm
had been wounded.

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.930
He tells them to send the drone, but Jack
tells him the drone had been decommissioned

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.000
during the fight.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.030
Julia remembers that Sally had ordered Jack
to bring her to the Tet.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.500
Julia offers to be brought up, hiding the
bomb in her hibernation pod.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.440
Jack considers this and agrees.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.860
They prepare themselves for the sacrifice,
and Julia gets into her hibernation pod along

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.000
with the bomb.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.870
Jack gives her one final kiss before she lays
down.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.420
Jack loads the pod into his aircraft and flies
to the Tet.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.680
He plays Julia’s ship’s voice recorder
and finally hears what transpired before the

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.680
Tet took him.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.800
It’s revealed that he and Vika were the
first ones to awake from hibernation, and

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.400
they were the ones who saw the Tet.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.350
They weren’t a couple but were close friends.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.310
The Tet hijacked their ship’s controls,
and they decided to eject the others who were

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.790
still in hibernation.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:54.280
Jack and Vika end up being the only two people
getting sucked into the Tet.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.250
The team they ejected were the same people
in the pods that the drones had all fired

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.250
upon.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.620
It’s also revealed that Sally was a real
person in NASA, but the Tet must have mimicked

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:02.920
her somehow.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.580
Jack now reaches the Tet with the hibernation
pod, and Sally lets him in.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.070
The Tet interior appears empty, only populated
by a few drones.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:13.360
Sally’s voice now appears distorted, sounding
more mechanical.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.820
He sees the Tet lined with incubating humans,
all copies of him and Julia.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.750
Jack then comes face to face with the Tet’s
core and brings out the hibernation pod.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.960
He opens the pod and reveals that it’s Malcolm
he had brought along with him.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.190
He then begins wiring up the bomb.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.700
Back on Earth, Julia awakens and finds herself
in Jack’s cottage.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.930
Sykes and the others see drones approaching
and prepare for an attack.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:37.080
Jack and Malcolm detonate the bomb at the
Tet, and the Tet erupts into a massive fireball.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.310
All the drones drop dead, and everyone on
Earth sees a bright flash in the sky.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.970
Several years pass, and Julia is living happily
in the cottage with a daughter.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.760
Sykes and the other arrive, but a person of
note is with them.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.550
The Tech-52 Jack has survived and has spent
his time searching for Julia and the cottage

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.620
that Tech-49 Jack had built.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:15:06.860
Tech-52 Jack finally finds Julia, her daughter,
and humanity’s new home.
