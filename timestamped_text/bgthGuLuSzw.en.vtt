00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.440
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to explain a&nbsp;
fantasy and horror film called "The Head Hunter."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.480
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.960
The coldness in the man's eyes complements&nbsp;
the freezing temperature surrounding him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.760
Father finally snaps back to reality&nbsp;
and breathes heavily to warm himself up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.960
A branch breaking catches his attention, making&nbsp;
him wary of his surroundings. An alarm system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.280
made up of string and bones rustles at the touch&nbsp;
of a creature; it then crosses the boundary.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.400
He anticipates the creature with a sword in hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.600
meeting it halfway. The sounds of slicing and&nbsp;
the creature howling echo throughout the forest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.960
He returns, and his daughter calls out to him.&nbsp;
Father kneels to comfort his freezing daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.840
He realizes the blood in his hand&nbsp;
that's been transferred to her coat.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.800
Time passes, and a tragedy occurs.&nbsp;
A monster kills his daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.600
and since then, he has sought revenge. His&nbsp;
home is now filled with a collection of heads,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.000
but he has yet to sever the&nbsp;
head of his daughter’s killer.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.320
A lonely night arrives, and Father&nbsp;
sits by the fire reciting his prayer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.320
He harvests innards from a creature and&nbsp;
awaits to eat one roasting by the fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.640
Morning comes, and he pulls a creature's&nbsp;
skull into his shack’s balcony.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.120
Father retrieves a fish stuck in the eye socket,&nbsp;
and he releases the skull back into the depths.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.560
Using tongs, Father drops the fish into&nbsp;
a mixture that instantly dissolves it. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.840
starts producing an orange powder. He then grabs&nbsp;
small bones and spits at his knife, incorporating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.640
all the ingredients together. Meanwhile, the&nbsp;
squeaking window knocks over a jar of powder.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.680
After preparing the dry components, Father&nbsp;
exits the shack to tends his cauldron,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.480
which contains a boiling dark liquid. He pours&nbsp;
the hot mixture through a filter into jars.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.200
He locks them in place and leaves them to ferment.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.840
Outside, he sits on a block of wood and&nbsp;
admires the beauty of his surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.760
He talks to his daughter's grave&nbsp;
and offers her a metal arrowhead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.400
Legend says that the arrowhead can carry souls to&nbsp;
the afterlife, but Father doesn't believe in it.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.320
After some time, squeaking from the window&nbsp;
disturbs Father's siesta. Feeling frustrated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.680
he cuts off wood and tries fixing it. He then&nbsp;
stops as he hears horns blaring from the castle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.040
The horns are a sign that a king’s order&nbsp;
has been sent for him to accomplish.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.560
With his helmet on, Father rides&nbsp;
away to accept his mission.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.120
Later that day, Father falls off&nbsp;
his horse and makes his way inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.160
throwing a sack into the floor. He bleeds as&nbsp;
he makes his way to the mixture he prepared.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.880
Father removes his armor and helmet and opens up&nbsp;
the jar. He applies the medicine to his mauled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.600
shoulder and screams in pain. His eyes almost&nbsp;
pop out of their sockets as he feels relief.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.680
A new day arrives, and the window’s squeaking&nbsp;
persists. Father awakens; he unsheaths his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.720
blade and uses it as a mirror. His wounds have&nbsp;
miraculously healed, and he recoups his strength.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.840
He stands and flips through his diary,&nbsp;
inserting another completed order from the king.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.840
He has completed countless bounties, but he&nbsp;
is yet to encounter his daughter’s killer.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.000
He stashes his loot and looks over to a bloody&nbsp;
sack. Inside it is a severed head of a white ape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.600
He displays it on his wall and smirks as&nbsp;
he adds another skull to his collection.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.400
Later that day, he ties his horse down&nbsp;
on a tree and starts hammering on a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.800
chest plate in his outpost. After that, he&nbsp;
retrieves a creature caught in his trap.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.080
Night arrives, and Father&nbsp;
sleeps soundly in his home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.400
His eyes open as the squeaks of the window&nbsp;
mask the shriek of a creature outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.560
Menacing eyes watch his home. With a determined&nbsp;
look, Father grabs his battle-ax. The sounds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.320
the leaves rustling get replaced by Father's&nbsp;
grunts as he starts hacking the creature.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.120
The following day, he erects the creature's&nbsp;
head stuck through a pole to warn potential&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.080
unwanted visitors. Father kneels by a stream to&nbsp;
drink some water, and a dragon flies above him.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.400
Back home, the horn calls out&nbsp;
for his aide again. He sharpens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.360
a piece of wood and hammers it to&nbsp;
the wall, preparing to add another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.280
head to his collection. He grabs his&nbsp;
belongings and rides off on his horse.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.600
Evening comes, and he returns home, less injured&nbsp;
than before. He lights up his fireplace and pulls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.880
out a wolf's head from the bag. He sticks it into&nbsp;
the wall and opens up another jar of the mixture.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.240
He sits on his throne, removes his helmet, and&nbsp;
reveals his mangled face. Father applies the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.120
medicine, and he bears the pain much easier.&nbsp;
He closes his eyes and drifts off to sleep.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.520
A pool of blood accumulates on the wood&nbsp;
flooring, and Father wakes up with new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.360
scars. He moves the bucket to catch&nbsp;
the blood from his most recent prey.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.560
Outside, he hangs his horse's bridle on a tree&nbsp;
where a horseshoe rests on one of the branches.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.080
Later that day, he carves out&nbsp;
a wooden figurine of his horse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.080
He makes his way to his daughter's grave&nbsp;
and informs her that his horse is dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.680
Another horn blares from the castle; Father cusses&nbsp;
in frustration as it seems he has no time to rest.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.760
Back at home, he starts hammering&nbsp;
another spike but gets pricked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.720
He walks to the castle, leaving&nbsp;
the stake with his blood dripping.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.560
Arriving at a tree, Father inspects an arrow with&nbsp;
a piece of parchment. He then sees the archer in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.600
white robe returning to the castle. He reads the&nbsp;
bounty, and he runs toward his daughter's grave:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.280
the monster that killed her daughter&nbsp;
returns, and Father thirsts for vengeance.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.280
He starts his journey passing various biomes.&nbsp;
After a long walk, Father reaches a hill where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.720
a skeleton rests, foreshadowing the dangers ahead.&nbsp;
He camps out the night with the skeleton, and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.760
feasts on some meat. Father talks to the pile of&nbsp;
bones and asks what killed it. He shares about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.000
oath he made to his daughter, and in the distance,&nbsp;
a faint silhouette of the monster is seen.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.800
Morning comes, and Father continues on&nbsp;
his journey. He arrives at the edge of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.320
the waters overlooking an island&nbsp;
enveloped in mist and darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.360
In the depths of the cave, a&nbsp;
monstrous howling echoes out.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.160
Another day arrives, and a bloody sack along&nbsp;
with an injured Father falls to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.640
He removes his helmet, whimpering as coldness&nbsp;
and injuries take a toll on his body.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.440
Later that day, he bathes in the river revealing&nbsp;
that he suffered no significant injuries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.200
Night arrives, and he returns to&nbsp;
camp out with his skeleton friend.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.920
He drags his feet, and with every&nbsp;
step, fatigue catches up to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.880
He remembers his daughter and&nbsp;
gathers the strength to return home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.280
Finally, he reaches his home,&nbsp;
realizing how much he misses his horse.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.840
Father immediately reports to his daughter&nbsp;
and says that he has now fulfilled his oath.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.560
The window continues to squeak, spilling&nbsp;
a jar of the mixture on the workbench—the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.960
liquid drips, flowing down the cabinets and&nbsp;
to the sack containing the monster's head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.520
The sack starts moving, and a spine sticks out.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.880
He returns home to see the head gone. He grabs&nbsp;
the jar and scoops out the mixture with his knife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.040
He drops it on a dead spider, and&nbsp;
it resurrects before his eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.520
He curses under his breath and smashes&nbsp;
the spider. However, the spider lives.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.560
Night arrives, and Father prepares for the hunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.440
Outside, a monster stalks within the&nbsp;
shadows, whispering the word "body."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.720
It starts crawling to Father's shack. Father exits&nbsp;
with a torch in hand to look for the monster.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.080
He takes every step with caution, straying farther&nbsp;
and farther away from his shack. He unsheaths his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.320
blade as he sees the sack. He pierces it and holds&nbsp;
it up close to inspect. Suddenly, the door opens.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.840
Father enters the home, checking every corner.&nbsp;
He hears a faint sound, and the view from his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.960
helmet hinders his sight. He rushes to the&nbsp;
balcony, and as he turns, he sees the monster,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.400
who dives into the river. He leaves to chase it&nbsp;
while something tugs the rope. It stops moving,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.840
and the monster crawls out the depths&nbsp;
bringing with it the skull tied to the rope.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.560
Father continues his pursuits; the light&nbsp;
from his torch is a mere speck surrounded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.640
by the dark of night. The monster’s&nbsp;
hisses are now accompanied by footsteps.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.840
Father starts waving his torch as his&nbsp;
anxiety grows. But then, he hears a trap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.480
that's been set off. The monster struggles&nbsp;
but escapes, resuming its search for a body.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.120
He discovers the trap and sees the&nbsp;
skull from his rope. Father finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.680
arrives at the terrifying realization of the&nbsp;
horror he's truly up against. Father rushes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.200
to his daughter's grave as he figures out&nbsp;
that the monster is searching for a body.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.520
In the grave, a skeleton's hand starts to move.&nbsp;
Father sees the dug-up grave empty. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.280
the monster begins to reconstruct&nbsp;
itself with the daughter's bones.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.320
He arrives at a stream that leads deeper into&nbsp;
the woods. The monster now whispers the word,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.400
father. Due to the tight passage, Father sheaths&nbsp;
his sword, removes his armor, and grabs his ax,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.520
journeying farther into the tunnel. A skeleton&nbsp;
surprises him, and he smacks it with his torch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.720
putting out the flame. He tries&nbsp;
to light it again but fails.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.960
The word father echoes throughout, provoking&nbsp;
him to go deeper into the darkness.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.320
Further in, Father stops to observe his&nbsp;
surroundings, and only the water droplets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.920
from the cave ceilings can be heard. Suddenly,&nbsp;
the monster reveals itself and latches on to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:36.480
With his bare hands, he strangles it, pulling&nbsp;
the spine out of her daughter's bones.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.880
The monster wraps its cord around Father&nbsp;
and constricts him. He removes his helmet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.320
and grabs a blade from his belt. With every&nbsp;
stab, blood splatters on his face. Finally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.280
the monster ceases to resists. Father sighs in&nbsp;
relief and retrieves his daughter's remains.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.800
Morning arrives, and he sets his daughter's&nbsp;
corpse with blooming flowers. He returns home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.280
and leaves the head outside. He grabs his ax&nbsp;
and smashes the monster to ensure its death.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.880
Father returns to the grave, reburies his&nbsp;
daughter. And with every layer of dirt he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:12.240
brushes in, he's reminded of the time he would&nbsp;
cover her daughter with a coat. Finally, her body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.200
along with her soul, peacefully rests. The metal&nbsp;
arrowhead presents itself underneath the soil.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.080
Father chops up some wood and creates&nbsp;
an arrow with it. He aims it at the sky,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.080
closes his eyes, and fires. The&nbsp;
arrow lands on a rotting creature.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.480
He finally fulfills the oath and returns home. He&nbsp;
passes through the still squeaking window. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.440
suddenly, a faint noise of struggling and flesh&nbsp;
being ripped aprt is heard. Father enters the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.800
home, oddly stepping his way in. He sticks another&nbsp;
head into the stake he prepared, adding himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.520
to the collection. The monster now inhabits his&nbsp;
body and walks away with a jar of the mixture.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.880
The Father attributes revenge to his desire&nbsp;
to give his daughter peace. When in fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.520
the Father does it for himself as a means to&nbsp;
bury away his self-loathing for letting her die.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.320
As he goes on repetitive quests to kill monsters,&nbsp;
he loses what’s important to him little by little,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.200
scar by scar. Then finally, he encounters the&nbsp;
monster who killed his daughter, getting the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.320
opportunity to end his endless pursuit. However,&nbsp;
his own meticulous preparations defeat him.
