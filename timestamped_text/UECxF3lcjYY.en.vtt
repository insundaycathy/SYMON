00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.680
the movie begins as joel dawson narrates&nbsp;
to us the current state of the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.480
he says that his life was normal like&nbsp;
any of us until the end of the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.120
it all started when a huge asteroid named&nbsp;
agatha 616 was heading straight to earth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.480
humanity came together and sent several rockets&nbsp;
to destroy the asteroid before it hit the earth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.320
and succeeded the asteroid was gone however&nbsp;
the rockets were destroyed to the radioactive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.680
material in the rockets reigned back into earth&nbsp;
causing all cold-blooded animals to mutate so now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.520
there are huge ants roaches crocodiles lizards&nbsp;
and many other huge animals who attack humans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.600
the animals immediately started killing people&nbsp;
and within about a year 95 percent of the human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.240
population was wiped out the ones who survived&nbsp;
hidden bunkers caves and panic rooms the surviving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.120
humans have been living in such places for the&nbsp;
last seven years and one of them is joel he lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.480
in a bunker with other members the tiny place&nbsp;
doesn't provide room for privacy so joel complains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.600
about two of the members having sex right beside&nbsp;
him as he pretends to sleep joel tells us that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.880
everyone in the bunker is a couple except&nbsp;
for him their first baby was born last summer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.280
they have established their own lifestyle vastly&nbsp;
different from how it was outside the bunker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.680
joel's day-to-day life includes milking the&nbsp;
cow and cooking food they have a hunting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.840
party every month in which some members of the&nbsp;
group go up and bring whatever food they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.840
joel writes letters to amy his girlfriend&nbsp;
before he lived in the bunkers that day joel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.400
is practicing hitting targets when the lights in&nbsp;
the bunker start to flicker everyone starts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.080
pack their weapons to go out a mutated animal is&nbsp;
in the area joel asks them if they want his help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.440
but the group tells him to stay in the bunker he&nbsp;
is a liability for them because joel cannot fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.320
the team then leaves to find and kill the&nbsp;
animal joel and a few others stay at the bunker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.480
they monitor the group through a device and see&nbsp;
that one of the team is killed by the monster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.000
joel gets a crossbow and goes to help them&nbsp;
one animal has slipped into the bunker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.800
joel sees it and freezes although he has plenty&nbsp;
of chances to kill it he doesn't move at all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.720
the animal is about to attack him when&nbsp;
the others from behind him kill it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.320
cut to seven years ago the day the asteroid&nbsp;
was destroyed joel and his girlfriend amy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.520
are in a car hanging out he draws a picture of&nbsp;
amy and she gives him a box of colors as a gift&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.280
as they kiss the emergency alarm goes off in the&nbsp;
city just then the pieces of rocket fall back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.040
onto the city creating huge explosions the two&nbsp;
drive back home quickly after they had come home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.400
everyone was packing their bags to leave for a&nbsp;
safe place the two hug for the last time separated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.560
that day and have not met ever since she lives&nbsp;
in another colony a few miles away seven years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.840
later joel still has the box of colors that he&nbsp;
uses to draw the monster animals on his notepad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.040
that day jay speaks to her through a radio system&nbsp;
the two talk about the letters that joel writes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.640
amy every day but the call cuts off midway others&nbsp;
from the team mourn the death of their team member&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.680
suddenly joel asks the team about amy's colony&nbsp;
it turns out that it is only 85 miles away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.240
it takes seven days to reach there joel&nbsp;
is determined to find amy this time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.440
the team members are surprised because they know&nbsp;
joel cannot fight they try to persuade him to stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.080
but he packs his bag with all the necessities&nbsp;
and leaves the bunker for the first time he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.040
looks at the map but cannot figure out anything&nbsp;
in it he even can't tell what direction is west&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.640
so joel takes a chance and heads in a random&nbsp;
direction he walks for a while thinking that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.400
the journey is not as bad as he expected it to be&nbsp;
on his way he encounters several monster eggs but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.920
tries to stay positive he finds a frisbee on the&nbsp;
ground and keeps it with him just then he hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.800
a noise nearby the team members had advised him&nbsp;
to run and hide instead of fighting the creatures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.840
so joel goes into a nearby house it is empty as&nbsp;
expected curious he opens the fridge and sees a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.160
creature there he immediately rushes back outside&nbsp;
he ends up in front of a small pond a tentacle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.400
peeks out of it joel freezes like he does when&nbsp;
he is scared suddenly a huge mutated frog comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.840
out of the pond but joel doesn't move it attacks&nbsp;
joel with its tongue making him fall to the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.080
a dog jumps on top of him out of nowhere just as&nbsp;
joel is about to run the frog catches his legs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.200
with its tongue and drags him towards them the&nbsp;
dog saves joel from the frog and they both run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.880
to a nearby van it seems to be the dog's home&nbsp;
joel notices boy written on the ceiling and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.800
figures that it is the dog's name that night he&nbsp;
stays with boy in the van the following morning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.480
he draws the dog in his notepad thanking him for&nbsp;
saving his life and continues his journey boy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.080
follows him with his owner's dress it is the only&nbsp;
way boy can still be close to his owner joel keeps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.960
the dress in his backpack and starts walking with&nbsp;
boy the two become best friends on their journey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.000
boy protects joel from eating poisonous berries&nbsp;
and other dangers while joel tells him everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.800
about his life one day as they walk joel falls&nbsp;
into a pit the pit has several burrows inside it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.120
a warm monster called the sand gobbler comes&nbsp;
out from one of the holes and attacks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.680
just then two survivors throw him a rope and&nbsp;
bring him out of the pit several worm monsters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.200
attack him as he climbs up the survivors are a man&nbsp;
named clyde dutton and his eight-year-old friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.280
minnow minnow throws an explosive in the&nbsp;
pit and kills the rest of the monsters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.520
as the two strangers continue their journey joel&nbsp;
and boy follow them for safety it turns out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.560
minnow's father and clyde son were killed by a&nbsp;
monster and they have been together since then the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.280
duo is heading towards the north now where fewer&nbsp;
monsters live due to the cold climate and higher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.280
elevation joel decides to be with them until they&nbsp;
have to part ways suddenly everyone freezes as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.320
they come across a huge snail clyde makes joel&nbsp;
take his shirt off and gives it to the snail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.600
his shirt had the smell of sand gobblers in them&nbsp;
which attracted other monsters now the snail will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.880
spread it through the jungle and help them confuse&nbsp;
the monsters the snail slowly leaves minnow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.760
teaches joel that like the snail some creatures&nbsp;
are actually nice you can tell by their eyes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.800
for the next two days they teach joel to shoot a&nbsp;
crossbow in the right direction and other survival&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.720
skills joel draws every monster they come across&nbsp;
the day finally comes when they have to part ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.640
minnow insists he come with them to the north but&nbsp;
joel has to find amy clyde gives joel a grenade as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.840
a parting gift as joel and boy continue heading&nbsp;
west boyz suddenly feels something is wrong and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:30.000
hides joel tries to bring him out but before he&nbsp;
can he is attacked by a huge centipede monster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.560
like the one he had encountered in the bunker&nbsp;
this time dole manages to point his crossbow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.280
at him but freezes right after the monster&nbsp;
throws him away with its tail and surrounds boy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.960
joel lies on the ground thinking of the day his&nbsp;
parents died with much determination he gets up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:51.200
and shoots at the monster killing him he finally&nbsp;
saves boy and the two celebrate that night they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.480
stay at a motel where they encounter a talking&nbsp;
robot named mavis the robot has 51 minutes of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.240
battery left joel asks her if she has a working&nbsp;
outlet that he can use his radio on mavis offers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.080
her remaining battery to him joel finally contacts&nbsp;
amy who is worried about him she tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.960
her colony is leaving for a new place very soon&nbsp;
they have found another group of survivors who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.920
plan to take them somewhere safe before she can&nbsp;
tell him where they are going the power runs out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.440
joel brings mavis outside and talks to her about&nbsp;
his feelings the robot shows him the picture of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.240
his family through its database she plays a&nbsp;
song for them when suddenly her battery dies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.520
boy and joel continue their journey the&nbsp;
following day as they walk they encounter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.000
a queen sand gobbler clyde had warned them&nbsp;
about her being the most dangerous of them all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.280
the queen attacks them and chases them&nbsp;
through the woods joel and boy hide by a river&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.120
however boy gets scared and starts barking giving&nbsp;
away their position boy's owner's dress falls into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.840
the river which makes him get out of hiding the&nbsp;
queen finds their location but before she can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.280
attack them joel uses the grenade to kill her&nbsp;
he falls into the water before the explosion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.640
when he gets out of the water he finds several&nbsp;
leeches latch onto his body he screams at boy for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:11.040
giving away their location earlier saddened boy&nbsp;
runs away from him joel now walks alone but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.080
leeches seem to have poisoned him with something&nbsp;
he gets light-headed and starts to hallucinate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.600
just then a group of people appears before him&nbsp;
he opens his eyes to see amy in front of him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.520
amy is surprised to see him too the two kiss&nbsp;
but joel falls unconscious soon after that when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.720
he wakes up he is in a bunker amy greets him&nbsp;
as it turns out that he had kissed an old man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:39.040
earlier the two are talking when amy is called by&nbsp;
another older woman after her parents died amy has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.520
been in this colony taking care of the elderly&nbsp;
people there she is the head of the colony as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.920
the elders depend on her they live on a beach joel&nbsp;
goes outside and sees the beautiful view several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.880
people are packing to leave the place another&nbsp;
group of survivors had approached amy's colony&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:01.120
their leader cap had promised to take them to a&nbsp;
safer arena so now they are packing to leave joel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.920
meets cap who is preparing for a party at night&nbsp;
camp brews his own beer which is the attraction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:11.360
of the party later that day amy confesses she&nbsp;
is glad to see joel but has no romantic interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.240
in him she has grown into a different person&nbsp;
now and is mourning the death of a close one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.720
suggesting that she was together with someone&nbsp;
else all these years before he died joel is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:26.000
devastated and apologizes to her for not asking&nbsp;
before coming to see her amy assures him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.760
it is okay and invites him to join their colony&nbsp;
however joel decides to return back to his colony&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.640
and contacts them through the radio his friends&nbsp;
are happy and surprised to find out he is alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.080
they inform him that the bunker is no longer safe&nbsp;
for them and that they are planning to leave soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.360
the phone cuts off midway joel then notices the&nbsp;
berries and beer kept beside him by one of cap's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.560
friends he sees that the berries are poisonous&nbsp;
the one that boy had warned him about earlier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.320
joel realizes that cap and his crew are&nbsp;
planning to poison the other survivors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.680
he goes out to tell amy but she is too drunk&nbsp;
to understand just then someone hits him on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:07.200
the head and he falls unconscious the following&nbsp;
morning joel wakes up to him tied up on the beach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.000
the others are in the same condition cap reveals&nbsp;
that he and his crew are actually pirates who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.120
raid colonies for food and fuel he summons a crab&nbsp;
monster rigged with a makeshift electric collar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.920
to eat the colonists they also use the crab&nbsp;
to toe their yacht as the crab attacks them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:27.440
amy frees herself and joel she runs to fight the&nbsp;
crew and leaves joel to fight the monster crap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.880
amy fights with the girl member of the crew&nbsp;
joel surprisingly manages to push the crab over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.840
but cap electrocutes the crab and it hits joel&nbsp;
making him fall unconscious the crab then walks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:44.560
towards joel as he retreats just then boy comes&nbsp;
to his aid as dana aims to shoot boy amy hits her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:50.160
making her shoot the crab instead cap's crew runs&nbsp;
to the boat and gets back on their yacht the crab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.880
is about to kill joel when he looks at its eyes&nbsp;
and notices that it is actually a friendly animal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:00.000
it had gone wild because cap electrocuted it&nbsp;
so joel shoots at the chain that electrocutes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.520
it which makes the crab docile again it leaves&nbsp;
the beach and goes to capsic to kill all of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.320
later that day joel packs his bag to get back&nbsp;
to his colony to help them he gives his book of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.520
monsters to amy as a parting gift and they kiss&nbsp;
their goodbye we see joel survive the seven day&nbsp;&nbsp;

journey back to the bunker with boy he finally&nbsp;
meets his friends again they too decide to head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.160
to a safe place in the mountains on the radio joel&nbsp;
inspires other colonies to come out to the surface&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:31.120
proving that life outside is still possible in&nbsp;
the end we see many colonies head towards the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.480
mountains to live a better life clyde and minnow&nbsp;
are already there while joel and boy are also&nbsp;&nbsp;
