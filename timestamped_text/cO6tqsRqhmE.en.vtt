00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.340
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.720
Today, I'm going to explain the mystery thriller
film called “Julia’s eyes.”

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.099
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.376
Watch out and take care!

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.660
The movie starts when we see a blind woman...named
Sara talking to an invisible presence.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.180
The presence has been tormenting her for days.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.060
It plays songs and follows her around the
house.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.869
Sara cannot take more of this...so she goes
to the basement to hang herself.

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.630
Just then, she feels the presence near her.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.651
She changes her mind...but before she can
remove the noose, someone kicks the tool away.

00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:39.580
A person from a corner...clicks a picture
of her hanging to death.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.850
A set of hospital tools lies on a table nearby.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.500
Sara’s twin sister Julia lives miles away
from her.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.290
As Sara hangs to death, Julia collapses.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.570
She senses something wrong, and decides to
visit Sara.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.680
Julia and her husband, Issac, come looking
for Sara and find her dead in the basement.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.740
Sara and Julia both had the same kind of disease
that made their vision progressively worse...eventually

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.690
making them blind, but Sara’s vision had
gotten bad before Julia’s.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.140
At home, the police officer suggests...declaring
it a case of suicide…he suspects Sara got

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.170
depressed with her blindness, so she committed
suicide.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.990
However, Julia insists.. it is not, as Sara
was waiting for a donor to get her vision back

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.140
She believes this is not a case of suicide,
but that of murder.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.760
He then informs her of a blind lady named
Soledad...who Sara used to talk to.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.200
Julia visits Soledad, and gets to know about
a place named Baumann Centre; a place for

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.700
handicapped people.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.490
She tells her that Sara had made new friends
there.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.409
Julia visits the place.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.840
When she goes there, she hears a group of
blind women gossiping about Sara.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.479
Sara had a boyfriend who she went with…
to a hotel in Bellavista.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.530
The women notice Julia’s presence and confront
her.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.119
When she introduces herself, they ask who
the man she came with is.

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.030
Julia is surprised because she had come alone.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.670
But the women sense someone standing right
behind her.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.810
Julia sees someone walk out.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.060
She chases the person, and reaches a small
dark room.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.039
The person is right in front of her, but she
cannot see him due to the darkness.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.849
He flashes his camera which distracts Julia,
and he escapes.

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.660
Her eyesight goes weak.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.980
Issac wants her to go back home...because
any more stress will cause Julia to lose her

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.810
vision ,but she convinces him to go to Bellavista
for a holiday.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.000
In reality, she wants to find out Sara’s
boyfriend whom the blind women had been talking about

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.060
As they arrive in Bellasvista, she chooses
the hotel in which Sara stayed with her boyfriend.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.720
In the hotel, she cannot find any record of
Sara's boyfriend.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.990
Later at lunch, a waitress tells her that
her twin, Sara, already had her eye operation.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.400
So she is confused as why Sara committed suicide
if she already had the operation.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.650
Then, Issac reveals...that Sara’s doctor
told him that her eye operation was not successful.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.360
According to him, this is the reason Sara
committed suicide.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.870
As Julia is about to leave the hotel, a janitor
named Créspulo says that he found something

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.770
in Sara’s hotel room.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.570
He guides her to Sara’s room, and gives
her a key that belonged to Sara.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.820
Créspulo also tells her to be careful of
the man in the dark.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.709
Just then, Julia senses someone behind her.

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.459
The person runs away before she can catch
him.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.710
Julia and Issac then go to get surveillance
camera footage to identify the person Sara

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.710
was with.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.220
Issac goes in to get the footage, but never
comes back.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.879
When Julia goes in to check, Issac is not
there; all the footages are gone too.

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.989
She reports to the police about Issac’s
disappearance ,and tells them about the invisible man.

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.110
Just then, we see Créspulo bathing in a tub.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.250
Someone cuts off the light bulb over him.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.120
It electrocutes him to death.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.819
The police and Julia come looking for Créspulo,
and find him dead.

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.820
Julia is now sure that the invisible man has
killed Créspulo and kidnapped her husband.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.720
Worried about Issac, she gets a seizure that
further weakens her eyesight.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.710
She goes to see her doctor... who tells her
that she has less than a month before she

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.260
goes fully blind.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.220
He arranges an eye transplant surgery for
her.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.590
Later that day, she goes back to Soledad’s
house.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.160
Soledad had a husband and a son named Ángel.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.794
Her husband left her, and Ángel had looked
after her for ten years before suddenly leaving one day

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.530
Shortly, the police find Issac’s last location
to be a motel.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.100
They also find his wedding ring in the room
he stayed in.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.910
As the Inspector and Julia are in the 
motel talking, another officer comes saying

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.020
that someone is at Julia’s home.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.240
The two of them return back.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.410
Inspector goes to check into a room...when
Julia hears a noise from the basement.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.610
She goes down to check…but because of her
eyesight and the room’s darkness, she doesn’t

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.810
see anything.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.860
She feels around the room and suddenly touches
a man.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.710
Scared, she starts to yell for help.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.340
The inspector comes down, and tries to calm
her; suddenly, the lights come back.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.780
Issac’s body hangs from the ceiling.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.610
He has committed suicide.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.560
But even when the lights are on, Julia can’t
see.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.500
She has gone fully blind.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.630
The following day at the hospital, the inspector
tells Julia about Issac’s suicide letter.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.840
He had an affair with Sara for six months
before her death.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.820
He killed himself because he couldn’t lie
to Julia anymore.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.410
A few days later, Julia goes through eye surgery.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.590
She has to live with the bandage around her
eyes for a week.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.110
Only after that, will we know if the surgery
has been successful.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.940
During this time, she will stay under supervision
in her twin’s house.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.870
The hospital provides Julia with a caretaker
named Ivan...to help her around the house.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.199
He gives her a device to hang around her neck...so
that she can call him anytime she wants.

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.100
That night, Julia gets a nightmare about Issac
and Sara trying to get her bandage off.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.860
She wakes up terrified.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.290
Then she hears footsteps from outside.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.400
She calls Ivan through the device.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.639
He tells her to get out of the house.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:48.710
She escapes.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.000
Just then, someone takes the key Créspulo
had given her.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.740
The police come in the following day...but
they do not find any evidence of invasion.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.229
Ivan lovingly changes Julia’s bandage.

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.350
For the next few days, he takes great care
of her.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.800
Changing her bandages, cooking for her, listening
to music with her, and whatnot.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.620
But throughout all those times, we never get
to see Ivan’s face.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.770
On the third day, Julia asks him to stay for
drinks.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.789
They have a conversation about Issac...after
which she kisses him.

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:21.560
That night, Julia is woken up by a nightmare.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.560
As she reaches for her wedding ring on the
side table, we see a set of hospital tools

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.258
similar to one from the night of Sara’s
death... 

00:06:28.258 --> 00:06:30.898
Someone from behind her tries to injects her with
a drug.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.080
This wakes her up, and she finally touches
the man.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.229
Terrified, she runs out of the house to her
neighbor, Blasco’s home.

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:40.160
His daughter Lia is home too.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.710
He lets her inside but starts to harass Julia.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.500
Shortly, she is surprised to find Sara’s
key in his house; she takes it with her.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.450
She escapes from his house, and hides in a
corner calling Ivan for help.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.889
Finally, Ivan comes to save her.

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:57.550
She is too scared to go into her own house,
so he takes her to his.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.259
There she tells him that she found Sarah's
key at Mr. Blasco’s home.

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:04.410
She suspects that Blasco is the invisible
man.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.479
Ivan leaves for some time when Lia approaches
Julia.

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:10.729
She has followed them here and snuck into
the house through the windows.

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:14.509
Lia tells Julia that she was the one who stole
the key from her house and that she knows

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:16.550
who killed Sara and Issac.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.113
It is the invisible man - IVAN himself

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:24.699
Lia reveals that she used to be close to
Sara; and knows a lot about the invisible man

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:29.250
Julia doesn’t believe it but Lia insists
that the key unlocks one of the locks in Ivan’s house

00:07:29.726 --> 00:07:33.889
Ivan has been drugging Julia to make her go
blind...as he did with Sara.

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:38.830
Lia tells Julia to go to the bathroom, and
stay there until Lia finds a way to escape.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.199
When Ivan comes back, she asks him to take
her to the bathroom.

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:45.419
She then opens her bandage…4 days before
the schedule.

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:50.330
Luckily, the operation is successful, and
she is happy to have gained her vision back.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.820
She quickly goes outside, and enters one of
the rooms.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:58.470
She is shocked to see many pictures of Sara
and herself on the wall.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.940
Julia leaves the room to look for Lia, but
sees her body stabbed to the wall.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.350
Ivan had killed her too.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.310
Terrified, she sits down in the corner crying.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.810
Just then, Ivan comes into the room.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.900
We see his face for the first time.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.830
It is splattered with Lia’s blood.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:18.710
Julia poses as though the surgery was unsuccessful,
and pretends that she is still blind.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.650
Ivan expresses his love for her.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.610
Now she is in the kitchen with him.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.770
She sees him drugging her cup of tea.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.770
Julia then replaces her cup of tea with his.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.220
Ivan doesn’t notice but he gets suspicious.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.430
He takes her to the freezer, and asks her
to open it.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.349
Inside it... is the dead body of real Ivan.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:39.800
Julia gasps, giving away that she can actually
see.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.159
The imposter Ivan calls her a liar.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:46.810
He then takes her to Sara’s house, but Julia
manages to run away from him into Soledad’s house

00:08:47.286 --> 00:08:51.430
There she asks her to call the police, but
Ivan comes in before she can.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.439
He calls Soledad “mom”...revealing that
he is actually her son, Ángel.

00:08:55.439 --> 00:09:00.000
Julia pleads with Soledad to call the police,
but Ángel convinces her that he is not a killer

00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:03.470
Then Soledad hits Julia on her head with the
phone.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.769
Ángel realizes that his mother can see.

00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:09.230
Soledad reminds him he will be nothing without
her.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.980
This agitates Ángel, so he chokes her.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.480
He wants her to go back to being blind again.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.540
He pokes her eyes with a needle.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.879
When Julia wakes up, she is in the basement
of Sara’s house.

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:21.790
Ángel sits in front of her.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:25.429
He has packed all her clothes and plans to
take her away to live with him.

00:09:25.429 --> 00:09:29.559
As he starts to kiss her, Julia takes a knife
and stabs him on his legs.

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:32.750
She quickly runs out of the basement and locks
him there.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.769
But she can’t get out of the house.

00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:36.189
She calls the police.

00:09:36.189 --> 00:09:40.330
Just as Ángel breaks the door, Julia cuts
off all the lights in the house.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.550
It is pitch dark.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.529
Angel uses his camera flash to look for Julia,
and finds her.

00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:48.269
As he tries to stab her, the police come in.

00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:50.990
But they too cannot see anyone in the dark
room.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:55.420
Julia takes one of the torch lights from them,
and shines it to Ángel in the corner.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.369
The shadow finally comes to light.

00:09:57.369 --> 00:10:02.204
Ángel cannot handle being looked at by so
many people, so he slits his throat, killing himself

00:10:03.129 --> 00:10:07.339
Cut to a few weeks later, Julia is at the
hospital, she finds that the damage to her

00:10:07.339 --> 00:10:12.569
new eyes is irreversible...as she had been
continuously injected by her "fake" caretaker.

00:10:12.569 --> 00:10:16.730
Using her last few hours of vision, Julia
says goodbye to Isaac's corpse.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.029
It is revealed that he was the one who donated
her with his eyes.

00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:23.199
The movie ends as the camera zooms into Julia’s
eye...

00:10:23.199 --> 00:10:25.759
Now, for the explanation.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:29.160
Sara and Julia both have a condition called
degenerative vision.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.759
This causes them to lose their vision progressively....eventually,
going blind.

00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:35.759
Sara loses her vision before Julia.

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:38.950
Ángel has a fascination for blind girls.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.260
He calls himself an invisible man.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.100
This is a metaphor for him trying to say that
he has no friends or family.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.790
No one notices him when he’s around because
he’s not worth noticing.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:54.250
Over time, Ángel has developed the ability
to be stealthy, and stalk victims efficiently.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:58.175
He took care of his mother Soledad for ten
years thinking she was blind.

00:10:58.175 --> 00:11:00.625
Soledad was the only person who he talked
to.

00:11:01.089 --> 00:11:05.519
This filled Ángel with resentment towards
everyone who did not notice or care for him.

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:08.889
However, he fell in love with Sara, and then
Julia.

00:11:08.889 --> 00:11:12.749
According to him, only blind girls could feel
his presence.

00:11:12.749 --> 00:11:17.050
Sara tells her other blind friends at a Centre
For The Blind that she’s been dating someone.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.829
This person is Ángel.

00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:23.870
Once she has her eyes operated, she goes with
Ángel to a Hotel in Bellavista for a week.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.209
At this point she has her eyes bandaged.

00:11:26.209 --> 00:11:29.449
We are not told what circumstances she meets
with Ángel.

00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:33.420
Perhaps he was posing as her caretaker, and
his empathy was winning Sara over.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.589
Ángel doesn’t want Sara getting her eyesight
back.

00:11:36.589 --> 00:11:40.519
He ensures that he sneaks up on Sara in the
nights and injects her eyes with chemicals

00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:42.499
that destroy the optic nerve.

00:11:42.499 --> 00:11:45.579
The doctor declares that the operation has
failed.

00:11:45.579 --> 00:11:49.309
Sara gets to know that someone is following
her; she could feel his presence and resented him

00:11:50.087 --> 00:11:52.318
So, he killed her.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:57.060
When Julia came looking for Sara, Ángel saw
it as another opportunity at love.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.370
But Julia had her husband always by her side.

00:12:00.142 --> 00:12:01.948
Hence, Ángel killed him as well.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:07.069
However, the neighbor girl, Lia, helped Julia
find out about Ángel’s real intentions

00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:09.410
before he could blind Julia fully.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:13.240
At the end, finally, Julia makes him visible
to everyone.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.619
He had always been a lonely man.

00:12:15.407 --> 00:12:19.600
So, when the police officers had their eyes
on him, he could not handle it, killing himself

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.600
at the end.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.100
That’s my explanation for the movie “Julia’s
eyes.”
