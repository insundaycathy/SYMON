00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.000
Then we see Paige going to see Blake Johnson,

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.790
As driving they see a detour on the road,
so they take a different road.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.880
Soon as they try to take over their group,
they see Paige and Blake enjoying a popsicle,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.400
they make fun of them for a bit then, they
decide to pull over for the night, since they’re

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.330
tried and see a Wax Museum banner.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.110
Sooner, they stop around an isolated area
and prepare to spend the night there.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.290
Upon arrival, Carley asks Paige if her boyfriend
knows that she is pregnant, she denies, and

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.340
Carley says they should talk about it.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.560

brother does not like his sister’s boyfriend.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.090
It is revealed that Nick tried stealing a
car and Carley didn’t knew about it, so

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.840
she didn’t lie to cover him while cops were
looking for him.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:36.500
Later, Blake sees wind brining very bad smell,
they speculate it’s from Dalton, but soon

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.730
they find out that the bad odour is coming
from the woods, and something might be dead

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.730
there.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.620
However, they decide to continue partying,
Dalton records it all in his camera, Carley

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.950
takes his cam and records him instead and
he changes the clothes.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.760
He then takes the camera and records both
the couples kissing and Nick sitting there

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.760
like me.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.430
Sooner, a truck pulls over there and turns
high beam lights on, they ask him to turn

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.100
off his lights and Nick throws beer bottle
to the right spot breaking it.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.590
The truck then reverses and decides to leave,
boys encourage him.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.440
Later that night, we see someone sneaking
on them with a camera while they’re sleeping.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.010
Carley wakes up and she senses something and
decides to wake her boyfriend Wade about the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.270
noise outside tent.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.690
She then bravely decides to go outside the
tent, she walks a bit and turns around to

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.090
find Wade standing behind her, he says it’s
too late and she should come back in tent.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.450
Next day they sleep till 2:30 in the noon
and get ready to see their Football Game.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.920
The girls are in the woods taking a piss and
they smell the same odour of dead animal;

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.480
the boys discover fan belt of Wade’s car
is broken despite fact it being brand new.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.130
The girls decide to find the origin of odour,
and Carley falls into a pit of rotting animal

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.349
carcasses with flies all over, and she asks
for help, as she tries to get up, she sees

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.100
a human hand coming out of the pit.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.400
Wade and other boys come and rescue her, they
see a truck and think it might be from last

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.130
night, but the headlight is not broken.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.690
A man named Lester comes out and throws more
dead animals in the pit, they ask him about

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.400
the human hand in there, he goes and plucks
it, and he laughs by saying it’s not real.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.919
Wade ask him for a fanbelt, but it’s 15
miles away.

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.020
Nick decides to stay back in car in case someone
tries to destroy it again and the group gets

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.039
ready to leave.

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.909
As Carley changes dirty clothes, Lester looks
at her in a creepy way.

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:48.069
Later, Wade and Carley are in the truck with
Lester, he seems to be checking out Carley,

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.960
Carley says there is very bad smell in the
truck, which Lester replies, you will get

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.199
used to it, she says, she can never get used
to it, and he claims that you can get used

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.479
to anything if you spend longer time around
it.

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.569
He then stops suddenly at a river bend and
asks wade for help in making it out.

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.229
Carley says they will go on their own from
there, Lester seems disappointed, but he then

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.860
agrees.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.339
The couple makes it to other end Lester looks
at them in a creepy way, and they come across

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:20.389
a small town, and Wade feels bad for being
rude.

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:26.529
Later, back to the woods, the group is stuck
in traffic in Blake’s truck.

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:31.840
Carley and Wade walk in the town for a bit
and go to the gas station, but find it empty,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.809
they get call from Paige that the group is
coming back since there is a lot of traffic

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:38.259
and they’ll camp again tonight.

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:44.719
Carley decides to go to the local church for
help, there they see Bo Sinclair, they wait

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:50.080
outside, and Bo comes out for a smoke, they
talk to him, and he tells them that they interfered

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.270
a funeral for a fanbelt and leaves.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.039
He then comes back and says he lost someone
close to him and offers to help after half

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.430
an hour near the gas station.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.180
Then they decide to visit Trudy’s House
of Wax, a museum that is made of wax and feature

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.080
of the town.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.860
We see someone working on the wax statues,
everything in there is made of wax, even the

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:17.710
floor and walls, they browse for a bit, and
wade sees a dog in there.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.379
Carley flips some wax dolls and finds Vincent
watermark underneath it, then they see Vincent

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:26.909
written on a chair, we can recall that in
earlier scene in the movie a child was forced

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:29.990
to sit on a chair, so it might be his chair.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.050
Carley looks in a mirror and sees someone
starring.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.159
Wade goes to check it out and Carley stays
inside waiting, she walks and goes to the

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:46.199
kitchen and hears footsteps, she turns around
and sees a lady, she runs, to wade outside

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:48.240
and they leave.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.639
In the woods, Blake tells his friends that
he wants to enjoy hormone sandwich so Nick

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:58.159
and Dalton should go and pick up the group
instead and he stays here.

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:03.499
Bo does not show up so Wade decides to enter
gas station and get the fanbelt, they couldn’t

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:09.319
find 15 inch belt so Wade decides to grab
the 16 inch belt and Bo shows up and asks

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:13.949
them if they’re stealing it, wade says he
left the money on the counter but they couldn’t

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:19.330
find the 15 inch belt which he replies I have
one at my home and asks to pass by and get

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.680
it.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.909
They walk and Bo tells them how few years
ago everyone used to drive miles to the town

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:30.330
just to see Trudy’s House of Wax, she asks
about who’s Vincent?, he says they are not

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:36.309
living there anymore after the owner Trudy
got a cyst in her brain and she went crazy.

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:41.999
Upon arrival, Wade wants to use washroom,
so Bo and he goes inside, and Carley waits

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:43.749
in the car.

00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:49.229
Bo goes upstairs to get the belt, Wade comes
across a jar with animal fetus in it, and

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:53.710
then he sees few masks in the room, Carley
is bored so she comes out of Bo’s truck

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.819
and surprisingly she sees the headlight broken,
recalling how a truck showed up to them a

00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:05.039
night ago, she presses horn to bring Wade
out, but the light of house turns off.

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:10.490
As Wade knocks, a hand from behind with scissors
makes a cut in his leg, Wade crawls to a room

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.629
but is soon he is knocked out by a masked
man.

00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:18.439
Carley calls Blake to let them know about
the pickup truck for help but they are busy

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:20.430
in changing hormones.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.740
Bo comes out and she locks herself inside
the truck, she says you’re the guy from

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:30.629
campsite and he breaks glass, she starts the
truck kicks him out, as tries to leave but

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:35.560
it gets stuck and Bo shows up, so she runs
away.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.070
Dalton and Nick are on their way to pick them,
the masked man then brings wade to a surgical

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:49.370
room, and starts doing some weird things on
him, shaving his eyebrows, and making stitches

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.360
to the wound.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.000
Carley goes to the town and suddenly the town
is lightens up.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.300
In the house, the masked man puts set of metal
mold on Wade’s face with strings in it and

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:08.269
ties him up, screaming wade cannot move, he
then showers him with boiling wax on his naked

00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:12.350
body, making him an alive statue of wax.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:19.190
Carley runs to church for help, However, soon
she finds everyone inside it made of wax.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:25.220
Later, Bo enters the church while Carley is
hidden, he catches her from behind and she

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:31.310
runs outside the church, she sees a lady in
a house but soon he abducts her.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:36.560
Dalton and Nick reaches the river bend and
they decide to walk from there, Bo then strangles

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.410
Carley on a chair and then he tapes her to
the chair.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:46.500
Dalton and Nick arrive to the gas station
but find it empty, they decide to go separate

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.920
ways and look in every shop.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.910
Bo decides to use super glue to shut both
lips of Carley, and she can’t speak now,

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.730
and then he leaves her in a locked room.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:02.040
Bo goes out and Nick is waiting there, and
he asks him if he has seen his sister.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:08.360
Bo denies but Nick seems to speculate since
this is the only gas station in town.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:14.610
Carley takes her finger outside drain for
help, but Bo distracts Nicks and cuts it,

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:19.600
as nick decides to walk, Carley tears her
lips and screams for help, Bo then attacks

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.779
nick, but nick overpowers him.

00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:27.290
And locks him outside, then he goes downstairs
to Carley.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.290
As he sets her free.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:35.550
Dalton is seen entering The House of Wax,
upon going inside, he looks for Wade and Carley,

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:41.680
he looks for a bit and comes he then across
Wade in his Wax coating, he starts taking

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:47.360
wax off which also tears the skin apart, he
is then attack by the mask man, but it cuts

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:53.910
Wade instead, he then chases Dalton and soon
catches up with him and pushes him down the

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:55.910
stairs.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.379
And he then stabs him with knife also cutting
his neck.

00:11:00.379 --> 00:11:06.000
Later, in gas station they hear Bo leaving
in the truck, so they come up, they try to

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.350
call cops, but line is not working.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:13.720
Carley speculates that everyone is turned
into wax, she then takes him where she saw

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.759
the lady in the house earlier to look for
help.

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:22.279
Nick tries to look through the window, and
a lady moves the curtains, she is a statue

00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:25.000
rigged with a mechanism.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.910
In the woods, with loud music Paige starts
getting ready for Hormone Sandwich, the music

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:35.930
shuts off, so he goes out to play the music
and hears a voicemail from Carley about the

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.240
guy from the campsite.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:46.160
Later as Paige falls asleep, the masked man
goes to attack her, she then runs and comes

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.089
across Blake stabbed to the ground.

00:11:49.089 --> 00:11:54.160
Paige runs in the woods, and she goes and
hides in a sugar mill, there she grabs a box

00:11:54.160 --> 00:12:00.709
of dead cellphones, then she grabs a pipe,
as she walks, she is stabbed in the feet,

00:12:00.709 --> 00:12:07.199
she runs to a car, and hides in back seat,
soon Masked man approaches the car, she attacks

him with pipe, and runs, he then throws a
metal pipe through her forehead killing her

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.939
and then using Dalton’s camera to record
it.

00:12:16.939 --> 00:12:21.560
In the town, Carley claims the killer might
be Vincent, brother of Bo.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:26.529
Nick is raging out and breaks the window to
make noise, and grabs a weapon from a statue,

00:12:26.529 --> 00:12:31.319
then Bo shoots at them and they run and enter
a theatre, they see dozens of people sitting

00:12:31.319 --> 00:12:33.820
on the chair watching a movie.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:39.459
Bo catches up to them and starts looking for
them, Carley is pretending to be a statue,

00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:43.960
Bo shoots at her she dodges, and Nick shoots
him with X-bow.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:50.270
As Bo comes out, Nick shoots again, and takes
his gun which is empty now.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:55.689
Then they leave, Nick makes a plan to get
the cellphone and call Paige and Blake, they

00:12:55.689 --> 00:12:59.779
go to his truck and look for cellphone, and
couldn’t find it.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.880
Then nicks makes a plan to rescue their friends.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.069
He then opens the back door of the museum,
and they enter in it.

00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:12.079
Sooner Carley finds gun in a cage, having
a lock on it, they look for a key so they

00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:17.459
can open it, Carley comes across childhood
pictures of Bo and Vincent.

Soon Bo enters the house injured, so they
hide, Bo painfully takes out the X-bow.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.810

enters the house, and he tries to help him,

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:42.290

downstairs, Nick can’t see anything so starts
pressing the switches to get some lights.

00:13:57.269 --> 00:14:00.709
The Twin brothers notice this with creepy
smile.

00:14:00.709 --> 00:14:05.010
Nick sooner finds body of Dalton with wax
all over it, he tries to help but it breaks

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.440
the neck of it.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:11.999
Soon, Vincent comes there, and Nick bravely
starts attacking him.

00:14:11.999 --> 00:14:17.209
Nick then sees a tank of melted wax; he pulls
the chains pulling it and that causes a fire

00:14:17.209 --> 00:14:18.759
in there.

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:25.480

with a knife, Carley takes a baseball bat

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:35.879
and attacks Bo multiple times crushing his
face.

00:14:35.879 --> 00:14:38.920
Vincent comes and sees his brother dead.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.440
Vincent then screams in pain from his brother’s
death, and he starts chasing Carley to top

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.240
of the floor.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.750
The stairs are melting, and Nick tries to
go up.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:55.029
Vincent breaks the melting wall, she tries
to distract him with his brother’s death,

knife and stabs him, Vincent falls through
the floor and land on Bo’s corpse.

They both try to make their way through the
wall, the whole place starts melting down,

00:15:11.899 --> 00:15:16.060
but they make it out, before the place burning
to the ground.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:22.259
The next day, the police and ambulance arrive
there, the sheriff says the town was abandoned

00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:26.790
for 10 years and it wasn’t even on the map,
and they came here after tracing the smoke

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.620
and fire.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.009
They take them to hospital.

00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:36.019
The sheriff gets information that Trudy’s
family didn’t have two sons but three instead,

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:39.600

dog.
