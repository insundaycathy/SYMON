00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.710
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.240
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of
the 2018 American science fiction action film

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.010
called 'Extinction'.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.400
The film was directed by Ben Young and written
by Spenser Cohen and Brad Kane.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.890
The story is centered around a man who has
a recurring vision that results in the death

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.400
of his family.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.539
During the vision, he also witnesses an evil
entity determined to destroy all of mankind.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.300
There will be Spoilers ahead, so please proceed
with caution.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.949
Peter, an engineer, has dreams in which he
and everyone he knows are subjected to horrific

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.730
alien invasion-style encounters with an unidentified
enemy.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.160
He has a difficult relationship with his wife,
Alice, and daughters Hanna and Lucy as a result

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.330
of this.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.520
He unwillingly goes to a clinic for psychiatric
assistance, only to discover that another

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.740
patient there is seeing the same images, and
that the mind can only conceal them.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.260
This leads Peter to assume that his visions
are foreshadowing an impending invasion.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.300
One evening, while spending time at home with
his family, Peter's worst fears come true.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.930
Invading spacecrafts open fire on the city,
causing severe damage.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.360
In the midst of the chaos, ground soldiers
can be heard slaughtering civilians.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.179
After realising what is happening, Peter and
Alice quickly barricade the entrance to their

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:11.329
apartment.

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.770
Lucy is discovered cowering beneath a table
by an armoured alien soldier who bursts past

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.979
the barrier.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.180
The soldier takes a breather to inspect the
girl, allowing Peter and Alice to disable

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.180
him.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.009
Peter takes his family out of the building,
armed with the soldier's rifle.

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.859
Peter and his family decide to take refuge
in the factory where Peter works, based on

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:31.240
his visions.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.270
He is able to eliminate the troops protecting
the apartment building's exit by bypassing

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.799
the rifle's biometric verification.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.530
They find a tunnel entry and make their way
to the plant safely, but not before Alice

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.529
is hurt by a bomb blast.

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:47.189
As they reassemble, the soldier from their
flat approaches, having followed them down

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.869
using the homing signal on Peter's gun.

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.509
The soldier takes off his helmet and emerges
human, much to Peter's surprise.

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.109
Peter orders the man to carry Alice to the
factory as she is injured and unable to walk.

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.139
When they arrive at the factory, they meet
with David (Peter's boss), who reveals that

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:05.020
the invasion is not a surprise.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.710
And in fact he has been waiting for it to
happen for a long time.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.390
A doctor checks over Alice to but tells Peter
that there is nothing that can be done to

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.510
help her.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.880
The soldier shouts to Peter that he can save
Alice, as David's men try to drag the invading

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.360
soldier away to be executed.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.840
Peter offers to stay with the soldier to make
sure his wife is safe.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.430
Meanwhile, David will take their children
to a metro station, where they will board

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.310
a transport train to an offsite base.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.650
Peter is taken aback when the soldier reveals
that Alice is a synthetic (AI).

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.880
Alice will need an other source of power to
save herself: Peter himself.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.210
With the soldier's help, Peter uses a pocket
knife to cut open his own chest, revealing

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.530
that he, too, is a synthetic.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.980
The soldier attaches a wire between the two
synthetics, and Peter faints.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.210
Peter vividly recalls what he believed were
visions of the future, but are actually recollections

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.530
of a previous battle, in which the military
targeted unarmed synthetics, thinking that

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.640
they might rise up against humans.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.590
The synthetics retaliated and finally expelled
all humans from the planet.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.540
During the tension, Peter and Alice met, and
while battling the humans, they discovered

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.460
Hanna and Lucy, who are also synthetics.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.190
Most synthetics (including Peter and his family)
deleted their memories and lived as humans,

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.810
unknowing of their nature or past, to deal
with the guilt of what they had done and avoid

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.730
living in dread of retaliation from humans.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.160
When Peter awakens, Miles, the soldier, informs
him that people have been residing on Mars

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.170
for the past 50 years.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.440
He had anticipated the synths to be monsters,
not families with children, and after seeing

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.260
Lucy under the table, he realised he couldn't
execute anyone.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.600
As the humans breach the factory's roof, Peter
and Alice part peacefully with Miles to find

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.930
their daughters.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.830
As they board the train, David reveals that
he and a few other synthetics have retained

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.330
their memories to prepare for the humans'
eventual return.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.569
Peter believes that humans and synthetics
will be able to live in harmony one day.
