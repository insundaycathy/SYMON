Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.310
Today, I'm going to explain a drama, mystery,
sci-fi film called "Donnie Darko."

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.590
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.300
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.940
On October 2, 1988, a teenager named Donnie
wakes up in the middle of the road after sleepwalking

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.219
the night before.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.680
He takes in the sights, confused at what happened
to him at first, before smiling.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.539
Then, he rides his bicycle back to his home
in a small town in Virginia, where his family

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.300
spends the morning typically despite him disappearing
in the night.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.390
That evening, Donne has dinner with his family:
his parents, Eddie and Rose, and his sisters,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.030
Elizabeth and Samantha.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.499
Elizabeth and Eddie discuss politics, which
leads to Rose suggesting that Elizabeth go

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:42.179
to Harvard next fall.

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.249
Donnie makes an inappropriate joke to his
little sister that leads to an argument between

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:46.739
him and Elizabeth.

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.289
Later that night, Rose confronts her son about
disappearing in the night.

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.809
Donnie becomes defensive and suggests that
she take his medications instead.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.539
Rose leaves and discusses his behavior with
Eddie.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.239
Unable to sleep, Eddie heads to the living
room to watch T.V. Upstairs, Donnie is woken

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.619
up by a mysterious voice that leads him to
sleepwalk out of his bedroom.

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.909
Donnie passes by his father, but he has fallen
asleep in the living room.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.020
The voice beckons him as he walks outside
and into the dark streets.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.729
Finally, Donnie reaches a golf course and
smiles at the figure before him.

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.539
There stands a strange person wearing a creepy
rabbit costume.

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:22.259
The rabbit tells him that the world will end
in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds.

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.299
Back at home, Elizabeth had just returned
when something loud and heavy crashes into

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.460
the house, alerting everyone.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.021
The next day, Donnie wakes up on the golf
course, finding a marker in his hand and the

00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:34.509
numbers 28, 6, 42, and 12 written on his arm.

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.400
He walks home and sees officers and spectators
around his house as the jet engine that fell

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.229
on his bedroom is being removed.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.240
The F.A.A. provides them accommodations and
payment for repairs in exchange for a non-disclosure

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.240
agreement.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.950
Donnie learns that the F.A.A. hasn't figured
out where the jet engine came from.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.869
In their hotel room, Samantha asks questions
about the jet engine, but her old siblings

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.420
dismiss her questions.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.549
In the other room, their parents talk about
an old high school classmate who died on the

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.960
way to their prom after a paranoid episode.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.619
Eddie worries if Donnie will end up the same
way.

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:10.090
On the next day, Donnie and Samantha meet
up with their schoolmates: Ronald, Sean, Joanie,

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.129
and Cherita.

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.060
The girls eagerly ask about the jet engine
incident while Donnie's friends offer him

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.060
a cigarette.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.440
Ronald starts mocking Cherita, but Donnie
defends her.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.030
At school, Donnie attends an English class
discussing The Destructors by Graham Greene.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.190
His teacher, Karen Pomeroy, asks for his opinion
on the book's passage about destruction.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.790
He suggests that since destruction is a form
of creation, the novel's characters may want

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.340
to see the world torn apart to change something.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.769
The door opens, and all eyes meet the new
girl, Gretchen Ross.

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.299
Ms. Pomeroy challenges Gretchen to sit next
to the boy she finds most attractive, and

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.909
she chooses Donnie.

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.150
On their way to Donnie's psychiatrist, Eddie
laments reconstructing their house and how

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.600
the F.A.A. refuses to give them information
about what happened.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.640
Distracted by the conversation, Eddie nearly
hits an old woman standing in the middle of

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.790
the road.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.590
Donnie walks up to the woman to help, and
she whispers something in his ear.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.879
At Dr. Thurman's office, Donnie recounts meeting
the figure in the rabbit costume, who he's

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.290
named Frank.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.659
Donnie explains how Frank told him that the
world is ending, but he refuses to believe

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:08.659
that.

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.140
On the next day, Donnie's class watches a
video about overcoming fears hosted by Jim

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.590
Cunningham.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.079
Again, Donnie hears Frank's voice, who advises
him to pay close attention to the video.

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.220
While asleep on the couch, Donnie dreams about
the school in the water.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.450
He wakes up, seeing Frank watching him.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.540
Under Frank's influence, Donnie leaves the
house while carrying an ax.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.099
He reaches a building's water pipe and breaks
it.

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.590
On the next day, Donnie teases Samantha about
a short story she wrote while waiting for

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.590
the bus.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.660
Sean points out that their bus is 20-minutes
late.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.909
Two girls from their school run up to them,
reporting that the school is closed due to

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.590
flooding in the building.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.120
At the school, Principal Cole stands in the
flooding building; the water is leaking from

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.360
a busted water main.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.709
Outside, they find an ax protruding from the
school's statue's head.

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.930
A message is written at the foot of the statue,
saying, "They made me do it."

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.980
While walking back to school, Donnie spots
Gretchen getting cornered by the school bullies

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.040
Seth and Ricky.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.159
The two walk together, where he learns that
Gretchen moved with her mom to escape her

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.329
stepdad after he stabbed her mother.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.609
Donnie shares that he was arrested for burning
down an abandoned house, then clarifies that

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.010
he's gotten his life straight after the event.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.709
Before going their separate ways, Donnie asks
Gretchen out, and she accepts.

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.800
During his next therapy session, Dr. Thurman
puts Donnie under hypnosis, and he starts

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.130
talking about Gretchen.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.690
Dr. Thurman changes the subject to school
and his family, but Donnie continues talking

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.740
about girls and fantasizing about the actress
Christina Applegate.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.720
Dr. Thurman ends the hypnosis when she sees
Donnie unzipping his pants.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.780
Back at school, the police order the students
to write "They made me do it" on the board

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.970
to match their handwriting with the vandalism.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.380
When it's Donnie's turn, Principal Cole marks
him as suspicious, given his hastiness.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.760
While in the bathroom, Seth accuses Donnie
of spreading rumors that he flooded the school.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.600
Then, Seth puts a knife to Donnie's throat,
accusing him of doing the deed instead before

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.600
leaving.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.130
Later that day, Donnie and his friends hang
out in a field, shooting at bottles as they

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.630
argue about The Smurfs.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.000
However, their conversation is interrupted
when the same old woman that Eddie nearly

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.280
hit before stops in the middle of the road
again, alarming a driver.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.380
Donnie's friends nickname her Grandma Death,
as she is often seen standing in the middle

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.360
of the road to check her empty mailbox that
never receives any mail.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.390
That evening, the school hosts an emergency
P.T.A. meeting to determine who flooded and

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.910
vandalized the school.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.600
The gym teacher, Mrs. Kitty Farmer, links
the act of vandalism to the story, The Destructors,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.250
which Ms. Pomeroy teaches in her English class.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.320
Mrs. Farmer claims that the novel inspired
the act and shouldn't be taught in their school.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.660
As this happens, Donnie finds Frank in his
bathroom, who assures him that no one will

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.280
find out what he did.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.280
Donnie faces the strange creature, but a force
field seemingly blocks him from Frank.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.510
He asks why Frank led him to flood the school
to which Frank merely explains that they are

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.870
in grave danger.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.500
When asked where he came from, Frank questions
if Donnie believes in time travel.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.710
The conversation ends when Samantha walks
into the bathroom; Frank has disappeared.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.680
On poetry day, Donnie reads a poem he wrote
about Frank.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.710
Later that day, Mrs. Farmer implements attitude
lessons, but Donnie argues the concept that

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.470
she's teaching, insisting that life and human
emotions cannot be lumped into categories.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.990
Due to this argument, Donnie's parents are
called into the principal's office.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.400
Despite Mrs. Farmer's hysterics, Rose and
Eddie are not bothered by Donnie's behavior,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.460
though they suspend his after-school activities
as punishment.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.340
Mrs. Farmer lectures Rose on raising her son,
shocking the mother.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.950
On October 10, Donnie learns time travel theories
from his science teacher, Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.840
Dr. Monnitoff gives Donnie a book titled "The
Philosophy of Time Travel," written by a former

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.910
nun who suddenly turned to science.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.400
Donnie recognizes the author's name Roberta
Sparrow as Grandma Death.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.930
In his next therapy session, Donnie talks
about Roberta and how Frank told him to look

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.530
into time travel, leading him to assume that
Frank wants him to talk to Roberta.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.930
Donne tells Dr. Thurman that Roberta said
that every living creature dies alone, which

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.210
reminded him of his childhood dog, who died.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.120
Donnie admits that he has stopped wondering
about God but confesses that he doesn't want

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.520
to be alone.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.460
While watching football that evening, Donne
sees a bubble emerging from his father and

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.680
sister, dictating their next steps.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.240
He looks down and sees a bubble on his chest,
directing him to go somewhere.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.930
Donnie follows the bubble to his parent's
room, where he finds a gun in the closet.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.170
A week later, Donnie walks home with Gretchen,
where they talk about turning back the time.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.610
Donnie leans to kiss her, but Gretchen avoids
him, saying that she wants their first kiss

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.560
to be something she'll remember fondly of
in the future.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.410
After pondering Donnie's behavior, Rose and
Eddie visit Dr. Thurman to discuss him.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.950
Dr. Thurman suggests that Donnie is afraid
of the world, and thus he's detached himself

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:21.950
from reality.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.390
Dr. Thurman tells them about Frank, which
the parents aren't aware of.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.550
The signs point to Donnie having daylight
hallucinations and paranoid schizophrenia.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.600
During this, Donnie continuously jams a knife
onto his bathroom mirror, imagining Frank

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.150
in the reflection.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.180
Days later, Jim Cunningham hosts a school
assembly that Mrs. Farmer arranged.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.210
Jim presents a story as part of the lesson,
where the protagonist is named Frank, distracting

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.210
Donnie.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.430
Once Jim receives questions from the students,
Donnie finds his answers absurd and starts

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.680
berating Jim.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.810
He offers crude advice to the students who
raised their questions earlier.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.470
The adults are horrified at Donnie's statements,
yet the students cheer him as he's being escorted

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.470
away.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.650
After school, Donnie rants about Jim's hypocrisy
to Gretchen.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.370
He hands her Roberta's book and explains that
he sees bizarre things tied to the book.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.840
Hoping for answers, the two visit Roberta's
home, but no one responds.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.700
Finally, while checking her mailbox, they
spot Roberta watching them on the terrace.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.590
In his mind, Donnie hears Frank telling him
to send Roberta a letter.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.000
The next day, Mrs. Farmer's insistence on
teaching the students morality hindered the

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
other teachers.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.260
Dr. Monnitoff refuses to discuss philosophy
with Donnie when he brings God into the argument,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.890
and Ms. Pomeroy confiscates copies of The
Destructors from the students.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.120
While walking home from school, Donnie finds
Jim's wallet on the street, learning where

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.330
he lives.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.390
During Gretchen and Donnie's science presentation,
Seth and Ricky bring up Gretchen's stepfather,

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.610
which upsets her.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.310
She storms off the school with Donnie following
behind.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:43.229
Full of emotions, Gretchen kisses him, solidifying
their relationship.

00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:46.230
That night, Donnie and Gretchen watch a movie
together.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.709
Gretchen falls asleep in the middle of the
film, allowing Donnie to speak to Frank.

00:08:49.709 --> 00:08:53.269
Frank removes the head of his costume, revealing
the face of a young man with an injured eye.

00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:56.500
He recounts that his father and his grandfather
are also named Frank.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.740
The movie warps, showing Donnie a portal that
seems to lead to the sky.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.500
Then, he envisions fire as Frank advises him
to "burn it to the ground."

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.240
Finally, Donnie leaves the cinema alone, formulating
a plan.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.430
While Jim hosts the school's talent show,
including Samantha's dance group as one of

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.329
the contestants, Donnie finds his way to Jim's
house and pours gas all over.

00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:17.290
Jim's house burns down as the crowd cheers
in the talent show.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.680
Donnie heads back to the cinema, seeing that
Gretchen is still asleep, not noticing that

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.880
he left.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.610
The following morning, Donnie shares his worries
about his sanity with his father.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.730
Not wanting his son to be dragged down by
these thoughts, Eddie advises Donnie to speak

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.870
his mind no matter what others think.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.899
Donnie is comforted, seeing his father's confidence
in him.

00:09:33.899 --> 00:09:37.329
While extinguishing the fire in Jim's house,
the news reveals that the firefighters found

00:09:37.329 --> 00:09:40.829
obscene content involving minors, leading
to Jim's arrest.

00:09:40.829 --> 00:09:45.449
On October 24, Ms. Pomeroy gets fired without
being given a reason for her dismissal.

00:09:45.449 --> 00:09:49.160
Samantha's dance group is invited to perform
in California, which excites their coach,

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.160
Mrs. Farmer.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.930
However, her joy is soon cut short when she
learns about Jim's arrest.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.589
In one of her last classes, Ms. Pomeroy uses
the rabbits from Watership Down as a metaphor

00:09:57.589 --> 00:09:59.100
for human existence.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.329
But Donnie interrupts her, noting how the
rabbits cannot compare to humans as they have

00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:04.139
no complex emotions.

00:10:04.139 --> 00:10:07.209
Gretchen chimes to explain how the rabbits
in the novel are products of the author's

00:10:07.209 --> 00:10:09.490
imagination, thus carrying his emotion.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.420
That afternoon, Mrs. Farmer asks Rose to chaperone
the dance group's trip to California while

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.209
she testifies to defend Jim, believing his
arrest is a conspiracy.

00:10:17.209 --> 00:10:20.990
Later that day, Rose finds a disturbing sketch
Donnie made in his bedroom.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.300
She explains how she'll be leaving with Samantha
to California, and with Eddie being in New

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.040
York will leave Donnie and Elizabeth alone
in the house.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.370
Knowing that she's disturbed by his drawings,
Donnie asks her what it feels to have a son

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:34.320
like him, to which she comforts him by saying
she feels wonderful for having him.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.080
Days later, Elizabeth and Donnie say goodbye
to Rose and Samantha as they head to California.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.779
After school, Donnie finds Ms. Pomeroy packing
up her things.

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:44.910
Getting inspired by Ms. Pomeroy's story of
a linguist choosing the words "Cellar Door"

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.029
as the most beautiful in the English language,
Donnie tells Cherita that things will get

00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:49.029
better for her.

00:10:49.029 --> 00:10:52.749
Tearfully, Cherita runs away, leaving her
ear muffs in his hands.

00:10:52.749 --> 00:10:56.470
Donnie looks down and sees Cherita dropped
a notebook with his name on the front.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:00.750
Donnie revisits Dr. Thurman, where she asks
him about his parents while he's under hypnosis.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.490
Donnie remembers not receiving the Christmas
present he wanted, which made him feel regret.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.860
When Dr. Thurman asks what else he regrets,
Donnie smiles sheepishly and confesses to

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:09.910
his crimes.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:13.100
He explains that he had to obey Frank as he
saved his life and that he'd be left alone

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.279
if he didn't.

00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:17.670
Donnie begins to cry, his face reddening,
as he tells Dr. Thurman about Frank's end

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.459
of the world prediction.

00:11:19.459 --> 00:11:23.120
Still under hypnosis, Donnie gets up and picks
up a stuffed dog, cradling it in his arms

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.120
for comfort.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.820
Then, he opens his eyes and shrieks, seeing
Frank in front of them.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.790
Donnie's face calms, telling Dr. Thurman that
the sky will open up.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.029
Dr. Thurman reminds him that there will be
nothing left but himself and Frank if the

00:11:34.029 --> 00:11:35.370
sky opens up.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.569
The idea brings Donnie to tears until Dr.
Thurman breaks him out of his hypnosis.

00:11:39.569 --> 00:11:43.002
Before he leaves her office, Dr. Thurman reveals
that his medicines are placebo and he should

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:44.399
stop taking them.

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:47.839
She identifies to him the difference between
atheists and agnostics, classifying him as

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:49.080
the latter.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.309
On October 29, Elizabeth announces to Donnie
that she's been accepted into Harvard.

00:11:53.309 --> 00:11:55.629
He suggests throwing a Halloween party to
celebrate.

00:11:55.629 --> 00:12:00.000
That evening, Gretchen arrives at the party,
distraught about her missing mother.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.029
Donnie takes her to his bedroom, where she
shares her suspicion that her stepfather is

00:12:03.029 --> 00:12:04.180
responsible.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.459
The two start making out and head back to
the party after a passionate evening.

00:12:07.459 --> 00:12:10.680
During this, Elizabeth searches for someone
named Frank.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.009
Donnie's elated mood is suddenly warped into
dread.

00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:15.959
He sees the bubble from his chest that leads
him to the note on the fridge, saying that

00:12:15.959 --> 00:12:17.600
Frank went out to buy beer.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.120
The bubble continues to move, showing him
visions that disturb him.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.149
Donnie takes Gretchen, Ronald, and Sean away
from the party.

00:12:24.149 --> 00:12:27.459
They go to Roberta's house, where Donnie and
Gretchen enter through the cellar door.

00:12:27.459 --> 00:12:33.120
They search for Roberta but get ambushed by
Seth and Ricky, who hold the two at knifepoint.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.449
Ricky throws Gretchen to the ground before
scaring Ronald and Sean away.

00:12:36.449 --> 00:12:40.000
He sees a car coming and warns Seth, who has
Donnie pinned to the ground.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.170
Ricky escapes before the car gets close.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.339
Roberta appears in the middle of the road,
causing the car to swerve and hit Gretchen

00:12:45.339 --> 00:12:46.339
instead.

00:12:46.339 --> 00:12:49.410
The scene finally forces Seth to let go of
Donnie and escape.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:53.699
Two boys step out of the car, including Frank,
who is now only an average teenager.

00:12:53.699 --> 00:12:56.879
Cold with grief, Donnie shoots Frank in the
eye with the gun he stole from his parent's

00:12:56.879 --> 00:12:57.879
room.

00:12:57.879 --> 00:13:01.129
After Frank's friend flees, Roberta approaches
Donnie, having received the letter he sent

00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:02.129
her.

00:13:02.129 --> 00:13:04.980
She tells him that a storm is coming, so he
must hurry.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.050
That morning, Donnie carries Gretchen's body
back to his house.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.069
He takes his parent's car and finds a dark
vortex slowly descending over his house.

00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:15.559
Donnie recklessly drives to a ridge overlooking
the town with Gretchen's body in the passenger's

00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:16.559
seat.

00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:19.470
Laughing at his hopelessness, Donnie watches
the vortex growing bigger, destroying the

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.499
plane Rose and Samantha are in.

00:13:21.499 --> 00:13:25.410
As Donnie gazes at Gretchen's face, the events
of the last 28 days replay in his mind as

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.600
he recounts the letter he wrote to Roberta.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.899
He tells her that he's afraid that the time-travel
book is not fictional and hopes to have something

00:13:30.899 --> 00:13:33.430
to look forward to despite the world ending.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.290
Donnie is back in his old bedroom, laughing
as he realizes that he gets a do-over.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:41.459
It's October 2 again, and Donnie has a chance
to rewrite the past and save Gretchen.

00:13:41.459 --> 00:13:45.220
He waits in bed as the jet engine falls into
his room, crushing him under its weight.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.800
The people who would have had life-altering
experiences with Donnie of the other timeline

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.709
wake up from their dreams, including the real
Frank.

00:13:51.709 --> 00:13:55.089
In the morning, this timeline's Gretchen bikes
pass the Darko's house as Donnie's body is

00:13:55.089 --> 00:13:56.300
wheeled away.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.120
But this Gretchen didn't meet Donnie.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:09.430
So even as she waves to Rose, neither remember
each other in this new timeline.
