00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.320
Welcome to Slash Forward. I’ve always&nbsp;
said that the best protection against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.040
unforeseen calamities is to constantly run&nbsp;
different scenarios in your mind. To that end,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.840
we’re going to take a detailed look at a different&nbsp;
kind of alien encounter with the 1982 film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.320
Xtro. A young man enjoying some good&nbsp;
old fashioned stick play with his father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.680
suffers a devastating loss when that very same&nbsp;
father previously mentioned is abducted into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.720
a dark void. With a paucity of evidence of the&nbsp;
terrible event, young Tony finds himself alone on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.240
an island of emotional solitude for the next three&nbsp;
years...until his father Sam returns - but does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.960
he? In this interesting take on a classic story&nbsp;
we’re left to wonder what the hell is going on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.320
in terms of the compulsions and intent of the&nbsp;
strange beings as the only things we ever really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.800
learn from them are through the impulses of&nbsp;
Sam, who has not returned so much as he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.280
been reborn from the bowels of the Earth. I’m&nbsp;
guessing this one screwed some of you up when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.520
you were kids. Be sure to leave a comment with any&nbsp;
ideas of what the aliens might have been up to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.120
and feel free to hit the like button if&nbsp;
you enjoy the video. Let’s get to it.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.000
We open on a quaint little summer cottage&nbsp;
where little ToneTone, a right proper madlad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.560
hops a fence to steal the hubcaps off&nbsp;
a car. But mummy gets away. So he goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.040
back to playing stick whacker with papa Sam.&nbsp;
When he tosses that sum’ bitch into the air,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.880
it effing explodes and drapes the sky in total&nbsp;
darkness. They’re victim to a persistent assault&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.920
of light and leaves and general chaos and,&nbsp;
when it’s all said and done, daddy is gone.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.840
We flash forward three years to Tony&nbsp;
waking up, haunted by thoughts of why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.520
Sam doesn’t want them anymore. Rachel&nbsp;
does her best to raise her young boy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.560
but is troubled by his recurring nightmares and&nbsp;
the fact that he can’t get over his loss despite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.240
her finding a perfectly acceptable replacement&nbsp;
in Joe, the fine specimen who now shares her bed.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.600
But then, in the cold, dark night after these&nbsp;
long, three years, a familiar lighted shape crests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.320
the country hill. It cuts a path into the forest,&nbsp;
leaving a trail of smouldering wreckage behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.240
and compelling the natural earth to reconstitute a&nbsp;
portion of its base elements into a sort of slimy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.120
upside-down man. It makes a quick appearance to&nbsp;
rile up the locals. Luckily there is no damage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.880
to the vehicle, but Thadeus happens&nbsp;
to be a total freak about cryptids,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.880
so he’s geeking out right now. His&nbsp;
curiosity drives him deep into the woods,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.160
and he doesn’t even consider turning back until&nbsp;
he happens upon a fleshy little wad of meat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.880
which tongue-lashes him just below the eyeballs&nbsp;
- the prime kill spot. When he doesn’t return,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.280
Sardinia backs down the road a bit to see if&nbsp;
she can find him, but instead gets grabbed.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.720
Later on, outside a nearby summer cottage, a&nbsp;
familiar form approaches in the dark. Inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.360
the current occupant is warned of potential danger&nbsp;
by her trusty pooch, who becomes frustrated that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.480
she’s so dense. But then a strange noise outside&nbsp;
does prompt her to lock up, set the mood just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.760
right for blood, and to load up the shotty. But,&nbsp;
her intruder’s already inside, and after willfully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.040
feeding it her hand and passing out, it uses a&nbsp;
slimy protuberance to get her mouth pregnant.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.200
Back at the London flat Tony has another bad&nbsp;
dream, prompting him to interrupt mommy’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.200
grown-up wrestle sesh so she can put him&nbsp;
back to bed. He seems to be feeling better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.200
despite suffering from a flop sweat, and he&nbsp;
announces daddy’s return before revealing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.440
that he’s been completely saturated&nbsp;
in life juice from an unknown source.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.400
They call the doctor, but he doesn’t find any&nbsp;
signs of external injury. So, with nothing else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.200
to worry about he wraps it up and heads on&nbsp;
out. Along the way Joe oversteps with advice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.320
about what’s best for Tony while the doc suggests&nbsp;
this may be psychosomatic and therefore treatable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.680
through therapy. Then Annalise, the fiery French&nbsp;
scientologist comes out to make him choke on his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.480
words. So, he confirms that with his job done,&nbsp;
it’s in their hands and he takes his leave.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.520
Back at the cottage, Dingo’s tucking into&nbsp;
a massive, sloppy pile of wet meat as his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.400
owner wakes up feeling a bit off. She tries&nbsp;
to settle her GI with some refreshing water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.120
but baby’s not in the mood. She collapses under&nbsp;
the weight of her distended belly and serves up a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.320
birthing scene for the ages. Luckily for her sleep&nbsp;
schedule, she gives birth to a full grown man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.360
Luckily for Tony, that man happens to be&nbsp;
his father, yea, wash up like a man, boy.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.160
Once he’s all cleaned up, he follows a vague&nbsp;
memory of a past life to get himself dressed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.320
and secure transportation. Later that&nbsp;
morning Rachel is awoken by a caller,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.920
but Sam is not yet able to speak coherently and he&nbsp;
also accidentally melts the phone. After he rolls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.720
up with Sardinia still in the passenger seat for&nbsp;
carpool purposes, he gets out and begins creeping.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.000
Upstairs things are as normal - Tony has no&nbsp;
respect for anyone, Annalise is lazing about and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.320
we learn that they’re addressing the prior night’s&nbsp;
events by pretending they never happened. On the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.040
way to school they’re accosted by an old lady in&nbsp;
the hallway and Tony shoots that bitch. Then, as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.160
they make their way through the traffic and bustle&nbsp;
of the city, Sam is close by watching and waiting.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.440
Back at the lot a tradesman pulls&nbsp;
up hard and bumps Sam’s car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.000
When he goes to apologize, he accidentally&nbsp;
unpacks Sam’s lunchbox. While at the flat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.600
Annalise is spending her time on the&nbsp;
clock engaged in an afternoon delight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.840
It’s interrupted by a call that’s maybe&nbsp;
important? But I can’t focus on anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.840
other than how Michael is putting whatever&nbsp;
his mouth touched all over that milk bottle.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.000
At the studio Joe is engaged in his side&nbsp;
hustle of foot photography when Rachel dips&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.760
out to go pick Tony up from school. When&nbsp;
she gets there the yard marm informs her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.000
that her services are unnecessary, because&nbsp;
Tony’s already been picked up by his father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
who she’s never met. She rushes off,&nbsp;
searching frantically, until overcome by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.680
a strange feeling that leads her to Sam and&nbsp;
Tony. Sam can speak now, so they catch up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.320
After the formalities he confirms that he’s&nbsp;
back for good now, but from where? Who knows?

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.080
She brings him home to sort things out, and&nbsp;
he expresses how good it feels to be back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.120
where he belongs on a permanent basis, which&nbsp;
is presumptuous. After dressing smartly in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.360
some of his old wardrobe, a sip of Scotch&nbsp;
causes his memory of that fateful day to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.680
come flooding back. Joe comes in to start&nbsp;
sizing things up and make preparations for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.080
staking his claim, but the initial signs&nbsp;
are not promising. In a more private moment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.000
Joe complains about getting his feelings hurt,&nbsp;
and Rachel admits that she's feeling like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.080
Sam’s explanation of what happened might&nbsp;
warrant picking up where they left off.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.840
Later that night Sam slips into Tony’s room&nbsp;
and snatches Harry’s eggs so he can start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.880
slurping up that sweet, sweet snake embryo.&nbsp;
Tony walks in at an inopportune moment and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.760
oh, he knows immediately what daddy’s up to.&nbsp;
Mostly because Harry is obviously pissed off.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.000
Tony is so startled that he jets out of the&nbsp;
whole building and into the cool evening air,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.640
bare-chested, and doesn’t stop until he’s good&nbsp;
and lost but with Sam still hot on his heels.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.200
Meanwhile Rachel comes home and finds Tony’s room&nbsp;
empty. Insistent that Sam must have stolen him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.040
Joe hopes he can score some brownie points&nbsp;
by jogging off with her in search of Tony.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.000
When Sam catches up with his son, he explains that&nbsp;
he’s changed a bit in his time away. For instance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.200
he needs snake eggs now. He offers to take Tony&nbsp;
back with him before comforting his son in a way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.680
that I’m not sure I can describe without getting&nbsp;
in trouble. When Rachel and Joe return, the boys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.240
are back and Sam plays it off like they just went&nbsp;
to get some sweets, but we saw what happened.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.920
That night at dinner the adults make small&nbsp;
talk, which turns into a group chat about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.480
Sam and Rachel’s relationship. The tone&nbsp;
escalates until Sam puts Joe in his place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.960
causing Joe to screech at him like a howler&nbsp;
monkey. Meanwhile, Tony’s spinning tops with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.520
his mind and that freaks him out. He calls for&nbsp;
daddy, and Sam comes to reassure him that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.080
represents the new norm, and from this point&nbsp;
on moving toys is but a fraction of his new,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.320
ill-defined suite of powers imbued&nbsp;
upon him during the basement incident.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.440
Meanwhile, Harry packs up and leaves, looking&nbsp;
to start over in a new place more amenable to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.080
nurturing snake babies. Unfortunately, first&nbsp;
stop on his journey is Mrs. Goodman’s flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.640
And in this house, they are indiscriminate in&nbsp;
dealing with serpentine vermin. She returns his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:38.160
tenderized remains to Rachel, causing Tony to go&nbsp;
into a fit of rage, but not yet Tony, not yet.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.920
Later on, while doing his sketches,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.320
Rachel delivers some more clothes to Sam&nbsp;
and also lays down some mixed messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.240
After she leaves he tries to calm the&nbsp;
fire in his brain by huffing some gas.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.520
Tony dreams of Harry, and in his focused rage&nbsp;
he manifests some clown magic. But this is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.680
silly type of clown that thirsts for blood.&nbsp;
Then Mrs. Goodman answers a knock at the door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.320
and is surprised when an unknown visitor begins to&nbsp;
make his way in. She’s even more surprised to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.280
it’s a man-sized toy equipped with a functional&nbsp;
harpoon gun. Failing that, it pursues her with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.600
its assault rifle, but she does a cracking job&nbsp;
of hiding out. Unfortunately, her sweet tooth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.080
cannot be tamed, and she gives an indication&nbsp;
as to where the bayonet should be inserted.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.480
The next morning Joe sulks off to work in&nbsp;
an introspective mood. We know it’s bad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.040
because when he gets to the studio, he attempts&nbsp;
to drown his sorrows in some refreshing juice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.600
Back at home it appears he left Rachel a Dear&nbsp;
John letter. Now free to pursue her interests,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.760
she goes out to reminisce with Sam whose&nbsp;
memory is slowly coming back into focus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.920
But then when Annalise is sorting the wash,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.840
she finds some strange items in Sam’s jacket.&nbsp;
But he has no memory of them, very convenient.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.640
Regardless, she pops in to say hi to Joe and make&nbsp;
sure he’s aware that she’s going to the cottage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.920
with Sam, so bye. Back at the flat Annalise&nbsp;
is doing a real shit job of cleaning...if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.000
that is her job, still not fully sure&nbsp;
of her role - and the doorbell rings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.600
announcing Michael’s arrival. As&nbsp;
a certified sex fiend, she sneaks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:06.080
him into her room before letting Tony know she&nbsp;
needs to go take a nap get roasted by a child.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.000
He gives her about five minutes before&nbsp;
insisting on a game of hide and seek,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.760
which she agrees to in the hope it will shut&nbsp;
him up. Determined to get back to her lover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.840
she attempts to make quick work of this.&nbsp;
Tony throws his voice, making her think he’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.240
on the elevator. She chases it up and down, but&nbsp;
ultimately discovers it to be unoccupied - except&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.720
for the clown. I guess Tony was mad at her&nbsp;
or something? As Michael waits patiently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.200
Tony sucks out her lifeforce - or blows&nbsp;
something into her, it’s not totally clear.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.880
While all this is going down, Rachel and&nbsp;
Sam arrive at the old cottage to see what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.560
additional memories they can reconstruct for&nbsp;
Sam. But then when they get to the front door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.760
hmmmm, someone short who burns things&nbsp;
I would say. They go in and look around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.240
and Rachel finds that someone left the gas&nbsp;
on, exactly how Sam likes it. But before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.560
we can go deeper Sam elects to run off&nbsp;
to find his favorite spot in the woods.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.760
Michael finally gets fed up with&nbsp;
waiting and goes to look for Annalise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.400
but he doesn’t find her on the mantle and then a&nbsp;
toy tank rolls in and tries to straight up blast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.800
his face through the back of his head. He seeks&nbsp;
refuge in the bathroom where he finds Annalise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.240
busy nurturing her new egg sac.&nbsp;
Plus, there’s a black panther.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.400
Back in the woods Rachel finds a presence&nbsp;
and runs to tell Sam. But when she finds him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.800
he’s all rolled up and quivering like a baby&nbsp;
bird. She brings him back inside so he can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.920
get all warmed up and cozy. Then, as she goes to&nbsp;
call home, he pulls out a hair plug and tosses it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.640
into the fire, which is definitely not going to&nbsp;
raise the ambiance. She’s unable to reach Tony,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.760
because he’s busy enjoying a milkshake while his&nbsp;
clown friend repurposes the appliances for their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:39.120
activities. You know, guy stuff. Rachel then calls&nbsp;
the super to ask if he can go check in. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.120
whatever they’ve got going on in the bathroom&nbsp;
comes to fruition. The clown carefully collects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:48.400
the eggs and prepares them for incubation. So,&nbsp;
they’re too busy to answer when Mr. Knight rings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.600
This either puts Tony in a bad mood, or he’s&nbsp;
now using his powers to kill anyone who garners&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.000
his attention. Because, when Mr. Knight gets&nbsp;
downstairs, he steps off the elevator into total&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.880
darkness, and has his throat slit by a bouncing&nbsp;
light. Not sure why he didn’t see that coming.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.480
With no callbacks Rachel enlists Joe’s&nbsp;
help in trying to get some answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.280
As he casually cleans the birdcage, he notices&nbsp;
a striking resemblance between the jacket photo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.520
and a story about a dead woman recently found&nbsp;
in the area. He tries to call back right away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.600
but Sam knows what’s up and heats up&nbsp;
the phone box with his hot little hands.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.080
Conveniently, as soon as Joe steps out, Tony&nbsp;
is there already, resting on the hood of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.240
car like a calendar girl. With that task&nbsp;
completed, he takes Tony to the cottage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:33.040
Hopefully they drive slow, because mommy&nbsp;
is busy reconciling. Unfortunately, Sam has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.200
turned into a monster and he apologizes&nbsp;
for his gruesome appearance profusely,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:43.120
before he skeets. Rachel now ponders her life&nbsp;
choices as Sam lurks around in the shadows. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.600
the boys arrive and Joe tells Tony to cool out&nbsp;
in the car while he goes in to see what’s what.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.120
Rachel meets him in the entryway to make&nbsp;
a quick getaway, but Tony’s already found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.680
his way into the forest where he is lovingly&nbsp;
caressed by his rapidly deteriorating father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.400
Joe chases them down for a man-to-man&nbsp;
confrontation, but Sam is no man and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.600
he shrieks a high-pitched noise into Joe’s face&nbsp;
that causes his brains to leak out of his ears.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.240
As Sam’s facade melts away, Rachel tries&nbsp;
to get to where they are. She eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.880
emerges into a grassy clearing engulfed in&nbsp;
light and shapes where she is confronted by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.760
daddy Sam’s final form. Rachel screams for&nbsp;
Tony, but is rightly reluctant to go to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.520
and then they disapparate anyway and&nbsp;
shoot off into the vibrating cosmos.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.040
Rachel returns to the surreal&nbsp;
mindscape that is now her home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.760
Looking to make the best of a&nbsp;
bad situation, she greets her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.400
consolation babies and welcomes them into&nbsp;
her heart. But, she is immediately betrayed.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.600
Xtro is a film that transcends its B-movie&nbsp;
pedigree. Yea, it’s silly and has some nonsensical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.560
moments. I’m not sure why Tony was killing&nbsp;
people and his powers were somewhat ill-defined.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.560
It wasn’t really clear what the process&nbsp;
was here for whatever they were doing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.720
or why it had to be done in order to arrive&nbsp;
at the conclusion the film presents us.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.440
Also I’m still not sure what Annalise’s job&nbsp;
was. But despite all these minor quibbles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.960
this movie goes hard and it absolutely rips.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.120
In some ways it benefits from the lack of&nbsp;
explanation, because the premise is based on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.120
interactions with aliens whose intentions&nbsp;
and capabilities are completely unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.040
In that regard, anything goes. This opens&nbsp;
up the storytelling a bit by allowing for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.520
a wide range of possibilities. This&nbsp;
can obviously go wrong in some cases,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.920
but I think they pulled it off in Xtro with&nbsp;
its highly stylized and surreal visuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.720
I’m not sure what the stick snapping into&nbsp;
lightning and turning the sky black had to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.320
do with an alien arrival, but it was pretty&nbsp;
sweet. It would also be pretty standard to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.000
design some sort of flying machine that they&nbsp;
matted out and placed over the background,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.960
but bypassing that completely and making it just&nbsp;
a glowing shape was inspired. It also added an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.200
unnerving element in that we never actually saw&nbsp;
the alien beings. We only ever saw the after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.680
effects of their presence through the various&nbsp;
forms that Sam or Tony’s hatchlings took on.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.480
All of this made for a very unsettling overall&nbsp;
experience that, I think, elevated this film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.120
beyond the typical expectations for movies&nbsp;
enjoyed solely due to the charm of their failings.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.840
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;
my donors, memorialized in the hall of headshots.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.600
