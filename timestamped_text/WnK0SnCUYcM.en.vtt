00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.510
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.740
Today, I'm going to explain a comedy, horror,
and mystery film called "Vivarium."

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.379
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.180
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.270
Gemma works as a kindergarten teacher at a
small school.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.490
After her classes, she joins her boyfriend,
Tom, who works as the school groundskeeper.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.050
The couple is currently looking for a new
home, planning to start a family.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.590
So they head to a small office for Yonder,
a new real estate company.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.390
The couple enters, and a man welcomes them,
introducing himself as Martin.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.070
Martin begins by telling them about a subdivision,
Yonder, and how it'd be perfect for young

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.910
couples looking for a new home.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.780
Tom and Gemma notice Martin is a little eccentric,
talking and behaving strangely, but they continue

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.840
to listen to him.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.370
Martin invites them to Yonder, but they are
hesitant.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.930
Gemma says they're not looking for a suburban
home, but Martin insists that the low prices

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.600
attract more people, telling Tom and Gemma
that the houses could run out soon.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.829
Finally, Gemma decides a quick look wouldn't
hurt, and they agree to follow Martin.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.110
They drive for a while before arriving at
Yonder.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.239
Yonder is filled with rows upon rows of houses,
all indistinguishable from each other.

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.140
They stop at house 9, and Martin shows them
inside.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.369
They go through the rooms, and Martin offers
drinks and a snack, but the couple rejects.

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.420
They head upstairs, arriving at a nursery,
and Martin asks if they have children.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.710
Gemma answers no, and Martin mimics what she
said, even sounding and acting like her.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.400
They head to the backyard, but Martin disappears.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.310
Gemma and Tom step out and see Martin’s
car is gone.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.040
They take it as a sign to leave, and they
start driving out.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.220
They try to navigate through the endless houses
but find that they keep returning to house

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.220
9.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.730
They try their cellphones and see they have
no reception.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.780
They keep driving for several more hours but
somehow always end up at house 9.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.710
Night comes, and their car runs out of gas.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.020
They coincidentally end up at house 9.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.650
Hungry and cold, they decide to head into
the house.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.490
They eat the food Martin had offered them
earlier and discover the food has no taste.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.240
The following day, Tom decides to climb the
roof, hoping to see which direction they should

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.240
head in.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.410
He's dismayed to see the houses in Yonder
stretch out into the horizon.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.799
Tom suggests they follow the setting sun and
maintain that direction until they reach the

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:58.799
edge.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.259
They start walking, jumping over hedges, and
climbing fences, making sure they keep their

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.320
bearing.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.790
After several hours, the two are exhausted
and find a house with lights on.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.399
They enter and see they're once again back
at house 9.

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.709
Gemma finds a box full of food and supplies
in front of the house, and she starts calling

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.099
out to whoever delivered it.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.489
Tom dumps the box's contents and uses it to
set fire to the house.

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.779
Tom hopes the fire and smoke would alert nearby
authorities, thinking the fire department

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:21.819
would come.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.860
They sleep at the curb and wake up the following
day to another box.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.519
Gemma opens it and finds an infant boy.

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.090
House 9 remains standing, unaffected by the
fire.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.209
Time passes, and the infant appears to have
aged ten years.

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.510
Tom and Gemma wake up to the child waiting
for them.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.290
The kid then starts talking, seemingly mimicking
things Tom and Gemma had said.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.349
The child then demands Gemma to measure his
height.

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.989
It’s revealed that the kid is only three
months old.

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.540
He then starts screaming, and Tom and Gemma
rush to give him breakfast.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.239
The couple joins him, and they eat in silence.

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.239
Tom places their leftover food along with
all the trash in a box and brings it outside.

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.250
Tom and Gemma then sit on the lawn, waiting
for whoever picks up their trash to show up.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.769
Gemma says their wait is futile as the garbage
never gets collected if they watch.

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.019
Gemma observes that the boy always watches
them, and Tom corrects her, saying the creature

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.319
is not human.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.969
Tom then lights a cigarette, smokes it, and
drops it on the grass, but the grass opens

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.559
up, revealing the dirt.

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:14.370
Tom strikes the ground with a pickaxe and
peels layers off.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.290
He gets more equipment, and he and Gemma start
digging.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.089
Gemma checks the box full of trash and sees
it has vanished.

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:23.049
She asks the boy if he took the box, but he
remains quiet.

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.010
She tries to tell Tom, but Tom ignores her,
asking Gemma to leave him alone and let him

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.010
dig.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.639
Later that night, the couple gets intimate
in bed, and the boy watches them in secret.

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.170
The following day, Tom continues digging and
has produced a sizable mound of dirt on the

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.170
yard.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.019
Gemma is stuck inside doing the laundry, and
the boy turns on the T.V., mesmerized, watching

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.849
a strange feed showing squiggly lines on the
screen.

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.719
Tom keeps digging into the night and joins
Gemma inside his car.

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.419
Tom says he likes staying in the car as it
has an odor.

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:52.159
Unlike everything else in Yonder, the car
is the only thing that feels real to him.

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.609
Gemma agrees, saying she likes staying in
the car to breathe it in.

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.339
Tom accidentally hits the car radio, and it
turns on.

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.829
The two are shocked to discover it is still
working.

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.549
They step out and start dancing, appearing
happy for the first time in a while.

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.459
The boy watches them and eventually joins
in, dancing.

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.049
He gets in the middle and trips Tom.

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.769
Tom falls and hits his head on the curb.

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.069
Angered, he picks up the boy and slams him
onto the asphalt.

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.539
Gemma checks to see if the boy is alright,
and he appears unharmed, smiling.

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.540
Gemma is concerned about the boy, but the
boy gets back up and continues dancing.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.139
Later, Gemma is tucking the boy into bed.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.810
She tells him that he has to understand that
she and Tom can't be with him at all times,

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.289
trying to explain to the boy why they prefer
being away from him.

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.330
The boy nods and says goodnight, calling Gemma
his mother.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.500
Gemma corrects him, saying she's not his mother.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.259
The boy then starts screaming, and Gemma orders
the kid to stop, saying they've done everything

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:40.419
he wanted.

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.350
Gemma asks what he wants, and the boy begs
her to be his mother.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.569
Gemma is disgusted, shouting at the boy and
leaving him.

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.190
She then heads to bed and initiates intimacy
with Tom, but Tom doesn't respond.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.740
Instead, he apologizes, saying he's not in
the mood.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.060
The following day, the boy walks in and wakes
Tom and Gemma up with screaming.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.139
They then head to breakfast, and Gemma asks
Tom what he'll be doing for the day.

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.690
She asks if he'll continue digging and Tom
nods.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.669
Gemma tries asking more questions, but Tom
doesn't appear to be in a conversing mood.

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.900
Tom continues digging in the hole until he
hears a strange sound coming from deeper underground.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.070
Later at night, Tom is awakened, hearing the
strange sound again.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.750
He rushes to the living room and finds the
peculiar sound coming from the T.V. that the

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.750
boy is watching.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.430
Tom turns the T.V. off, but the boy turns
it back on.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.150
Gemma then turns it off, reprimanding the
boy, but the boy continues watching.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.490
Finally, they give up and leave him.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.620
The following day, the boy is screaming again,
waiting to be served breakfast.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.719
Tom finally snaps and picks the boy up.

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.340
He locks the boy in his car, intending to
starve him.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.020
Gemma protests, but Tom holds her back.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.660
Tom drags Gemma inside, pinning her to the
floor.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.250
He tries to talk sense into her, telling her
the boy controls her, making her act as the

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.460
boy's mother.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.470
Finally, Tom lets Gemma go and tells her he
will no longer allow her to help the boy.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.699
He argues that whoever gave them the boy would
have to intervene to stop the boy from starving

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:55.699
to death.

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:58.849
Gemma then asks if they’re going to stand
by and watch the boy die, and Tom corrects

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:02.669
her, telling her the child is not a boy, nor
is it human, asking her to stop referring

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:03.949
to it as such.

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.550
Gemma then takes the car keys and retrieves
the boy.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.680
She apologizes to the child, saying Tom wouldn’t
hurt him.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.919
Tom looks on, menacingly, at the boy and Gemma.

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.520
Tom continues digging at night, coughing and
heaving.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.120
He tries to communicate with the voices he
hears from underground, shouting, asking if

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.900
the voices can hear him.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.520
Inside the house, Gemma chats with the boy,
explaining to him what dreams are.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.280
She then sleeps next to him.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.169
Tom wakes up the following morning after sleeping
in the hole.

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:30.720
He enters the house coughing.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.039
He runs into Gemma and the boy, who are on
their way out but say nothing.

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:36.539
Tom then eats breakfast in silence.

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.099
Gemma and the boy are lying in a field, having
a picnic.

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:42.840
Gemma points to a cloud and asks what the
boy thinks the cloud is in the shape of.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.000
He answers that it’s in the form of a cloud.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.599
She points to another one, and the boy tells
her the same.

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:51.370
Gemma tells the boy that the clouds outside
of Yonder come in different shapes and sizes.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.510
All clouds in Yonder are shaped perfectly
to look like clouds.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.349
Gemma lays in bed at night, sobbing, while
Tom remains outside in the cold, sleeping

00:06:58.349 --> 00:06:59.650
in his hole.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.900
The following day, Gemma notices that the
boy had gone missing.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.910
So she starts looking for him, walking through
the neighborhoods.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.710
She arrives back at the house by late afternoon
and sees the boy standing by the hole.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.621
She runs to him and asks him where he’s
been all day, but the boy doesn’t answer

00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:14.849
and instead hands Gemma a book.

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:18.069
Gemma looks through the book and finds it
full of strange and alien symbols.

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:21.270
The book appears to be an informative research
book that seems to have been written by someone

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.050
or something studying humans.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.580
It has illustrations and diagrams about humans
and how humanity lives and reproduces.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.919
Tom refuses to sleep in the house and decides
to keep sleeping in the hole.

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:32.819
Unfortunately, this has led to him developing
a coughing fit.

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:34.370
So he remains outside in the cold even though
he's visibly in a lot of discomforts.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.680
Gemma talks to the boy and asks him where
he’s been.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.060
The boy says he’s met someone but is not
allowed to say who or what it was.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.449
Gemma then invites the boy to play pretend.

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:46.120
She asks him to act as Tom, and the boy complies,
mimicking Tom’s voice and saying things

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.840
Tom has said in the past.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.210
Gemma then asks the boy to pretend to be her,
and the boy does the same thing.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.539
Finally, she asks the boy to act like the
person he met when he disappeared, and the

00:07:54.539 --> 00:07:55.960
boy starts growling.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.800
Two lumps appear on the boy’s throat, and
he produces an ungodly screeching sound.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.689
Gemma reels back, terrified of the creature
talking to her.

00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:06.330
She starts crying, saying she wants to go
home, and the boy smiles, telling her she’s

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.840
already home.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.740
More time passes, and the child has grown
into a man.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.270
Gemma serves him dinner, and the man asks
why Gemma is still polite to him.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:17.389
He asks if she's afraid of him, and Gemma
says she's unsure.

00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:20.919
She then takes food to Tom, who's staying
in their bedroom, barring the door.

00:08:20.919 --> 00:08:24.559
They eat in the bedroom, and Gemma tells Tom
she regrets not allowing Tom to kill the man

00:08:24.559 --> 00:08:25.559
when he was young.

00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:28.830
After their meal, Gemma takes Tom to the bathroom
and cleans him.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.800
Tom's body is marked with bruises, and he
is noticeably having trouble walking.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.589
Later that afternoon, Gemma prepares to head
out, planning on following the man.

00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:40.050
The man walks through Yonder, and Gemma tries
her best to follow him, but it seems that

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:43.490
the man disappears and reappears all over
the neighborhoods, so Gemma cannot keep up

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.670
with him.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.029
That night, a weak Tom continues digging.

00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:49.670
He finally strikes something and digs it out
excitedly.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.500
He succeeds and discovers that it’s a bag
with a body inside.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.010
He rushes to climb out of the hole, terrified.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.360
Meanwhile, Gemma is having trouble finding
her way back.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.760
Tom calls out to her, and she calls back.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.330
She runs, following the sound of Tom’s voice.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:06.350
Tom collapses to the sidewalk, unable to shout,
and Gemma finally arrives, discovering Tom

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.940
suffering on the ground.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.769
She carries Tom back to the house, but the
door is locked.

00:09:10.769 --> 00:09:14.430
She tries knocking, demanding the man to let
them in, but the man ignores her.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.130
She brings Tom to the car, and they sleep
inside it.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.120
The man leaves the house the following day,
and Gemma asks for his help as Tom gets sicker.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.310
The man smiles and tells her he thinks the
time has come to release Tom.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.110
He leaves them, and Gemma cradles Tom in her
arms on the sidewalk.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:30.940
They reminisce, talking about the night they
first met and how Tom ended up waking up in

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.950
Gemma's apartment the morning after.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.529
Tom says he felt like he was at home in Gemma's
apartment when he laid eyes on her.

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:39.019
Tom then closes his eyes and stops breathing.

00:09:39.019 --> 00:09:43.090
The man returns carrying a box, and Gemma
opens it to find a body bag for Tom.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.620
She starts crying and sobbing, and the man
mimics her.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.670
The man then places Tom in the body bag and
throws him down the hole Tom had dug.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.880
Gemma awakens the following morning, waiting
for the man to leave the house.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.970
As the man leaves, Gemma walks up behind him
with a pickaxe.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.680
She tries to strike the man, but the man manages
to dodge, snarling at her.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.970
The man starts crawling towards the sidewalk,
grabbing it and lifting it.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.710
He crawls underneath the sidewalk, but Gemma
manages to follow him inside.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.970
Gemma drops in and finds herself in a strange
red-tinted living room.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:13.380
She finds a young boy watching television
but sees that it's a different boy.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.670
She goes to the kitchen and finds a woman
sobbing.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:19.260
The floor opens up, swallowing Gemma, and
she drops into a bedroom where a couple is

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.260
having intercourse.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.620
A man is with them, applauding.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.880
Gemma again sinks into the floor and finds
herself in a bathroom, where she discovers

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.480
a dead man in the tub.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.840
She slips into the floor again and finds herself
back at house 9.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.050
She falls to the ground, defeated.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.120
She then asks the man what Yonder is and why
this is happening to them.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.589
The man doesn’t answer but tells Gemma she
is a mother, and her only purpose now is to

00:10:39.589 --> 00:10:40.589
die.

00:10:40.589 --> 00:10:44.420
The man places her in a body bag, and Gemma
says all she and Tom ever wanted was a home.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.320
The man laughs once again, telling her she’s
already home.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.921
As the man zips up the bag, Gemma lets out
one final remark, telling the man that she

00:10:50.921 --> 00:10:52.430
is not his mother.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.149
The man then drags Gemma down the stairs before
throwing her into the hole with Tom.

00:10:56.149 --> 00:10:59.440
He covers up the hole, gets Tom’s car, and
drives out of Yonder.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.149
He arrives back in town to Yonder’s small
office and finds Martin waiting for him.

00:11:03.149 --> 00:11:05.930
Martin has aged dramatically, barely able
to move.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:09.350
Martin hands the man his nametag, and the
man gets a body bag from a drawer and places

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.350
Martin inside.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.940
The man then folds up the body bag with Martin
inside, and it crunches up, fitting into a

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.940
drawer.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:25.240
The man then sits at the desk, waiting for
another hopeful couple, eager to take them

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.960
to Yonder.
