00:00:06.584 --> 00:00:07.800
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.184 --> 00:00:10.936
today I'll show you a period psychological thriller film

00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:13.112
"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer" 

00:00:13.432 --> 00:00:15.736
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:16.696 --> 00:00:18.232
in the eighteenth-century Paris

00:00:18.296 --> 00:00:21.240
well-developed maritime navigation boosts global trade

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:23.416
and industries and commerce thrive

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:28.664
in a wet market of a squalid slum near Paris, a fish vendor gives birth to Jean

00:00:29.048 --> 00:00:31.352
he is not her first infant born at work

00:00:31.544 --> 00:00:34.744
Jean is motionless at birth, with no even a breath

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.880
thinking he must be another infant born dead

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:40.888
the fish vendor discards him and continues her work

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:45.688
but Jean makes a loud cry when he smells the stink smell of the wet market

00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:49.848
since this moment on, his life is tightly connected to smells

00:00:50.424 --> 00:00:54.264
accused of abandonment of her infant, the fish vendor is later hanged

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:57.848
raised in an orphanage, Jean has a tough life

00:00:58.168 --> 00:01:00.984
but he is particularly obsessive about the scents

00:01:01.112 --> 00:01:04.056
caring not much what a freak he seems to other orphans

00:01:04.824 --> 00:01:07.320
logs, fruits leaves, and even water

00:01:07.448 --> 00:01:10.968
everything in the nature has its scent, which fascinates him

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.832
at the age of thirteen, Jean is sold to a tanner for 7 francs 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.392
as the orphanage owner regards him as a burden 

00:01:18.648 --> 00:01:20.888
but she then is killed by the robbers 

00:01:21.656 --> 00:01:23.832
life is not any better in the tanner's

00:01:24.024 --> 00:01:27.160
Jean keeps toiling for over ten hours every day

00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:29.656
reveling in all kinds of odors

00:01:29.784 --> 00:01:34.072
Jean dreams of crossing the river one day to explore the world of aroma

00:01:34.712 --> 00:01:39.384
his first travel to Paris delivering leather with the tanner changes his whole life

00:01:40.088 --> 00:01:44.568
the hustle and bustle town has all kinds of scents of soldiers, vendors and horses

00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:48.920
but the most delighting ones to Jean are the scents of upper-class ladies

00:01:49.624 --> 00:01:54.488
someday, Jean's captured by one distinctively enchanting scent mixed with hormones

00:01:55.128 --> 00:01:57.944
his supernatural sense of smell leads him to the origin

00:01:58.072 --> 00:02:02.744
a young lady with chestnut hair, who has a pair of clear eyes on her innocent face

00:02:03.384 --> 00:02:06.840
deeply obsessive about her scent, which is too magic for words

00:02:06.968 --> 00:02:09.848
he follows her and takes in her scent greedily

00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:14.456
later he puts his face into her hand and licks her ball-shaped palm

00:02:14.584 --> 00:02:16.568
which startles the girl away

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.816
Jean follows her smelly hormones, chases after her, and catches her in the alley

00:02:22.456 --> 00:02:24.504
he shuts her mouth to avoid being heard

00:02:24.632 --> 00:02:26.552
but suffocates her by accident

00:02:27.128 --> 00:02:30.904
to his surprise, her amazing scent fades as her breath weakens

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.360
he then strips her body naked to better smell her

00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:36.600
but the scent soon disappears

00:02:37.048 --> 00:02:39.992
Jean then makes up his mind to learn how to preserve scents

00:02:40.632 --> 00:02:43.512
Baldini is an Italian perfume maker in Paris 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.376
who succeeded in making a couple of amazing perfume formulas when he was young

00:02:48.632 --> 00:02:51.640
but his creativity dries up as he grows old

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.456
when Jean delivers leather to Baldini

00:02:54.648 --> 00:02:57.848
in the basement, he reproduces the scent of "love and soul"

00:02:57.912 --> 00:03:00.920
the former fashionable perfume with some improvement 

00:03:01.368 --> 00:03:04.056
shocked by his incredible talent for discerning scents

00:03:04.248 --> 00:03:07.256
Baldini buys Jean from the tanner for 50 francs

00:03:07.512 --> 00:03:12.248
after the deal, the tanner is surprisingly hit by a fast-moving carriage on the bridge

00:03:12.376 --> 00:03:15.768
causing him to fall down to the river and be drowned 

00:03:16.344 --> 00:03:20.184
those who abandoned Jean are seemingly doomed to die of accident

00:03:20.952 --> 00:03:23.832
Jean starts to work at Baldini's perfume workshop

00:03:24.152 --> 00:03:27.736
he revitalizes the perfumer's business with amazing new formulas

00:03:27.864 --> 00:03:30.296
and he also learns more knowledge on perfume

00:03:30.808 --> 00:03:33.688
one night in his dream, Jean sees the girl again

00:03:33.816 --> 00:03:36.632
whose body and hormone odor he revels in 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.552
when waking up the next morning 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.520
he asks Baldini to teach him how to convert scents into perfume

00:03:42.776 --> 00:03:46.168
and promises he will create the best formulas for him in return 

00:03:46.296 --> 00:03:48.280
Baldini agrees gladly

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.928
the next day baskets of roses are shipped to them

00:03:52.376 --> 00:03:55.704
Baldini begins to teach Jean the skill of preserving scents

00:03:56.152 --> 00:04:00.888
they dump the roses into a distiller and captures the scent through steam distillation

00:04:01.592 --> 00:04:05.240
Baldini also proudly talks about Grasse, the town of scents

00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:07.992
reputed for world's finest perfumers

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.832
the refining of rose essential oil continues late into the night

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.976
the next morning Jean finds some iron chains, glass pieces, copper blocks, and even a cat

00:04:18.168 --> 00:04:21.432
he distills them one by one till late into the night

00:04:21.752 --> 00:04:24.376
but he gets no any refined oil

00:04:24.824 --> 00:04:26.616
hearing Jean's desperate wail

00:04:26.744 --> 00:04:30.456
Baldini rises from the bed to see what is going on in the basement

00:04:31.288 --> 00:04:35.384
he angrily tells Jean that no any living being's odor such as theirs

00:04:35.512 --> 00:04:37.688
can be refined through instillation

00:04:38.136 --> 00:04:41.336
the reality is so cruel that Jean faints to the ground

00:04:41.464 --> 00:04:45.112
as it is the meaning of life for him to capture wonderful scents

00:04:45.496 --> 00:04:48.952
had he known how to preserve the body odor of the girl with chestnut hair

00:04:49.144 --> 00:04:51.576
it would not have vanished along with her death

00:04:52.216 --> 00:04:57.336
lying in bed seriously ill, Jean asks Baldini how to preserve human's odor

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.944
Baldini answers he can learn the mysterious enfleurage process in Grasse

00:05:02.328 --> 00:05:06.616
his words bring hope back to Jean, and he recovers in just a week

00:05:07.256 --> 00:05:08.728
before Jean leaves for Grasse

00:05:08.856 --> 00:05:13.400
Baldini demands Jean provide him the recipes of 100 finest formulas

00:05:13.976 --> 00:05:16.728
this day is the happiest day ever for Baldini 

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:22.360
he lies in bed happily holding the notebook written with recipes of 100 finest formulas

00:05:22.808 --> 00:05:25.752
however, he never wakes up again

00:05:26.328 --> 00:05:28.248
it is a long journey to Grasse

00:05:28.376 --> 00:05:33.240
excited by every kind of scent from the endless wildness, Jean can't rest his mind

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.056
exhausted, he enters a dark cave to sleep

00:05:36.568 --> 00:05:38.680
when he wakes up inside the dark cave

00:05:38.808 --> 00:05:43.480
Jean smells himself and is surprised to realize that he has no any body odor

00:05:43.864 --> 00:05:46.808
he is puzzled, since even a worm has its own scent

00:05:47.192 --> 00:05:52.120
body odor is the soul of life, yet he has no soul and is still alive

00:05:52.632 --> 00:05:55.448
this fact posts a huge challenge to his knowledge

00:05:55.896 --> 00:05:59.672
without odor, there will be no any trace of his being in the world

00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:01.720
he ponders over and over

00:06:01.848 --> 00:06:06.328
and decides that creating the best ever perfume will prove not just his existence

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.312
but the existence of great worth

00:06:08.888 --> 00:06:10.552
so he strides toward Grasse

00:06:11.064 --> 00:06:14.904
upon arrival, Jean catches another magic hormone scent of a girl

00:06:15.032 --> 00:06:17.144
as fascinating as that of the Paris girl 

00:06:17.528 --> 00:06:20.536
it comes from a girl who also has chestnut hair

00:06:20.856 --> 00:06:23.992
Richis, daughter of the famous and wealthy businessman

00:06:24.056 --> 00:06:26.104
lives a graceful and delicate life

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.240
her beautiful and pure body has a charming odor

00:06:29.752 --> 00:06:33.976
Grasse is the town of scents with flowers growing in every piece of field 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.152
lavenders are picked up in the field 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.864
and sent to the perfumer's to extract essential oil by enfleurage

00:06:40.184 --> 00:06:42.040
when Jean has learned this new skill 

00:06:42.232 --> 00:06:45.368
he starts his plan of making the world's best-ever perfume

00:06:46.136 --> 00:06:50.104
one night he hunts his first game, a girl who meets her hormone partner

00:06:50.552 --> 00:06:55.032
Jean strips her off and puts her into the oil vat directly without hormone-let-go

00:06:55.608 --> 00:06:57.784
but he fails in extracting her odor

00:06:57.976 --> 00:06:59.960
his next prey is a prostitute

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.688
Jean kills her brutally

00:07:01.816 --> 00:07:05.016
he cuts off her hair, soaks her body in coconut oil 

00:07:05.144 --> 00:07:07.640
and then refines the odor by distillation

00:07:08.216 --> 00:07:11.032
this time he succeeds in preserving the body odor 

00:07:11.672 --> 00:07:15.896
the town of Grasse is covered in panic as one girl after another are missing 

00:07:16.472 --> 00:07:21.912
Jean's ambition is to make 12 bottles of individual scents by refining body odors of girls

00:07:22.104 --> 00:07:25.816
so that he can make the best ever perfume as Baldini told him

00:07:26.456 --> 00:07:29.464
at Richis's birthday party in her father's luxury manor 

00:07:29.592 --> 00:07:33.688
Richis comes to the lawn to play hide-and-seek with the twin sisters

00:07:34.328 --> 00:07:37.912
Jean catches the twin sisters away but leaves Richis alone 

00:07:38.104 --> 00:07:41.368
as he decides that she will be the last "thirteenth scent"

00:07:41.624 --> 00:07:46.168
this time he improves the process by soaking the twin girls with coconut oil

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.328
wrapping them with cloth and then refining by distillation

00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:55.192
the essential oil extracted by the improved process has a stronger scent 

00:07:55.768 --> 00:08:00.696
the scents begin to show the irresistible magic of changing people's mind and mood

00:08:01.208 --> 00:08:05.048
the raged foreman who attempts to beat Jean, becomes kind

00:08:05.112 --> 00:08:07.224
once smelling the drop of a scent

00:08:07.544 --> 00:08:11.128
to fill up the twelve bottles, Jean needs more body odors

00:08:11.576 --> 00:08:15.544
so he continues his cruel slaughter of beautiful girls to capture their scents

00:08:15.672 --> 00:08:18.040
turning Brasse into a town of horror

00:08:18.616 --> 00:08:22.200
although curfews are enforced, and security measures are strengthened 

00:08:22.328 --> 00:08:23.992
more girls are killed

00:08:24.696 --> 00:08:28.792
at last, Jean has filled the twelve bottles with twelve individual scents

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.416
but he has one more empty bottle to fill up 

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.768
and his last game is unluckily the hormone-smelly Richis

00:08:36.344 --> 00:08:38.328
people are attending a sermon in the church

00:08:38.456 --> 00:08:42.488
when a safeguard rushes in and declares that the murderer is caught

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:46.136
released from panic, people come out to the streets and cheer

00:08:46.264 --> 00:08:49.592
unaware that the man is just a scapegoat for law enforcement

00:08:49.976 --> 00:08:51.576
vigilant and unconvinced

00:08:51.704 --> 00:08:55.288
Richis's father decides to leave Grasse with his daughter by ship

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.960
the night before departure, he takes Richis to sleep in a roadside inn

00:09:00.216 --> 00:09:03.160
Jean tracks her scent and sneaks into her room

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.616
He cuts off her hair and extracts her body scent

00:09:06.936 --> 00:09:09.112
with the thirteenth bottle of scent filled

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.800
Jean realizes his ultimate ambition

00:09:12.312 --> 00:09:16.088
he succeeds in making the magic best ever perfume in the world

00:09:16.984 --> 00:09:22.296
however, the prostitute's dog traces her smell to the place where her body was buried

00:09:22.744 --> 00:09:25.688
and more corpses of the missing girls are dug out

00:09:26.392 --> 00:09:28.440
Jean's evil slaughter is exposed

00:09:28.952 --> 00:09:32.472
he is captured and tortured, and the death penalty is announced

00:09:33.304 --> 00:09:38.104
on the day of his execution, the execution ground is packed with a furious crowd 

00:09:39.064 --> 00:09:41.688
with shackles on the hands and legs in the custody

00:09:41.752 --> 00:09:44.376
Jean holds tight his bottle of magic perfume

00:09:45.144 --> 00:09:47.064
the moment he removes the bottle lid

00:09:47.192 --> 00:09:50.136
his whole body smells an enchanting, exotic scent

00:09:50.392 --> 00:09:53.272
which dispels the rage of the escorting guards

00:09:53.784 --> 00:09:55.832
Jean puts on the blue suit of the foreman's

00:09:55.896 --> 00:09:59.608
and steps into the blue luxury carriage offered by the escorting guards 

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.680
upon his arrival at the execution ground

00:10:02.808 --> 00:10:06.392
the furious crowd fall into the spell of his enchanting smell 

00:10:06.584 --> 00:10:09.080
they look at him with admiration and yearning

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:11.000
when Jean comes onto the guillotine

00:10:11.128 --> 00:10:13.112
the executioner takes off his mask

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.400
kneels down in front of him and shouts to the crowd that he is innocent

00:10:17.912 --> 00:10:22.840
Jean applies a drop of the perfume over his handkerchief and waves it toward the crowd

00:10:23.352 --> 00:10:25.656
when the enchanting scent permeates the air

00:10:25.784 --> 00:10:28.984
for a moment, the crowd are speechless with their mouths opened

00:10:29.496 --> 00:10:33.336
they stretch their arms toward Jean, calling him the hormone angel

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:38.584
even Richis's father, who is the most resentful, forgets his revenge

00:10:39.224 --> 00:10:42.424
the perfume endows Jean the essence of innocence and beauty

00:10:42.616 --> 00:10:46.904
and arouses people's desire for love, turning the execution into an orgy

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.896
another scapegoat, the foreman, is convicted for the murders and executed

00:10:52.408 --> 00:10:57.050
returning to Paris, Jean now has the most powerful tool in his hand, the perfume

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.650
which can control people's desire for love and hormones

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:04.386
and would definitely give him the power to go, to see, to conquer

00:11:04.514 --> 00:11:08.866
however, he chooses to come back to the wet fish market, his birthplace

00:11:09.314 --> 00:11:12.130
he pours the whole bottle of perfume down from his head

00:11:12.322 --> 00:11:15.138
and the nearby poor people, hungered for the lofty scent

00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:18.850
go on a rampage and swarm to devour him up, eventually

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.242
in such a way, he disappears from the world

00:11:22.434 --> 00:11:26.466
all that is left are his clothes and the empty perfume bottle

00:11:27.234 --> 00:11:29.858
