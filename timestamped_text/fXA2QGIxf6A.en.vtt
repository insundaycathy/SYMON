00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.280
Hey everyone. Welcome back&nbsp;
to movie recap. Today I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.628
gonna show you a 2019 American&nbsp;
superhero film called,

00:00:12.628 --> 00:00:13.664
Shazam

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:22.160
The film starts in 1974, Upstate New York. Young&nbsp;
Thaddeus Sivana is playing with a Magic 8 Ball&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.760
while riding with his father and older brother,&nbsp;
Sid. The two mock Thad for complaining when Sid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.440
takes his toy away. After Thad gets it back,&nbsp;
strange symbols start to appear on the ball.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.040
Sid and Mr. Sivana are gone, and Thad suddenly&nbsp;
finds himself in the Rock of Eternity. He is met&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.160
by a being known as The Wizard, who had summoned&nbsp;
Thad there. The Wizard tells Thad of an old group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.120
of wizards he belonged to that found a champion&nbsp;
to inherit great powers, but he must first pass a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.640
test. Next to Thad on the wall are large monstrous&nbsp;
statues that contain the Seven Deadly Sins,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.080
evil creatures that wish to wreak havoc upon&nbsp;
mankind. They speak to Thad and tempt him to grab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.000
an orb called The Eye so that Thad may possess an&nbsp;
even greater power. The Wizard then stops Thad and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.360
declares him unworthy of receiving these powers&nbsp;
before sending him back to the car. Thad starts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.960
yell about what he saw, and in the confusion, Mr.&nbsp;
Sivana swerves and nearly collides with a truck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.480
As he berates his son, another car plows into&nbsp;
the Sivanas, causing Mr. Sivana to be ejected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.200
from the car. He survives but is crippled,&nbsp;
and Sid blames Thad for what happened.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.680
In present day, Philadelphia, 15-year-old Billy&nbsp;
Batson, tricks a pair of police officers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.560
respond to a shop robbery, only to lock them in&nbsp;
the store so he can get in their car and look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.360
up information on a woman named Rachel Batson,&nbsp;
whom he believes to be his long lost mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.320
Billy arrives at the address with a small compass,&nbsp;
which leads to a flashback to his childhood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.280
when he last saw his mother. They were at a&nbsp;
carnival and Billy got separated from his mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.360
but she never went to claim him when the police&nbsp;
found him. Billy walks up to the door and is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.480
greeted by a woman who is clearly not his mother.&nbsp;
The police then show up and take Billy with them.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.120
Billy meets with a social worker, Ms. Glover,&nbsp;
who brings up his history of getting into trouble&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.360
and running away from multiple foster&nbsp;
homes, none of which would take him back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.000
She is sympathetic to his quest to find his&nbsp;
mother, but reminds him that he only has one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.240
more chance before he ends up somewhere worse. Ms.&nbsp;
Glover sets Billy up with Victor and Rosa Vasquez,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.600
a couple who already care for five other foster&nbsp;
kids. They bring Billy home and introduce him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.280
the kids, Eugene Choi a video game nerd, Darla&nbsp;
Dudley a sweet little girl who immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.040
embraces Billy as her new brother, Pedro Pena&nbsp;
a quiet kid that doesn't really talk to anyone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.960
Mary Bromfield an aspiring college&nbsp;
student and Freddy Freeman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.040
a superhero nerd who uses a cane to walk. He chats&nbsp;
with Billy and shows him some memorabilia he owns,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.751
such as an authentified bullet that hit&nbsp;
Superman, as well as a Batmans Batarang.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.680
Billy joins the other kids for school that day.&nbsp;
As he heads to class, Darla hugs him, but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.880
tells her that they are not actually brother and&nbsp;
sister, which makes her sad, and he regrets it.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.720
Grown up Dr. Thaddeus Sivana sits in&nbsp;
on an interview with his scientist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.840
Dr. Lynn Crosby and another woman who claims to&nbsp;
have also been taken to the Rock of Eternity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.240
Dozens of other individuals have sent videos&nbsp;
detailing their account of meeting The Wizard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.680
and what they saw. Sivana has been trying for&nbsp;
years to find a way back to the Rock of Eternity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.000
but only recently has he discovered&nbsp;
a pattern. He shows Crosby that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.960
same symbols appear and always repeat in the&nbsp;
same order. After he draws them on a door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.160
Crosby dismisses it and taps the door, which&nbsp;
opens a portal and causes Crosby to disintegrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.400
Sivana enters through the door and finds&nbsp;
himself back in the Rock of Eternity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.320
He faces The Wizard and expresses&nbsp;
disdain for his rejection as a child,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.600
and has come seeking a different power. He goes&nbsp;
for The Eye and takes it, which then lodges itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.040
in Sivana's right eye. This releases the Seven&nbsp;
Deadly Sins, who claim Sivana as their champion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.112
and take shelter in The Eye. Sivana overpowers&nbsp;
The Wizard and leaves to go get his revenge.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.080
After school, Freddy is knocked over by a&nbsp;
truck driven by the bullying Bryer brothers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.440
Burke and Brett. They continue to pick on Freddy&nbsp;
and kick him around, which Billy walks away from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.560
until the bullies taunt Freddy over not having&nbsp;
parents. Billy grabs Freddy's cane and whacks the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.160
Bryers over the head before the other foster kids&nbsp;
come to intervene. Billy runs away and is chased&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.360
by the Bryers until he gets away in a subway.&nbsp;
Suddenly, everyone in the subway vanishes and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.040
the strange symbols appear again. Billy is now in&nbsp;
the Rock of Eternity, and he too meets The Wizard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.400
He has run out of options and feels that Billy&nbsp;
is the only one worthy of receiving his powers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.280
He explains to Billy that he and the other wizards&nbsp;
passed their powers onto their champion, but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.720
used his powers for evil and created the Seven&nbsp;
Deadly Sins, who killed many innocent people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.400
If Sivana lets them loose again, they will most&nbsp;
likely destroy mankind. The Wizard commands Billy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.720
to hold onto his staff and say his name SHAZAM!&nbsp;
After Billy does so, he is struck by lightning and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.480
turned into an adult superhero named, Shazam. He&nbsp;
possesses the wisdom of Solomon, the strength of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.720
Hercules, the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus,&nbsp;
the courage of Achilles, and the speed of Mercury.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.120
The Wizard then turns to dust after telling&nbsp;
Billy that he needs to be the champion.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.240
The Vasquezes become worried&nbsp;
after Billy doesn t show up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.000
As Shazam, he sneaks around and gets Freddy&nbsp;
to come outside and prove who he is. Freddy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.580
is amazed and excited, and they go around&nbsp;
the city to test out the powers of Shazam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.080
They go by the park and see a mugging about to&nbsp;
occur. Shazam speeds over to the mugger, but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.480
already got taken down by the woman he tried&nbsp;
to rob because she had mace. They return home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.000
and fail to sneak past Victor and Rosa, so they&nbsp;
hide in Darla s room where she sees Shazam. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.663
saying his own name, he turns back into Billy.&nbsp;
The boys then tell Darla to keep this a secret.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.840
Sivana goes to his father's corporation&nbsp;
where he is in a meeting with board members,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.320
including Sid. After receiving yet another&nbsp;
cold dismissal from the two of them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.280
Sivana reveals his newfound powers by grabbing&nbsp;
Sid and throwing him out the window to his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.240
death. He then sets the Sins loose, and they&nbsp;
proceed to kill all the other board members,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.400
leaving Mr. Sivana for last. He pleads to his son&nbsp;
for mercy, but Sivana accuses him of being greedy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.760
and now being the one crying for help. Fittingly,&nbsp;
Sivana allows Greed to finish off his father.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.800
Billy turns into Shazam again and goes around&nbsp;
the city with Freddy to test out his powers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.560
He cannot seem to get the hang of flying, but he&nbsp;
is super strong, fast, and has lightning powers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:03.120
Freddy records everything, and Shazam becomes a&nbsp;
viral sensation. The two stop in a convenience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.320
store so Shazam can buy beer, which the boys&nbsp;
discover they don't like, but then a robbery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.680
starts to happen. Shazam goes to stop it and&nbsp;
gets shot, but the bullet bounces off of him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.720
meaning he is bulletproof. He then ties up&nbsp;
the robbers and throws them out of the store.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.760
He even later has fun with his powers at school&nbsp;
and uses his strength to wreck the Bryers truck.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.080
After being taunted by the Bryers again, Freddy&nbsp;
tells them and the other students that Shazam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.920
will show up during lunch. Billy instead goes off&nbsp;
to continue doing superhero stuff, leaving Freddy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:42.880
to be humiliated when he fails to show up. Freddy&nbsp;
later finds Shazam in the streets showing off his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.840
lightning powers, and Freddy confronts him for&nbsp;
being a lousy friend and for using his powers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:53.600
be a jerk. Shazam then accidentally zaps the tires&nbsp;
off a bus, which veers over the edge of a bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.480
Still not knowing how to fly, Shazam waits&nbsp;
for the bus to fall so he can catch it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.440
then set it down. He s still viewed as a hero&nbsp;
for saving them despite causing the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:13.040
Freddy then ditches Shazam, and not long after,&nbsp;
the hero is found by Sivana. He shows that his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.840
power can affect Shazam, and the villain tosses&nbsp;
him around the city before pulling him up to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:25.600
sky and dropping him. Before he hits the ground,&nbsp;
Shazam discovers that he can indeed fly. Sivana&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.960
takes their fight into a mall, but Shazam escapes&nbsp;
by saying his name and disappearing as Billy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.080
Freddy runs into the mall calling for Billy,&nbsp;
but Sivana sees and then notices a TV screen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.200
with an earlier news report featuring Freddy&nbsp;
talking to Shazam. Sivana then follows the boy.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.160
Out on the street, Billy sees a young woman&nbsp;
walking into the street about to get hit by a car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.960
He Shazams himself and swoops in to save&nbsp;
the woman, who turns out to be Mary. She is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.080
distressed as she just got a college acceptance&nbsp;
letter but is hesitant because she is not sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.520
that she wants to leave her home. Shazam tries to&nbsp;
reassure her but accidentally slips up and calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.040
her Mary and mentions her being from a foster&nbsp;
home. He leaves, and Mary starts to suspect.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.120
Billy returns home and gets chewed out by&nbsp;
Victor for running off and getting Freddy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.227
involved in his troubles. After being left alone,&nbsp;
the kids go into Billy's room. Pedro found Billy's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.227 --> 00:09:28.080
notebook detailing all the women he searched&nbsp;
that he thought would be his mother, but Eugene&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:33.200
managed to track Billy's parents and learn that&nbsp;
his father is in prison and his mother, Marilyn,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.880
is only two subway stops away. Billy heads off&nbsp;
to go find her. The kids then watch the news&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:44.240
report showing Freddy with Shazam. After piecing&nbsp;
it together, Mary and Eugene deduce that Billy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:50.320
is Shazam, which Darla confirms. Freddy then&nbsp;
returns home, but he is accompanied by Sivana.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.320
Billy arrives at Marilyn's apartment&nbsp;
to greet her. She doesn't recognize him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.480
and is stunned but not relieved to see&nbsp;
Billy when he tells her he is her son.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.040
Marilyn then confesses that she did look for&nbsp;
Billy when he got lost, but when she saw him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.320
with the cops, she thought that he was better off&nbsp;
with them since she was just 17 and got kicked out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.520
by her parents while Billy s father wasn't in&nbsp;
the picture. Realizing she never cared for him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:20.240
Billy gives her the compass toy that she won&nbsp;
him and he leaves brokenhearted. He then gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:25.440
a phone call from Freddy, but Sivana answers him,&nbsp;
and Billy realizes his siblings are in trouble.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:35.200
Shazam finds the foster kids being held captive by&nbsp;
Sivana and the Sins at a carnival. Sivana orders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:40.400
Shazam to give up his powers, or the Sins will&nbsp;
kill the kids starting with Darla. Shazam is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.760
ready to do so and goes for Sivana s staff, but&nbsp;
he then remembers the words of The Wizard and is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.520
inspired to achieve his heroic potential. He takes&nbsp;
the staff from Sivana and gets the other kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:57.360
to place their hands on it and yell, SHAZAM! The&nbsp;
kids then turn into adult superheroes themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.560
Realizing they need to separate the Sins&nbsp;
from Sivana s eye to rid him of his power,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.840
they get Sivana to attack them while they fight&nbsp;
the Sins as they cause chaos upon the carnival.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.960
The heroes save the patrons while Shazam fights&nbsp;
Sivana, who has Envy remaining in his eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.280
Shazam taunts Envy in order to get him to&nbsp;
come out, and the Sin angrily jumps out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.000
to attack Shazam, which causes the floating&nbsp;
Sivana to fall over the edge of a building,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.400
hanging on for dear life. Shazam&nbsp;
reverts to Billy to get Envy off of him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.280
but then goes back to his hero form to&nbsp;
catch Sivana before he falls to his death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.920
He brings the villain with him and gets the&nbsp;
others to join him in the Rock of Eternity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:41.840
There, Shazam pulls the Eye out of Sivana, which&nbsp;
causes the Sins to revert to their statue forms.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:48.720
After returning home, the siblings are praised&nbsp;
as mysterious superheroes. Billy later joins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.520
the family for dinner and even says grace,&nbsp;
now having accepted them as his new family.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.280
Back at school, Freddy sits alone at&nbsp;
lunch, now being shunned by his peers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.120
until Mary, Darla, Eugene, and Pedro join him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:08.480
Shazam then enters the cafeteria and amazes&nbsp;
all the other kids, even the Bryers. He sits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:14.352
next to Freddy and calls him his best friend, as&nbsp;
well as showing off his special guest, SUPERMAN.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.120
On Mid-Credits scene, Sivana is in&nbsp;
his prison cell drawing symbols all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.720
over the walls in a desperate attempt&nbsp;
to go back to the Rock of Eternity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.760
He then hears a voice in the shadows calling&nbsp;
to him. It is a small caterpillar creature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.120
He offers Sivana a chance to work&nbsp;
with him to get what he wants.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.040
On Post-Credits scene, Shazam and Freddy are&nbsp;
still trying to see what other powers Shazam has,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:42.720

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.560
but Shazam doesn't think he s that cool.
