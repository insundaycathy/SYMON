00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.000
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain a horror,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.440
sci-fi film, thriller film called “Life.”&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.800
A team of astronauts aboard the International&nbsp;
Space Station prepares to intercept the Pilgrim,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.600
a satellite capsule returning from Mars.&nbsp;
The Pilgrim carries soil samples from Mars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.880
and what the astronauts hope carries&nbsp;
confirmation of life from the red planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.360
Intercepting the Pilgrim and finding out&nbsp;
whether or not life is possible on Mars is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.640
the team’s primary objective. Unfortunately,&nbsp;
the Pilgrim is damaged and veers off course.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.200
Rory suits up and prepares for a spacewalk.&nbsp;
He would be outside the space station,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.822
controlling a mechanical arm to catch the Pilgrim.&nbsp;
His colleagues are helping him gear up for his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:45.680
assignment. The space station is filled with&nbsp;
tension as the astronauts navigate the station,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.360
all rushing into their posts. Their commander,&nbsp;
Ekaterina, and another astronaut, Sho, are at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.920
the station’s command center, overseeing&nbsp;
the operation. The other astronauts watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.480
intently as the station moves into position to&nbsp;
intercept the Pilgrim. David, the station doctor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.840
monitors Rory’s vital signs. He, along with the&nbsp;
lead scientist, Hugh, watch Rory from a window.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.720
Anxiety fills the station as they finally see&nbsp;
the Pilgrim capsule approaching the station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.760
Rory navigates the arm into position, and&nbsp;
as the Pilgrim barrels in and makes contact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.400
the whole station jolts back. The astronauts&nbsp;
are pushed back, but as they gather back at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.960
the window, they see Rory has caught the&nbsp;
Pilgrim. Cheers and smiles are exchanged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.680
as Ekaterina announces to NASA that the Pilgrim&nbsp;
capsule has successfully landed on the station.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.920
At the laboratory, Hugh carefully&nbsp;
takes samples from a container and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.640
places them under a microscope. He discovers&nbsp;
an organism almost fossilized in the sample.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.000
He describes it as something similar to a&nbsp;
single-cell organism. Hugh tries reanimating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.440
the organism, but it doesn’t react. He then tries&nbsp;
mimicking an atmosphere closer to a proterozoic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.720
Earth and adding in a growth hormone. To&nbsp;
everyone’s surprise, the organism starts moving.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.160
Hugh can’t help but giggle, as they’ve&nbsp;
confirmed life from a different planet.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.920
The team later goes into a call from Earth. News&nbsp;
outlets and large crowds are all celebrating the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.920
discovery of extraterrestrial life.&nbsp;
The astronauts chat with students&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.000
announcing that their school had been given&nbsp;
an extraordinary chance to name the Martian.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.040
The kid declares that they decided&nbsp;
to name the organism “Calvin.”

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.160
After the call, the astronauts resume&nbsp;
their tasks. Hugh and Rory bicker while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.320
trying to fix plumbing. Meanwhile, another&nbsp;
doctor, Miranda, checks on David’s health.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.280
Miranda is concerned because David had been on&nbsp;
the station for a significant length of time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.080
almost breaking the world record for the longest&nbsp;
time in space. David says he doesn’t mind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.000
as he prefers staying on the space&nbsp;
station. He feels like he belongs there.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.000
They continue testing the organism the following&nbsp;
day. Hugh found that Calvin has grown rapidly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.640
now consisting of hundreds of cells and developing&nbsp;
a neural network. Hugh notes that each of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.520
Calvin’s cells can perform every somatic function&nbsp;
independently, meaning each of Calvin’s cells are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.280
simultaneously a muscle cell, a nerve cell, and&nbsp;
a photoreceptive cell. Calvin is a creature that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.800
is all brain, all muscle, and all eyes. Calvin&nbsp;
has also developed to have appendages, and Hugh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.840
tries making contact. The crew watches anxiously&nbsp;
as Hugh plays around with the alien creature.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.640
The crew later has dinner while Sho calls&nbsp;
his wife, who’s currently undergoing labor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.000
Sho then introduces everyone to his newborn&nbsp;
daughter. The crew then heads into their quarters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.400
each tending to themselves. David examines&nbsp;
himself for injuries and ailments,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.040
Sho continues his call with his family, and Hugh&nbsp;
is back at the lab, interacting with Calvin.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.720
Several weeks pass, and the&nbsp;
station is rocked by an alarm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.120
Rory, Miranda, and Hugh all rush to the lab.&nbsp;
Rory heads in and fixes the malfunction,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.800
and Hugh admits he must have overseen&nbsp;
something for the lab to malfunction.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.840
Miranda stresses the importance of keeping Calvin&nbsp;
contained as they don’t fully understand it yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.560
Hugh is irked, saying they shouldn’t liken&nbsp;
Calvin to a disease, but Rory gets annoyed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.240
saying that Calvin is an alien species&nbsp;
and that Hugh shouldn’t grow too attached.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.160
Later, Miranda makes a note that Calvin has now&nbsp;
become dormant after weeks of sustained growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.600
They suspect that Calvin may have gone&nbsp;
to hibernation as a defense mechanism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.080
when the lab malfunctioned. She says she is&nbsp;
relieved as the creature was growing too fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.360
This pause in its growth has given her and the&nbsp;
crew time to review their containment procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.000
Calvin and the lab must remain&nbsp;
sealed off at all times.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.640
Miranda expresses that the health of everyone&nbsp;
on board far outweighs any harm to Calvin.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.080
Hugh discusses Calvin with Miranda. He stresses&nbsp;
the importance of their mission and studying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.440
Calvin’s cells. He poses that Calvin could unlock&nbsp;
the secret to curing any disease or potentially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.160
healing every ailment. He proposes giving&nbsp;
Calvin a small electric shock to awaken it.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.400
In the lab, Hugh prepares to electrocute Calvin.&nbsp;
After several shocks, Calvin springs awake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.480
latching to Hugh’s hand and breaking the&nbsp;
electric wand. The crew tries to remain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.440
calm as Calvin grips Hugh’s hand. Hugh tries&nbsp;
pulling, but Calvin maintains a tight grip.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.480
Hugh starts shouting in pain as Calvin starts&nbsp;
squeezing. Calvin begins folding Hugh’s fingers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.440
into unnatural shapes, and Hugh begins begging&nbsp;
for help. The crew wants to head in and help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.800
but Miranda tells them they can’t risk placing&nbsp;
another crew member in danger. As the crew argues,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.080
Calvin breaks Hugh’s hand. Hugh then starts&nbsp;
floating, unconscious, his hand a mangled mess.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.840
In the container, Calvin tries breaking free.&nbsp;
It uses a piece of the broken electric wand to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.920
pierce one of the gloves. Calvin breaks&nbsp;
free, leaving everyone in utter shock.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.520
Calvin makes its way to a lab rat specimen. It&nbsp;
suddenly attacks, wrapping itself around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.120
rat and digesting it. Rory enters the lab,&nbsp;
fetching Hugh. David receives Hugh but has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.840
to close the lab door before Rory makes it out&nbsp;
as he sees Calvin latch itself on Rory’s leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.080
Rory then gets an oxygen candle,&nbsp;
hoping to burn Calvin off his leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.520
He burns Calvin, and it jumps off. Ekaterina&nbsp;
then gives the other to kill the alien.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.200
Rory takes an incinerator and prepares to&nbsp;
flame Calvin. He starts hunting the alien,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:09.840
bathing it with flame. Calvin runs around the lab,&nbsp;
hiding, but Rory chases after it. Rory corners the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.040
alien, believing to have Calvin trapped in a&nbsp;
container. Rory discovers the container empty,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.320
and Calvin pops up behind him. The alien grabs&nbsp;
Rory’s face and makes its way into Rory’s mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.040
Rory begins choking, and the crew&nbsp;
watches in horror, unable to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.040
A large amount of blood spews out of Rory’s&nbsp;
mouth as he floats lifelessly in the lab.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.840
The incinerator triggers a fire alarm,&nbsp;
and fire suppressant gas fills the lab.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.280
Calvin exits Rory, now appearing&nbsp;
to have grown a hundredfold.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.360
Sho and the commander try manually closing the gas&nbsp;
as Calvin could use the gas holes as a way out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.720
As the final valve closes, Calvin&nbsp;
reaches it and squeezes out.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.560
Ekaterina sends out a distress call to NASA,&nbsp;
but Sho sees the transmission has failed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.400
They would need to venture out to fix&nbsp;
it. Ekaterina suits up and heads out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.440
She reaches the transmitter and sees it has&nbsp;
overheated. She opens the coolant chamber&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.600
and sees it empty. She surmises that&nbsp;
Calvin could have reached the coolant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.800
Hugh, now conscious, theorizes that Calvin&nbsp;
may have consumed the coolant for sustenance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.240
As they talk, Calvin launches itself out of&nbsp;
the coolant chamber and latches onto Ekaterina.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.120
Ekaterina makes her way back to the station&nbsp;
airlock, but she notices liquid in her suit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.240
Calvin has ruptured her coolant tube, and&nbsp;
Ekaterina realizes she could drown soon. Liquid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.960
starts inhibiting her vision, and she decides&nbsp;
to leap for the airlock. Liquid coolant floods&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.240
into Ekarina’s helmet, and she starts drowning.&nbsp;
David rushes to the airlock to meet Ekaterina, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.840
Miranda warns him that Ekaterina may be frantic&nbsp;
and irrational. Ekaterina makes it to the airlock,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.960
and David advises her to help him unlock the&nbsp;
airlock. To David’s surprise, she starts turning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.760
the airlock’s lever in the opposite direction.&nbsp;
Miranda realizes that Ekaterina is deliberately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.600
locking herself out to save the crew from Calvin.&nbsp;
Ekaterina eventually drowns, and David and Miranda&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.160
watch her float away. Calvin jumps back to&nbsp;
the ship, and David weeps in frustration.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.520
Hugh tries calming everyone down, telling them&nbsp;
Calvin has been outside far too long for any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.480
creature to survive. Sho tells them Calvin could&nbsp;
still enter the station through the thrusters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.880
They monitor the thrusters, and each time a&nbsp;
thruster experiences a temperature change,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.000
Sho ignites it. Unfortunately, all the thruster&nbsp;
blasting causes the station to veer off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.680
and Sho has to use the remaining fuel&nbsp;
to put the station back in orbit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.000
This allows Calvin to sneak back into the station.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.440
Hugh realizes that Calvin’s species must have&nbsp;
dominated Mars for millions of years but went&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.760
into hibernation when Mars’ atmosphere&nbsp;
collapsed. He proposes they should simulate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.720
the same on the station to force Calvin back into&nbsp;
hibernation. They would retreat to one capsule,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.160
seal themselves off, and expel the&nbsp;
oxygen from the rest of the station.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.080
They retreat to a capsule and seal everything&nbsp;
off. Miranda notices Hugh getting weaker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.960
Hugh blames himself for what happened, but David&nbsp;
says it was a team decision to take Calvin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.000
Hugh says Calvin isn’t their enemy&nbsp;
as it’s only trying to survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.880
And for it to survive, it must kill&nbsp;
them. Hugh gets weaker and passes out.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.000
The crew tries to help stabilize Hugh, but&nbsp;
Miranda notices something moving in Hugh’s leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.760
She unzips Hugh’s pants and finds&nbsp;
Calvin feeding on Hugh’s leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.840
They all jump back. Miranda uses a defibrillator&nbsp;
to shock Calvin, but it only catches the alien’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.640
attention. They rush out and get split up,&nbsp;
and Sho gets stranded in the sleeping pods.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.320
David and Miranda return to Hugh, and David&nbsp;
sees that Hugh would soon pass. David sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.120
Calvin moving through the ship in a hologram.&nbsp;
Calvin had accidentally swallowed Hugh’s tracker,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.920
leaving Miranda and David the ability to track&nbsp;
the creature. They then lock themselves off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.320
and purge oxygen from the other compartments.&nbsp;
Calvin starts suffocating when they suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.120
get a proximity warning. They look out the window&nbsp;
and see a Soyuz shuttle docking with the station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.920
Miranda reveals that the Soyuz isn’t there to&nbsp;
rescue them but to push them into deep space.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.320
It is a final security measure ensuring&nbsp;
no alien life would ever reach Earth.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.960
Believing the shuttle docking is a rescue&nbsp;
mission, Sho leaves his sleeping chamber&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.320
and rushes to the Soyuz. As he tries to get&nbsp;
the hatch open, Calvin sneaks up behind him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.880
Miranda and David hurry to Sho but are too&nbsp;
late. They see the cosmonauts inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:18.160
Soyuz getting devoured and Sho trying to make his&nbsp;
way back out. The Soyuz breaks away, and the seal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:23.440
between the two stations fails. The station begins&nbsp;
decompressing, and Sho starts getting sucked out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.680
Calvin suddenly latches onto Sho’s leg and starts&nbsp;
climbing. As Calvin gets closer to Miranda, Sho&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.120
decides to grab Calvin and allow himself to get&nbsp;
sucked back. Sho falls and gets sucked into space,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.840
but Calvin manages to cling to the station.&nbsp;
David helps Miranda climb up and manages to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.720
lock Calvin out. The station starts falling&nbsp;
apart, and parts and debris fly everywhere.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.360
David sees that all the chaos has once&nbsp;
again pushed the station into the Earth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.640
leaving them about thirty minutes before&nbsp;
the station re-enters the atmosphere.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.920
With depleting oxygen, David gets an idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:01.200
Calvin is searching for oxygen, so they could&nbsp;
probably use the oxygen candles to lure it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.320
He plans to lure Calvin to one of the escape pods&nbsp;
and launch himself into deep space with Calvin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.720
Miranda would then get into a different pod and&nbsp;
land back on Earth to tell everyone what happened.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.880
They initiate their plan, and David heads out with&nbsp;
an oxygen candle. David carefully traverses the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:22.800
station, and Calvin shows up and hugs his oxygen&nbsp;
candle. David flees and uses another oxygen candle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:28.720
to lure Calvin. David gets to the escape pod, and&nbsp;
Calvin rushes in and hugs him. Seeing that David&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:34.160
has made it to the pod, Miranda begins making&nbsp;
her way to the other pod. David launches his pod,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.040
and he begins heading into deep space. Miranda&nbsp;
then launches, and they start separating.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.360
In a black box recording, Miranda&nbsp;
narrates what happened in the station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.280
She recommends treating all Martian&nbsp;
life as dangerous and hostile and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.960
advises to use all possible means to&nbsp;
kill Calvin if it ever reaches Earth.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.360
Both capsules run into debris,&nbsp;
and both begin malfunctioning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.680
Calvin grabs David’s hand, but he tries&nbsp;
his best to maintain his trajectory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.440
Miranda descends, but her pod’s&nbsp;
navigation systems start malfunctioning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.920
The two pods drift farther apart. David screams&nbsp;
in agony as Calvin wraps around his arm.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.880
One pod finally enters the atmosphere while&nbsp;
the other flies off into space. The pod ends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.240
up crash landing in the ocean. Fishermen see&nbsp;
the pod descending and approach it. In the pod,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:25.280
they see David covered in tendrils of flesh.&nbsp;
In space, Miranda continues veering off.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.320
The fishermen work together to get the pod&nbsp;
opened, and David tries to discourage them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.000
but they can’t understand him. More&nbsp;
fishing boats approach the pod,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.840
unknowingly bringing themselves closer&nbsp;
to their, and the planet’s, doom.
