00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.840
Story Recapped here. Today, I’m going&nbsp;
to explain a horror film called,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.760
“Drag Me To Hell.” Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.640
In 1969 Pasadena, a young distraught couple brings&nbsp;
in their son to a medium named Shaun San Dena.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.760
The boy has been hearing voices for three days&nbsp;
thinking someone is after him. It turns out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.440
he stole a silver necklace from a gypsy wagon,&nbsp;
but even returning the necklace didn’t stop the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.760
voices. San Dena takes the boy into her house&nbsp;
and begins to perform a ritual to save him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.320
but it’s too late. The shadows have come to take&nbsp;
the boy. Suddenly, an unseen force pushes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.760
adults away. Feeling terrified, the boy runs away&nbsp;
and trips over to the balcony. San Dena runs after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.080
him and sees the boy, unmoving on the tiled floor.&nbsp;
As the parents run over to their son, a crack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.240
opens up on the floor, and burned arms drag the&nbsp;
boy to the depths of hell. The crack disappears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.320
and so does the boy. San Dena makes a vow to&nbsp;
meet with the devil again and redeem herself.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.720
At present time Pasadena, Christine Brown is&nbsp;
working at a bank as a loan officer. Gearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.640
up for a big promotion, Christine has her&nbsp;
heart set on becoming assistant manager. She’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.560
determined to impress her boss, Mr. Jim Jacks,&nbsp;
and beat her rival, Stu Rubin. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.880
Mr. Jacks doesn’t think she can handle tough&nbsp;
decisions and isn’t taking her seriously. He sends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.280
her on an early lunch break and asks her to bring&nbsp;
two sandwiches for him and Stu. Feeling dejected,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.000
Christine visits her boyfriend, Clay Dalton, who’s&nbsp;
a psychology professor at a nearby university.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.920
After having lunch together, Christine gives&nbsp;
him a rare coin to add to his coin collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.000
She kisses him goodbye as his phone rings. As&nbsp;
she’s walking away, she hears Clay’s mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.920
on the phone with him. Clay comes from a rich&nbsp;
and upper-class family and Mrs. Dalton doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.000
like the idea of his son dating some unknown&nbsp;
farm girl. She walks away and arrives at work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.400
feeling more down than ever. Stu is still on&nbsp;
his way sucking up to the boss. She needs to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.480
learn how to handle tough decisions if she wants&nbsp;
this promotion to impress the Daltons. Her chance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.240
comes in the form of a peculiar-looking old&nbsp;
lady with a glass eye named Mrs. Slyvia Ganush.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.880
The bank is repossessing Mrs. Ganush’s house&nbsp;
because she’s unable to pay her mortgage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.400
She’s come for an extension for her mortgage but&nbsp;
it turns out she’s already been given an extension&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.640
by the bank twice. Wanting to stand her ground and&nbsp;
show her boss that she can handle tough decisions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.160
Christine flatly rejects Mrs. Ganush’s appeal and&nbsp;
tells her that there’s nothing she can do about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.160
it. Mrs. Ganush rises from her chair and begs&nbsp;
Christine on her knees to get her house back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.080
Christine backs away, feeling weirded&nbsp;
out by the situation, and calls security.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.240
The old lady drops down on the floor and looks&nbsp;
at Christine, feeling completely humiliated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.400
Mrs. Ganush lunges at her but security grabs&nbsp;
her and forces her out. Christine feels shaken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.640
by the incident but Mr. Jacks is impressed that&nbsp;
she was able to stand her ground. As a reward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.480
he lets her handle an important client for the&nbsp;
bank and reassures her about the promotion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.680
Later that night after work, Christine&nbsp;
walks into the dark parking lot alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.160
She sees a lone car sitting across from&nbsp;
hers that looked like Mrs. Ganush’s own car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.080
The paranoia is creeping in now as she&nbsp;
hurries to her vehicle. She turns her head,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.680
thinking she’s heard a sound and jams her&nbsp;
keys into the door. She hurries inside and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.600
spots a handkerchief floating in the air towards&nbsp;
her. It takes the shape of the old woman’s face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.240
and she screams. As Christine turns to face her&nbsp;
backseat, Mrs. Ganush appears and grabs her head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.000
Christine screams as she tries to break&nbsp;
free and grabs the stapler from her box.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.920
She slams the stapler into the woman’s face&nbsp;
multiple times before her feet step on the gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.240
The car runs backward and rear-ends another car,&nbsp;
forcing the woman to loosen her grip. She wraps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.320
her arms around Christine’s neck, strangling her,&nbsp;
as Christine shifts the gear forward and steps on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.960
the gas one more time. She pulls down her seatbelt&nbsp;
and crashes directly into another parked car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.120
tossing Mrs. Ganush forward and knock the dentures&nbsp;
out of her mouth. The old woman tries to bite her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.960
with her slimy toothless gums but Christine pushes&nbsp;
her back and stabs a ruler into her mouth. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.040
kicks the lady out of the car and locks the door.&nbsp;
Mrs. Ganush grabs a brick and drags her out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.600
car. As Christine prepares for another attack, the&nbsp;
old woman reaches out to her coat and grabs one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.320
of her coat buttons. She smiles in delight as she&nbsp;
whispers into the button and calls on Lamia. Mrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.240
Ganesh returns the button to Christine and tells&nbsp;
her that she will soon come begging her. Christine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.560
passes out and when wakes up, Mrs. Ganesh is&nbsp;
gone. She calls the police and her boyfriend.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.880
Clay rescues Christine from the scene. As they&nbsp;
walk to his car, Christine gets the urge to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.080
her fortune read. Clay is skeptical but joins her&nbsp;
anyway. They meet the seer, a man named Rham Jas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.840
In a small dark room, Rham Jas begins to read&nbsp;
Christine’s fortune. He feels that something’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.000
been taken from her, specifically a coat&nbsp;
button. As he sees into Christine’s future,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.160
wind enters the room and breaks one of his framed&nbsp;
pictures. He then sees the mark of the devil upon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.320
her. Rham Jas backs away and tells her that&nbsp;
someone must have cursed her. He tries to give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.320
them back their money, hands them his business&nbsp;
card, and sends them away. Clay drives them home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.840
still skeptical about the session, and tells&nbsp;
Christine that he’ll be back in an hour, leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.080
her alone in the house with their cat. Christine&nbsp;
tries to relax after the day’s unsettling events,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.960
but it’s too late. The curse is slowly beginning&nbsp;
to take place. After baking a cake, she puts away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.880
her things and sees an old picture of her. She&nbsp;
crumples the picture, wanting to leave her farm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.440
girl past behind her. Just then, she hears a sound&nbsp;
coming from the door and sees the gate wide open.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.360
A strong gust of wind makes her gasp as it roams&nbsp;
all around the house and turns off the power.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.080
She runs into the kitchen and closes the window.&nbsp;
The wind stops and the house falls into silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.840
She grabs a flashlight and watches as the&nbsp;
shadows on the wall form into a horned figure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.040
She’s tossed back into the cabinets and falls&nbsp;
to the floor with a busted lip just as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.280
power comes back on. Clay arrives and calls a&nbsp;
doctor to check on her. He reassures her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.200
it’s just post-traumatic stress and things will&nbsp;
get better. He suggests going on a weekend trip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.840
to his parent’s cabin and this cheers her up. They&nbsp;
settle in for the night and as Christine sleeps, a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.480
fly enters the room and creeps around her face. It&nbsp;
enters her mouth and she wakes up coughing. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.960
she settles back into bed, she screams as she sees&nbsp;
the decaying corpse of Mrs. Ganush beside her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.200
The corpse pins her down to the bed and vomits&nbsp;
maggots all over her face. Christine sits right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.120
up on the bed and feels relieved that it was just&nbsp;
a nightmare. Clay drives her over to work and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.120
enters the bank, still feeling stressed over&nbsp;
what happened yesterday. She doesn’t know why,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.760
but she feels as if the universe has shifted.&nbsp;
She feels paranoid and sees traces of Mrs. Ganush&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.080
everywhere she looks. She gets impatient with&nbsp;
Stu and shouts at him. Suddenly, her phone rings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.000
and she answers it but blood starts dripping&nbsp;
from her nose. Mr. Jacks approaches her to ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.640
what’s wrong, but she starts projectile vomiting&nbsp;
blood onto her boss. Feeling horrified, she grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.800
her things and runs out. Unbeknownst to her,&nbsp;
Stu steals her client documents from her desk.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.640
Christine makes her way to the house&nbsp;
of Mrs. Ganush’s granddaughter, Ilenka.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.280
She begs Ilenka to let her in and apologize&nbsp;
to her grandmother so that she can help and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.400
make things right. Ilenka scoffs at&nbsp;
her but leads her into the basement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.120
Christine makes her down and finds herself in a&nbsp;
bizarre ceremony. People were eating, talking, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.440
drinking as she looks for Mrs. Ganush. Suddenly,&nbsp;
she trips into something and lands on the floor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.320
with Mrs. Ganush’s corpse on top of her. It turns&nbsp;
out Mrs. Ganush is dead and this is her funeral.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.080
The relatives help carry the corpse off her as&nbsp;
Christine stands up to regain her composure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.600
Ilenka arrives at her side and tells her that&nbsp;
she deserves everything that’s coming for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.760
Christine shudders as she looks at the corpse&nbsp;
that is now staring at her. Even in death, Mrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.080
Ganush wouldn’t let her go. Christine decides to&nbsp;
see Rham Jas and learns that she’s being hunted by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.120
a Lamia. The Lamia is the Black Goat which gypsies&nbsp;
summon to do their evil deeds. The Lamia torments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.800
its victim for three days before revealing itself&nbsp;
and taking the accursed object and the soul of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.040
its owner. The accursed object is something taken&nbsp;
from the victim, is cursed, and then given back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.760
Christine gasps as she realizes that her accursed&nbsp;
object is her coat button. Rham Jas advises her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.600
that if she wants the Lamia off her back, she can&nbsp;
try appeasing it by sacrificing an animal and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.600
hands her a book that shows her how to do it.&nbsp;
Christine returns back home and feels haunted by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.240
Lamia. She hears a sound coming from the house and&nbsp;
sees the shadow of the devil outside her house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.560
She runs upstairs and sees the shadow walking up&nbsp;
the stairs. She backs away and locks herself in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.560
the bedroom and tries to call her boyfriend. A&nbsp;
picture of Mrs. Ganush appears on her phone and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.480
she tosses it away. The Lamia is now outside&nbsp;
her door, its hands reaching out to take her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.200
soul to hell. Christine runs to the window but&nbsp;
Lamia appears and bursts its way in. The window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.880
breaks as she’s lifted into the air in a circle.&nbsp;
Her things float around her as she’s wrung about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.720
like a lifeless doll before being thrown back&nbsp;
to the floor. She looks around the messy room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.720
and feels determined about her decision. She&nbsp;
goes back to the kitchen, grabs a knife, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.040
sacrifices their cat. After she buries the corpse&nbsp;
of their pet in the backyard, Clay arrives and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.400
tries to postpone their dinner with his parents&nbsp;
but Christine insists that she wants to go.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.880
They arrive at Dalton’s villa and are&nbsp;
received coldly by Mr. and Mrs. Dalton.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.800
Mr. Dalton is tolerable of their relationship,&nbsp;
but Mrs. Dalton is a downright snob and doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.240
miss a chance to make Christine feel&nbsp;
unwelcome. During dinner, Mrs. Dalton&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.080
interrogates Christine and gets her to admit the&nbsp;
troubled past she had while living on a farm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.480
For once, Mrs. Dalton is impressed by Christine’s&nbsp;
honesty. The atmosphere turns light as they all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.160
laugh together, but Christine feels nothing&nbsp;
but dread as she hears a distant sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.160
She pokes her cake and finds an eyeball in it.&nbsp;
She stabs it with a knife and blood oozes out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.480
Suddenly, she hears a loud ringing in her&nbsp;
head. She tries to keep her composure but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.360
is soon sent into a coughing fit. She spits out a&nbsp;
fly from her mouth and it horrifies Mrs. Dalton.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.120
Christine hears the loud ringing noise again,&nbsp;
but this time paired with thunderous knocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.440
She’s fed up with everything and throws a glass at&nbsp;
the door, screaming for Lamia to leave her alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.080
Mr. and Mrs. Dalton is taken aback as Christine&nbsp;
leaves. Christine visits Rham Jas again and is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.680
angry at him for making her sacrifice their cat&nbsp;
for nothing. He reminds her that these are dark&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.520
and powerful spirits that they’re dealing with.&nbsp;
He knows someone who can help her, but this person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.200
won’t be willing to put themselves at risk for&nbsp;
free. He tells Christine that she needs $10,000&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.320
in cash by tomorrow. The next day, Christine&nbsp;
finds herself in Mr. Jack's office and asks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.160
if she can get an advance as the new assistant&nbsp;
manager. He informs her that the promotion has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.520
been delayed because their biggest client went&nbsp;
to another bank for their deal and he’s thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.000
of giving the position to Stu anyway. Christine&nbsp;
goes back home, feeling desperate, and strips her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
house of any loose cash. As she goes into the&nbsp;
shed to start selling some of her old stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.240
Mrs. Ganush appears from behind a curtain and pins&nbsp;
her to the wall by the neck. Christine struggles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.240
as she cuts a rope and sends an anvil straight&nbsp;
onto the old woman’s head. Her head bursts and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.640
blood splatters all over Christine’s face, but she&nbsp;
wakes up and finds that it’s just a hallucination.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.720
She sells her stuff at a pawnshop, but she still&nbsp;
needs more money. Clay arrives and finds her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.120
crying in the kitchen with the money. He tells&nbsp;
her that he already paid Rham Jas in full. Even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.400
though he’s skeptical about the whole thing,&nbsp;
he cares about Christine and if this is what it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.240
takes for her to be at peace, then he’s willing&nbsp;
to do it. She thanks him and gives him a hug.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.840
They drive up to an old mansion&nbsp;
and are received by Rham Jas who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.800
introduces them to an older Shaun&nbsp;
San Dena and her assistant, Milos.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.840
San Dena believes what Christine is going through&nbsp;
and shares with her the story of a young boy who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.080
was also cursed by Lamia. She’s waited all these&nbsp;
years to finally destroy the beast and tonight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.880
the opportunity has come. San Dena takes them to&nbsp;
a grand room with a seance table in the center.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.640
In this place, there is a special doorway in&nbsp;
the center through which spirits pass through.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.960
They take their seats at the table as Milos ties&nbsp;
a goat next to Christine. San Dena takes out a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.080
machete and tells her that they will force&nbsp;
Lamia into the goat and Milos will use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:59.200
machete to strike the animal dead. They hold hands&nbsp;
together as San Dena starts the ritual. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.600
the chanting stops, and the objects around them&nbsp;
start moving around. Christine gasps as she sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.760
a group of spirits walking towards them. San&nbsp;
Dena sends the unsettled souls away and feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.480
Lamia coming in. Christine turns around and hears&nbsp;
the sound of hooves as it comes closer. A loud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.280
ringing bursts into her head and then stops.&nbsp;
San Dena gasps as Lamia takes over her body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.240
Rham Jas talks to Lamia and asks her what she&nbsp;
wants. It wants Christine’s soul. It lunges for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.640
Christine but touches the goat instead. Milo gets&nbsp;
up from his chair and drives the machete towards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.640
the animal but ends up cutting the rope loose.&nbsp;
The goat bites his hand and transfers the Lamia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.880
to him. Milos starts dancing above the table as&nbsp;
Rham Jas commands him to leave. The spirit throws&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.920
a chair to the seer, knocking him out. Christine&nbsp;
tries to run away but is blocked by Lamia. Lamia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.600
in Milos’s body, throws up her cat’s corpse,&nbsp;
telling her it doesn’t want anything but her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.720
soul. Rham Jas gains consciousness and helps San&nbsp;
Dena to her feet to banish the spirit. San Dena&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.640
commands Lamia and pulls it away from Christine.&nbsp;
She holds it above the table and pulls out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.880
spirit in the form of red smoke from Milos’s body.&nbsp;
The smoke disappears and Milos collapses on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:02.080
table, back to his old self. Christine thanks San&nbsp;
Dena but she faints to the floor. Rham Jas tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.480
to revive her but it’s too late, the ritual has&nbsp;
taken an enormous strain on her body and she dies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.960
As San Dena’s body is wheeled into the ambulance,&nbsp;
Rham Jas tells Christine that it’s not over yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.640
Lamia is still free to roam about and will come&nbsp;
for her because the goat was never slaughtered.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.080
The only way now is to pass the accursed object&nbsp;
to someone else so that Lamia will take them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.000
instead of Christine. They place the button into&nbsp;
an envelope and he tells Christine that she has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
until morning to get rid of it. On the way home,&nbsp;
Christine lies to Clay and tells him that it’s all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.120
over. She sees Mrs. Ganush on the road and they&nbsp;
stop, almost running over an old man. Her files&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.960
are thrown on the floor, including the envelope&nbsp;
with the button. She now feels the weight of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.040
decision in her bag. She has to pass this course&nbsp;
to someone else or else she’ll burn in hell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.320
They arrive at home but Christine tells Clay that&nbsp;
she’ll meet him at the station for their weekend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.400
trip. She panics for a second as she searches&nbsp;
her files for the envelope but quickly finds it.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.800
Christine goes to a diner and searches&nbsp;
for a person to pass the curse. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.960
she has an idea. She calls Stu on the phone and&nbsp;
blackmails him into coming, threatening to tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.640
Mr. Jacks that it was Stu who stole the documents&nbsp;
off her desk and led their biggest client to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.480
the deal with their rival bank. Stu arrives in&nbsp;
a matter of minutes and begs Christine not to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.040
rat him out to their boss. He breaks down crying&nbsp;
and she feels sorry for him and changes her mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.880
She asks him to leave and is now feeling&nbsp;
desperate. She visits Rham Jas who tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.800
that she can give the accursed object to a dead&nbsp;
person. Christine grabs a shovel and makes her way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.360
to the cemetery. The same handkerchief appears as&nbsp;
she drives, taking the shape of Mrs. Ganush tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.080
to suffocate her. She stops the car and rips the&nbsp;
cloth apart. She grabs her shovel and enters the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:29.200
cemetery. She digs up Mrs. Ganush’s corpse, opens&nbsp;
up her mouth, and makes a formal declaration,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.200
transferring the ownership of the accursed button&nbsp;
back to the old woman. The rain starts filling in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.720
the hole as Christine desperately tries to get&nbsp;
out. The corpse floats around and drags her down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.120
to the water as the cross falls down on her head.&nbsp;
In a matter of seconds, Christine emerges from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.600
water and uses the cross to pull herself out. She&nbsp;
goes back home by morning, feeling happy now that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.840
she’s finally free from the gypsy’s curse. She&nbsp;
packs her bags for their trip and Mr. Jacks calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.960
her to let her know that she got the promotion&nbsp;
after they found out it was Stu who gave out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.040
insider information. Christine drives up to the&nbsp;
station to meet up with Clay but decides to buy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.200
a new coat, especially for the trip. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
Clay is waiting for her with an engagement ring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.040
in her pocket. They finally meet and Christine&nbsp;
thanks him for fully supporting her throughout the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.600
whole thing. He asks her about her old coat but&nbsp;
she tells him that she threw it away. Just then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.440
Clay pulls out an envelope containing the cursed&nbsp;
button. It turned out that Christine took the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.680
wrong envelope and gave Mrs. Ganush the rare coin&nbsp;
that she meant to give to Clay. Christine gasps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.840
as she backs away and falls into the train tracks.&nbsp;
He runs towards her to help her but it’s too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.520
The train speeds over as a hole erupt from beneath&nbsp;
Christine as burned hands pull her down to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.760
depths of hell. Clay can only stand and watch in&nbsp;
disbelief as the new owner of the cursed button.
