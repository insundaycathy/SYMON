00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.589
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.100
Today I'm going to explain a psychological
thriller film called Triangle.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.549
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:09.370
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.950
A tearful mother, Jess, hugs her son, Tommy,
to comfort him from a nightmare.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.510
She tells him that she imagines being with
him to save her from nightmares.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.770
In a sunny neighborhood, Jess prepares to
leave on a sailing trip with her son.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.560
She cleans up paint that he spilled on the
floor but gets her dress dirty.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.760
Someone rings the door, but she sees no one
outside.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.860
With new clothes on, she prepares to leave
the house.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.070
Stuck to her fridge is a note reminding her
to head to the Triangle Harbor.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.149
Jess tries to calm her son down, who's throwing
a tantrum about a mess.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.730
Jess picks him up and takes him to the car.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.000
Waiting at the yacht is Jess's friend, Greg,
along with the married couple, Sally and Downey.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.120
Sally introduces her friend Heather, whom
Greg wasn't expecting.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.550
Greg spots Jess and Victor arrive.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.300
Tommy is not with her.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.070
Seeing Jess' troubled face, he checks in on
her.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.660
She explains that she's simply tired, not
wanting to ruin the trip for everyone else.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.540
Greg introduces Jess to everyone and gets
the boat ready to sail.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.520
As the boat sails, Jess sleeps in the cabin,
dreaming of the beach.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.979
She wakes up startled but she doesn't remember
her dream.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.460
While navigating the boat, Victor explains
to Greg that he thought Jess was bringing

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.299
her son along, so he asked where Tommy was.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.250
Jess couldn't answer him at first but finally
says that Tommy is at school.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.369
But it's a Saturday, so there shouldn't be
any school open.

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.340
Greg informs Victor that Tommy goes to a special
needs school, which is open every day.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.390
Heather and Jess come up from the cabin.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.580
A seagull flies over the boat, making Greg
believe that it thinks they're a fishing boat

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.619
and is hoping to get food from them.

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.100
Greg encourages Jess to steer the yacht to
uplift her mood.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.440
Heather and Sally gossip about the two.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.130
Heather learned that Jess is a waitress and
has an autistic son.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.740
Sally thinks that Jess might be using Greg.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.630
Sally wanted to set Heather up with Greg.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.030
Greg explains to Jess that Victor has been
living with him after running away from a

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.670
troubled home.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.229
Downey and Sally are his friends from school,
who always try to set him up with someone.

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.340
Jess wonders if they think he's lonely.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.260
Greg insists that he's not but reveals that
he intentionally visited Jess at the diner

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.779
the day before to invite her to sail.

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:18.120
Jess wonders how Greg feels about her.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.950
Jess shares her guilt about leaving Tommy
behind, but Greg notes that feeling guilty

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.959
over having time for herself makes her a good
mother.

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.859
Suddenly, the wind stops, leaving the boat
immobile.

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.700
Downey points to a dark cloud hovering close
by.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.950
The group watches the cloud, unsure of what
to do.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.930
Greg radios the coast guard.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.569
The coast guard reports that nothing odd is
showing up on their end despite the yacht's

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.569
condition.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.670
The radio goes static then picks up the frequency
of a frightened woman's call for help.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.790
Greg tries to communicate with the woman but
the transmission disconnects.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.219
The storm reaches them, and hell breaks looseâ€”Victor
and Greg attempt to get the boat to safety

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.250
while the guests hide in the cabin.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.569
Greg grabs Jess, keeping her close as he steers.

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.919
Downey holds onto the other women but loses
his grip on Heather when another wave hits

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:03.919
the boat.

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:07.139
The boat capsizes just before the storm calms.

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.069
Greg and Victor help the others up the overturned
boat.

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.709
But they can't find Heather.

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.939
The clouds clear up, but still no sign of
Heather.

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.239
Downey comforts his tearful wife, who's worried
about her friend.

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.709
Greg assures Jess that Tommy will be looked
after until they return.

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.150
A large passenger ship looms over from the
distance.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.029
The group is hopeful, calling the ship for
help.

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:30.239
But Jess watches it with suspicion.

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.609
Finally, the ship reaches them, and they climb
aboard.

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.950
On the ship, Jess finds something eerily familiar
about it.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.079
Victor calls for anyone on board, but no one
answers.

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.090
Greg suggests heading to the bridge and talking
to the captain.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.879
Sally hopes that Heather made it onboard the
ship as well.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.360
The group goes in the promenade deck, still
seeing no signs of life.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.919
The maze-like hallways confuse the group,
with Downey thinking they're walking in circles.

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.949
Jess shares with Greg that she feels like
she knows this place.

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:00.849
The others find photos of the ship, seeing
that it's been around since 1932.

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.459
They learn that the ship is named after the
Greek God of Wind, Aeolus, whose son, Sisyphus,

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.749
is punished for cheating death by spending
eternity pushing a boulder up a hill repeatedly.

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:14.059
Greg and Victor investigate a sound coming
from the end of the hallway.

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:16.430
Victor picks up a set of keys from the floor.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.660
Jess recognizes that it's her keys, proving
so by showing a photo of her son amongst the

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.159
keychain, matching the one in her locket.

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:26.729
Sally believes it was Heather who got the
keys from the yacht and dropped them here.

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.039
At the ship's dining room, they see fresh
food laid out but still without anyone else

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.039
in sight.

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.210
Sally continues to call for Heather while
Victor enjoys the food.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.750
Greg finally gets tired of Sally's yelling
and stops her.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.750
Greg suggests that someone in the ship might
be tricking them.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.750
He insists on continuing on to the bridge.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.580
Jess slowly turns around, feeling that someone's
watching them.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.440
She sees a glimpse of someone running out
of view and points it out to the others.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.240
Victor runs ahead to give chase.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.250
Back at the lounge, Sally wonders if Jess
saw Heather.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.050
Greg decides to go to the bridge by himself,
telling them to wait for Victor.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.810
Jess follows Greg, leaving the couple behind.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.050
Jess worries about Victor, but Greg is tired
of how everyone is acting, arguing to Jess

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.870
that she's just in shock.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.189
They stop as they hear noise from down the
hall.

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:08.539
Greg finds the cabin door where the noise
is coming from.

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.689
Inside the cabin's bathroom, there's a message
on the mirror, saying "Go To Theater," written

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:13.689
in red.

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:14.689
The message scares the two.

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.849
Meanwhile, Victor continues to hunt down the
person Jess saw earlier.

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.190
He hears loud sounds from afar and follows
outside.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.340
Back to Jess and Greg, they find a map of
the ship.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.509
Jess brings up that the writing was written
in blood.

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:29.150
Greg thinks it's just a joke, played by bored
crew members.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.139
Jess is unconvinced, deciding to leave and
go back to the dining area.

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.379
Greg argues that her paranoia has her fabricating
her own little world in her mind.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.229
Jess reminds him that her world is her son,
making him feel guilty.

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.349
Sally and Downey follow a trail of blood out
the deck.

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.770
Downey insists that they meet with the others
in the theater, but Sally points out that

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.419
the blood is heading there anyway.

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.110
They go to the theater, with Sally looking
around for more signs of blood.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.940
Sally thought the blood was Heather's, but
Downey doubts Heather is even on the ship.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.610
Jess reaches the dining room, but it's empty.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.340
The previously fresh food on the table is
now rotting.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.250
She hears a movement and hides.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.719
An injured Victor enters and Jess goes to
his aid but is met with his hands around her

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:08.719
neck.

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:09.750
He tackles her to the floor.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.539
Out of desperation, Jess finds a wound at
the back of his head and pushes it.

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.150
This causes Victor to collapse and release
her.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.000
Worried, Jess checks on him, but a gunshot
diverts her attention.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.080
Jess heads to the theater to investigate,
finding Sally and Downey cradling a bloodied

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.080
Greg.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.949
As soon as Sally sees her, Sally accuses her
of firing at Greg.

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.889
But Jess was with Victor, who was also hurt.

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.319
Downey thinks that Jess also harmed Victor.

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.030
He tells her that Jess was the one who told
them to go to the theater, but she insists

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.789
that she didn't.

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:43.219
Sally gets hit in the chest by a bullet, and
Downey is hit on the back.

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:47.290
Jess sees the burlap-masked shooter on the
theater's upper deck, who continues to shoot

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.509
at the couple.

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.340
Downey dies just as Jess sees the shooter
retreat.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.889
She tries to take Sally to safety, but the
shooter fires at Sally again, mortally wounding

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:56.889
her.

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:59.900
Jess runs for her life, reaching the engine
room to hide.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.230
When the coast is clear, she runs to the kitchen
and grabs a knife for protection.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.979
Jess hides behind a kitchen island when she
hears the shooter closing in.

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:11.710
The shooter peers into the kitchen but doesn't
see her and goes away.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.440
Thinking it's safe, Jess heads out of the
kitchen and sees a sign to the boat deck.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.430
Quickly, she goes out to the deck but is hit
on the head with the back of the gun.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.330
The shooter comes forward as she begs for
her life.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.389
When the shooter pulls the trigger, she diverts
the weapon away, missing her.

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:30.270
She fights back and slips out of the deck,
landing on the lower floor.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.159
Jess runs with the shooter on her trail.

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:36.050
The gun jams, opting for the shooter to throw
it at her as she climbs over the rails to

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.669
the front of the ship.

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:40.430
Jess stumbles down but gets back on her feet
quickly.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.040
Running to the back of the ship, she spots
an ax.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.810
To mislead the shooter, she throws a broken
valve across the deck but runs back to the

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:47.810
front.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.090
She stops, sensing danger.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.860
Jess swings the ax at her pursuer, who attempts
to hit her with a crowbar.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.809
Jess gets the upper hand, evading the crowbar
and shoving her opponent.

00:07:57.809 --> 00:08:01.569
Jess corners her opponent, who is stammering
as she backed away from her.

00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:04.470
Jess interrogates her, realizing it's a woman.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.020
She repeatedly tells Jess that the only way
out is to "kill them."

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.139
Jess swings the ax at the woman, causing her
to fall.

00:08:11.139 --> 00:08:13.800
Jess watches the woman disappear into the
water.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.400
Relieved that it's over, Jess catches her
breath.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.219
She hears music from inside the nearby cabin
and finds a gramophone.

00:08:20.219 --> 00:08:23.479
Jess inspects her injuries when she hears
yelling from outside.

00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:29.199
On the ocean, she sees Greg's overturned yacht,
with Greg, Sally, Victor, Downey, and herself

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:30.889
alive and calling the ship.

00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:36.140
Confused, Jess backs away, bumping onto the
gramophone, which starts playing again.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.110
She hears the others, now climbing on board
the ship.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.829
She follows them into the promenade deck,
hiding behind the walls as the others look

00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:43.969
around.

00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:46.990
Jess overhears the same conversations as earlier.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:51.550
While the others are talking about Sisyphus,
Jess peeks and sees her other self look back,

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.200
nearly spotting her.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.910
At her wit's end, Jess sinks into the floor
when her keys drop from her pocket.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.380
Realizing the others heard her, Jess runs
away.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.180
She finds an empty corridor and hides.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.350
Jess continues to wander, hearing Sally yell
for Heather at the dining room.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.760
The new Jess looks back and spots her from
the mirror, just before she runs off.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.050
The original Jess runs back to the deck and
sees Downey's body in the water, feasted upon

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.420
by seagulls.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.310
Jess hears Victor coming, and she gets an
idea.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.920
When Victor sees her, Jess explains what happened
to her, telling him the one they're with is

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.420
a copy of her.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.040
She tries to show him the dead body in the
water, but it's no longer there.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.870
Jess desperately tries to convince Victor,
but he doesn't believe her.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:37.290
He tries to go away, but she pushes him while
rambling on, accidentally slamming his head

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.070
against a hook on the wall.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:42.420
Victor pulls away, bearing a wound at the
back of his head.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.540
Horrified, Jess runs away, narrowly avoiding
the new Jess and Greg.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.550
Greg's previous argument that things were
all in her mind runs through her head, driving

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.320
Jess into confusion.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.750
She ends up in the crew's locker room where
she finds papers scattered all around.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:59.490
She reads them, seeing that they all say the
same thing in her own handwriting: to kill

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.410
them all if they board the ship.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:05.600
She opens the lockers for more clues until
she finds a row of overalls, similar to what

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.240
the previous shooter was wearing.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.490
The previous shooter's ramblings play in her
mind, clearer than before.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:15.380
Jess finds a row of shotguns as the voice
repeatedly tells her to get rid of the others

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.380
to escape.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.260
She takes one of the guns, facing the mirror,
confused about what to do.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.589
Finally, she breaks down in hopelessness.

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:27.110
Something catches her eye from the grated
floor, and she picks up another locket, the

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.980
same one she is wearing.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.860
Dozens of the same locket are under the floor,
with the one around her neck snagging between

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.580
the cracks and falling into the pile.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.649
Jess has been in this exact same scenario
multiple times.

00:10:38.649 --> 00:10:41.120
Remembering her son, Jess finds the urge to
escape.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.070
She grabs a burlap sack and gathers shotgun
rounds.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:49.009
The new group continues their journey, with
Sally, Downey, and Greg heading to the theater

00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:51.310
and the injured Victor wandering around.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:55.709
Jess comes across the new Victor, who is alarmed
to see the shotgun in her hand.

00:10:55.709 --> 00:10:59.320
Jess tells him that she didn't mean to hurt
him and wants to get them out of the ship.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.649
The new Jess walks into the lounge, looking
for Sally.

00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:05.380
Jess hides while Victor meets up with the
new Jess.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.690
Breaking the pattern, the original Jess reveals
herself to the other her, confusing both the

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.570
new Victor and new Jess.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.350
She aims her gun at the new Jess, repeating
that she's not really her.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:20.190
Jess musters up the courage to shoot her own
self but can't, letting the new Jess escape.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.639
Jess turns to Victor, promising him that they
will all escape together.

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:26.220
A gunshot distracts Jess.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.000
She goes to the theater, knowing what will
happen.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.889
She pushes Sally and Downey out of the way
when the shooter fires at them.

00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:37.890
She helps the couple escape the theater, explaining
that they can escape if they change the pattern.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.790
Downey demands a better explanation, but Jess
insists on hurrying.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:45.910
She gives him the shotgun, telling them to
wait while Jess retrieves Victor.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.140
Jess comes back to the dining area, but Victor
is gone.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.790
She follows a trail of blood and sees it stop
at the edge of the deck.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.649
Victor had fallen into the water.

00:11:54.649 --> 00:11:57.170
Downey fires the gun at someone in the distance.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.360
It's the shooter with the burlap sack.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.720
She takes the mask off, revealing that she's
another Jess with blood on her face.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.580
The shooter Jess tells the couple that Victor
fell to the side of the boat.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.460
Downey asks if she pushed him.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.800
She says they can't prove if she did, but
they need to follow her to survive.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.199
The original Jess gets back inside, calling
out to Downey.

00:12:17.199 --> 00:12:21.180
Out in the deck with Downey and Sally, the
shooter Jess insists on ignoring the other

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.699
one's calls.

00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:26.569
Shooter Jess gets the couple inside a bedroom,
where she stabs them.

00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:30.010
Sally escapes, and the original Jess chases
after her.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.910
Sally doesn't stop, thinking that it was her
who stabbed them.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.420
Sally hides in the engine room, avoiding the
original Jess.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:40.329
She finds a control room and sends out a distress
call, begging for help.

00:12:40.329 --> 00:12:44.130
As Sally leaves the room, Greg's voice is
heard from the speakers.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.709
Sally's call was the one Greg and Jess heard
before the storm hit.

00:12:46.709 --> 00:12:47.709
Tracking down Sally, Jess hears Greg on the
radio.

00:12:47.709 --> 00:12:51.110
She tries to communicate with him, but the
line disconnects.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.590
Jess continues her search for Sally, who's
crying on the upper deck at the front of the

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.750
boat.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.380
Sally has crawled into where the rest of her
old selves were disposed of, horrified at

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.380
the sight.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.350
Jess carefully walks to her, but Sally is
scared.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:06.579
Jess reassures her that she's not the same
Jess that hurt her and Downey.

00:13:06.579 --> 00:13:09.100
The ruckus at the bottom deck alerts Jess.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.490
She sees the new Jess fighting the shooter
Jess before throwing the shooter off the ship.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:17.389
Jess goes back to Sally, telling her to hold
on as the yacht will come back to repeat the

00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:18.389
loop.

00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:22.259
She promises that they can escape once it
does, but Sally succumbs to her wounds and

00:13:22.259 --> 00:13:23.259
dies.

00:13:23.259 --> 00:13:27.149
When Sally dies, Jess hears the new group
calling for help.

00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:32.080
Realizing that the time repeats after everyone
dies, she starts to formulate an idea.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.649
Jess runs down the deck, seeing the overturned
yacht getting far.

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:39.339
She climbs down the engine room and tries
to stop the ship from getting too far from

00:13:39.339 --> 00:13:41.820
the yacht, but to no avail.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:46.310
Jess goes back to the deck and hears the second
Jess recount what happened to the newest Victor.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:50.410
The second Jess runs away after accidentally
wounding Victor, allowing the original one

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.680
to tell him that she can save him.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.690
She goes to the bedroom where Downey was stabbed
by the previous shooter, seeing that he lived

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.690
long enough to write her name with his blood
on the mirror.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:03.160
She changes the message, writing "go to theater"
in the mirror.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.379
Jess pushes Downey's and Greg's bodies off
the ship.

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:10.620
In the dining area, Jess tells the newest
versions of Sally and Downey to go to the

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.620
theater.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.490
Now that she has set up everything from the
first loop in motion, Jess disguises herself

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:19.190
as the new shooter, hiding her face in a burlap
sack.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:22.050
Jess follows the newest Greg to the theater's
balcony.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.649
He turns around to see her aiming the gun
at him.

00:14:24.649 --> 00:14:28.560
Greg attempts to negotiate with her, saying
that he and the rest will just leave.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.870
But Greg recognizes Jess's sandals, realizing
who she is.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:37.009
Jess reveals her plan to fulfill the conditions
of the first loop to start another one, but

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:40.740
this time, she will wait for them and prevent
them from getting on the ship.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.660
Greg promises they'll do whatever she wants,
but Jess simply apologizes and fires the gun

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.660
on him.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.079
Greg drops to the seats below, alarming Sally
and Downey.

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:54.850
Jess hides away, listening to the couple argue
with the newest Jess, who just arrived.

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.509
Jess starts firing again, fulfilling the tragedy
from earlier.

00:14:58.509 --> 00:15:02.490
Jess chases after the newest version of herself
down to the engine room.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.720
Jess reaches this third Jess at the deck and
hits her on the head.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.940
The third Jess begs for her life again, making
her hesitate.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.300
As it happened in the first loop, her hesitation
allows the third Jess to escape.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.829
Jess's shotgun jams, so she throws it at her
new self.

00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:19.959
The third Jess grabs the ax and attempts to
mislead her.

00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:23.259
The original Jess grabs the crowbar and the
two fight.

00:15:23.259 --> 00:15:27.720
The third Jess evades her attacks, disarming
and cornering her on the edge of the ship.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.840
The original Jess tells the other to kill
the next group before they get on the ship.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:36.339
The new Jess swings her ax, causing the original
Jess to fall in the water.

00:15:36.339 --> 00:15:41.009
The original Jess wakes up by the beach, the
same one she saw in her dream at the yacht.

00:15:41.009 --> 00:15:44.339
Jess looks around, trying to make sense of
what happened.

00:15:44.339 --> 00:15:47.400
Jess makes her way to her house, relieved
that she has escaped.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.980
Carefully, she looks into the window, seeing
her son painting.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.970
Her joy is halted when she hears her own voice.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.880
Hiding behind the bush, she sees another Jess
gathering clothes and a toy ship from the

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:58.980
backyard.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.399
She looks into the window again, seeing herself
yell at her son for leaving the toy.

00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:07.500
Tommy sees her from the window and accidentally
spills the paint on the floor.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:12.000
Jess cries, listening to herself slap and
yell at Tommy for making a mess.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.250
While the Jess at home cleans up the paint,
the original Jess rings the doorbell to distract

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.250
her.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.810
Jess walks around the backyard and grabs a
hammer from the shed before going into the

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:21.810
house.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:25.579
Without hesitation, Jess slams the hammer
on the new Jess's head.

00:16:25.579 --> 00:16:28.329
She turns to find that Tommy has seen the
event.

00:16:28.329 --> 00:16:32.829
She embraces her son and convinces him that
what he saw is just a bad dream.

00:16:32.829 --> 00:16:36.709
Jess puts the body in the trunk of the car,
taking the locket she lost and drives away

00:16:36.709 --> 00:16:38.060
with Tommy.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.610
Jess promises her son that she will no longer
yell at or hit him.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.529
She stops when blood splatters on the windshield.

00:16:44.529 --> 00:16:47.269
Jess checks and sees a dead seagull on the
street.

00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:51.350
She picks up the seagull to throw it away,
but she sees more dead seagulls on the shore

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:52.350
below.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:55.600
Confused, she rushes back to the car and drives
away.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.410
Tommy cries at the backseat, scared of the
blood on the windshield.

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.870
His cries distract Jess, causing her to hit
the side of a truck.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.120
The car flips and crashes.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.700
Passerbys find Jess's body that was previously
hidden in the trunk, and Tommy, dying from

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.910
his injuries.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.820
The original Jess stares blankly at the tragedy.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:16.030
A taxi driver walks up to her.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.890
He points out that nothing can be done to
bring the boy in the accident back.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.710
This gives Jess an idea.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:23.390
She tells the driver to take her to the harbor.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.190
Back at the harbor, Jess meets up with Victor.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:30.820
With her memory fading, Jess forgets who he
is, so Victor introduces himself and walks

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.150
her to the yacht.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.420
When he asks about Tommy, she tells him that
he's at school.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.280
Greg meets them by the yacht, and Jess hugs
him, apologizing.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.660
When Greg tells her she doesn't have to come,
Jess insists that she wants to go sailing,

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:54.630
hoping to start another loop where she can
be reunited with her son.
