00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.640
imagine you're attacked by vicious monsters coming&nbsp;
from the sea how would you beat them and how would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.480
you survive in this video we follow friend he's a&nbsp;
weather scientist traveling on an arctic mission&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.680
to get to a nordic island his predecessor has&nbsp;
mysteriously vanished and now it is for him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.120
to continue the research looks like his boss&nbsp;
doesn't like him very much this story plays out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.920
in 1914 so we do not have access to phones much&nbsp;
electricity and other sources of comfort this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.440
journey requires us to use different tactics when&nbsp;
our character arrives it becomes clear that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.840
is a hostile environment not only is it cold windy&nbsp;
and harsh but it also seems like his predecessor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.280
vanished in a rush the house is completely messed&nbsp;
up not only does it look uncomfortable and kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.960
of creepy but it's also protected by wooden&nbsp;
speares now that would freak me out why do we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.280
need this protection on an uninhabited island&nbsp;
it doesn't look like there are any dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.400
animals here the only thing you may find are&nbsp;
fat seals which if we're honest are hardly a

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:17.120
threat furthermore the inside is completely&nbsp;
messed up why if there is nobody living here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.840
and there aren't any large animals how is it&nbsp;
possible that this house looks like it was raided&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.720
if this was me i would seriously reconsider this&nbsp;
mission in the first half an hour on this island&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.880
i mean once our crew sails off we are completely&nbsp;
on our own we also hear that this island is far&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.240
off any commercial routes which means that once&nbsp;
they are gone there won't be any new ships passing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.480
by meaning for 12 months that's the length of our&nbsp;
character's contract we are completely stuck here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.120
the red flags are there but for now let's see&nbsp;
what we find on this island the captain always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.480
treated me with the courtesy of an executioner&nbsp;
we find two important things the good thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.600
first they come by a freshwater fountain the bad&nbsp;
thing it seems to be owned by a guy named Gruner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.240
at least that's what the carvings next to it say&nbsp;
when they arrive at the lighthouse it becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.720
absolutely and 100% clear that there is something&nbsp;
very strange going on this lighthouse looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.000
like a fortress every opening is fitted with&nbsp;
piercing spears stopping anyone from entering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.120
not just the fundament is secured like that&nbsp;
but every single window from bottom to top&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.000
that is red flag numero dos the man&nbsp;
they look for runs the lighthouse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.840
pretty much the only other soul on this&nbsp;
island his name is Gruner there you go

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.960
not very inviting this Gruner but we can't blame&nbsp;
him okay he doesn't look like he's able to develop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.680
social skills up here but anyway none of our&nbsp;
characters ask him about the insane amount&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.840
of protection on this lighthouse why not that's&nbsp;
literally the most important thing to ask plus it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.200
is a very straightforward question but they don't&nbsp;
and the captain and his crew are about to leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.440
which is a problem because that means we need&nbsp;
to decide if we want to stay or leave you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.400
declining the offer to leave this island with them&nbsp;
is one thing but arrogantly denying the gun that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.680
is being handed to you as a means to protect&nbsp;
yourself is foolish and stupid this was a bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.640
decision if this was me i would have not accepted&nbsp;
the gun i would have packed my bags and joined the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.400
crew without hesitation or regrets no research&nbsp;
would convince me to stay up here for 12 months&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.120
living next by a hostile neighbor who designed&nbsp;
his home like a fortress to evade the dark forces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.080
of the sea no chance when nighttime arrives&nbsp;
our character goes through the records of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.280
his predecessor skimming through the pages he&nbsp;
arrives at a drawing of a human eating monster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.800
coming from the sea by now leaving this island&nbsp;
is not an option anymore that is impossible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.480
unless we can spot a ship off coast so coming&nbsp;
up with an emergency strategy is the way to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.760
how can i exit this house are there any good&nbsp;
hideouts in here maybe a double floor or something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.120
similar just knowing about any of these things&nbsp;
would ease me up quite a bit but our character&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.720
doesn't bother nope he ignores all these very&nbsp;
strange facts and just goes about his day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.600
bad things are about to come on the next day&nbsp;
he looks around his new home that's a good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.280
thing nothing important happens though until he is&nbsp;
spying out his only neighbor with his binoculars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.240
but he just spots the naked men and join&nbsp;
his freedom nothing special until he also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.360
spots a weird creature behind him at second glance&nbsp;
though it's gone and he the rational man as he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.600
brushes it off as nothing important again alright&nbsp;
at this point things are getting really strange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.400
if this guy knows something that you don't know&nbsp;
then you either confront him directly or at least&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.040
stay vigilant when the second night arrives&nbsp;
our character hears is a rumble on the outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.440
mind you this island is free of any living&nbsp;
beings if you heard such sounds late at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.000
night in a place like this you better&nbsp;
brace yourself friend gets up to check

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.640
let's be honest here how creepy can a monster with&nbsp;
duck feet really be well i guess we will find out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.920
stomping on it though wasn't the best idea i&nbsp;
reckon the grunting from the outside gets louder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.960
if you want to survive this&nbsp;
night then you better hide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.760
at this moment we have no idea what is actually&nbsp;
happening so hiding and staying low key&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.840
is the way to go friend turns around opens a trap&nbsp;
door and hides inside meanwhile the monsters have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.960
entered the building he uses a rope to stop the&nbsp;
trapdoor from being able to open which is a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.080
smart move in all honesty this small hideout&nbsp;
here would become my best friend very quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.200
but for some reason he decides to peek through a&nbsp;
small slit and we get the shock of our lifetime

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.440
in the next morning when he leaves his hideout&nbsp;
he finds his home messed up and pretty much in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.440
the same state as it was when he first came now&nbsp;
we know why he does the obvious and walks over to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.960
the only person that might know what is going on&nbsp;
but groener being the [ __ ] that he is declines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.160
any sort of interaction that's a death sentence&nbsp;
if there are monster is looking out for us at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.040
night then we must find out who they are and&nbsp;
what they want most importantly though we must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.800
figure out their weakness this is survival and we&nbsp;
need a plan friend returns and prepares for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.840
upcoming night he cuts spares before he calls his&nbsp;
home with wooden boards and tries to shield off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.800
any of the incoming monsters with a pretty&nbsp;
pathetic construction he also finds a rifle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.680
at least if i were him i would take this rifle&nbsp;
and walk over to the lighthouse and make myself a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.040
guest without discussion i would rather die by the&nbsp;
hand of a man than being teared apart by monsters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:47.360
with duck feet however friend doesn't okay he&nbsp;
stays back in his hut and i find this a bad idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.760
if you decide to stay back putting on a better&nbsp;
boric collar then those few lousy and dry wooden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.960
boards would have been better this wouldn't keep&nbsp;
a child out that is determined to enter my friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.640
the safest place though is arguably the secret&nbsp;
room underneath the trap door the question though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:09.120
is can these monsters remember if yes then they&nbsp;
will know where you will hide there is no way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.840
i would stay in here i would either find myself a&nbsp;
cave somewhere on the other side of the island or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.000
seek review which inside the lighthouse no&nbsp;
matter what this old man thinks about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.880
one thing is clear though if we want to figure&nbsp;
out a solution we must survive this night first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.880
friend braces himself waiting anxiously inside&nbsp;
this hut like me and cod zombie mode level 42&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:35.120
no speed cola and no juggernaut my friends okay&nbsp;
this situation is hardcore we got a rifle with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.400
limited ammunition and that's pretty much it&nbsp;
during his preparations during daytime he also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.920
poured fuel over dry wood around the house&nbsp;
just in case i mean fair enough but dude i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:57.840
don't think this will end well is this enough&nbsp;
to survive this night well let's have a look

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.440
what a bad idea to stay in here not sure what he&nbsp;
thought about it but it sure as hell wasn't enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.480
facing dozens of them at once is impossible to&nbsp;
survive he is visibly struggling and is about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:16.160
to give up but then he remembers his emergency&nbsp;
plan lights up a torch opens the door and throws&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.840
it at the circle of fuel the interesting thing is&nbsp;
the monsters run away proving that the fire is an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.720
effective way to shield them off if we have&nbsp;
the resources to light up sustainable fires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:32.320
every night we should be very secure that&nbsp;
is as long as the resources allow of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:39.840
friend takes a chance and runs out to&nbsp;
hide behind a rock it can get worse

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:48.160
uh i'm sorry the next day he returns but finds&nbsp;
everything burned to ash not just that but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:54.800
realization that he's strikes too how do you&nbsp;
survive these nights for 12 months straight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.440
well you don't but if you do want to have a&nbsp;
chance teaming up with your angry neighbor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:05.280
might be the only chance you have of course that&nbsp;
is until a boat passes by because there is no way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:11.200
i would spend more time here than necessary also&nbsp;
always keep one bullet safe just in case you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:22.240
as he tries to confront gruner at the nearby&nbsp;
fountain something very unexpected happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:29.200
our neighbor seems to have a pet monster how&nbsp;
sweet i guess this is what pokemon was in 1914.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.760
now her character almost shoots her down which&nbsp;
is understandable i mean imagine you are attacked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.960
by a giant yellow rat trying to fry you with a&nbsp;
million volt lightnings you would shoot that thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:45.040
down too huh but Gruner interferes it looks like&nbsp;
he is emotionally attached and so our character&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.080
uses this opportunity and blackmails him into&nbsp;
giving him provisions and a sleeping place inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.520
the lighthouse thumbs up for that a short while&nbsp;
later they move what's left from our character's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:02.160
cabin over to the lighthouse and there we find&nbsp;
out more of what's actually going on in short&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:08.240
there is no revelation Gruner tells us that they&nbsp;
are attacked every night and we need to stay alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.640
having the lighthouse available is strategically&nbsp;
a great thing by the way we also have a generous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.680
amount of ammunition left and we do have the&nbsp;
light of the lighthouse however i would first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.520
consider why they attack could it be that they&nbsp;
just want her back i mean she doesn't look like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:29.200
a hostage but we can't deny the possibility this&nbsp;
Gruner doesn't appear to be a very legit guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.640
what do you think it is also important that they&nbsp;
only attack at night and they do not like fire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.440
meaning there is a good chance that they don't&nbsp;
like heat if that's the case then all you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:45.840
is metal plates and fire to shield them off&nbsp;
successfully but for now let's begin the game

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:57.600
now basically it's shooting down as many monsters&nbsp;
as you possibly can until sunrise and then repeat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:03.760
this every other night forever this kind of sucks&nbsp;
if you ask me and friend two has his issues with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.800
that he's basically frozen in terror not knowing&nbsp;
what to do he stands around and looks stupefied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:14.320
into the distance as if he had a math class at&nbsp;
8 am if you ask me i will do everything i can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:20.400
every single day to get away from this island from&nbsp;
here on out even if it means drowning at sea what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:25.760
would you do i'm very curious to hear your plan&nbsp;
it goes without saying that gruner isn't pleased&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:31.840
about friends reaction of last night we can't&nbsp;
blame him but what he pulls off is quite insane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:37.120
the next night when they brace themselves again&nbsp;
gruner turns around leaves the balcony and shuts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:43.600
our character out jesus but if only this is&nbsp;
necessary to remain safe inside then why bother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.800
fighting why not pull that lever every night&nbsp;
and vibe inside to the menacing sound of flesh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.640
eating duck feet monsters i don't know when dawn&nbsp;
breaks though when gruner opens the window again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:02.160
he finds our character covered in blood but&nbsp;
still alive thanks for the ptsd you see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.680
lighthouse looks very secure i would establish a&nbsp;
more secure barrier covering the windows and doors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:13.920
with the collected trash from alongside the shore&nbsp;
as long as we don't step outside we should be good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.960
sort of like dr neville and i am legend another&nbsp;
thing to notice is that the lighthouse light&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.920
itself may attract these monsters it isn't&nbsp;
entirely clear in one scene before we have seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:29.680
the pet monster gazing savagely into the light&nbsp;
logically speaking if it's pitch dark and quiet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:35.120
how would any of these monsters know that you are&nbsp;
there our characters though don't do any of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:41.280
nope what they do is they repeat the fighting&nbsp;
for many days to come with no end in sight what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:47.280
is worse than being stuck on an island haunted by&nbsp;
nocturnal sea creatures well falling in love with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:54.640
them of course jesus christ friend please this&nbsp;
is not necessary okay let's keep things simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.200
look i have no problems with interracial&nbsp;
relationships but this is a little strange okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.800
but i guess that's what solitude does to you maybe&nbsp;
something good will come of it i guess we will see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:10.720
at home gruner and our characters start to deepen&nbsp;
their relationship as well they play chess that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:16.960
what i mean and their pet mob is being a pet mob&nbsp;
suddenly gruner jumps up grabs his gun and shoots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.680
down one of the monsters almost entering the&nbsp;
lighthouse they have forgotten to prepare for this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.800
night they struggle through the attack there are&nbsp;
just too many of the monsters having to fight with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:32.000
fists and kicks to avoid death Gruner eventually&nbsp;
is harmed when climbing off the ladder at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.360
same time the light goes out as well perfect&nbsp;
timing causing both of them to be stuck up there

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:47.200
well gruner starts to sing and for some reason&nbsp;
that i have not yet figured out and probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:54.480
never will a minute later the sun rises and so&nbsp;
we conclude that Gruner is either a magician or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:00.880
a funny dude in any way they survive the night and&nbsp;
for the next few days the monsters do not attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:06.720
implying that it is not the light nor the pet that&nbsp;
attracts them during those days friend continues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.920
searching the island through her by the way&nbsp;
that he from now on calls Aneris he finds a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:17.440
boat thrilled about it he goes back to tell gruner&nbsp;
about it who replies that he knew about it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.720
that it belonged to Portuguese dynamite smugglers&nbsp;
that suffered a shipwreck being the quick-witted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.760
guided friend is he concludes that if they can&nbsp;
recover the dynamite from the bottom of the sea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:33.200
they might be able to exterminate these monsters&nbsp;
with just one blow Gruner first declines but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:38.720
eventually changes his mind secretly hoping that&nbsp;
friend dies so that he gets back his solitude&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:46.080
and his island never trust a dodgy old man owning&nbsp;
a pet monster unless it is professor oak of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:51.280
with their vintage dive set they leave and hope&nbsp;
to recover the dynamite as friend arrives at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:56.000
the bottom of the sea looking like big daddy&nbsp;
himself he looks out for the dynamite caskets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.960
he eventually finds them hooks them up pulls&nbsp;
the rope and Gruner recovers them at sea level&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.880
at the same time though friend is&nbsp;
surprised by aquatic monster kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:10.160
having a blast around him he loses balance and&nbsp;
falls not a situation you want to be stuck in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:16.640
for sure this is terrifying however having seen&nbsp;
these kids playing just like human kids strucks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:22.080
him being the soft and kind-hearted guy that&nbsp;
he is he ponders about the war between them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:27.360
what is the reason for this pointless bloodshed&nbsp;
now these are very noble thoughts and i thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:32.560
we might get a plot twist here but the&nbsp;
thrill of dynamite seems to be too strong

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.160
they continue by laying out the bombs though and&nbsp;
planned the detonation ahead the only problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.880
no monsters have attacked for over three&nbsp;
weeks which suggests that these monsters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.760
do have a great sense of humor i like that&nbsp;
as the days pass gruner loses patience he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:57.360
convinces his friend to lure them out for that our&nbsp;
character has to position himself at the main door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.320
while Gruner is at the top waiting to&nbsp;
activate the wire but no monsters attack

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:13.520
now perplexed by this Gruner forces Aneris to sing&nbsp;
as she starts we understand that she wasn't gazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.800
savagely at the light before but just howling&nbsp;
with her peers now our main character though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:24.160
doesn't like this at all for him treating this&nbsp;
being with that level of disgrace is shameful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.840
he is visibly against it but what in god's name&nbsp;
can you do about it this is survival if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:35.120
want to be teared apart like your predecessors&nbsp;
then you need to do what you need to do there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:41.440
is no place for compassion in here at least not at&nbsp;
this moment now as friend loses focus for a second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.800
a monster appears and jumps him this is the first&nbsp;
time we can see one up front apart from Aneris&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.880
now they're physically much stronger and&nbsp;
faster than humans just with a great deal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:56.000
of luck he is able to survive and escape now&nbsp;
the situation grows hectic by now hundreds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.960
of these creatures are storming the lighthouse&nbsp;
when gruner activates the bomb it malfunctions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:06.640
of course it does however friend comes for rescue&nbsp;
and reconnects the wires and then it's showtime

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.520
their plan was a success they almost killed&nbsp;
themselves though but let's ignore that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:20.080
in daylight the battlefield looks even more&nbsp;
horrifying hundreds of dead creatures plaster the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:25.680
ground some of them still alive now friend almost&nbsp;
can't take it much other than gruner who almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.560
joyfully walks around and frees them from their&nbsp;
suffering the following night the great wailing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.280
atones from the sea the creatures mourn for their&nbsp;
loss and friend knows that what happened was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:40.880
tragedy Aneris disappeared as well apparently&nbsp;
Gruner found her as a baby years ago trapped in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:46.400
a fishing net he freed her but believed that she&nbsp;
now owed him her life which obviously is complete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:52.480
nonsense it becomes clear that the real monster&nbsp;
here is him on the next day feeling exhausted sad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:57.600
and horrible about the event of last night friend&nbsp;
decides to create an offering on the beach it's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:04.080
sign of peace and truth i think at this point even&nbsp;
if a boat passes could you go back to normalty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:09.280
just like that the next day the creatures&nbsp;
come to accept the peace but uh doesn't happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:16.880
i see you king of ___ Gruner jumps in between&nbsp;
and threatens to continue the murders he screams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.440
at Aneris who has now joined us well that no&nbsp;
one is allowed to leave him showing that most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:27.520
likely it was him who was the problem all along&nbsp;
who knew now gruner returns home and just as we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.480
believe things may turn out well he shoots&nbsp;
down the child from afar causing the truce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:38.160
and peace to be completely shattered all this for&nbsp;
nothing every struggle and every death pointless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:44.080
yet bound to cycle forward our character rushes&nbsp;
back home and confronts gruner about his actions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:49.520
a fight breaks out and we get one last big&nbsp;
revelation friend reveals that gruner was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.240
the weather scientist that was believed to be&nbsp;
dead and that he was bound to replace being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:59.760
reminded of that truth gruner understands&nbsp;
his misery turns around steps outside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:05.360
lighthouse and is being teared apart by the&nbsp;
monsters and as of that moment friend himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:11.120
is taking his place and continues to struggle on&nbsp;
this island without sharing anything with anyone

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.640
damn what a strange but kind of beautiful&nbsp;
movie there were multiple ways to survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.120
this but in the end only peace could&nbsp;
have truly led to a lasting change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.600
how would have you survived these encounters are&nbsp;
you more the Friend type of person or more the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:35.600
Gruner sort of person let me know and as always&nbsp;
binge another one thanks for watching peace
