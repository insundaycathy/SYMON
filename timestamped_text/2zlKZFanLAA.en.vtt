00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.920
Welcome to the breakdown where we breakdown&nbsp;all the messed-up movies, and anime. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.360
I know you're here, first, notification gang.&nbsp;
All that matters is that you re here to join us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.224
in watching our next Anime series. Easily a lot&nbsp;
better overall than Pupa. We have Another You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.224 --> 00:00:27.600
ve seen Another before. You ve seen a teacher&nbsp;
kill himself by stabbing himself in the neck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.320
Another is about Koichi Sakakibara who transfers&nbsp;
to Yomiyama Middle School. It doesn t take long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.240
for this big city kid to realize that something&nbsp;
weird is going on with his class and this girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.480
Mei Misaki is at the center of it all. Now Spooky&nbsp;
has partnered up with Shudder for today s video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.480 --> 00:02:45.680
so listen up! This anime is 12 episodes long + 1&nbsp;
OVA. Each episode is 25 minutes long which means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.800
4 episodes is about 100 minutes or an hour and 40&nbsp;
minutes. That s longer than most movies we talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.240
about so we will do 4 episodes at a time. Don t&nbsp;
worry, I m not gonna do 4 episodes today and 4&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.640
episodes a month later. It will all be finished&nbsp;
within the next weeks. Of course, this anime is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.760
easily on Crunchyroll so if you just want to watch&nbsp;
it yourself go right ahead. If you wanna see what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.840
happens, including all the messed-up parts,&nbsp;
stay tuned for the breakdown cue the Gohan!
&nbsp;

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.800
Another! This is not one of my&nbsp;
favorite openings I m not going to lie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.440
As soon as the story starts, you already&nbsp;
know about the legend of Class 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.200
We will introduce it shortly. Koichi is in the&nbsp;
hospital right before transferring to school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.640
He has a lung condition that runs in&nbsp;
the family, collapsed lung. Mom is dead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.920
father is doing some Nathan Drake type shit&nbsp;
in India. Right across in the next room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.320
Son Gohan and Son Goku are resting after their&nbsp;
bout with the Saiyans. Soon, the officers of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:01.360
class 3 visit. Akazawa, Kazami, Sakuragi.&nbsp;
I m sure you won t remember those names. 
&nbsp;

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.320
They keep sweating our homeboy about where he&nbsp;
is from. They are worse than some gang members.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.640
Keep asking if he is really from&nbsp;
Yomiyama even though he is from Tokyo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.000
where the bad bitches are. They also ask&nbsp;
to call him by his first name Koichi, even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.440
though usually people call each other by their&nbsp;
family names in Japan, you all just met today.
&nbsp;

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.120
Later that night, Koichi is on the way downstairs&nbsp;
when he encounters this doll girl. Mei Misaki.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.920
She says she has to deliver something to her Poor&nbsp;
other half . Ignoring any question directed to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.840
except to say her name is Mei. She is&nbsp;
getting bored, taking a trip to the morgue.
&nbsp;

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.360
On the first day of school, introductions out of&nbsp;
the way. The teacher sounds like he wants to steal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.040
Sharingans. First day of school, people talk&nbsp;
to Koichi like he just transferred from UA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:01.040
Really everybody wants to hear about Tokyo, that&nbsp;
s why everybody asks questions. There go Genocide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:09.680
Jack. Suddenly Koichi wonders where Mei Misaki is.&nbsp;
The other kids change the subject really quick.
&nbsp;

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.960
When Koichi asks Sakuragi where Mei is, she almost&nbsp;
activates her Rinnegan. Compelled to give a fuck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.760
he goes all the way up to the roof seeing Mei&nbsp;
there, drawing something. She doesn t even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:31.760
remember you bro then announces his whole name.&nbsp;
She warns him that his classmates are starting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:39.120
to associate him with death. Death being the&nbsp;
cruel curse affecting his entire class. Class 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.120
Mei says he should start avoiding her,&nbsp;
because if you pay too much attention to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:52.160
Bad things will happen. He s like Who are&nbsp;
you . She s like You don t wanna know Mista,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.920
I m trouble..big trouble 
Episode 2
&nbsp;

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:02.800
Beautiful Flowers, Beautiful day. Mei sits in the&nbsp;
shadows before Koichi visits failing to light her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.120
up. Again she warns him to keep his distance,&nbsp;
but since he won t IT will begin! What is IT?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:19.440
Later, Jock Boy lets loose that Class 3 is&nbsp;
cursed. Cursed is an understatement since Koichi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.560
wont stop trying to talk to Misaki. Chibiki the&nbsp;
librarian tells him only to go to class, showing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:33.120
exactly that everybody is ignoring Misaki like&nbsp;
she doesn t exist at all. Misaki is built for it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.400
but that s insecurity brewing right there. 
Koichi has a check up at the hospital when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.800
nurse who tended to him talks with him. They are&nbsp;
good reading buddies. He asks her if a girl died&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.800
last week. The person that Mei was visiting all&nbsp;
the way to the morgue. She starkly remembers that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.960
maybe a girl did die last Monday. It ll take some&nbsp;
time to see who it is though. Next day at school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:04.640
the lesson is about haikus. Akazawa looks t&nbsp;
Kochi hard as hell when he keeps sweating Misaki.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.600
She kinda looks like that girl&nbsp;
with that literature club. 
&nbsp;

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.280
Koichi isn t falling in line like he should,&nbsp;
and even stalks Mei Misaki walking around.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.120
After school she retires to a random&nbsp;
building filled with dolls and models. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.960
the nurse calls him saying that a middle&nbsp;
school girl died, and her name was Misaki. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:33.360
we re led to think Mei Misaki is a ghost kind of&nbsp;
but that s not the case. One of these dolls looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.720
kinda like her too! Misaki randomly pops&nbsp;
up to agree that the doll looks like her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.840
except its missing the eyepatch. She offers&nbsp;
to show him what s under her eyepatch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.400
smiling as she takes it off.
Episode 3
&nbsp;

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:55.440
Misaki is taking that hoe off, and its just&nbsp;
another EYE! A green artificial doll eye that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:01.600
of course allows her to see things others cannot.&nbsp;
Misaki tells Koichi to get out of here before the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:08.640
dolls fill their emptiness with Koichi s soul.&nbsp;
Upstairs, she tells him about the story of class 3&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:14.880
twenty-six years ago. Class 3 is the&nbsp;
class Misaki and Koichi are in now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:22.640
26 years ago, a popular girl who was named&nbsp;
Misaki died shortly after 9th grade started.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.400
Many rumors exist as to how she died, but&nbsp;
everybody was shocked and overcome with grief&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:37.760
Until someone someday just decided to walk up to&nbsp;
her old desk, look at it and say: She isn t dead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:44.560
Misaki is right here ! Despite literally&nbsp;
being dead, this Misaki girl from 26 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:51.440
ago was suddenly said to exist and everybody&nbsp;
started believing it Even though she is dead.
&nbsp;

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.640
It s a weird way to deal with death...It s like&nbsp;
everybody had the same grief and the same remedy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:15.360
to deal with it, by pretending she was alive. Even&nbsp;
the principal and teachers fell into that role by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:21.120
including her desk in the graduation ceremony.&nbsp;
When they took a class picture, that girl was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:28.400
in the picture, Pale like a ghost and smiling.
Anyway, midterms coming up soon. Its 1998 when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:34.000
this story takes place. At the end of school,&nbsp;
Sakuragi asks Koichi if he wants to walk home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.240
with her. Just say yes dude and go with her You&nbsp;
re gonna walk home anyway. This scene feels like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:46.080
a prophecy! Koichi asks about Misaki, but&nbsp;
you re not supposed to acknowledge Misaki.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:52.560
Finally, someone tells him straight up.
For some reason Misaki is not supposed to exist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:58.000
even though she clearly does, or people wouldn t&nbsp;
be sweating Koichi to not talk to her. Later that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.480
night, Koichi finds out that a girl named Misaki&nbsp;
Fujioka died in the hospital. Must be someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:11.280
related to Mei. We will hear more about her in the&nbsp;
next 4 episodes, I guess. Soon its finals week,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.800
and Koichi s smart ass being done early lets&nbsp;
him hang with the girl who does not exist. 
&nbsp;

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.080
I m wondering how everyone knows not to see you&nbsp;
or act like you exist. Its like its one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:28.080
first things you learn in this town. Sakuragi&nbsp;
gets notified of something and has to run out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.960
She rushes with her pointed umbrella but stands&nbsp;
shocked to see Koichi with the girl who doesn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:42.400
t exist. She runs down the stairs slips one step&nbsp;
and drops her umbrella. She falls down tumbling,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:50.320
eventually landing straight on the pointed tip and&nbsp;
dying a gruesome, bloody, and painful death. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.440
can hear her gurgling as she finally expires.
Episode 4
&nbsp;

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:01.840
In case you forgot, here is a replay of her dying.&nbsp;
And guess what, her mother died the same day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.480
Koichi was scarred to see it, but it&nbsp;
did not affect him that much later on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.920
Everybody is ordered to not talk about it, and&nbsp;
the curse gets rumors brewing that its best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:26.480
to stay away from Class 3. On June 2nd, Koichi&nbsp;
meets up with the nurse who tended to him. Its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:33.200
like they best friends now. Basically, they become&nbsp;
investigative partners for this episode at least.
&nbsp;

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.600
Now these four episodes love to hammer in the&nbsp;
same information in your head. Yes, I know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:45.680
Misaki doesn t exist. I know the main portion&nbsp;
of what happened 26 years ago. At this point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.960
I m just trying to see who is going to die and how&nbsp;
until y all get ready to tell me the whole story.
&nbsp;

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:58.560
Koichi walks home. Who is this? I don t remember&nbsp;
this girl at all but of course she is in the class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:05.920
right? She s funny! Suddenly, a gust of wind blows&nbsp;
over a glass panel almost landing on them both,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:13.120
until Koichi saves the day. That goofy happy&nbsp;
go lucky personality switches to pure dread&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:18.880
realizing how close she came to death. 
Koichi has a sister. She was in the hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:27.520
of course. She was in class 3 too, fifteen&nbsp;
years ago. She s a lot older than I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:34.640
She is plagued by fatigue and headaches ever since&nbsp;
Koichi started hanging with Mei. On June 3rd,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.720
Koichi is the focus of the class.&nbsp;
They are scared of him because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:45.600
whoever is around him dies. And he is ignoring&nbsp;
the unwritten rule of ignoring Mei Misaki.
&nbsp;

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.480
I wish Koichi got the breakdown on the cursed&nbsp;
classroom like y all did. Its like the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:56.240
thing they learn when they get out of the womb is&nbsp;
that class 3 is cursed, ignore Mei Misaki. Anyway,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.600
Koichi starting to get mad that his homes ignore&nbsp;
him now. At least he aint walking around like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:10.800
Why are they doing that . The nurse soon calls him&nbsp;
wanting to talk about Mei. She doubts she really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:16.000
exists, but we know she does and everybody&nbsp;
else knows too. Get back to work ma am. 
&nbsp;

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.920
She gets back on the elevator to return to&nbsp;
her shift, but then the elevator breaks apart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:28.893
Literally malfunctioning making the entire&nbsp;
elevator fall to the ground floor! The nurse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.893 --> 00:13:35.680
s last moments are fear as the elevator crashes&nbsp;
into the ground, killing her instantly as her head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:45.920
hits the floor. Even if that didn t kill her, the&nbsp;
elevator breaking around her would have. Well I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:52.240
kinda liked her Koichi knows something went bad!
And that s it for the first four episodes of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:58.560
Another. I hope you guys are enjoying this! Much&nbsp;
better than Pupa s entire existence. It ll get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:04.560
dark in the next 4 episodes, and I promise you ll&nbsp;
see those next week! Come on you can t lie and say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:10.080
that watching anime aint cool! Let s talk about&nbsp;
the most disturbed moment and most enjoyed moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:17.920
in that Spooky stuff! Cue the Gohan!
So I would say that the most disturbed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:24.480
moment is easily Sakuragi s death! I thought&nbsp;
Id feel bad but I really don t. I sound like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:30.080
a sick fuck but I don t really care that you&nbsp;
died! Oh no! I m becoming Despair! The death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:35.920
of the nurse was sad though, I kinda liked her. 
Most enjoyed moment is probably the doll studio.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.320
I personally liked how they were drawn.&nbsp;
I liked the aura of the place too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:46.320
Nah I m just bullshittin! I kinda like this main&nbsp;
character. He kinda cool! He s not stupid either,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:52.816
asking obvious questions. Mei is pretty cool too&nbsp;
but she is almost a clich at this point. And that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.816 --> 00:14:58.080
s it! Hope you guys enjoyed this video and I d&nbsp;
love if you could check out pupa and corpse party!&nbsp;&nbsp;
