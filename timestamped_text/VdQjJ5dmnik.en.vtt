00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.600
Sex Education follows Otis Milburn and the
other students at Moordale Secondary School.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.493
Otis has a few hangups when it comes to sex,
due to his single mother Jean being a very

00:00:10.493 --> 00:00:12.330
open and free-spirited sex therapist AND having
witnessed his father cheat on his mother as

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.330
a young boy.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.590
Otis’ best friend is Eric, the gay son of
a religious Ghanian-Nigerian family.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.350
Otis’ crush is Maeve Wiley, an intelligent
outcast whose rough family life leads to self-destructive

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.350
tendencies.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.390
There’s also Jackson Marchetti, the headboy
at Moordale who struggles to just be a kid

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.630
amidst the lofty expectations placed on him
by his parents.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.880
Adam Groff is the headmaster’s son who bullies
the other students due to his own insecurities

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.550
and the extreme pressures of his father.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.790
Aimee Gibbs is member of the popular mean
girls clique “The Untouchables”, but secretly

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.510
she’s best friends with Maeve and a people
pleaser to the point of it being a detriment

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.510
to herself.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.180
Other members of the Untouchables include
Ruby, Olivia, and Anwar, the only other openly

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.330
gay guy at Moordale, and the crush of Eric.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.960
And then there’s Lily, an eccentric writer
of alien erotica who desperately wants to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.960
lose her virginity.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.570
Throughout season 1, Otis develops a crush
on Maeve and the two decide to start a sex

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.950
therapy clinic to help the various sex and
relationship problems of the students at Moordale.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.360
Otis is using knowledge he’s picked up over
the years from his sex therapist mother, while

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.710
Maeve is running the business side of things,
needing the money to help pay her rent as

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.219
her parents and older brother are absent from
her life.

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:11.679
The clinic ends up becoming a huge success,
and Otis helps many students along the way.

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.030
He teaches Aimee to be her own person and
to pursue and communicate her own thoughts

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.179
and feelings instead of living for others.

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:20.960
This eventually leads to Aimee breaking up
with her Untouchables friend group and publicly

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.960
siding with Maeve.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.310
She also breaks up with her bully of a boyfriend
Adam and eventually ends up with nice guy

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.310
Steve.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.920
He also helps Lily come to terms with both
her obsession and internal anxieties over

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.920
losing her virginity.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.350
But Otis’ preoccupation with his new side
hustle and his developing feelings for Maeve

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.350
create tension in his relationship with best
friend Eric.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.789
Throughout the season, Eric finds confidence
and comfort in himself, reconnecting with

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.640
his family’s religious beliefs, realizing
the love and support of his father, confidently

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.039
displaying his true self to the school, and
even striking up a relationship with the repressed

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.039
bully Adam.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.770
That relationship is short-lived, as the perpetual
screw-up Adam is shipped off to military school

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.770
by his father.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.740
Jackson strikes up a relationship with Maeve,
thanks in large part to some unwitting advice

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.909
from Otis, and it’s a huge breakthrough
for Jackson in simply allowing himself to

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:57.909
be a teenager.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.299
Instead of living his life revolved around
swim meets and practices, he can party and

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.299
experience young love.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.689
Unfortunately, try as she might, Maeve doesn’t
reciprocate those feelings and by the end

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.799
of the season her and Jackson break up.

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.290
Maeve spent the season trying to better herself
and refocus on her academics.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.290
Her writing skills could earn her university
scholarships, and an essay she wrote for Adam

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.290
even ends up winning an award.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.290
But those newfound successes could all come
grinding to a halt when her troublemaking

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.290
brother returns home.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.290
After he’s caught selling drugs at the school
dance, Headmaster Groff believes that Maeve

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.130
and Otis’ clinic is actually a drug ring
and moves to have Maeve expelled.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.230
Otis, meanwhile, is finally reckoning with
his relationship with his mother.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.849
After discovering she’s begun work on her
next book, focused on his sexual frustrations,

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.860
Otis confronts his mother and the two seem
to genuinely reconcile.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.120
As season one comes to a close, Maeve, fresh
off her break-up with Jackson, finally realizes

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.590
her true romantic feelings for Otis and goes
to tell him.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.489
Unbeknownst to her, Otis has finally moved
on from Maeve and started a relationship with

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.489
new girl Ola.

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.180
And unbeknownst to Otis and Ola, their parents,
Jean and Jakob, have started up a relationship

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.909
of their own, creating a VERY messy situation.

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.500
Annnnnnnd speaking of messy situations, as
season one comes to a close and Otis experiences

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.010
his first kiss from Ola, he’s finally able
to get past all of his sexual hangups and

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.150
masterbate for the first time.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.459
Season 2 of Sex Education finds our favorite
characters in a whole assortment of new positions.

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.439
Otis and Ola’s burgeoning relationship is
still going strong, but the revelation that

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.160
their parents Jean and Jakob are also dating
creates a new rift between Otis and Jakob

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.340
AND Otis and his mother which is only intensified
when a chlamydia outbreak at Moordale forces

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.409
Headmaster Groff to bring on Jean as the school’s
new sex ed teacher.

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.110
Maeve has been expelled from Moordale, but
with the help of English teacher Miss Sands,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.390
she’s able to convince Headmaster Groff
to let her return.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.780
Back at Moordale, Maeve and Otis restart their
sex clinic, but having Jean at the school

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.450
offering free AND professional advice to the
students puts a bit of a damper on their business.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.580
And the close friendship and business partnership
of Maeve and Otis creates tension in Otis’

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.580
relationship with Ola.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.219
Eric is still buzzing over his brief fling
with Adam Groff, which was cut short after

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:31.739
Adam was sent off to military school.

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.306
A new French student named Rahim arrives at
Moordale and the entire school takes an interest

00:03:33.306 --> 00:03:34.306
in him.

00:03:34.306 --> 00:03:37.209
But Rahim only has eyes for Eric and the two
enter into a relationship.

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.870
That relationship is complicated when Adam
is kicked out of military school after drugs

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.400
are planted in his bunk and he takes a job
working at a shop under Rahim’s apartment.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.920
Eric becomes caught between being in a comfortable
relationship with Rahim that allows him to

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.610
be confident and out in public, and exploring
a relationship with Adam who is more repressed

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.810
and closeted due to his father’s oppressive
rules.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.040
Aimee has now fully removed herself from the
Untouchables clique and is now trying to discover

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.250
herself and what her own aspirations are.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.749
Unfortunately, after being sexually assaulted
on her bus to school, Aimee spends the season

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:02.749
grappling with the trauma.

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:06.810
Eventually, she finds a support system in
the other girls at Moordale and is finally

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.129
able to overcome her fear of riding the bus.

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.390
By the end of the season, the support of her
friends and her boyfriend Steve have helped

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.390
her healthily cope with the trauma.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.390
Jackson Marchetti is still heartbroken over
his breakup with Maeve AND still anxious about

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.390
being the swim star his mothers pressure him
to be.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.390
He ends up purposefully breaking his hand
and frames it as an accident to use as an

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.390
excuse to get a break from swimming.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.390
In turn, he’s now faced with an uncertain
future of what his life looks like without

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.390
swimming in it.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.390
Forced to put in more efforts in academics,
he starts being tutored by fellow student

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.390
Viv.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.390
He helps Viv with relationship advice on how
to get her crush Dex to notice her, while

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.390
she helps Jackson pursue his new interest
in acting, landing the lead role of Romeo

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.390
in a school play.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.390
Eventually, Viv discovers the secret that
Jackson purposefully broke his hand and, concerned

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.390
for his well being, tells Jackson’s mothers.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.390
Although Jackson is at first angry at Viv
for this decision, he starts going to therapy

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.390
and finally confesses his true feelings to
his mothers about the extreme pressure he

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.390
feels they place on him when it comes to swimming.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.390
Jackson reconciles with his mothers and Viv.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.390
Otis’ father Remi returns home to spend
time with him.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.390
This excites Otis, but causes friction in
Jean and Jakob’s relationship.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.390
Jean isn’t used to being in a committed
and healthy relationship like she’s in with

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.390
Jakob, and begins to feel smothered by Jakob’s
intimacy.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.390
This eventually leads to Jean kissing Remi
and ending her relationship with Jakob.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.390
Jean quickly realizes her mistake and her
true love for Jakob, but he doesn’t believe

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.390
she’s at a place to give him the intimacy
he needs from a relationship.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.390
To complicate things further, Jean discovers
that she’s pregnant.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.390
And that’s not the only discovery Jean will
make, as she finally finds out about her son’s

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.390
secret sex clinic being run at Moordale, something
she rightfully deems as completely unethical.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.390
And although Otis is at first excited to have
his father back in his life, he soon discovers

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.390
that Remi has only returned home because his
new wife kicked him out for his incessant

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.390
cheating.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.390
Ola begins to suspect that there’s more
going on between Otis and Maeve than just

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.390
a friendship and their sex clinic business
and asks Otis to cut Maeve from his life,

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.390
which he does.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.390
Although Ola herself begins to realize that
she’s pansexual and has feelings for her

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.390
friend Lily.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.390
Ola and Otis break up, and at a party, a drunken
Otis manages to insult both Ola and Maeve.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.390
Ola and Lily begin a relationship, and Ola
forms a friendship with her co-worker Adam.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.390
Maeve’s mother, Erin, returns home with
Maeve’s young half-sister Elsie, with the

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.390
promise of making amends with Maeve, getting
clean, and getting a real job that can move

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.390
them all out of the trailer park.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.390
At first hesitant to trust her mother, Maeve
begins to trust that their relationship can

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.390
be saved.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.390
Meanwhile, in addition to restarting the sex
clinic with Otis, whom she secretly loves,

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.390
Maeve also joins Moordale’s trivia team,
the Quiz Heads, alongside Steve, Viv, and

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.390
Dex.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.390
Throughout the season, Maeve learns to trust
in her teammates and eventually helps them

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.390
win the national championship.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.390
That win is dampened when Maeve’s new paraplegic
neighbor Isaac discovers that Erin is using

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.390
drugs again.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.390
Maeve makes the difficult decision to call
social services on her mother, causing Erin

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.390
and Elsie to be taken away by the authorities.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.390
Headmaster Groff’s marriage with his wife
Maureen deteriorates due to his complete lack

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.390
of emotions and empathy.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.390
When Maureen begins to seek friendship and
advice from Jean on the matter, a jealous

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.390
and spiteful Groff begins copying and spreading
Jean’s therapy notes around Moordale, causing

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.390
complete chaos.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.390
Everything comes to a head in the finale,
set largely around the school’s production

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.390
of Romeo and Juliet.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.390
With the support of Viv and his mothers, Jackson
is able to overcome his performance anxieties

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.390
to play Romeo.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.390
The play’s director, Lily, has crafted an
impressively intricate, albeit sexually charged

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.390
show.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.390
This embarrasses Headmaster Groff in front
of the chair of the school board, and he tries

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.390
to shut the production down.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.390
But it’s actually his son Adam who fully
derails the show by running on stage and publicly

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.390
declaring his true feelings for Eric, who
reciprocates.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.390
Headmaster Groff proceeds to have a bit of
a public meltdown, accusing Jean of corrupting

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.390
the students’ minds.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.030
Otis stands up for his mother and the school
board chair puts Groff on leave.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.930
As the season comes to a close, Otis is resolved
to confess his true love to Maeve.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.400
When he goes to tell her, he instead finds
Isaac.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.750
Otis asks Isaac to make sure that Maeve checks
her voicemail messages and leaves.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.120
Isaac listens to the message Otis left for
Maeve, detailing his love for her, and deletes

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.009
it before Maeve can hear it.

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:45.449
