00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.509
Hey Guys, welcome to our movie recap channel.
Today we will be watching the movie “The

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.960
Man Without Gravity”. So, please turn on
the subtitles and spoilers ahead.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.820
At the start of the movie, we see a pregnant
woman named Natalia. She is going through

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.930
labor pain, and her mother is rushing her
to the hospital.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.150
After reaching the hospital, the nurse informs
them that there are no doctors available.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.980
So, the nurse herself tries to help deliver
the baby. In the operating room, Natalia is

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.599
having a hard time giving birth to her child.
The nurse tries to keep her focused and helps

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.079
her through the process. Finally, the child
is out of Natalia’s womb. But something

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.440
is strange. The newborn child starts floating
in the air, with it being still attached to

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.600
its mother.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.560
Seeing the child float in the air, everyone
is shocked. But Natalia pulls her baby to

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.420
her chest and hugs it tightly. Despite this
rare phenomena, Natalia seems unfazed due

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.879
to her motherly love. She believes that her
child is an angel. But, the nurse is left

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.430
speechless, and Natalia’s mother’s face
is filled with concern and confusion.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.090
Realizing that the birth of this rare child
could bring unwanted attention, Natalia and

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.379
her mother head out of the hospital and go
back to their house. Natalia’s mother starts

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.280
asking her about the father of the child.
But Natalia says that she has no idea. She

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.100
used to have physical relations with many
men, so she didn’t know who the real father

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.479
of her child was.

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.860
Her mother tries to tell her that the child
was not normal. So, they have to keep it safe

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.040
from the outside world, and keep everything
a secret.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.049
Next morning, when Natalia’s mother wakes
up, she finds that the baby is in the air,

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.009
stuck to the ceiling. She wakes up Natalia
and steps on a chair to bring the baby down.

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.009
She starts scolding Natalia for not knowing
the real father of this child. But Natalia

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.980
is insistent that her baby is an angel. She
names the child Oscar. Later, their neighbours

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.890
arrive at their house to see the new born
baby. To keep the secret from everyone, Natalia’s

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.149
mother ties Oscar to his crib with a belt,
and tells her friends to not touch the baby,

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.650
as it was very fragile.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.920
After that incident, they both realize that
taking care of the baby was not going to be

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.390
easy. They arrange mattresses on the ceiling
to make it safe for the child to float around.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.049
They also realize that if they ever let him
out of the house, Oscar might float in the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.550
sky and reach space. So, they become very
conscious of Oscar and are protective of him.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.420
Just like this, a few years go by, and Oscar
is now 6 years old. And in the 6 years of

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.239
his life, Oscar has never stepped out of his
house. So, all that Oscar had experienced

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.530
or seen in his short life, was all inside
his house. Even his schooling was done by

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.550
his grandmother. Oscar watches a lot of superhero
movies in the house, and he believes that

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.170
he too is a superhero with the ability of
flying.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.519
Oscar often asks his mother why he wasn’t
allowed to step out of the house. But he never

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.209
gets the answer to it. He spends his time
watching outside the house from the window.

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.050
He sees kids of his age, going to school and
living freely outside their house. Oscar wishes

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.180
that he too could live like them. He is curious
to know about the life that is outside of

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.430
his house. So, one day Oscar decides to see
for himself. He opens the window, and when

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.540
his mother and grandmother return, they are
both scared to find the window open. They

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.570
believe that Oscar might have opened the window
and floated in the sky.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.660
But, Oscar hadn’t left the house. They are
relieved to find him. But, Oscar’s grandmother

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.190
is concerned that he might escape out of the
window for real next time. So, she seals all

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.069
the windows of the house, and is unhappy with
Oscar.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.620
Natalia however, realizes that Oscar wants
to see the outside world. She knows that keeping

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.590
him locked in the house isn’t the right
thing. So, she fights with her mother, and

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.260
takes Oscar outside. She puts two heavy weights
inside Oscar’s jacket. The weights were

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.299
keeping Oscar from floating, and keeping him
on the ground.

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.491
Natalia’s idea works as Oscar doesn’t
float when he steps out of the house. She

00:03:34.491 --> 00:03:38.710
also tells Oscar that he has to keep his ability
a secret from everyone, just like how the

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.130
superheroes keep their identity a secret.
Oscar agrees to never tell anyone about his

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.230
ability.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.750
One day, Oscar is out with his mother. Natalia
goes inside the shop to buy something and

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.840
Oscar stays outside. While waiting for his
mother, Oscar bumps into a girl. The girl’s

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.650
name is Sofia and she is mad at Oscar for
bumping into her, which caused her to drop

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.599
her belongings. She shouts at Oscar and wants
him to help her carry her items. Sofia hands

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.550
Oscar two water bottles and says that it's
his punishment to carry those water bottles

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.550
to her house.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.159
Oscar doesn’t know what to do, but he follows
Sofia anyway, without telling his mother.

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.690
On their way, Oscar and Sofia start talking
to each other. Oscar is tired having to carry

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.270
two massive weights inside his jacket, along
with the two water bottles. So, he takes out

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.620
the weights from his jacket and leaves it.
Sofia and Oscar tell each other their names,

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.040
and begin their friendship.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.190
They reach Sofia’s house, but Oscar cannot
let go of the water bottles. He knows that

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.640
doing so will result in him floating in the
sky. Sofia asks Oscar to hand her the water

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.730
bottles, but Oscar refuses to do so. Sofia
is confused to see Oscar, and she grabs the

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.360
water bottles from Oscar. As soon as Sofia
takes the bottles, Oscar starts to float in

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.050
the air, but is thankfully saved. Sofia is
shocked to see Oscar float around in the sky,

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.980
and even calls him Superman. Oscar asks her
for help, and Sofia quickly pulls him down,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.630
and holds him. But she knows this won’t
work. So, she goes inside her house and returns

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.390
with a pink bag filled with stones. She hands
the bag to Oscar, who finally manages to stay

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.650
on the ground, with the help of the bag’s
weight. Oscar asks her to keep it a secret,

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.910
and Sofia promises to him that she will not
tell anyone about his secret. From there on,

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.350
they become good friends.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.460
Meanwhile, Natalia is scared thinking about
the disappearance of Oscar. And her mother

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.160
finds the weight that was thrown by Oscar.
But, Oscar soon returns to his house, and

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.370
tells his mother about Sofia. Natalia is concerned
that Oscar might have told her about his secret.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.670
But Oscar assures her that he didn’t tell
Sofia about his secret.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.810
From that day, Sofia begins to visit Oscar
in his house, and Natalia too is happy to

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.100
see that Oscar had made a friend. They begin
playing inside the house, and Natalia even

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.680
allows them to go outside to play on their
own. But, Natalia soon finds out that Sofia

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.630
knows about Oscar’s secret. So, she stops
allowing her to come see Oscar. Oscar and

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.220
Sofia could no longer see each other, and
the neighbours were also witnessing all of

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.080
these. They believe that Oscar was imprisoned
by his mother and grandmother.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.571
Soon, the police visit Natalia, and ask her
about Oscar. They even warn them that they

00:06:01.571 --> 00:06:05.820
cannot keep a child locked inside the house.
The police tell Natalia that they should send

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.580
Oscar to the school. Next day, Natalia and
her mother drive Oscar to his new school.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.390
At school, Natalia realizes that Oscar wouldn’t
be allowed to carry his bag all the time.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.820
She gets scared that something bad might happen
to Oscar in the school. So, she takes Oscar

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.010
back with her. Natalia and her mother realize
that it will be hard for Oscar to survive

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.200
in this environment. So, they leave their
house, and live somewhere far away from everybody.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.520
Many years have gone by, and Oscar is now
a grown man. Natalia is old, and her mother

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.970
has passed away. Despite being older, Oscar
still has the pink bag that was given to him

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:43.330
by Sofia. He often holds the bag close to
him, and thinks about Sofia and their friendship.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.520
She was the only friend he ever had. And Oscar’s
life hasn’t changed by much. He still isn’t

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.050
allowed to live like a normal person. He is
fed up by the daily routine of his life. He

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.520
still has to carry the heavy bag when he goes
outside his house, and Natalia is still protective

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.520
of him.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.080
Oscar and Natalia have a great bond with each
other. They both love each other. But, Natalia

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.180
is aware that this is not the life that Oscar
wants, but she also cannot do anything about

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.180
it.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.180
One night, Oscar sees an ad for a reality
show called “The Extraordinary Men”. Oscar

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.300
believes himself to be extraordinary and starts
to think that if he showcases his power in

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.210
that show, people might like him, and he no
longer has to hide his secret. So, he silently

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.760
leaves his house, without telling his mother.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.870
Oscar soon arrives at the show, and finally
presents his secret to the world, which he

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.640
has been keeping for years. The show becomes
an instant hit, and Natalia also ends up finding

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.640
out about it.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.610
Oscar becomes famous overnight, and is approached
by a person named David. He is a content agent

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.830
and he tells Oscar that he can help him become
more famous, and earn more money by organizing

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.910
shows and events for him. David takes Oscar
to a big house, which is for him to live in.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:52.050
Then David asks Oscar to sign a contract,
and Oscar happily signs it as he wants to

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:53.100
be famous.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.181
Oscar is then given the nickname “The Man
Without gravity”. He does photoshoots, and

00:07:57.181 --> 00:08:01.390
events which makes him more famous than before.
Oscar seems happy with everything and has

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:06.270
earned a lot of money as well. The media also
starts covering Oscar and his childhood. They

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.450
show the house that he lived in as a child.
And they also present Natalia and her mother

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:15.410
in a bad light for never letting Oscar out.
Natalia is sad to see all this happen. And

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.490
slowly, Oscar starts to realize that this
was not what he wanted to do. He wanted to

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.830
be accepted by people, live freely and be
adored for his ability. He wanted to become

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.040
a superhero. But he was turning out to be
a circus clown, which people paid money to

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.890
see. He tells David that he no longer wants
to do such shows anymore. But David tells

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.599
him that he has signed a contract and has
to do the shows which were booked for him.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:41.340
Natalia comes to meet Oscar, and David takes
her to him. Upon seeing his mother, Oscar

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.950
isn’t sure how to react. He wanted everyone
to know about his powers, but now when they

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:50.560
do, he isn’t happy. Natalia asks him if
everything was okay. And Oscar lies to her

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.090
that everything was fine.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:56.470
After this, Oscar is brought to a show where
he has to wear an angel costume. Natalia is

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:01.080
also among the audience. Oscar isn’t happy
with what he was asked to do. And Natalia

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.130
too is shocked to see how her son was being
presented. Everyone in the audience starts

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.970
clapping, but Oscar starts to bad mouth everyone,
as he is angry with his presentation.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:14.220
With the actions of Oscar, David isn’t happy
at all. But Oscar makes it clear to him that

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.470
he no longer wants to do any shows or events.
He wants to quit everything and doesn’t

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.950
want to be famous anymore. David tells Oscar
that he cannot just quit everything. But,

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.490
Oscar is adamant and tells David to tell everyone
that “The Man Without Gravity” was dead.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:31.680
And soon, the news comes out stating that
Oscar was no longer alive. The news media

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.950
starts to arrive at Natalia’s house to ask
her about Oscar, but she doesn’t tell them

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.850
anything. Few years go by, and Natalia becomes
old and dies.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:44.490
On the other hand, Oscar was living a different
life. He started acting as a wheelchair bound

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.780
person, and had grown his beard to not let
anyone recognize him. He had started working

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.980
at a hotel as a receptionist, and was very
much loved by the people there. Even till

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.530
this day, he is still carrying the bag which
was given to him by Sofia.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:01.490
One day, a lady sees him carrying that bag
and she follows him. She calls him Oscar,

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:06.480
who quickly denies that his name is not Oscar.
But the lady introduces herself as Sofia.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.530
They both are happy to see each other, and
Oscar shares his life story. He starts to

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.980
become happy again in his life, with the arrival
of Sofia. They are as happy as when they were

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.490
children. They even have feelings for each
other, and share the same bed.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:23.300
But one day, he sees her with an unknown man.
Oscar realizes that Sofia was sleeping with

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:28.190
other men to earn money. Next time, Oscar
has a flower for Sofia, but this time too,

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.140
she has brought an old man with her. Seeing
this, Oscar gets sad and doesn’t know what

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.140
to do.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.380
Sofia also realizes that she cannot act like
nothing is going on. She goes to Oscar and

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.620
asks him what he wants. Oscar says that he
wants them to live together, away from this

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:46.120
place. But Sofia tells him that it isn't as
easy as he thinks. It’s hard to survive

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.240
in this world, and she wants to live her life
in comfort by earning as much money as she

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.330
can. So, Oscar leaves from there without Sofia.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.210
He returns back to his childhood home, and
prepares to live out the rest of his life

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.940
there. Then, unexpectedly, Oscar finds Sofia
at his doorsteps with the pink bag in her

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.270
