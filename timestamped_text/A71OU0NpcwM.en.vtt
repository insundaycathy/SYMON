00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.639
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:07.010
Today, I'm going to explain an action, adventure,
sci-fi film called “Stargate.”

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.010
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.340
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.940
In a North African settlement in 8,000 B.C.,
tribespeople are woken up by bright lights

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.010
and loud humming.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.980
A spacecraft descends upon them, and they
start running.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.470
A young man sees the craft, and without fear
or hesitation, he walks up to the alien ship,

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.100
getting bombarded by bright lights.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.430
It is 1928 in Egypt, and an archeologist arrives
at a dig site with his daughter.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.969
A man welcomes him, excited to show the archeologist
the latest dig find.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.749
They arrive at a circular tablet formation
with hieroglyphs and other strange carvings.

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:45.260
As the men examine the carvings, the archeologist’s
daughter finds a gold necklace with an Egyptian

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.260
rune.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.829
Nearby, workers are erecting a massive circular
structure.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.780
The archeologist notes that this is nothing
he has ever seen before.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:01.050
In the present day, the archeologist’s daughter,
Catherine Langford, is now an older woman

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.209
making her way to a scientific gathering.

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:10.960
At this event, Egyptologist and linguist,
Daniel Jackson, presents his claim that the

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.120
Egyptian pyramids were built at a much earlier
date than currently accepted.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.479
The audience, finding his theories ridiculous,
leaves one by one.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.939
Outside, Catherine invites Daniel into her
car and offers him a job to decipher ancient

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.570
Egyptian hieroglyphs on the circular tablets
her father found.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.689
Catherine tells him that this could be his
chance to prove his theories.

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.030
Military personnel arrive at a suburban home
and inform Colonel Jack O’Neill that he

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.650
is being reactivated to serve in the army.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.719
Jack cradles a gun and hides it when the soldiers
knock.

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.979
The soldiers tell him why they came, and he
stays quiet.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.950
While leaving, one of the men reveals that
Jack had lost his young son to an accidental

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.670
gun discharge.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.340
Daniel arrives at a top-secret military installation
and sees the circular stone tablet with hieroglyphs.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.119
He’s informed that the seven center carvings
are yet to be deciphered, and that’s the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.380
reason he’s there.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.369
Daniel then sees a board with hieroglyph translations,
and sees errors.

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.729
He immediately goes to corrects everything
and produces a translation about the sun god,

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.640
Ra, using a stargate.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.099
One of the scientists informs Daniel that
they have found a significant artifact in

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.260
the sands, something dating back 10,000 years,
much more ancient than the Egyptians.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.180
Jack enters and informs everyone that he now
has sole supervision over the entire project.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.300
The scientists are confused, and Catherine
asks the colonel to clarify.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.340
She had the belief that she had complete autonomy
over the project, but Jack informs her that

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.269
the higher-ups have changed their minds.

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.080
The colonel then adds that his presence is
only required if the project achieves its

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.080
goal.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.890
Daniel works on the translation and exhausts
all possible language ciphers he knows but

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.689
still can’t come up with a solid translation.

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.780
While going for a coffee break, he sees a
star constellation and recognizes that one

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.400
of the seven symbols is shaped similarly.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.129
With this discovery, Daniel is called to brief
the military heads.

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.010
He presents his findings and shows that six
of the symbols correspond to coordinates for

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.040
a location, with the seventh symbol indicating
a place of origin.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.510
One scientist protests, saying the seventh
symbol is not on the device they were experimenting

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.510
on.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.629
Daniel asks what device he’s pertaining
to, and they open a wall to show Daniel what

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.060
the project has been centered on.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.470
In the next room, the enormous circular hollow
stone found in Egypt has been erected and

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.540
attached to the building’s power.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.510
It looks alien in origin and appears to be
some sort of portal doorway.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.909
Catherine tells Daniel that this is the stargate
earlier mentioned in the translation.

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.150
Catherine explains that the stargate is made
of a mineral not present on Earth.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.730
A team of scientists inputs the symbols Daniel
had discovered.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.079
Daniel spots the seventh symbol on the device,
and the other scientist concurs.

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:49.290
They place the symbols in, and with each symbol
locking into place, the room hums and shakes.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.879
The scientists lock in the seventh symbol,
and the stargate bursts open.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.500
A portal appears, and everyone is dumbfounded.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.719
They then take a robotic rover equipped with
a camera and send it into stargate.

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:04.970
As the rover enters, it sends a location in
a galaxy on the farthest edges of the known

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.099
universe.

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.700
The probe then suddenly loses its signal,
but luckily, some footage has been transmitted.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.650
From the robot’s readings, they see that
there is also a stargate on the opposite side

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.650
that they assume functions in the same way.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.400
Atmospheric readings also indicate that whatever
planet the rover has been transported to has

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.980
the same atmospheric conditions as Earth.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.250
The military considers they may have to abort
as the project’s primary goal is to perform

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.310
surveillance.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.950
The team that will perform reconnaissance
must decipher the markings and access the

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.710
stargate from the opposite side to get back
home.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.790
With the information they’ve gathered, they’re
uncertain they’ll be able to achieve that.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.140
Daniel immediately speaks up and says he may
be able to help.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.100
The military men take his word and enroll
him on the reconnaissance team.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.770
As Daniel prepares for the trip, Catherine
gives him the necklace she found at the dig

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.570
site for good luck.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.380
The scientists turn the stargate on again,
and a group of soldiers enters it one by one.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.620
Daniel is the last to enter and, before he
does so, stares in awe and excitement at what

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.910
he’s about to experience.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.040
A new world behind the stargate.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.280
He’ll be part of one of the first humans
ever to enter.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.170
He steps in and is immediately transported
through millions of miles in a matter of seconds.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.120
The team emerges on the other side and gets
to work and surveying the area.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.630
They step out into what appears to be an old
stone temple and see they’re in the middle

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.840
of a desert.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.960
They then see a large stone pyramid dwarfing
the temple they exited from.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.240
Jack asks Daniel how long it’d take to get
the stargate working, but Daniel confesses

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.150
that he has no idea how to get the machine
to work.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.360
He assumed that the symbols they’d need
for the stargate to work would be readily

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.520
available.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.600
Unlike the stargate back on Earth, he still
needs to find the seven symbols required for

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.000
a trip home.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.101
One of the soldiers understandably shouts
at Daniel and pushes him, but Jack steps in

00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:50.100
and orders the man to set up a base camp.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.150
Inside the temple, Jack initializes some sort
of beeping device with a timer but hides it

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.000
immediately when one of the soldiers enters.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.550
Back outside, Daniel fixes his belongings,
and one of the soldiers bullies him, throwing

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.710
his luggage out, books spewing out.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.100
Daniel understands their frustration and gathers
his things.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.290
In the distance, he sees some kind of animal
grazing.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.440
He approaches it and tries to pet it.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.250
Luckily for him, the animal is tamed and doesn’t
think of him as a threat.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.210
Jack and two other soldiers see him and call
out to him.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.080
Daniel assures them that the animal is harmless
as it’s got a harness, indicating that it’s

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.080
domesticated.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.220
The animal gets startled, and its harness
gets tangled with Daniel’s foot.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.830
It bolts, and Daniel gets dragged.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.220
Jack and the soldiers chase after him, but
the animal runs too fast.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.790
They finally catch up to Daniel, but Jack
spots something over the hill.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.680
The soldiers reposition on top of the hill,
and they’re all shocked to see a sprawling

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.490
community of people that look like humans.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.030
From what they can see, the location seems
to look like a mine.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.550
The miners see them, and they all stop.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.050
The group starts approaching the miners, and
one of the miners sees Daniel’s necklace.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.580
He shouts to the other miners, and they all
start bowing to Daniel.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:06.360
Jack approaches one of the young men, a teenager,
Skaara, and runs to retrieve the village elder.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.710
One of Jack’s men takes a reading of the
rock they’re mining and sees that it consists

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.440
of the same material the stargate is made
of.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.170
The village elder, Kasuf, approaches and welcomes
the men.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.900
He offers a drink, and Daniel offers a chocolate
bar in return.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.920
The exchange proves positive, and both parties
are on good terms.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.200
Jack asks Daniel to translate, but Daniel
says he can’t decipher what kind of language

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.380
they’re speaking.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.430
He theorizes it could be a variant of the
Egyptian language but is unsure.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.460
Jack then radios to the men back at base camp
and informs them they’ll be staying a little

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.570
longer.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.950
The whole mining group then travels to a large
town, almost a city, made entirely of mud

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.320
and brick houses.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.480
Daniel and the group are welcomed, greeted
with hospitality, and are treated as guests

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.570
of honor.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.480
They arrive at a gathering place, and the
elder reveals an overhanging brass plate with

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.570
a symbol.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:00.500
Daniel identifies it as the symbol for the
Egyptian sun god, Ra, and Jack realizes the

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.210
villagers have been welcoming because of the
necklace Daniel is wearing, which has the

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.820
same symbol.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.580
An alarm blares, and everyone rushes out.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.070
Jack tries radioing base camp, but a massive
sandstorm overruns the camp.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:18.400
The city gates are closed, but Jack misunderstands,
thinking the villagers are becoming hostile.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.540
They take several villagers hostage and fire
warning shots.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.640
Skaara tries to calm the soldiers down and
shows Jack the reason they’re closing the

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.640
gates.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.910
He sees the approaching sandstorm and orders
his men to stand down.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.490
That evening, the elders and Daniel’s group
gather for a feast.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:38.060
Jack theorizes that since the villagers could
identify the Egyptian symbol for Ra, then

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.550
it would stand to reason that they may know
more Egyptian symbols, specifically the symbols

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.100
needed for initiating the stargate.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.579
Daniel approaches Kasuf and tries to communicate
by drawing something in the sand.

00:08:49.579 --> 00:08:51.970
Kasuf panics and erases the writing.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.600
He then orders everyone out.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.310
Daniel guesses that writing of any kind must
be forbidden in their culture.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:01.579
Kasuf then orders the women to take Daniel
away, and they do so, laughing and teasing

00:09:01.579 --> 00:09:02.639
Daniel.

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:06.000
They take Daniel to a tent, bathe him, and
groom him.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.660
The women then leave, and a beautiful woman,
Sha'uri, enters.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.579
She then starts undressing, and Daniel understands
what is happening.

00:09:14.579 --> 00:09:17.079
This woman has been offered to him as an offering.

00:09:17.079 --> 00:09:22.350
He takes Sha'uri out, but Kasuf sees this
and understands this as Daniel rejecting Sha'uri.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.510
He falls to his knees and starts apologizing.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:29.290
Upon seeing this, Daniel instead thanks Kasuf
for Sha'uri.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:33.700
The two return inside the tent, and Daniel
shows Sha'uri a drawing of the pyramid.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.550
Sha'uri answers by drawing the symbol for
Earth.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:41.100
Daniel asks Sha'uri if she’s seen the symbol
somewhere in the city and asks her to take

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.100
him there.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.259
Back in the temple, the soldiers have retreated
inside to hide from the sandstorm.

00:09:46.259 --> 00:09:50.620
They soon start hearing an ominous humming
sound, and the temple begins vibrating.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.160
Above them, a pyramid-shaped spaceship descends,
landing on the massive pyramid.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.079
The temple trembles violently, and the soldiers
are thrown to the ground.

00:09:59.079 --> 00:10:02.380
The ship finally lands, and everything becomes
calm.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.339
The men spread out, sensing something in the
temple.

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:09.300
One by one, the soldiers start getting picked
off by an unseen creature.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.410
They get whacked by a blunt instrument with
some kind of electricity running through it.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.620
One of the soldiers manages to get to a gun,
firing at the creature, but he still gets

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.620
bested.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.040
The attacker reveals itself as a human-robot
hybrid with the head of a jackal, emulating

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.250
the Egyptian god Anubis.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.140
Back in the village, Jack shows Skaaraa a
metal lighter.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.910
Skaara is astonished by the small device that
can create fire.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:36.389
The two then share a cigarette, but Skaara
starts coughing, and Jack laughs.

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:40.480
Skaara then comes closer and reaches for Jack’s
rifle, to which Jack immediately swipes his

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.389
hand off and shouts at him.

00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:45.709
He scolds Skaara, telling him the gun is dangerous.

00:10:45.709 --> 00:10:47.329
Skaara runs away, frightened.

00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:50.570
Jack is reminded of his son and the fatal
shooting accident.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:55.399
Meanwhile, Jack and Sha'uri enter a cave with
hieroglyphs Daniel can recognize.

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:58.949
He then uses the inscription to have Sha'uri
teach him the language.

00:10:58.949 --> 00:11:02.089
Already learned in the Egyptian language,
Daniel learns quickly.

00:11:02.089 --> 00:11:06.120
Jack and the soldiers still can’t establish
communication with the base camp, and Jack

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.100
decides to look for Daniel.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.660
He asks Skaara and some of his friends where
Daniel is, and after a few attempts, Skaara

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.579
understands Jack.

00:11:14.579 --> 00:11:18.019
Skaara takes one of the yaks and has it smell
Daniel’s jacket.

00:11:18.019 --> 00:11:22.610
Jack finds Daniel in the cave with Sha'uri,
and Daniel tells him what he’s found out.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:27.319
From the hieroglyphs, Daniel speaks of a traveler
from distant stars, that being Ra, looking

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:28.800
for a way to escape death.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.860
Ra escaped his dying world and is one of if
not the only remaining descendant of his species.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.190
Ra found Earth, where he encountered early
humans who worshipped him.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:42.250
He soon realized that a human body would give
him a chance for extended life.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.870
He found a young boy, abducted him, and placed
his mind in the boy’s body.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:50.759
He then used the stargate to bring thousands
of humans to the current planet as a massive

00:11:50.759 --> 00:11:52.800
workforce to mine a mineral.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.089
This mineral has unique properties making
it suitable as a powerful energy source.

00:11:57.089 --> 00:12:01.499
A rebellion soon starts on Earth, and Ra’s
forces are quickly overrun.

00:12:01.499 --> 00:12:06.129
He escapes to this planet and, to prevent
another uprising, outlaws reading and writing,

00:12:06.129 --> 00:12:08.509
making the people forget their history.

00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:12.819
In the cave, they find another stone tablet
containing the six symbols required for powering

00:12:12.819 --> 00:12:14.070
up the stargate.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.959
Daniel sees that the seventh symbol is missing
and tells them they can’t make the stargate

00:12:17.959 --> 00:12:18.959
work without it.

00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:22.080
By dawn, the group decides to return to base
camp.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.190
A group of boys led by Skaara follows closely.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.720
The group arrives at base camp, seeing the
massive spaceship.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.689
They rush into the temple and see signs of
a battle.

00:12:31.689 --> 00:12:34.680
They notice something stalking them, and they
all hide.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.910
Anubis once again quickly picks them off one
by one.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.990
He fires his staff, and an electrical force
throws back anyone who gets hit.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.889
Soon, only Jack and Daniel remain.

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:48.980
They head to the lower section where the stargate
is located, and Jack opens the container where

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.420
he hid the device earlier.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.639
He’s surprised to see that Ra had taken
the device.

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:58.079
Metallic rings descend from the ceiling, and
another human-robot hybrid teleports inside

00:12:58.079 --> 00:13:00.410
them, this time in the form of Horus.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:04.439
Two other guards flank him, and Jack and Daniel
surrender.

00:13:04.439 --> 00:13:09.420
Anubis and Horus take Jack and Daniel to Ra’s
throne room and force the two to kneel.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.999
Ra appears before all of them, followed by
a posse of young boys kept as slaves.

00:13:13.999 --> 00:13:18.860
Ra shows Jack the device, and Ra says that
they had brought the device to destroy him.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:23.319
Daniel identifies it as a bomb and questions
Jack’s true objectives on the mission.

00:13:23.319 --> 00:13:28.220
Ra orders Anubis and Horus to show themselves,
and it’s revealed that the two are humans.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.089
Ra also takes off his mask and appears as
the young boy in the story from the hieroglyphs.

00:13:33.089 --> 00:13:37.350
Jack takes the opportunity and steals one
of the gods’ weapons, and shoots them.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.820
Daniel tries to stop the fighting but gets
shot, ending up with a hole through his body.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:46.480
Jack aims the weapon at Ra, but the children
surround Ra, and Jack hesitates.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.170
Jack gets disarmed and beaten, but Ra orders
his men to stop.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.660
Ra sees Daniel’s necklace and examines it.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.160
Jack then gets dumped into a jail cell with
his men.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.189
Outside the ship, Skaara sees two aircraft
launching from the spaceship, heading for

00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:01.189
the town.

00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:04.699
Kasuf sees the ships and orders everyone to
take cover.

00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:08.949
The ships rain fire upon the townspeople,
punishing them for blasphemy.

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:15.079
Horus and Anubis spare no one, firing on men,
women, children, and the elderly.

00:14:15.079 --> 00:14:17.999
Skaara runs back to the town and sees the
devastation.

00:14:17.999 --> 00:14:22.180
Kasuf tells Skaara that entertaining Daniel
and the men had been a mistake.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.730
In the ship, Daniel wakes up in Ra’s regeneration
pod.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.930
The same pod Ra uses to maintain his immortality.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:33.380
Daniel sees that the hole on his stomach has
healed entirely and heads out, seeing Ra being

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.380
dressed.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.589
Daniel tells Ra that he knows he had died
earlier when he got shot.

00:14:37.589 --> 00:14:41.720
Ra tells him that the human body’s ease
of repair is the reason why he chose a human

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.990
to be his host body.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:47.269
Ra then reveals he intends to send back the
bomb to Earth, along with a shipment of the

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:50.249
mineral, which would multiply the bomb’s
destructive power.

00:14:50.249 --> 00:14:54.370
Ra adds that he created human civilization,
and it would be a fitting end if he’d be

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:55.899
the one to destroy it.

00:14:55.899 --> 00:15:00.209
Ra tells Daniel that Jack and his men would
be an example of anyone who wants to defy

00:15:00.209 --> 00:15:01.209
his rule.

00:15:01.209 --> 00:15:04.839
Ra orders Daniel to kill Jack and the soldiers
in front of the entire town.

00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:08.939
Ra is concerned that the inhabitants of the
planet might start seeing Daniel as another

00:15:08.939 --> 00:15:12.950
god figure to praise, and tells him there’s
only one true god on that planet.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:17.200
Ra yanks the necklace off of Daniel and threatens
him that if he doesn’t kill Jack and the

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.600
men, then Ra would kill him.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.300
In the town, Sha'uri tells Skaara and the
boys the true history of their people and

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.850
their origin.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:29.240
The following day, everyone is gathered to
witness Daniel killing the soldiers, but Skaara

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.670
reveals that he and the other boys are ready
to fight back.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:35.069
Seeing this, Daniel turns and fires at Ra.

00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:38.869
A firefight breaks loose, and the crowd disperses.

00:15:38.869 --> 00:15:42.529
Everyone later regroups at a hidden location
and gathers around a bonfire.

00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:46.800
Jack reveals that his primary mission objective
is to identify any potential threats on the

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.579
other side of the stargate.

00:15:48.579 --> 00:15:53.740
If a danger exists, he will destroy the stargate
using the bomb to prevent an invasion on Earth.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:59.259
Later, Daniel sees Sha’uri, and she tells
him she’s okay with being rejected.

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:04.019
Upon hearing this, Daniel kisses Sha’uri.

00:16:04.019 --> 00:16:07.389
Sha’uri then sketches something on the wall.

00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:12.019
Daniel discovers that this could be the seventh
symbol they need to access stargate.

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:15.399
That afternoon in the mines, they ambush Horus
and disable him.

00:16:15.399 --> 00:16:19.749
Kasuf tries to stop the rebellion, telling
them the gods would punish them, but Daniel

00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:24.509
reveals to everyone that the gods are mere
humans who possess advanced technology.

00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:29.149
Ra orders guards to send the bomb to Earth,
but Skaara and the boys intercept them.

00:16:29.149 --> 00:16:34.110
The guards check them one by one, and Jack
reveals himself, shooting the guards.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:37.600
Another firefight ensues, and casualties fall
on both sides.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.300
Jack, Daniel, and Sha’uri get trapped inside.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.100
The rest of the rebels are stuck outside,
left to face the aircrafts raining fire on

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.100
them.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.019
Jack finds the bomb and activates the timer,
deciding to remain on the planet to destroy

00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:52.259
the stargate as the team returns to Earth.

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:55.420
A guard appears behind them and shoots Sha’uri
dead.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:59.809
Jack kills the guard, but Anubis appears via
the teleportation rings.

00:16:59.809 --> 00:17:02.689
Daniel takes Sha’uri to the regeneration
pod.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:07.660
Jack is left alone to face Anubis, and they
exchange blows, the two fairly matched.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:12.050
Outside, the soldiers and the boys are trying
their best to battle the aircraft but soon

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.570
run out of ammo.

00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:17.550
One of the soldiers decides to surrender and
orders everyone to do the same.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.540
The aircrafts land and the pilots approach
them.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.520
Daniel succeeds in healing Sha’uri, taking
her out of the chamber and bringing her back

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.690
to the teleportation machine.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.630
Ra sees them and catches Daniel before he
teleports.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:34.200
Ra grabs Daniel’s head and uses alien powers
to melt Daniel’s brain.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.960
In the stargate room, Jack somehow gets the
upper hand and pins Anubis to the floor.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.340
He activates the teleportation rings, and
the rings descend on Anubis’ head.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:48.130
At the same time, the rings activate on Daniel
and Ra’s side, distracting Ra, making him

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.600
let go of Daniel.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.180
Daniel is quick to grab the necklace back.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:56.400
He and Sha’uri teleport back, and Anubis’
head appears in front of Ra.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.020
The pilots are about to execute Skaara, the
boys, and the soldiers, but Kasuf appears

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.860
with the entire townspeople rallying behind
him.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.000
They all charge the pilots and quickly overwhelm
them.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.720
Seeing this, Ra decides to relaunch his ship.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.390
Ra leaves, and Jack no longer needs the bomb.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:16.250
But Jack discovers that he can’t stop the
timer anymore.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.760
With seconds left on the clock, they decide
to send the bomb to Ra’s ship using the

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.640
teleportation rings.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.680
As Ra’s ship exits the planet’s atmosphere,
the bomb appears in front of Ra, and he’s

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.350
astonished to see it.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:30.970
Ra freezes, unable to react to the bomb as
it explodes.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:35.070
The ship explodes with an incredible amount
of force, and everyone back on the surface

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.100
cheers.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.420
The team then prepares to return to Earth.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.800
Daniel decides he wants to remain on the planet,
starting a new life with his newly beloved

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.800
Sha’uri.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:58.380
He gives the necklace back to Jack before
he steps into the void beyond the stargate.
