00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.410
Detective Recapped here.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.410
Today, I'm going to explain a Crime-Horror
film called: "The Owners."

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.700
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.240
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.019
From their car, countryside friends Nathan,
Gaz, and Terry watch the house of the elderly

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.900
couple, Dr. Huggins and Ellen.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.070
As Dr. Huggins bid his patients goodbye, the
boys talk to each other to make sure that

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.020
the couple won't be home that night.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.690
Terry says that Dr. Huggins always takes his
wife out to dinner every Friday, so he's confident

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.910
they'll be gone.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.010
As they continue discussing their plan, Nathan's
girlfriend, Mary, arrives to demand her car

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.010
back.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.790
They wonder how Mary found them, and she explains
that Terry texted her their location.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.740
Mary then asks Nathan what they're doing out
there, and Nathan replies that they're just

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.740
hanging.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.970
Thinking that her boyfriend is lying, Mary
tries honking the car's horn to make some

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.180
noise, so Nathan tells her that they've got
some business to take care of and he'll need

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.000
the car for a few more hours.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.350
They then see the elderly couple leaving,
so Nathan excitedly drives the car toward

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.370
the house, leaving Mary as she protests for
them to stop.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.020
To the boys' annoyance, Mary follows them
and once outside the Huggins' residence, Nathan

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.719
instructs her to keep on the lookout.

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.130
Gaz proceeds to break a small part of the
glass door, but Terry takes a spare key from

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.360
under a flower pot before he could do more
damage.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.119
They open the door, and once inside, Nathan
and Gaz ask Terry where the safe with cash

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.490
he's talking about is.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.850
Terry says that he doesn't know.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.159
This angers Gaz, so he carelessly goes through
the house, breaking the couples' things.

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.649
Terry pointlessly cleans up after Gaz's mess,
reminding him that they agreed not to trash

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:18.770
the place.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.090
As they search for the safe, Nathan finds
the stairs that lead to the basement and asks

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.590
Terry what's in there.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.279
Once more, Terry says that he doesn't know,
so Nathan urges him to check it out.

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:30.310
Terry, however, is reluctant due to his injured
ankle.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.810
Eventually, they manage to persuade Terry
to go downstairs while Nathan goes to look

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.810
for Gaz.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.859
Meanwhile, Gaz finds Ellen's jewelry in the
master's bedroom then takes them all.

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.310
Outside, Mary cleans her car while waiting
for the boys to finish ransacking the house.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.459
Terry searches the basement, Nathan takes
food from the kitchen, and Gaz enters the

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:48.180
room of the daughter, Kate.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.200
In the basement, Terry finds the safe and
hurriedly calls the two.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.639
However, Gaz quickly gets pissed once they
see that they can only open it through a dial

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:57.889
lock, not with an electronic code, like what
Terry's mom said.

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:01.599
Nathan tries opening the safe with a drill
and a sledgehammer to no avail, so he blames

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:03.369
Terry for what's happening.

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.809
Nathan then receives a call from Mary, telling
him that she wants to go, but he tells her

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:07.809
to wait.

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:10.679
He looks at his friends for advice, and that's
when Gaz suggests that they wait for the elderly

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.159
couple so they can scare them into revealing
the code.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:17.040
Nathan agrees and ends the call with Mary
while Terry stands there, unable to do anything.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.959
The three watch television to kill some time
until the couple arrives.

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.879
Mary, on the other hand, gets impatient outside
and starts yelling, calling out for Nathan.

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.099
Terry starts to feel uneasy, so he offers
to take Mary to her work since that's her

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.709
main concern, then they'll just bring the
car back.

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.159
Nathan firmly tells him that they're not going
anywhere, so Terry drops it.

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.420
Nathan invites Mary in, and after a few minutes
of persuading her, she agrees.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.959
Once inside, Nathan starts touching and kissing
Mary while Terry could only watch on in envy.

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.500
Nathan then takes Mary's phone when her boss
calls her.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.390
Terry and Gaz try cleaning the house, and
as they do, Gaz finds a photo of Kate.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.959
He teases Terry, saying they would make a
lovely couple, and an irritated Terry takes

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.120
the picture away from him.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.540
He explains that she was the elderly couple's
daughter who died a long time ago.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.799
While Nathan and Mary continue making out,
Mary lets her boyfriend know that she's pregnant.

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.150
Despite his surprise, Nathan promises her
that they're going to be all right, especially

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.580
after they get the money.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.080
In the middle of their conversation, the couple
arrives, and the three boys pull stockings

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.830
over their heads, even forcing Mary to do
it too.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.920
Deaf to her protests, Nathan tells Mary one
last time to put on the hose, and she obliges.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.970
Once inside, Nathan, Gaz, and Terry try to
restrain them, injuring Ellen along the way.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.810
They take the couple to the living area, where
Dr. Huggins pleads to them to help Ellen.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.960
He tells the boys to take everything they
want before turning to Mary, asking her to

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.599
look for disinfectants and bandages for his
wife.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.750
Mary agrees to sort it out, which only angers
Nathan and Gaz.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.930
She comes back with the medicine kit and a
glass of water for Ellen, and after the old

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.480
woman drinks, Mary tends to her wound.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.019
Once Mary is done, Gaz orders her to tie Ellen
up, and she apologetically complies.

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.090
Nathan then asks Dr. Huggins what they can
take, and the old doctor tells him where to

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.500
find his credit card and the money he's keeping
on top of the fridge.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.200
Not satisfied with the money they've acquired,
Nathan asks Dr. Huggins about the safe, but

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.079
the doctor denies having one.

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.569
Despite the doctor's denial, the boys take
the elderly couple to the basement.

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.120
All the while, Mary maintains her distance,
carefully watching everything.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.810
She then tells Nathan that she wants to leave,
but Nathan defends his actions, claiming that

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.709
he's doing it for her and the baby.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.469
Nathan asks Dr. Huggins for the safe's combination,
but the doctor refuses to tell him, which

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:16.460
resulted in Nathan getting mad and slapping
him.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.370
In an attempt to make the doctor talk, Gaz
threatens to hurt Ellen, but Mary protests

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.910
so Nathan stops him.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.280
Gaz picks up a blade and gives it to Nathan,
urging him to use it on the doctor.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.960
At that point, Mary decides that she's had
enough and heads back upstairs.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.389
Nathan is about to follow Mary when Gaz stops
him, saying he'll handle it.

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.620
Upstairs, Mary hides from Gaz in a bathroom
and tries calling the emergency services.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.139
Unfortunately, Gaz finds Mary and grabs the
phone by the cord before dragging her out

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.139
of the bathroom.

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.900
Meanwhile, Nathan and Terry listen to the
commotion upstairs while Dr. Huggins tries

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.169
to persuade Nathan to leave.

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.090
Amidst the chaos, Dr. Huggins recognizes Terry
and Nathan, surprising the two of them.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.590
On the other hand, Gaz continues attacking
Mary, telling her that Nathan will finally

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.699
leave her once they crack the safe open.

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.730
As Dr. Huggins talks out the situation with
Nathan, doubt suddenly fills the boy's mind,

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.620
making him rethink what they're doing.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.039
Terry even sides with Dr. Huggins, saying
that they should stop because it doesn't feel

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.039
right.

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.979
However, Nathan remains determined to get
the money from the safe and threatens to cut

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.020
Terry's tongue off if he doesn't shut up.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.690
Finally, Gaz takes Mary back to the basement
and tells Nathan that she tried calling for

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.690
help.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.620
As Ellen looks at Mary, she seems to recognize
the girl, but Dr. Huggins stops his wife before

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.900
she could say anything.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.900
Now tied up too, Mary pleads to her boyfriend
to stop the robbery, but Nathan ignores her

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.710
and puts a blade on Ellen's throat.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.979
Nathan once again asks the doctor what the
code is.

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.639
When Dr. Huggins still refuses to answer,
Gaz whispers something to Nathan, and the

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.349
latter threatens to cut off one of Ellen's
fingers instead.

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:40.199
The doctor pleads Nathan to think of Mary
and his baby, but at that point, Gaz is already

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.570
tired of playing games, so he points a gun
at Dr. Huggins.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.840
Nathan gives the doctor one last chance to
give him the code, but Dr. Huggins remains

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.840
quiet.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.770
Since Nathan can't actually cut Ellen's finger
off, he tells Gaz to do it instead.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.520
Gaz then mocks Nathan, saying he's now friends
with the doctor and his wife.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.000
Still trying to pick up a fight with him,
Gaz orders Nathan to cut Ellen's finger off,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.970
but Gaz puts his gun under Nathan's chin when
Nathan refuses.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.500
Left with no other choice, Nathan places the
blade on Ellen's finger, ready to cut it off

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.970
at a moment's notice.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.259
With Ellen's finger bleeding and Gaz's gun
pointed at Nathan's head, Nathan pleads for

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:11.550
the safe's code.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.919
Just like before, Doctor Huggins keeps his
mouth shut, and that's when Nathan seizes

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.280
the opportunity to take a swing at Gaz with
his knife, grazing his arm.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.169
Pissed, Gaz walks toward Nathan, who then
tries to stab him but fails.

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.500
Gaz deflects Nathan's attack and headbutts
him.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.740
As the two of them fall over, they continue
to fight until Gaz finally stabs Nathan.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.960
Horrified, Mary helplessly watches her boyfriend
bleed on the floor.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.129
Dr. Huggins offers to treat Nathan's wound,
but Gaz refuses to untie him.

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:39.419
Instead, Gaz tries to make a deal with them
by asking for the safe's code in exchange

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:41.060
for freeing Dr. Huggins.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.819
The doctor finally agrees and gives Gaz the
code, and as he does, Dr. Huggins signals

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:45.990
Terry to untie him.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.650
Terry, however, is too overwhelmed by what's
happening and starts to cry.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.319
Gaz continues to open the safe, but when he
got to the last number, he realizes that it's

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:54.319
wrong.

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:57.720
Dr. Huggins gives him the correct number,
but this time, he signals Mary to help him.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.949
Mary tries to untie herself but stops when
they hear Gaz failing to open the safe again.

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:06.070
Furious, Gaz saunters to Ellen then ties her
body to a post with packaging tape.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.610
No matter how much Dr. Huggins pleads with
Gaz to stop, he ignores him.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.150
Gaz then picks up a circular saw and turns
it on, terrifying everyone.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.449
With the saw in hand, Gaz walks back to where
Ellen is tied up, but he couldn't reach her

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:17.979
due to the short cord.

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:21.159
Not knowing that Mary has already managed
to free her legs, Gaz plugs the cable into

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:23.840
the socket behind Ellen and turns the saw
back on.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.169
As he prepares to attack her with it, Mary
hits him in the head with a sledgehammer,

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:28.479
instantly killing him.

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:31.990
She then turns off the saw and proceeds to
untie Dr. Huggins before asking for Terry's

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.640
help to bring Nathan to the hospital.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.639
However, Dr. Huggins takes out his gun and
tells them that no one will leave.

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:40.860
He unties Mary's bound hands and promises
her that he'll treat Nathan.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.000
The doctor then asks Terry to help Mary carry
Nathan upstairs.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.539
As they do, the doctor frees his wife and
takes Gaz's keys.

00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:50.990
Terry and Mary manage to get Nathan on the
doctor's operating table, but Huggins is taking

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.620
his time, choosing to tend to his wife first.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.550
Mary calls the doctor's attention, but Ellen
answers her, saying they got what they deserve.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.219
Dr. Huggins recklessly operates on Nathan,
almost as if he's hurting the boy on purpose.

00:08:02.219 --> 00:08:04.900
Despite this, he manages to get the blade
out of him.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.289
After that, the doctor requests for Mary,
Terry, and Ellen to leave the room so he can

00:08:08.289 --> 00:08:09.319
work properly.

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:13.370
Dr. Huggins hands Ellen a small box, and the
three of them reluctantly leave.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.460
Outside, Mary sits on the stairs while Terry
helps Ellen to the living area.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.800
Terry then sits beside Mary, and they talk
about how Dr. Huggins risked Ellen's life

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.319
for a security code.

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:25.930
Though he's exhausted, Terry assures Mary
that everything's going to be okay.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.060
Ellen then picks up the broken telephone on
the floor and mounds it back on the wall,

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.699
giving Mary a disgusted look before walking
away.

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:35.600
Mary breaks down, and as Terry comforts her,
he also tries to kiss her, making Mary back

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.720
away.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.480
Mary gets mad that they are all in that situation,
saying it's probably Terry's idea to rob the

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.360
couple since his mom works there.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.040
The two continue to argue, with Mary bringing
up her sister, Jane.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.560
Mary says that Jane didn't actually love Terry;
she just pitied him and ended up despising

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.560
him.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.590
She blames Terry for driving her sister away
and even for how they lost her while Terry

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.290
just sits there, crying.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.170
After their argument, Mary goes to the living
room, where she finds the small box that Dr.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.170
Huggins gave his wife.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.330
She is about to open it when Ellen arrives
to take it back from her before calling Mary

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.330
"dirty."

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.270
Ellen then starts sweeping the floor, and
when Terry offers to do it for her, she guides

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:10.020
the boy to the couch and offers to tend to
his injuries.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.530
Mary leaves them and goes back to the operating
room, finding Nathan looking as if he's already

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.530
dead.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.050
Dr. Huggins assures her that he's only sleeping
due to the medication he gave him, but Mary

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.790
doubts it, saying that Nathan's body is so
cold.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.350
When she asks the doctor where the ambulance
is, Dr. Huggins says it's on its way but promises

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.130
to call them again just to put Mary's mind
at ease.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.520
Mary follows the doctor when he makes the
call, and as he speaks, she realizes that

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.950
he's only pretending to talk to someone since
the phone's cord is broken.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.860
Mary backs away from the doctor before throwing
up in the nearby sink.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.160
With Mary looking pale and on the verge of
passing out, the doctor offers her some medicine.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.500
Mary refuses and instead closes the door to
the operating room.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.160
This is when she sees Ellen injecting Terry
with something.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.950
Horrified, Mary tries to flee only to find
the door locked.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.350
Mary turns around, and when Ellen sees her,
she tells the young lady to remove her shoes.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.120
Mary ignores Ellen and tries heading to the
other door, but it's locked, too.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.520
As she turns around, she finds Ellen in the
hallway, mad at her for wearing her shoes

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.970
inside the house.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.280
She even calls her "Kate."

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.560
Suddenly, Ellen slaps Mary and Dr. Huggins
appears in the hallway to remind her that

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.870
Mary isn't Kate.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.130
He also tells Ellen that Mary is Jane Voller's
twin, and that they're from the village.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:16.380
Ellen, who seems to be coming back to her
senses, remarks how Mary has grown.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.891
Ignoring what the couple is saying, Mary asks
Dr. Huggins what Ellen gave Terry, and he

00:10:19.891 --> 00:10:21.820
says that it's just an analgesic.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.770
He also adds that Ellen has worked as his
nurse for many years.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.460
As the couple walks away, he tells Mary that
he's constantly jogging Ellen's memory, giving

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.260
her small challenges every now and then.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.810
Mary goes to the living where she finds Terry
eating and watching television.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.470
She asks for his phone to call for help, but
Terry says he gave it to Ellen.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.360
Mary couldn't believe that Terry gave his
phone away, and when she is about to tell

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.430
him that Nathan is dead, the elderly couple
arrives.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.320
They all go to the dining area, where the
couple offers them tea, but Mary wants to

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.670
smoke instead.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.310
When Ellen stops her from smoking, Mary tries
going outside through another door, but it's

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.480
also locked.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.960
Dr. Huggins says he can't let them leave and
instead tells her to drink her tea while waiting

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.060
for the ambulance.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.550
Perplexed, Mary stands by the door as she
listens to Dr. Huggins' lecture about the

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.870
effects of smoking on an unborn child.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.330
He also thanks Mary for killing Gaz, saying
it wasn't easy to take a human life and that

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.760
because of her, he and his wife survived.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.210
Once again, he asks Mary to sit down and drink
her tea, and she finally obliges.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:17.600
As soon as Mary sits at the table, Dr. Huggins
starts talking about his late daughter, Kate.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.750
He tells Mary and Terry how much they loved
her and how they never once resented the girl

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.320
for having to take care of her even though
Kate occasionally made it hard for them.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.920
When Ellen is about to drink her tea, Dr.
Huggins stops her, and Ellen suddenly remembers

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.130
that it's for Mary.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.040
Dr. Huggins then stands and walks to a cabinet
to retrieve a scrapbook that contains detailed

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.780
information about the missing girls in their
place throughout the years.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.320
The scrapbook shows newspaper clippings and
pictures of the lost girls, including Mary's

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.910
twin sister, Jane.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.590
When she realizes that the elderly couple
poses a threat, Mary stops Terry from drinking

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.970
his milk, shocking everyone at the table.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.670
She asks for her phone back, saying she needs
to call Nathan's mother, but the doctor pretends

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.250
not to understand.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.760
Mary says Nathan had his phone, but it was
gone when she checked it in his pockets, so

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.840
she's sure that the couple has it.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.410
Mary starts yelling, saying that if it weren't
for Nathan, the elderly couple would be dead

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.040
and that Dr. Huggins lied about calling the
ambulance.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.060
She demands them to tell her what's going
on, but the doctor tries to calm her down

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.720
while Ellen pushes her to drink her tea.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.840
Fed up, Mary breaks everything at the table
and grabs a knife, demanding the couple to

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.840
open the door.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.180
Unfortunately, the doctor is too strong for
her, and he manages to take the knife from

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.180
Mary's hand.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.800
He grabs her by the hair and starts dragging
her out of the room.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.420
Dr. Huggins locks Mary inside a cupboard under
the stairs while Ellen screams profanities

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.520
at her.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.380
Terry could do nothing but watch.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.810
Inside the cupboard, Mary screams her lungs
out, begging Terry for help, but he won't

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:31.810
help her.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.200
She tries telling him that Nathan is dead,
but Terry only ignores her.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.170
In the couple's bedroom, Ellen tells her husband
that she wants to punish Mary for being bad.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.810
Dr. Huggins says he'll do it for her, but
Ellen insists on doing it herself.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:46.950
Downstairs, Mary tries to convince Terry that
Dr. Huggins has killed Nathan, but Terry still

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.410
refuses to believe her.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:52.290
Suddenly, he notices that his legs have gone
numb from what Ellen has injected him.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:56.850
Hallucinating that Mary is Jane, Terry opens
the cupboard, finally letting Mary out.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.390
Mary goes looking for the keys, and as she
does, Terry takes a peek inside the operating

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.920
room, where he sees Nathan's dead body.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.300
Still refusing to believe he's dead, Terry
looks for Mary and finds her in Kate's room,

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.110
about to escape through a window.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.170
He gets upset that Mary would leave without
him, but she insists that she was just about

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.630
to call him.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.630
Terry then tries to kiss her again, forcing
Mary to back away and fall onto the bed.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.730
Just then, a fumigation canister is thrown
inside Kate's room.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.040
She picks it up, and suddenly, the windows
close from the outside.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.820
They immediately leave the room to look for
a way to escape.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.390
Terry puts his arm around Mary for balance,
but with his legs going numb, he falls down

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.730
the stairs.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:34.310
While Mary's grabbing a knife by the stairs,
she notices someone walking by.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.810
But with the smoke around, she couldn't clearly
see.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.420
However, since Ellen is donning a protective
suit, she has no problem seeing and hitting

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.010
Mary with a whip while the girl can't even
defend herself.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.670
Ellen continues with her cruel lashes, but
Mary manages to hit the woman with a vase,

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:47.850
knocking her down.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:52.050
Mary wastes no time taking Ellen's gas mask
to put it on, and as she does, Ellen injects

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.140
her with some medication.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.660
Meanwhile, Terry is being dragged away, and
Mary does the same to Ellen before tying her

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.810
in the kitchen.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.980
She demands to know what she injected her
with and when Ellen refuses to speak, she

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.390
slaps her several times.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:06.310
Suddenly, Dr. Huggins arrives and takes her
mask off before strangling her.

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:09.820
Mary breaks free from the doctor by biting
his finger, and she eventually locks him out

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.890
of the room.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.290
The doctor loses his finger in the process
when Mary repeatedly tries shutting the door

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.510
with his hand between it and frame.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.490
Finally getting the upper hand, Mary puts
a knife to Ellen's throat and threatens to

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.730
kill her if the doctor doesn't give her the
keys.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:26.220
Unfortunately, the effects of the drugs start
to kick in, and Mary feels the relaxant working.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.870
Still, Mary demands to have the keys while
she hears the doctor talking to Terry, pleading

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:30.910
for his help.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.700
Mary orders him to leave the keys and Terry
outside the door, and he agrees.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.720
When Mary goes out, she finds Terry lying
on the floor with the keys in his pocket.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.440
With Mary dragging Terry by the feet, they
reach the garage, and Mary finally gets Terry

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.800
inside the van.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:49.685
As Mary prepares to drive, she sees the elderly
couple blocking the way, and that's when Terry

00:14:49.685 --> 00:14:50.685
suddenly shoots her.

00:14:50.685 --> 00:14:53.300
The doctor sits in the driver's seat, remarking
that Terry isn't a very good marksman.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.890
He comments about how he and Ellen were considering
letting Mary stay but then decided against

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:57.890
it.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.790
They leave Mary in the van to die as they
put Terry in the wheelchair.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:04.930
Dr. Huggins starts opening the safe, which
actually serves as a door to a secret room.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.040
Still breathing, Mary watches through the
rearview mirror as the couple takes Terry

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.351
inside the room with a girl chained to the
bed.

00:15:10.351 --> 00:15:13.580
The girl is revealed to be Mary's long-lost
twin, Jane, and she's even dressed to look

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.580
like Kate.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.440
The couple admits to abducting young girls
throughout the years in search of their late

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.730
daughter's replacement.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.380
The couple locks Terry and Jane inside, promising
them that they will be a happy family.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.450
In the end, Terry's mother finishes another
day of cleaning at the Huggins residence.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.760
She finds Dr. Huggins and Ellen in the garden
and thinks that they're simply gardening when

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.500
in reality, they're burying Mary, Gaz, and
Nathan's bodies.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.630
Terry's mother looks distraught, so Ellen
asks her what the problem is.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:40.010
She says that she hasn't heard anything from
Terry in a week, completely unaware that her

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:51.100
son is being held prisoner by the very people
she works for.
