00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.790
In today’s video, we will run through the
satirical horror movie American Psycho from

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.900
2000, where a wealthy New York City investment
banking executive, Patrick Bateman, hides

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.330
his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers
and friends as he delves deeper into his violent,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.020
hedonistic fantasies.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.840
Patrick Bateman is a 27-year-old investment
banker in a wall street firm of Pierce &amp; Pierce.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.600
He is a rich and successful man in people’s
eyes. But Bateman hides a big secret about

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.030
his life. The movie starts when we see him
and his associates in a fancy restaurant.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.260
They are talking about their co-worker Paul
Allen who happens to be dining a few tables

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.820
away. When the bill arrives, all of them flaunt
their business cards and call the $570 bill

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.510
reasonable. The group then leaves for a club.
The following day we see Patrick in his lavish

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.350
apartment. He narrates his life to us. According
to him, he likes to take care of himself by

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.309
eating nutritious food and exercising regularly.
Patrick also explains his morning routine

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.600
in detail. He likes to use various beauty
products to keep himself young and fresh.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.420
That day, Patrick goes to his office, and
after dismissing most of his appointments,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.771
he tells his assistant to wear a dress and
heels to the office. At night, Patrick and

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:20.420
his fiance, Evelyn, are in a restaurant with
their friends. He assumes that Evelyn is having

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.000
an affair with a guy named Timothy Bryce.
But he doesn’t care because he is also having

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.720
an affair with Evelyn’s best friend, Courtney
Rawlinson. Courtney is engaged to one of Paul’s

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.880
coworkers, Luis.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.030
Later, he calls Courtney and convinces her
to go out to dinner with him. She is high

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.130
on drugs, so he orders the food for her. The
next morning Patrick is in the conference

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.791
room of his office. Paul Allen, his co-worker,
mistakes him for a person named Marcus, but

00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:48.410
Patrick goes along with it. After Allen leaves,
Patrick shows off his business card to his

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.650
colleagues. The group starts comparing it
to their own. Patrick’s card is the best

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.740
in the lot until one of his colleagues shows
them Allen’s. He is petrified to see Allen’s

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.470
card better than his.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.049
On his way back home, he comes across a homeless
man and offers him money. As they are talking,

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.860
he takes a knife out of his briefcase and
stabs the man. He also kills the dog beside

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.690
him. Beneath his lavish and successful life,
Patrick Bateman is a serial killer. He has

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.170
no emotions except for greed, and his mask
of insanity is about to slip. He meets Allen

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.720
again at Evelyn’s Christmas party. He still
thinks Patrick is Marcus. They plan to meet

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.640
at a restaurant for dinner the following day.
Allen is already at the restaurant when Patrick

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.550
arrives. They talk as Allen gets progressively
drunk. He also calls Patrick a dork, thinking

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.790
he is talking to Marcus. After dinner, they
leave for Packris’s apartment. While Allen

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.320
sits on the couch, Patrick prepares to kill
him, but he is too drunk to understand. He

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.280
plays the song “Hip to be square,” brings
out a mirror-polished ax, and kills Allen

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.080
with it. Blood splatters everywhere as he
hits him with his ax several times.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.420
Patrick then sits down to smoke a cigar casually
in front of Allen’s corpse. He wraps the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.060
corpse in an overnight bag and drags it outside.
He meets an old friend on his way, but without

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.401
losing his cool, he dismisses them. Patrick
takes Allen’s body to his apartment. His

00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:08.961
plan is to fake Allen going on a trip, so
no one thinks his absence is suspicious. To

00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:12.790
pose this, he packs some of Allen’s clothes
and leaves a message that says he is on a

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.599
business trip to London on the answering machine.

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.260
Patrick is in his office the following day
when detective Donald Kimball comes to interview

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.190
him about Allen’s disappearance. Later,
Patrick brings two prostitutes, Christine

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.510
and Sabrina, to his apartment and has sex
with them. Late at night, they ask him if

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.720
they can leave, but he has other plans. He
takes out several knives and weapons to harm

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.120
their body. This arouses him sexually. The
girls leave in the morning with several injuries.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.000
Patrick is hanging out with his friends in
a bar when Courtney’s boyfriend Luis shows

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.750
them his new business card. It is better than
Patrick’s as well. This angers him, so he

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.940
goes after him into the bathroom and tries
to strangle him to death. But as Luis notices

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.540
him, he mistakes the gesture as a sexual advance
and tells Patrick that he has always loved

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.860
him. This surprises Patrick, so he quickly
leaves the restaurant.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.610
Detective Kimball is at Patrick’s office
the next day. He asks him several questions

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.720
about his last meeting with Allen. They decide
to meet for lunch in a week. That night he

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.630
is at Courtney's place. She seems distressed,
but he doesn’t notice it. Later, he does

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.099
drugs at a club with his associates. The following
day, he invites his assistant Jean to dinner

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.850
and asks her where she wants to go. Jean answers
Dorsia but is ready to go anywhere he takes

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.199
her. Patrick calls Dorsia and pretends to
book a table. He asks her to meet him at his

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.260
apartment at seven for drinks. Jean agrees.
At night, they meet at his place. While they

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.970
are talking, he points at her with a nail
gun from behind. But she doesn't notice. Just

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.960
then, he gets a voice message from Evelyn.
Jean realizes that Evelyn and Patrick are

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.450
still engaged, so she asks him if she should
leave. Patrick agrees and tells her that something

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.449
terrible might happen to her if she stays.

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.190
The next day, he meets detective Donald for
lunch. The detective tells him that there

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.310
were no suspects, so the case is called off.
Relieved, he goes to pick up the prostitute

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.490
Christine again. She refuses to come because
she had to go to the ER last time, but Patrick

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.000
convinces her with money. He also invites
another girl named Elizabeth. He takes them

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.890
both to Allen’s apartment instead of his.
He drugs the girls’ wine and convinces them

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.050
to have sex. While they are at it, Christine
notices him trying to kill Elizabeth and makes

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.030
a run for it. She tries to escape but comes
across several dead bodies of girls hidden

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.310
in different parts of the house. Now, Christine
is terrified. Patrick comes after her with

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.199
a chainsaw. As she falls, he bites her legs
like a maniac. She somehow manages to run

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:28.300
out of the room. A naked and bloodied Patrick
chases her with a chainsaw. She runs down

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.080
the stairs, and when Partick feels like he
cannot reach her in time, he drops the chainsaw

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.449
on her, killing her instantly.

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:38.050
The following day, Patrick is with Evelyn
in a restaurant, where he breaks off their

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.360
engagement. On his way back home, he uses
an ATM and sees a cat in the street beside

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.880
it. Taking his gun out, he is about to shoot
it when an old lady stops him. So, instead

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.830
of the cat, he shoots her. However, this time,
the police are around. Patrick tries to flee

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.930
from the scene but is stopped by the police.
This causes them to get in a shootout. He

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.020
blows up the police car killing all of the
policemen, and quickly runs away but enters

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.450
the wrong building. When he notices his mistake,
he kills the building receptionist and, on

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.770
his way out, kills a janitor too.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.580
He then runs to an office that he believes
is his. A police helicopter is looking for

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.020
him outside. Frantically, he calls his lawyer
Harold Carnes and leaves a message on Harold’s

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.389
answering machine. In the message, he confesses
his crime and reveals that he has killed almost

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:24.830
forty people, including several hookers, homeless
people, his old girlfriend, and others. He

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.860
has eaten some of their brains as well. Most
of his murders are documented in tapes. Patrick

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.520
also tells him to meet him at Harry’s bar.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.810
The next day, he goes to Allen’s apartment
again to find it completely clean and empty.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.110
A real estate agent is in the apartment who
tells him that it doesn't belong to Paul Allen

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.611
and asks him to leave. He goes downstairs
and calls Jean from a telephone booth. She

00:06:45.611 --> 00:06:49.690
notices the franticness in his voice, but
he dismisses her and tells her he won't be

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.850
at the office this afternoon. Jean gets suspicious
of him, so she goes through his drawers and

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.790
finds his journal. Meanwhile, Patrick goes
to a restaurant with his friends again, where

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.060
he finds lawyer Harold. He goes to him to
talk about his confession from last night.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.449
However, Harold mistakes him for another friend
and thinks his confession is a joke. Patrick

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:10.479
desperately tries to make him believe that
he killed Paul Allen, but Harold refuses and

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:13.790
tells him that he had dinner with Allen in
London just days ago.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.889
On the other hand, a horrified Jean finds
detailed drawings of Patrick’s crimes in

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:22.630
his journal. After talking to Harold, a confused
Patrick goes back to his friends and continues

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.009
chatting. The movie ends as Patrick’s voiceover
tells us that he did not get the punishment

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:31.759
that he was secretly hoping for. His confession
to the lawyer had made him feel better, but

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:34.580
now, that too was meaningless.
