this was a public hearing that would

00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
and it does make sense that stormfront
 

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:31.350 align:start position:0%

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
would build a fail-safe into cindy
 

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.509 align:start position:0%
would build a fail-safe into cindy
so<00:16:31.519><c> that</c><00:16:31.680><c> she</c><00:16:31.839><c> could</c><00:16:32.000><c> control</c><00:16:32.480><c> her</c><00:16:33.199><c> cindy</c>

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:35.430 align:start position:0%
so that she could control her cindy
could<00:16:33.680><c> have</c><00:16:33.839><c> exploded</c><00:16:34.399><c> stormfront's</c><00:16:35.040><c> head</c><00:16:35.279><c> at</c>

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
could have exploded stormfront's head at
 

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.590 align:start position:0%
could have exploded stormfront's head at

so<00:16:37.759><c> i</c><00:16:37.920><c> do</c><00:16:38.079><c> believe</c><00:16:38.320><c> that</c><00:16:38.720><c> she</c><00:16:38.959><c> does</c><00:16:39.199><c> hold</c><00:16:39.519><c> some</c>

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
