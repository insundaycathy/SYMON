00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.960
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m&nbsp;
going to explain an American teen fantasy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:15.920
comedy-drama film called “Pleasantville”,&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.600
At the beginning of the movie,&nbsp;
we see an advertisement on the TV&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.720
that boasts about an old black and white TV&nbsp;
show called Pleasantville. The organisers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.600
have conducted a Pleasantville trivia contest&nbsp;
for a chance to win a thousand dollars. 
&nbsp;

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.440
Somewhere else, lives a pair of twins named&nbsp;
David and Jennifer. Despite being twins, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.120
two are vastly different from each other and have&nbsp;
contrasting interests. David likes to read books,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.320
watch TV, and has only a few friends, while&nbsp;
Jennifer has no interest in her studies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.520
is outgoing, and spends most of&nbsp;
her time worrying about her looks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.640
Although the two go to the same school, they&nbsp;
are not particularly close to each other. 
&nbsp;

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.440
David is also a freak for the TV show&nbsp;
Pleasantville. Pleasantville is a black and white&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.320
sitcom from the 50s about an idealistic family of&nbsp;
the Parkers; George, his wife Betty and their two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.560
children, Bud and Mary Sue. David spends most of&nbsp;
his night watching the sitcom and is an expert on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.080
it; he can even recite every line from the whole&nbsp;
show. Unlike the Parker family, David’s family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.240
is not so perfect. His parents are divorced, and&nbsp;
his relationship with his sister is non-existent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.880
David plans to watch the Pleasantville marathon&nbsp;
and join the trivia in hope of winning the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.920
thousand dollars. However, the same night of the&nbsp;
trivia, Jennifer invites her crush and the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.120
popular guy in the school to come over for a movie&nbsp;
night. Their mother will not be home that day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.640
so it is the perfect opportunity for Jennifer. 
The night comes, and Jennifer and David both want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.080
to watch different things on TV. They fight over&nbsp;
the remote and accidentally break it. The TV&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.160
cannot be turned on now. Just then, the doorbell&nbsp;
rings, and Jennifer rushes to fetch her crush.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.520
But to her disappointment, it is a random&nbsp;
person who claims to be a repairman. The twins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.240
are doubtful because they hadn’t called anyone to&nbsp;
fix the remote that broke a few seconds ago. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.920
they let the man in any way. He randomly starts&nbsp;
asking David trivia questions about Pleasantville,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.520
and David answers them all correctly. The man is&nbsp;
impressed and gives them a heavy-looking remote.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.000
As the man leaves, the twins continue fighting&nbsp;
for the new remote and accidentally press a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.400
button. Suddenly, the two are sucked into the TV.&nbsp;
They are now in Parker’s living room, dressed as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.200
people from the 50s. The shocked siblings look&nbsp;
around and see everything in black and white. 
&nbsp;

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.280
Then, the same repairman appears on the television&nbsp;
and tells them that they are in Pleasantville.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.680
David freaks out and asks the man to let them&nbsp;
out, but the man insists the Pleasantville&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.920
world is much better than the real world they&nbsp;
live in. It turns out that David and Jennifer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.400
have replaced Bud and Mary Sue in the sitcom. The&nbsp;
twins have to live their life from now onwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.760
Their mother on the show, Betty, forces them&nbsp;
to eat a lot, as she does with her children.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.240
As they walk through the town of Pleasantville,&nbsp;
they see everyone is black and white and acts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.520
differently from the people they are used to.&nbsp;
David, who knows how the people in the sitcom act,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.160
has no problem adjusting to the new environment,&nbsp;
but Jennifer has no idea what is going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.200
They see a group of firefighters saving a&nbsp;
kitten stuck on a tree. The two find out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.480
that Pleasantville has no fire. As in the show,&nbsp;
the use of fire was never shown, so no one in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.440
Pleasantville knows that fire even exists.
Right after, Mary Sue’s love interest in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.520
show named Skip Martin passes by. Jennifer sees&nbsp;
the handsome boy and is instantly drawn to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.720
She has found a reason to enjoy&nbsp;
her stay at Pleasantville. 
&nbsp;

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.360
David and Jennifer even have to go to&nbsp;
the old fashioned school as Bud and Mary.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.480
David recognises all the characters and helps her&nbsp;
sister by introducing them to her from afar. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.800
tells her to go along with the plot of the sitcom&nbsp;
and not disturb the flow. Jennifer, as Mary, takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.280
the classes in her school and finds out that the&nbsp;
people there think Pleasantville is the only city&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.720
in the world. The road that leads out of the town&nbsp;
is in a circle that leads back to the town. Hence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.320
the people are oblivious to the outside world. 
Later, at recess, David sees that he is able&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.080
to score every time at basketball. The team is&nbsp;
perfect, similar to their character in the sitcom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.680
Skip approaches David to ask him if&nbsp;
he can take Jennifer out on a date.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.920
David tells him that she isn’t ready to date&nbsp;
yet. But Mary Sue going on a date with Skip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.640
was on the plot of the show, so David wants&nbsp;
Jennifer to go out with him at least once. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.640
warns her not to disrupt the original plot of the&nbsp;
show. Jennifer agrees and gets ready for the date.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.960
Meanwhile, David goes to work at a diner where&nbsp;
his boss is a friendly man named Bill Johnson.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.920
The diner is very popular in Pleasantville and&nbsp;
has a major role in the sitcom. Jennifer and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.800
Skip arrive at the diner for their date. Skip is&nbsp;
very different from the guys Jennifer is used to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.920
dating. She gets bored at the diner and tells&nbsp;
Skip to take her to a famous spot in the town&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.360
called the lover's lane. As the two set off,&nbsp;
David realises what his sister is trying to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.320
He tries to stop them but isn’t successful. 
The lover’s lane is a place where couples come to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.600
hold hands and watch the beautiful sky.&nbsp;
However, Jennifer has different plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.120
She starts to make out with Skip, who&nbsp;
is completely oblivious to the idea. 
&nbsp;

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.880
At home, Bill visits David after work. As&nbsp;
the two talk, the mother, Betty comes into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.040
the living room and locks eyes with Bill.&nbsp;
The two are attracted to each other. 
&nbsp;

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.280
Skip then drops Jennifer home and sees the colour&nbsp;
of a red rose nearby. He finds it weird because he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.240
has always only seen it in black and white. 
The following day at school, David notices Skip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.080
talking about his date with Jennifer&nbsp;
to everyone from his basketball team.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.360
All of them are shocked at the revelation. The&nbsp;
otherwise perfect basketball team cannot score&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.320
that day. Jennifer has changed the nature of the&nbsp;
characters. David asks her to keep everything in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.680
check, but she insists the people of Pleasantville&nbsp;
need a change. Because of Jennifer’s influence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.400
people in the town start seeing colours, Bill&nbsp;
doesn’t want to own a diner anymore, and more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.200
and more people start visiting the lover’s&nbsp;
lane. The town’s people, including the mayor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.680
grow suspicious of the sudden appearance of&nbsp;
colour in the town and are not happy about it. 
&nbsp;

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.800
One day, Betty asks Jennifer what goes on in the&nbsp;
lover’s lane and gets to know about the concept of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.640
making love. At night, she touches herself while&nbsp;
bathing and starts seeing colours all around. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.560
because of such changes, a tree outside the Parker&nbsp;
home starts to burn in flames. People, including&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.520
firefighters, do not know what to do because they&nbsp;
are new to the concept of fire. David instructs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.120
firefighters to put off the fire step by step and&nbsp;
manages to stop it from getting worse. He is later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.840
rewarded by the Mayor for his bravery. 
David’s friend from school named Margaret&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.880
gives him cookies as a present to express she&nbsp;
likes him. David has never had a girl like him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.480
so he is over the moon. Other teens ask David&nbsp;
how he knew about fire. David introduces them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.360
to the concept of reading books and getting such&nbsp;
knowledge from literature. He tells them the story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.640
of a famous novel, the adventures of Huckleberry&nbsp;
Finn. The book, which usually is blank,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.240
starts to fill with words as he tells the story.&nbsp;
The youngsters start visiting the library often to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.640
get the knowledge that David and Jennifer have.&nbsp;
The fathers of the town, including the mayor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.760
are not happy about the change and decide to do&nbsp;
something about it. The Mayor visits the father,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.560
George and includes him in the founding fathers’&nbsp;
council. He wants to work with him to implement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.080
strict laws against coloured people. George&nbsp;
happily agrees and calls Betty to meet the mayor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.720
However, Betty hides in the kitchen, seeing&nbsp;
that she is turning colourful as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.560
David finds her crying and helps her by&nbsp;
applying black and white makeup on her.
&nbsp;

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.800
One day, David brings books of old paintings&nbsp;
and art to the diner and shows them to Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.480
Bill is fascinated and discovers&nbsp;
that he is passionate about painting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.280
David also asks Margaret out and is happy when&nbsp;
she agrees. This is the first time someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.840
as attractive as Margaret has liked him. 
When David returns home, he sees the repairman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.640
who sent them to Pleasantville on TV trying to&nbsp;
communicate with him. The man claims that David&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.440
and Jennifer have changed the plot of the sitcom&nbsp;
completely. He wants David to return to his own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.400
world. However, David has grown used to his life&nbsp;
in Pleasantville. For the first time in his life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:18.320
he feels like he belongs somewhere. So, he turns&nbsp;
the TV off, refusing to go back. He then picks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.640
Margaret in his car and takes her to lover’s&nbsp;
lane, which has completely turned colourful,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.040
thanks to the bulk of lovers who come there. 
On the other hand, Betty is walking around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.640
town when she notices Bill’s paintings&nbsp;
displayed in front of the diner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.360
The different colours intrigue her, so she&nbsp;
goes inside to meet him. As the two talk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.840
Bill sees that Betty has turned completely&nbsp;
coloured and tells her she looks beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.200
Betty melts at the comment, but both of them know&nbsp;
they cannot take their conversation further. 
&nbsp;

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.080
Meanwhile, Jennifer is turning into the complete&nbsp;
opposite of herself from the real world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.280
She values her studies and doesn’t spend time&nbsp;
thinking about her looks. She even declines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.000
when Skip invites her to the lover’s lane. At&nbsp;
night, it starts to rain heavily. The people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.960
of Pleasantville have never seen rain and start&nbsp;
panicking. But eventually, they get used to it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.760
and enjoy the rain. When George returns home&nbsp;
from work, he sees that Betty is no longer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.360
there to serve him. He is furious and organises&nbsp;
an emergency meeting with the founding fathers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.360
All of them are mad about their wives and&nbsp;
children not obeying them like they used to. 
&nbsp;

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.840
The next day, Bill and Betty wake up in his&nbsp;
diner together. When Betty returns home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.080
George tries to make her come to the town&nbsp;
meeting, but Betty refuses. She says no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:33.120
to her husband for the first time in her life&nbsp;
and asks him to learn to cook dinner himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.600
George is shocked to witness his wife act like&nbsp;
that. The black and white people of the town are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.800
getting more intolerant of the coloured ones. The&nbsp;
founding fathers ban chromatic people altogether.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.120
People start to riot in the streets. Bill has&nbsp;
drawn a naked painting of Betty in the front&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.400
of his diner. The riots destroy the painting and&nbsp;
the diner too. The founding fathers also ban the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.840
reading of books, listening to loud music, and&nbsp;
using colourful paint. Betty, along with David,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.560
Jennifer, and other chromatic people, help&nbsp;
Bill clean up the mess caused by the riot. 
&nbsp;

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.720
David stands up as the leader of the coloured&nbsp;
people and promises to grant equal freedom to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.600
them. He and Bill paint a meaningful painting&nbsp;
on a wall as a silent protest. But they two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.440
are arrested because of the deed.
At the hearing, David and Bill tell the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.160
townspeople about how everyone deserves freedom&nbsp;
and equality. Their message touches everyone’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.960
heart, and suddenly, everyone in the court starts&nbsp;
to turn colourful. David shows the Mayor a mirror&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.400
to show him that he has turned colourful as well.&nbsp;
The entire town of Pleasantville has colour now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.720
Eventually, they start to progress from their&nbsp;
orthodox thoughts and look at the new way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.520
of living life. The circular road that led to&nbsp;
Pleasantville now connects it with other towns,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.280
connecting the people with the rest of&nbsp;
the world. After David’s work is done,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.840
he plans to return to his own world, but Jennifer&nbsp;
has formed a strong connection with the place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:53.360
so she decides to stay. David uses the remote&nbsp;
that had brought them there to go back home. 
&nbsp;

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.560
When he finally reaches home, he finds his mother&nbsp;
crying about her ruined life and her relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.040
with his father. Now that David has been through&nbsp;
so much in Pleasantville, he tells his mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.000
that life isn’t perfect. A clip of Pleasantville&nbsp;
shows us that the people there are much happier in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.800
colour than they were in black and white. George&nbsp;
and Betty are sitting on a park bench. He asks her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.360
what might happen next, and Betty replies that&nbsp;
she doesn’t know. As the camera pans towards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.720
George, we see he has changed into Bill. 
The movie gives us a beautiful message that life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.160
without ups and downs is stable but boring. Unlike&nbsp;
the black and white Pleasantville, our life is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.800
colourful and has a lot of difficulties but that&nbsp;
