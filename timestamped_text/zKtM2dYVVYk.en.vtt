00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.280
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.040
Today I will show you an Action, Sci-fi,&nbsp;
Thriller film from 2007, titled Next.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.720
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.640
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.480
Cris Johnson is a man with the unique ability&nbsp;
to see into his future. His ability lets him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.280
see two minutes ahead, aside from a vision&nbsp;
he once had of a woman walking into a diner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.400
Since there are no details other than the&nbsp;
time, he goes to the diner twice a day at 8:09,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.080
the time he saw in his vision, to wait for her to&nbsp;
arrive. To earn a living, he works as a small-time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.920
magician in downtown Las Vegas. Cris attracts&nbsp;
the attention of an FBI agent Callie Ferris.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.000
When he appears before a small audience, his&nbsp;
first trick is to find out where the man in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.800
white suit is from. Before letting him answer,&nbsp;
he says that he thinks he is a man from Seoul,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.680
and the man answers that he is indeed from&nbsp;
Korea. When his wife comes on stage, he drops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.480
her necklace into her drink without touching it.
He supplements his income by gambling and using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.920
his powers to win over and over again&nbsp;
against the house and only the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.520
Although he tries to do this in a low-key way, his&nbsp;
nonsensical gambling style attracts the attention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.560
of the casino security guards, who believe Cris&nbsp;
is cheating. Just as they are talking about him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.920
he looks up at the camera, like he&nbsp;
is letting them know, that he knows.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.360
As he is cashing out his chips, he uses his&nbsp;
foresight to prevent an impending robbery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.400
setting off a chase through the casino. Dozens of&nbsp;
security guards are after Cris, spotting him on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.280
the cameras. Cris explains the thing about the&nbsp;
future - every time you look at it, it changes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.160
because you looked at it. He eludes the pursuers&nbsp;
with clever tricks, such as cigarette smoke or a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.040
precise movement. Cris retreats to the restroom&nbsp;
and immediately changes his clothes to avoid the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.680
guards at the exit. Not at a single point of this&nbsp;
chase has he stood out. He steals a car. Which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.040
leads to a chase with the police. Cris&nbsp;
quickly shakes off with the help of a train.&nbsp;

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.240
Callie found out the nature of his&nbsp;
ability. It has nothing to do with luck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.400
He has shown a pattern of advanced&nbsp;
consciousness that is statistically impossible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.560
Callie wants to get him to help them try to&nbsp;
stop terrorists from detonating a nuclear weapon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.520
smuggled into the country. After reviewing the&nbsp;
casino tapes, Callie has discovered that he can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.720
see about 2 minutes into the future. Ferris&nbsp;
tracks Cris down, thanks to the LoJack GPS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.280
She explains to him the situation with the&nbsp;
terrorists and everything she knows about him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.240
and threatens Cris to help her. After seeing this&nbsp;
future, Cris runs away to avoid the confrontation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.000
Callie walks in and realizes she missed him by&nbsp;
seconds. Later that night, the casino's head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.560
of security is approached by two terrorists who&nbsp;
interrogate him about Cris before killing him.&nbsp;

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.760
The next morning Cris is back in the diner,&nbsp;
watching the clock, when he finally sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.440
Liz Cooper, the woman from his vision. After&nbsp;
imagining various advances, all of which fail,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.720
he intervenes when her ex-boyfriend (Kendall)&nbsp;
shows up and forces himself on her. Cris lets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.280
Kendall hit him to earn affection points with Liz&nbsp;
and eventually manages to strike up a conversation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.480
with her. Knowing she's on her way to Flagstaff,&nbsp;
Arizona, Cris convinces her to give him a lift.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.280
In the car, they talk about fate and how&nbsp;
Liz thinks a predetermined future is boring.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.160
Back at the diner, Callie learns from a waitress&nbsp;
that Cris is going to Flagstaff and pursues him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.920
At the same time, the terrorists at the docks,&nbsp;
concerned about the true nature of Cris's powers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.320
decide to get rid of him before the FBI can&nbsp;
use his abilities to expose their long-running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.880
schemes. Liz visits her students at a canyon&nbsp;
where she teaches once a week to wish one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.840
her students a happy birthday. As a birthday&nbsp;
present for the boy, Cris shows him a magic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.400
trick where he turns a rock into a lizard. Liz is&nbsp;
impressed and seems to take an interest in him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.120
Heavy rains come down and a washed out road&nbsp;
forces Cris and Liz to spend the night in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:47.840
hotel on the side of a canyon called Cliffhanger.&nbsp;
Cris sleeps in the car and makes Liz feel guilty.&nbsp;

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.880
Callie finds out Cris' whereabouts through&nbsp;
the video surveillance cameras. After tracking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.400
down the nuke to Los Angeles, she convinces her&nbsp;
superiors to let her bring Cris in. The terrorists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.880
who have been monitoring FBI also follow them&nbsp;
in hopes that the agents will lead them to Cris.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.320
After Liz showers at the hotel, Cris makes a rose&nbsp;
out of paper and lights it as one of his magical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.520
performances, then ensnares her and makes love&nbsp;
to her. Meanwhile, Callie and her team secure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.120
the perimeter of the motel. Agent Callie confronts&nbsp;
Liz while she is walking near the hotel. Claiming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.160
Cris is a dangerous sociopath, she asks her to&nbsp;
drug Cris so they can bring him in peacefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.800
When she returns to the motel, she gives Cris&nbsp;
hygiene products and while he is in the bathroom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.600
Liz tries to get herself to drug him. Cris shows&nbsp;
her a lot of affection and she stops him from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.560
drinking the drugged juice. Instead, Liz warns&nbsp;
Cris about Callie and explains what's going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.200
Cris steps out onto the porch to&nbsp;
pretend to be drugged. At the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.440
the terrorists have also secured the perimeter&nbsp;
and are trying to take Cris out with a sniper.&nbsp;

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.200
Cris tells Liz that he can see his future and&nbsp;
demonstrates it to her. When she asks why he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.680
is not helping the FBI stop the terrorists, he&nbsp;
tells her that he can not see the future except&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.880
for events that affect them. Cris gives Liz&nbsp;
instructions on how to escape. He gets out and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.240
jumps off a cliff to escape the FBI agents waiting&nbsp;
to arrest him. A sniper from the terrorists shoots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.840
at Cris. He dodges him with no problem. As&nbsp;
instructed, Liz sends the car down the hill.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.000
This destroys the water tower, causing a chain&nbsp;
effect. Debree begins to fall, stopping the agents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.760
in their tracks. Reaching the bottom, Cris is&nbsp;
intercepted by Callie. He saves her from the logs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.560
tumbling down the mountain, and while immobilised,&nbsp;
the agents of FBI manage to capture him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.440
After the terrorists see that the FBI&nbsp;
have caught him, they kidnap Liz instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.320
In custody, Cris is strapped to a&nbsp;
chair with his eyes held open and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.600
forced to watch television until he&nbsp;
has a vision that can help the FBI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.800
Expecting to see a report on the detonation of&nbsp;
the bomb, he instead sees a broadcast several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.360
hours in the future in which Liz is killed by a&nbsp;
bomb while tied to a wheelchair as bait for Cris.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.680
After the interrogation yielded no results, he is&nbsp;
taken to a holding cell. Before the guard leaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.240
he asks for a smoke and by using his ability&nbsp;
defeats everyone in hand-to-hand combat and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.840
escapes from the holding facility. He races to the&nbsp;
parking garage where he had his vision about Liz.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.000
A chase begins. Callie catches up with&nbsp;
Chris and offers to help rescue Liz.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.400
She explains to him that the people who kidnapped&nbsp;
her are the ones who want to detonate the bomb.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.880
They use her as bait to get to him. They&nbsp;
set a trap for one of the terrorists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.800
by pretending Cris was hit by his gunshot&nbsp;
and then get rid of him with a helicopter.&nbsp;

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.000
Cris foresees Liz being taken to the parking&nbsp;
lot in a van and looks at the licence plate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.360
He helps FBI track the terrorists to the port&nbsp;
where they are staying. Cris coordinates the FBI,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.720
how they should act and what will happen based on&nbsp;
his vision. FBI intercepts the van with Liz and a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.400
shootout ensues between the FBI and the terrorist&nbsp;
group. Cris tells Callie the perfect timing for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.520
shooting the gasoline barrels near the van so Liz&nbsp;
does not die and escapes captivity. In all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:59.200
chaos, he still keeps his cool and provides quick&nbsp;
information to the agents. Meanwhile, Liz tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.320
everything she can to escape the terrorists who&nbsp;
are looking for her, but is captured anyway. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:16.240
terrorists use Liz as a shield, boarding a ship&nbsp;
and planting motion detecting explosives along&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.280
the way. All of this is completely ineffective&nbsp;
against Cris whatsoever. We see countless futures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.440
of Cris searching the place for clues until he&nbsp;
finds Liz with the leader of the terrorists.&nbsp;

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
When Cris confronts the leader, he tells him&nbsp;
that he has seen all possible outcomes and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.880
none have been in his favor. Therefore, he&nbsp;
asks him to surrender peacefully. Since he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.360
already knows the answer to his own question, he&nbsp;
continues forward walking right up to the leader&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.560
dodging all bullets by seeing their trajectory.&nbsp;
After killing the terrorists and rescuing Liz,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.520
they discover that the bomb has already been&nbsp;
moved. Ferris shows Cris a seismograph, hoping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.560
that he will see quakes caused by explosions&nbsp;
before they happen. As he stares at the screen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.960
he realizes he has made a mistake and is&nbsp;
too late. The bomb explodes in the city,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.920
destroying it and them in the process. Yet Cris&nbsp;
and Liz are still asleep in their Arizona hotel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.720
before Liz goes outside and is confronted by&nbsp;
Agent Callie. Because of Liz's involvement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.720
in the events, Cris was able to see further&nbsp;
into the future and foresee what might happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.840
He calls Callie to make a deal, then says goodbye&nbsp;
to Liz and asks her to wait for him before heading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.320
outside to meet with Callie and help stop the&nbsp;
terrorists. Here is the thing about the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.200
Every time you look at it, it changes because&nbsp;
you looked at it. And that changed everything.&nbsp;

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:38.640
The end. Thank you for watching! Subscribe&nbsp;
