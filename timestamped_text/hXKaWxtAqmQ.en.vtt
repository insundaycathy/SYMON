00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.240
Welcome back to Movie Recaps. Today&nbsp;
I will show you a Russian horror and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.360
sci-fi film from 2020, called Sputnik.
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.080
It's 1983 and "Orbita-4" is in orbit around Earth,&nbsp;
carrying two cosmonauts. One of them is singing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.320
and is kidding with the other - Kostya that he'll&nbsp;
report him to mission control for not doing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.960
same. They chit chat about what they'll do when&nbsp;
they get home, while mission control checks up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.080
on them. Kostya opens the latch hocks and they&nbsp;
undock. The other sings again as they are getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.040
into the landing position, but something hits the&nbsp;
spaceship. They gain control back of the ship, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.200
the singing cosmonaut sees something in the window&nbsp;
moving outside of the ship and toward the hatch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.360
Later, a parachute is seen in the sky over Soviet&nbsp;
Kazakhstan. A man on a horse approaches the fallen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.000
spaceship. He lights a flashlight and finds one&nbsp;
of the cosmonauts dead on the side of the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.680
The other one is crawling out of the&nbsp;
ship, barely finding his footing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.200
as the man approaches him. When&nbsp;
the cosmonaut raises his head,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.080
blood is coming out of his mouth&nbsp;
and his eyes are completely black.&nbsp;

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.920
A woman is seen entering a conference room in&nbsp;
the Research Institute for Brain AMS in Moscow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.880
The room is being prepared for a hearing. The&nbsp;
board members come in and the hearing begins.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.600
Tatyana is being investigated about an&nbsp;
injury she possibly inflicted on a patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.600
Her colleagues from the board don't doubt her&nbsp;
methods, but still think that a certain level of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.400
negligence should be considered. She disagrees,&nbsp;
saying that the she did what needed to be done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.320
on a misdiagnosed patient. A man is observing the&nbsp;
hearing and later approaches Tatyana in the lobby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.880
He introduces himself as Colonel Semiradov&nbsp;
and asks for her consulting help on a patient,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.360
saying that he also runs a form of research&nbsp;
institute. She is a little apprehensive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.760
but becomes interested as he tells her&nbsp;
that he's also involved in neuropsychiatry.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.600
Semiradov tells her that he will take her to see&nbsp;
the patient, but if she doesn't want to work the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.280
case, he'll bring her back. On the way there in a&nbsp;
helicopter, they talk about the patient. She asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.400
for his medical files, but instead he gives her an&nbsp;
oral report. He tells her that the patient is one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.440
of the cosmonauts from Orbita-4 and explains that&nbsp;
certain things were left out of the media. Kostya&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.400
appears to be suffering from episodic amnesia, not&nbsp;
remembering the incident that happened in space,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.520
before the ship landed. She asks if she should&nbsp;
sign a non-disclosure agreement, considering that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.360
the cosmonaut, a Soviet national hero, might have&nbsp;
lost his mind. They arrive in Kazakhstan and take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.720
a car to the a Scientific Research institute. Once&nbsp;
there, Semiradov informs her that she can move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.440
freely in 90% of the institute and after she gets&nbsp;
her clearance she could get into the restricted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.520
area as well. They enter an elevator which takes&nbsp;
them to an observational room. Meanwhile, Kostya&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.400
is being hypnotized by a psychiatrist. Tatyana&nbsp;
observes the session from the other side of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.520
glass. The psychiatrist wants to get information&nbsp;
out of the cosmonaut, but he just kids with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.520
The doctor gets angry, saying he can't&nbsp;
help him if he doesn't let him help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.400
The man coughs and the doctor gets unnerved.&nbsp;
Kostya tells him that he can't be hypnotized,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.600
since only the most mentally strong can be sent to&nbsp;
space. Doctor Rigel walks into the other side of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.120
the room, greeted by Semiradov who tells Tatyana&nbsp;
that he's the research director of the institute.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.520
The cosmonaut bangs on the window and asks&nbsp;
what has happened to his colleague. Tatyana&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.840
asks what Colonel Semiradov needs and he tells&nbsp;
her that he needs her opinion on his condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.880
She walks on the other side of the window&nbsp;
and introduces herself. Kostya is happy for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.720
the change from Rigel. She offers him some tea,&nbsp;
which he takes and drinks. Tatyana observes all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.280
of his movements and tells him why she's there,&nbsp;
then asks him about the toy in the corner. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.080
replies that it's his, something having to do&nbsp;
with cosmonaut traditions. She asks him what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.960
happened during the mission, but he's weary of&nbsp;
doing it again. Since she hasn't read the files,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.720
he still tells her that the mission went&nbsp;
without a glitch until the landing procedure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.520
after which he can't remember anything, part&nbsp;
from waking up in the Institute. He realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.080
that she can't help him get out of there, so when&nbsp;
she says that she can at least help him, Kostya&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.400
gives her the name and number of his mother asking&nbsp;
Tatyana to inform her that he's alive and well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.280
She takes the tea and before she leaves, says&nbsp;
that it was a pleasure to meet him. When she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.560
hands the teacup to Rigel it burns his hands and&nbsp;
she explains to the Colonel that Kostya has PTSD&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.280
and that his sensory receptors or peripheral&nbsp;
nervous system might be damaged. After giving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.000
her evaluation, she asks to leave. Semiradov&nbsp;
tells her that she can leave in the morning.&nbsp;

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.480
The soldier taking her to her room tells her&nbsp;
that the Colonel would need to authorize her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.160
departure tomorrow. As they walk, they see a few&nbsp;
people working under supervision. To her question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.280
about them, the soldier replies that they are&nbsp;
prisoners, brought in to do hard labor. He takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.640
her to her room and says she's the only one in the&nbsp;
building. Tatyana gets into her room and unpacks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.040
then wants to make an outside call, only to be&nbsp;
told that no one can make those from the base,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.040
except Semiradov. That night, she's taking a bath&nbsp;
and a giant scar is seen on her back. She takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.720
some pills for the pain and goes to bed, but since&nbsp;
she can't sleep she goes out for a run. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.840
she runs into one of the prisoners. Once back&nbsp;
in her room, there's a knock on the door. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.520
Semiradov. He takes her back to the observation&nbsp;
room and asks her when was the last time she ate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.560
When she replies, he checks his watch and gives&nbsp;
the order to start. A glass window comes down in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.680
the cosmonauts chambers and more soldiers come in,&nbsp;
securing the door. Tatyana and the others watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.120
the security cameras as something starts happening&nbsp;
to Kostya's body. Suddenly, he falls from the bed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.640
and something is coming out of his mouth. The&nbsp;
blob transforms into an alien creature. Tatyana&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.760
is shocked. Semiradov asks her if she wants&nbsp;
to take a closer look. She goes to the glass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.360
window and waits for a sight of the creature.&nbsp;
It appears. She observes it and it observes her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.400
Tatyana reaches her hand out to it, but it jumps&nbsp;
at the window. She goes out of the room shocked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.160
and terrified. Semiradov runs to her and tells her&nbsp;
the creature is non-terrestrial. Tatyana wants to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.640
know if Kostya is aware that it lives inside&nbsp;
of him, but that doesn't seem to be the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.560
The Colonel wants her to find a way to separate&nbsp;
the host from the parasite or she could leave and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.440
sign the non-disclosure agreement. She asks why&nbsp;
he chose her for the task and he answers that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.040
is because she is willing to take risks. In his&nbsp;
mind that would save their national hero. Tatyana&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.080
asks for the videotapes of the creature, Kostya's&nbsp;
testimony and all the notes they have. She will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.040
need to have two sessions a day with him, one hour&nbsp;
each. The Colonel is content to have her stay.&nbsp;

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.560
Tatyana goes through the documents and finds out&nbsp;
that the cosmonaut was placed in a rehabilitation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.280
center first, but the creature emerged the first&nbsp;
night and killed a medical technician. Then they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.440
brought him to the facility and started trying to&nbsp;
separate the man from the creature, though nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.560
has worked thus far. Without the creature inside&nbsp;
of him, the cosmonaut's vital signs drop, but with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:40.240
the creature inside, he has amazing capabilities&nbsp;
of regeneration. When the creature is incubating,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.360
it takes up very little space inside of Kostya's&nbsp;
body. And outside of the cosmonaut it can reach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.560
up to a meter and a half. Exiting his body,&nbsp;
it releases a toxin that knocks out Kostya&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.840
and once it exits, it can stay out for an hour&nbsp;
and 40 to 50 minutes. It's exiting schedule has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.120
remained consistent every night. Tatyana pegs&nbsp;
the question, is it a parasite or a symbiote?&nbsp;

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.440
Kostya is seen exercising in a gym,&nbsp;
under the supervision of a doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.800
He tells him not to exert himself too much.&nbsp;
The cosmonaut says he feels generally good,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.080
but that he just has a small tickle in his throat.
Later, Tatyana is looking through the footage of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.640
the creature and is taking down some numbers.&nbsp;
Rigel comes in and she asks for the whereabouts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.840
of Kostya's son, but he doesn't really answer.&nbsp;
Then, she asks what the creature feeds on and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.160
tells her that it feeds on the same things&nbsp;
that Kostya eats. She tries to establish a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.320
rapport with the doctor, but he dismisses her&nbsp;
attempts and tells her to talk to the Colonel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.800
She calls the orphanage where Kostya's son&nbsp;
is staying from Colonel Semiradov's office.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.840
A paralyzed child is seen getting up and going to&nbsp;
get something, but a nurse catches it in the act&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.440
and stops it, scolding it. The next day, Tatyana&nbsp;
comes into Kostya's room for their session. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.200
tells him that the people who brought her to the&nbsp;
Institute think that he has lost his mind and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.760
he's killed his co-pilot. Rigel and the Colonel&nbsp;
are listening from the other side and the doctor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.880
isn't happy about her questions, while the Colonel&nbsp;
is confused. The cosmonaut is confused that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.960
would think that about him and if that's the only&nbsp;
reason why he's being held behind armored glass.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:13.360
She asks him who he really is. He's answer&nbsp;
- a hero. Tatyana antagonizes him over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.120
heroism of spaceflight and quickly&nbsp;
moves on to ask him about his son,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.920
telling him his abandoned him. He's offended&nbsp;
and asks her to leave the session. On the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.160
side of the window, she tells them to test his&nbsp;
endocrine system, thinking that if they understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.760
his hormone levels under stress, they'll be&nbsp;
able to figure out what the creature eats.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.720
Next, she asks the Colonel to move him into the&nbsp;
civilian area during the day, so that they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:40.160
get a more realistic clinical picture. Semiradov&nbsp;
abides her request and gives Kostya a normal room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.360
Tatyana comes into his room and apologizes,&nbsp;
explaining why she did what she did in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.000
session. He tells her that he didn't know about&nbsp;
the boy, that he was informed about his existence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.520
when his mother died, one week before the mission.&nbsp;
Before she leaves, he asks her one more thing - to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.080
tell him why he's really being kept there.&nbsp;
However, Tatyana can't answer that question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.680
That night, she goes into the observation room to&nbsp;
see the alien creature. She tries tapping on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.560
window to get it's attention, but then crouches&nbsp;
down and waits for it to appear. When it does,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.160
she lies down and it mimics her behavior. Tatyana&nbsp;
disturbs the cosmonauts toy when she stands up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.200
she notices the way the creature looks at it, so&nbsp;
she asks to go inside the room. The Colonel allows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.880
it, so she is put in a protective suit. She enters&nbsp;
the room and puts the toy down for the creature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.280
It immediately goes to it and coils around&nbsp;
it. Tatyana wants to touch the creature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.480
but she slips and she falls. The creature grabs&nbsp;
her and drags her in, so the general flashes it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.280
with lights and Tatyana is taken away from the&nbsp;
room. The Colonel then goes to face the creature.&nbsp;

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.520
That night, Tatyana is in her room and the Colonel&nbsp;
comes inside uninvited. She proceeds to explain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.600
to him what she learned from the incident with&nbsp;
the toy. She thinks that the creature and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.840
cosmonaut share the same consciousness because of&nbsp;
the way it reacted to the toy that means a lot to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:01.040
Kostya. Furthermore, she thinks that every night&nbsp;
it spends more time outside of Kostya's body and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:06.240
eventually it won't need him anymore. Tatyana&nbsp;
asks the Colonel to take them to Moscow, but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.160
refuses, knowing that won't be possible because&nbsp;
of how much they don't know about the creature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.280
Later, she goes to talk to Rigel and notices&nbsp;
something wrong with one of the videotapes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.200
He says it's a glitch, but she hits him with&nbsp;
the question about the difference in the hormone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.200
levels of the cosmonaut between day and night.&nbsp;
She thinks they feed the creature something that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.760
they're not sharing with her. Rigel tells&nbsp;
her to leave while she still can. But she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.080
thinks he wants a Nobel Prize and offers to&nbsp;
help him get it without her own accolades.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.080
Tatyana asks for the missing information to be&nbsp;
given to her without the Colonel's knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.840
Rigel hides her in his vehicle and sneaks her into&nbsp;
the restricted part of the facility. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.400
Kostya is being given sedatives, knocked out and&nbsp;
then wheeled back into the observational room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.280
Rigel parks the car inside the facility&nbsp;
and gives Tatyana night goggles, telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.400
her the battery lasts for only ten minutes. He&nbsp;
leaves the car and a giant cage can be seen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.320
with a few soldiers taking out a prisoner&nbsp;
from a truck and putting him inside of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.120
They turn the lights out and they all put on night&nbsp;
goggles. The creature has left Kostya's body and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.160
it's been guided to the cage. Tatyana sees it&nbsp;
from the car, as it goes toward the prisoner, then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.040
jumps it and rips his head off. She makes a sound&nbsp;
and one of the soldiers hears her inside the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:20.320
Rigel diverts the soldiers attention and he&nbsp;
doesn't find her. Later, he drives her back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.960
at the dormitory and gives her some water, as&nbsp;
well as some additional information. He found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.920
out that the creature feeds on cortisol, the fear&nbsp;
hormone that's released in the brain. But he tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.720
her that feeding it humans was the Colonel's idea.&nbsp;
She leaves the car telling him that he's a coward.&nbsp;

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.000
The next day, Tatyana asks Kostya to&nbsp;
go for a run with her. As they run,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.840
she tells him about the creature and that they&nbsp;
need help from the government to separate them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.080
but he runs back. He tells her to find out&nbsp;
if she's being followed and meet him in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.440
block at 1 AM. That night, they give him his&nbsp;
pills, but when they leave he throws them up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.480
He crushes up the pills and puts them in his tea.&nbsp;
Then, he leaves his room and chats up the nurse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.280
that's guarding him, asking her to come inside&nbsp;
and watch a movie with him. She falls asleep on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:09.760
his shoulder. Kostya takes apart the TV and takes&nbsp;
the magnet out. He meets with Tatyana. Then, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.240
places the magnet on the camera which will create&nbsp;
an error. The guard sees that there's something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.240
wrong and comes down to check the camera, but&nbsp;
when he doesn't find anything he leaves and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.200
can freely pass in front of it. Kostya and Tatyana&nbsp;
go to the freezer room where he sees the bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.400
There are scans of his body there also. She&nbsp;
asks him if he can feel the creature inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.040
He says that he is the creature and that he can&nbsp;
remember everything in detail of what it has seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.720
Kostya tells her that if Semiradov knew he would&nbsp;
never let him go. His co-pilot is there too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:44.160
but he's alive. He begs Tatyana to help him,&nbsp;
by enduring two more weeks in the Institute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.880
until a review board from Moscow arrives and he&nbsp;
can be set free. She asks him how he could endure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.520
the creature killing people for two more weeks.&nbsp;
But, he asks her what she would've done in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:59.840
stead. Kill herself? Tatyana answers yes. Kostya&nbsp;
doesn't want to be guilty for feeding the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.920
people or to die there after all that he's&nbsp;
been through. He wants to live and get his son.&nbsp;

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.800
Meanwhile in the orphanage, the child goes to&nbsp;
get a package and the nurse finds it again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:15.040
It scratches her and she calls it an invalid.
Back at the Institute, Tatyana is returning to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.840
room as two soldiers corner her and take her to&nbsp;
the offices of the Colonel. They argue about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.760
morals of the situation with the creature, with&nbsp;
him firmly believing that he's doing the right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.960
thing in the name of peace. Tatyana doesn't think&nbsp;
that human sacrifice is needed, but the Colonel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.520
tells her what kind of prisoners the men are. He&nbsp;
suggests they go to the feeding together so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.480
she could see it up close. At the feeding ground,&nbsp;
two prisoners are brought inside the cage and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.840
creature is let in. It keeps getting closer to the&nbsp;
men and Tatyana begs the Colonel to stop, saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.800
she'll find another way to feed it. Then she&nbsp;
asks to be let inside the cage with the creature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.840
She starts singing the same song she heard Kostya&nbsp;
sing before and the creature calms. Rigel and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.320
Colonel watch her do it, as the doctor exclaims&nbsp;
that the creature has adapted, that it can hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:04.000
now. While Tatyana is singing to the creature,&nbsp;
Kostya is seen reacting in his room as well, not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.120
unconscious anymore. One of the prisoners undoes&nbsp;
his restraints and the creature hears him move.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:14.720
It attacks him and kills him. After the feeding,&nbsp;
the Colonel asks Tatyana if Kostya can control the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:20.480
creature. She tells him that he can't do it yet.&nbsp;
With her help, Semiradov thinks, that eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.640
they will learn how to control the creature.&nbsp;
He asks her to put their differences aside.&nbsp;

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:30.320
The next day, Tatyana is working in the&nbsp;
room with the co-pilot, when Rigel comes in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.520
She starts talking to him in Latin, telling him&nbsp;
to help her and Kostya escape. He doesn't want to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.720
but she tells him to man up. Later, Rigel brings&nbsp;
her the sedatives she needed, but asks her not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.000
to tell anyone he helped her. She walks over&nbsp;
to the guard and sedates him. Tatyana asks the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.600
doctor to help one more time. He comes with her&nbsp;
to get Kostya. When she goes inside his room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.440
she finds him on the floor. She tells him&nbsp;
that the Colonel will do anything to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.680
the creature there. Moreover, she's figured&nbsp;
out a way to get the creature out of him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.280
by injecting him with a combination of&nbsp;
drugs that will mimic a specific disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.080
He doesn't want to do it, afraid that the creature&nbsp;
has adapted and that it will survive out of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.240
Furthermore, he thinks the creature has&nbsp;
saved his life and tells her to run,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:17.520
because it chose him for a reason. It was his&nbsp;
punishment for abandoning his son. She tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:22.320
his son's name and age, so he changes his mind and&nbsp;
goes with her. The doctor tells them that there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.680
a car outside and gives her the keys. Tatyana asks&nbsp;
him to come with them, but he's decided to stay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.680
The two of them leave and Rigel goes to&nbsp;
the Colonel's office to make a call to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:36.800
the authorities and give them information about&nbsp;
the Institute. Simultaneously, another soldier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:42.000
finds the sedated guard. They check the footage&nbsp;
and see that Tatyana and Kostya are running.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.280
The Colonel orders a response team to be sent,&nbsp;
to bring back Kostya alive and terminate Tatyana.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:52.640
The response team finds and stops them. Back at&nbsp;
the office, Rigel is still on the phone, when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.600
someone tries to come inside. He ends the call&nbsp;
the moment the Colonel gets inside the office.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.400
The Colonel kills him. Meanwhile, Tatyana&nbsp;
and Kostya are hiding from the soldiers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.040
when he asks for the syringe with the drugs. She&nbsp;
throws it at him and he shoots the drugs in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.240
heart. The creature leaves his body and faces off&nbsp;
with the soldiers. They shoot at the creature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.800
but it starts killing them. Tatyana drags&nbsp;
Kostya to a car and they escape the compound.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:23.040
Eventually, the Colonel goes to face the creature.&nbsp;
He drops a smoke bomb and starts shooting at it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.680
They're both hurt, but the Colonel shoots at&nbsp;
it again. At the same time, Kostya coughs up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:33.040
blood in the car. Tatyana realizes that he won't&nbsp;
survive without the creature. He says that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.600
can still escape, but she drags him out of the&nbsp;
car. The Colonel reaches them and asks her if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.560
she changed her mind. She says that they have&nbsp;
become fully symbiotic and can't be separated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.960
as the soldiers take the creature out of the&nbsp;
trunk. The Colonel drops the gun she was holding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:52.080
and the soldiers open the creature's enclosure.&nbsp;
The Colonel incapacitates her, but Kostya manages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:56.960
to control the creature and it kills the soldiers.&nbsp;
He goes after the Colonel next and kills him too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:02.400
Tatyana goes to check if Kostya is still alive&nbsp;
as the creature crawls to them. It doesn't kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.120
her and gets back into Kostya's body. She tells&nbsp;
him that she can separate them if she can get him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.960
to Moscow. Suddenly, Kostya kills himself, as the&nbsp;
authorities Rigel called for arrive at the scene.&nbsp;

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.760
Tatyana is going to Rostov, where&nbsp;
the orphanage with Kostya's son is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.480
In a flashback, the kid comes back for the&nbsp;
package. The nurse finally acknowledges its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.600
persistence and gives it the package. It&nbsp;
opens it to find sneakers inside. Tatyana&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.000
walks inside the orphanage and tells the guard at&nbsp;
reception that she's there to adopt Kostya's son.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:37.680
Meanwhile, the child is putting on the sneakers&nbsp;
and stands up from its wheelchair. The nurse says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.160
that everything will be alright and the child&nbsp;
turns and tells her that its name is Tatyana.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.600
In the present, she's waiting outside for the boy.&nbsp;
He comes out and she greets him. They embrace.
