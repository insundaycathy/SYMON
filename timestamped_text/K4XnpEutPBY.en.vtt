00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.900
The characters in this film have no names (with some exceptions) and thus they shall

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.140
be referred to by number or by occupation.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.200
Juror #1 is a assistant high school
American football coach.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.020
he's the Jury foreman who's in charge of the
whole deliberation process.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.720
Juror #2 is a meek and unpretentious bank worker,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.460
although initially rather cowardly,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.580
becomes far more courageous in the second part.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.660
#3 is a businessman, and a rather distraught father

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.580
opinionated, disrespectfuly, and very angry.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.340
#4 is a rational, unflappable, analytical stock broker, who is focused on the facts.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.000
Juror #5 is a man who grew up in the slums.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.920
Other than that, we don't know much about him--although he doesn't take kindly to insults toward "slum boys".

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.300
#6 is a house painter; tough guy, blue collar, very principled and respectful

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.540
--although willing to come to fists.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.380
Juror #7 is a wise-cracking salesman, and is a Yankees fan.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.480
However, he has little-to-no investment in the case.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.880
Juror #8 is an architect, and really, he's the protagonist of the film.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.520
The guy who propose that the boy may not be guilty.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.120
#9 is a wise and observant senior who gives the benefit of the doubt.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.200
Juror #10 is a garage owner; pushy, and loud-mouthed, as well as very bigoted.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.380
Juror #11 is a European watch-maker, who became an American citizen;

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.900
very polite, very wise, and also making a point of speaking proper English.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.240
Finally #12 is a wise-cracking advertising executive;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.900
an individual who flip-flops in his decision of guilty and not-guilty.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.660
In a preliminary vote, all jurors vote "guilty"
except Juror 8, who argues that the boy deserves

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.850
some deliberation.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.250
This irritates some of the other jurors, who
are impatient for a quick deliberation, especially

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.810
Juror 7, who has tickets to the evening's
Yankees game, and Juror 10, who demonstrates

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.240
blatant prejudice against people from slums.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.620
Juror 8 questions the accuracy and reliability
of the only two witnesses and the prosecution's

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.350
claim that the murder weapon, a common switchblade
(of which he possesses an identical copy),

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.670
was "rare".

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.000
Juror 8 argues that reasonable doubt exists
and that he therefore cannot in conscience

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.780
vote "guilty", but concedes that he has merely
hung the jury.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.849
Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot - from which
he will abstain - and agrees to change his

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.420
vote if the others unanimously vote "guilty".

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.249
The ballot is held and a new "not guilty"
vote appears.

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:26.349
An angry Juror 3 accuses Juror 5, who grew
up in a slum, of changing his vote out of

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.780
sympathy towards slum children.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.260
What made you change your vote?

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.600
He didn't change his vote

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.280
I did

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.659
Juror 8 argues that the noise of a passing
train would have obscured the verbal threat

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.239
that one witness claimed to have heard the
boy make to his father: "I'm going to kill

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.469
you", as well as arguing that this phrase
often is used by people who do not mean it

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:44.280
literally.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.180
Juror 11 also changes his vote, believing
the boy would not likely have tried to retrieve

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.359
the murder weapon from the scene if it had
been cleaned of fingerprints.

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.579
Jurors 5, 6, and 8 question the witness's
claim to have seen the defendant fleeing 15

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.379
seconds after hearing the father's body hit
the floor, since he was physically incapable

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.049
of reaching an appropriate vantage point in
time due to a limp caused by a stroke.

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.939
An angry Juror 3 shouts that they are losing
their chance to "burn" the boy.

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.499
When Juror 8 accuses him of being a sadist,
Juror 3 lunges at him and yells "I'll kill

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:16.549
him, I'll kill him!", while Jurors 1 and 7
try to calm him down.

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.810
Juror 8 calmly retorts "You don't really mean
you'll kill me, do you?", securing his earlier

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.810
argument.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.419
Jurors 2 and 6 change their votes, tying the
vote at 6–6.

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:30.230
A rainstorm then strikes the city, threatening
to cancel the game for which Juror 7 has tickets.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.780
Juror 4 doubts the boy's alibi of being at
the movies, because he could not recall it

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.249
in much detail.

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:40.169
Juror 8 tests how well Juror 4 remembers previous
days, which he does, with difficulty.

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.919
Juror 2 questions the likelihood that the
boy, who was nearly a foot shorter than his

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.519
father, could have inflicted the downward
stab wound found in the body.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.120
Next, Jurors 3 and 8 conduct an experiment
to see whether a shorter person could stab

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.620
downwards on a taller person.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.620
The experiment proves the possibility, but
Juror 5 steps up and demonstrates the correct

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.209
way to hold and use a switchblade; revealing
that anyone skilled with a switchblade, as

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.069
the boy would be, would always stab underhanded
at an upwards angle against an opponent who

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.260
was taller than they, as the grip of stabbing
downwards would be too awkward and the act

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.489
of changing hands too time-consuming.

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.349
Increasingly impatient, Juror 7 changes his
vote to hasten the deliberation, which earns

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.349
him the ire of Jurors 3 and 11, both on opposite
sides of the debate.

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.889
Juror 11, an immigrant from Europe, presses
Juror 7 about using his vote frivolously,

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.180
until Juror 7 admits that he truly believes
the boy is not guilty.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.080
Then, Jurors 12 and 1 change their votes,
leaving only three dissenters: Jurors 3, 4,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.080
and 10.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.240
Outraged, Juror 10 vents a torrent of condemnation
on slum-born people, claiming they are no

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.220
better than animals who kill for fun.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.230
Offended, Juror 5 and Juror 11 turn their
backs to him.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.730
All jurors soon follow, except for Juror 4.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.430
Confused by the reactions to his rant, Juror
10 pleads: "listen to me.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.690
Listen."

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.920
Juror 4, the only juror still facing him,
tersely responds: "I have.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.300
Now sit down and don't open your mouth again."

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.520
Juror 10 then humiliatingly sits down in a
corner by himself.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.600
When the remaining "guilty" voters are pressed
to explain themselves, Juror 4 states that,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.230
despite all the previous evidence, the woman
from across the street who saw the killing

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.600
still stands as solid evidence.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.470
Juror 12 then reverts his vote, making the
vote 8–4.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.850
Juror 9, seeing Juror 4 rub his nose (which
is being irritated by his glasses), realizes

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.600
that the woman who allegedly saw the murder
had impressions in the sides of her nose,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.350
indicating that she wore glasses, but did
not wear them in court out of vanity.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.430
Other jurors, including Juror 4, confirm that
they saw the same thing.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.730
Juror 8 adds that she would not have been
wearing them while trying to sleep and points

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.960
out that on her own evidence, the attack happened
so swiftly that she wouldn't have had time

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.030
to put them on.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.900
Jurors 12, 10, and 4 change their vote to
"not guilty", leaving only Juror 3.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.370
Juror 3 gives a long and increasingly tortured
string of arguments, building on earlier remarks

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.292
that his relationship with his own son is
deeply strained, which is ultimately why he

00:05:44.292 --> 00:05:45.650
wants the boy to be guilty.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.090
He finally loses his temper and tears up a
photo of him and his son, but then breaks

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.950
down crying and changes his vote to "not guilty",
making the vote unanimous.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.250
The jurors then leave the room to reveal their
verdict to the judge.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.120
In a show of compassion, Juror 8 helps a distraught
Juror 3 with his coat as they head out.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.450
Outside, Jurors 8 (Davis) and 9 (McCardle)
exchange names and all of the jurors descend

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.920
the courthouse steps to return to their individual
lives.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.220
Thank you for watching this episode of Cinema Summary, we hope you enjoyed it.
