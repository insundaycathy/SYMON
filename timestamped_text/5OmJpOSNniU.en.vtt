00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.620
If your friend wanted you to join them to
explore the gates of hell underneath the catacombs,

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.730
what would you do?

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.860
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
the characters, see if we can make better

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.090
decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat
the hell caves in, As Above So Below.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.689
If you think you have a better way, let me
know in the comments!

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.220
If you like these how to beat videos, consider

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.909
Before we ridicule the characters for being
morons for the next 20 minutes, I want to

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.750
say thank you to everyone for being a part
of this channel.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.250
I love talking about this stuff, and it’s
cool to see that so many other people do too.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.520
So yah, thank you!

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.990
Alright, let’s get to it.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.530
We start out following a wannabe Lara Croft
who trespasses into an Iranian cave in search

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.370
of historical treasures.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.680
Apparently these treasures are worth dying
for, because the Iranian military is just

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.350
about to demolish the cave she’s going into.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.300
The timing works out though, because in mere
seconds, she finds the lost satanic statue

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.329
that her dad was looking for his whole life.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.739
She’s forced to retreat when the demolition
countdown draws down.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.520
In her escape she runs into a random dude
hanging from the ceiling.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.979
It’s pretty creepy.

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.890
Before she can process what the fuck is going
on, the cave starts exploding.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:27.460
Scarlett makes it out of the cave just in
time, narrowly avoiding being buried alive.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.729
Thanks for telling me that now.

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.270
And if that’s the case, why are you putting
on open tours to what is essentially a map

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.890
for finding the stone?

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.280
How do you even know that everyone who chased
Flamel’s stone died.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.020
Have you already shown this map to lots of
other people, which led them to their deaths,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.240
if so, why are you putting on open tours to
it?

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.880
Then again, if everyone looking for it is
as reckless as Scarlett, i’m not sure it’s

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.490
a mystery why everyone’s ending up dead.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.979
We cut over to a much more cheery Scarlett,
being interviewed at an archaeological dig

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.100
site in Paris.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.819
I guess seeing the apparition of a dead guy
hanging from the cave ceiling where she found

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.640
a mysterious satanic statue was something
she didn’t feel the need to reflect on at

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.640
all.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.520
I’m gonna fast-forward through a lot of
Nicolas Cage National Treasure stuff here,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.970
but basically Scarlett is still hunting for
the philosopher's stone, which is a mythical

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.140
substance that was said to turn base metal
into gold and grant humans immortality.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.070
From all the raging clues they have, they
deduce where the stone might be.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.290
Naturally, it’s in a pretty inconvenient
location.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.720
They’d just need to go down into the catacombs,
hop over the off-limits barriers, crawl through

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.750
some bone-filled corridor, slip past the gates
of hell without anyone noticing, and carefully

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.550
snatch the stone while tossing a bag of sand
in its place.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.260
Personally, if I was looking for the immortality
stone, which our previous tour guide said

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.780
is a death sentence, then I started seeing
apparitions of dead people, and the next step

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.840
in the journey was to enter the gates of hell,
I think I'd take a knee, grab an eclair and

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.960
visit the Eiffel Tower instead.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.530
But Scarlett’s not going to be phased by
this, I mean earlier she jumped into a cave

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.560
that was about to be demolished in minutes.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.250
Scarlett and Benji, her cameraman do some
recon by joining a tour of the catacombs.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.460
A stranger that’s kickin it in the catacombs
overhears Scarlett, and tells her about a

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.790
group that can help them into the off-limits
area.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.850
Sounds legit.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.250
The tour guide distracts them by urging them
to stay with the group, and when they look

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.600
back, the guy had Jason Bourned out of there.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.210
In the time before they looked back he definitely
could have left through that right corridor,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.710
but he’d have to be really quick and sneaky,
which is odd because he was originally just

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.870
chilling with his Etch-A-Sketch.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.680
Even if I wanted to continue to find the stone,
I don’t think I'd want to take the advice

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.900
of some sneaky strange dude in the catacombs.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.630
That sounds like a good way to get Taken,
and Benji doesn’t seem to have the very

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.430
particular set of skills needed in that situation.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.880
Bringing in outside help and leading an official
expedition to find and excavate the philosopher’s

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.880
stone from deep inside the catacombs is unlikely
to be approved, so going in secretly is their

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.350
only real option.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:21.359
They hit up the club to find Papillon so he
can help them enter the off-limits area.

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.700
What the fuck is up with that chick.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.470
There must be some good shit at the party.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.890
Okay, she's obviously infatuated with us,
but why.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.100
No random girl at a club is going to check
you out like that unless you’re Magic Mike.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.050
It’s probably a good idea to keep an eye
on your drink so you don’t wake up in a

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.139
bathtub with a kidney missing.

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.120
Lara croft finds her new tour guide to lead
them into the gates of hell, oh wait, she

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.830
didn’t mention that part to Papillon, oh
well.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.030
Only George, Benji, and Scarlett know that
they are headed towards the mythological gates

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.760
of hell, but Scarlett is the only one that
has actually seen a ghost on her quest to

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.940
find the stone.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.120
Nobody but Scarlett has any reason to believe
that there might be terrible things awaiting

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.050
them, and she might just think her mind played
tricks on her.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.880
Considering the stone and treasures would
be a huge discovery, and there’s not really

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.260
a strong reason to believe they will actually
enter hell, calling the hunt off is not reasonable.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.570
It is dangerous though.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.070
While they prepare to enter the catacombs,
Benji asks one of Papi’s team members a

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:37.790
quick last minute question.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:50.900
I’m glad safety is coming first.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.690
This stone has never been found, and I don’t
think anyone else is hot on Scarlett’s trail.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.889
I think they can afford a few days to mull
over the plan.

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:04.290
I’m no Les Stroud, but I am known for my
pro Wiki-how survivor tips.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.870
Seriously though, this knowledge is 100% relevant
to the crew's survival as you’ll see later.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.530
The Paris catacombs is a nearly 200 mile long
maze of pitch black tunnels that are easy

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.780
to get lost in.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.550
In 2017, two teenagers got lost, and it took
a whole Fire Brigade and cataphile operation

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.800
to rescue them 3 days later.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.710
Cataphiles are people that frequently explore
the off-limits areas.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.770
Not to mention the area the teens got lost
in was considered to be a very “touristy”

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.950
beginners area of the off-limits zone by the
cataphiles.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.710
I know they expect to only be down there for
a few hours, but with what they are doing,

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.340
they could easily end up down there for multiple
days if something goes wrong.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.180
Here’s what I would bring:

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.800
Basic stuff like a First-Aid kit, and extra
food and water.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.800
Waterproof headlamps with spares and extra
batteries.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.760
Miners lamps for backup light and a heat source.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.010
A helmet is pretty much a no brainer.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:03.180
Thermal blankets because at 55 degrees down
there, it‘s cold enough to give you hypothermia

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.900
if exposed for over a day or two.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:11.110
Wetsuits and goggles, waterproof boots, and
waterproof bags to hold their gear and spare

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.580
dry clothes because they might have to go
through tunnels that are flooded with freezing

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.580
water.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.050
Freezing water pulls heat from your body 25
times faster than air, so if you don’t stay

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.400
dry you’re looking at hypothermia in hours
instead of days.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.360
Abrasion resistant caving oversuits for crawling
around.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.320
Since they will probably need to go up or
down shafts, bringing multiple ropes with

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.350
harnesses and gloves, as well as other proper
cave rappelling gear including ascenders,

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.540
descenders, and rope protectors.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:46.259
The ropes need to be placed in waterproof
bags, because a wet rope can be 40-70% weaker,

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:52.000
and is much more likely to be sliced through
by a jagged edge.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.320
Line markers to know your way back, but also
for rescue teams since you’re going into

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:05.430
an area that’s designed to not be found.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.710
Other good precautions to take would include
making sure everyone in the search group is

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.020
aware of all the dangers and conditions.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:17.759
You can’t have phobias of confined spaces,
rats, or cobwebby bones, because you can’t

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:20.080
exactly leave whenever you start feeling sick.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.990
I know they’re trying to be secretive, but
telling a trusted friend beforehand, that

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:29.330
you are going into the catacombs via this
entrance and taking this route, as well as

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.789
when you expect to be back, is always a good
idea.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.099
There’s honestly so much more to cover.

00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:40.270
The bigger point though, is that after a couple
hours of reading about cave exploration, I

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:44.210
realized I don’t know jack shit about cave
exploration.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:49.270
Maybe I should back off until I get the proper
gear, training, and guide instead of grabbing

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:54.180
some rope off the wall boondock saints style
and jumping into an uncharted cave half-cocked.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.490
You’re also far from justice.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:01.060
An important rule that Cataphiles state, is
to never trust anyone else unless you really

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.570
know them well because you are basically at
their mercy.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.880
Obviously Scarlett is breaking this rule by
finding a guide in a nightclub.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.870
Scarlett’s crew decides to ignore most of
what I mentioned and hastily enter the catacombs

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.760
with a bunch of strangers.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.950
George obviously hasn’t learned anything
from his time in a Turkish prison, which he

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:26.050
was thrown into because of Scarlett's shenanigans,
and Benji is naive enough to ignore George’s

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.180
warnings about how dangerous she is.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:34.450
Things quickly go south once they reach the
secret catacomb entrance.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:39.120
Yah, the police wouldn’t do that.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.140
It’s illegal, but generally speaking it's
a slap on the wrist and a 60 euro fine.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:49.210
Getting into a brawl with a cop and throwing
smoke bombs at them probably isn’t wise,

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.540
and they’ll be unlikely to help you if you
need to be rescued later.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.910
I’d take the fine and come back later.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:10:01.750
All in all, it’s a great way to start their
expedition, panicked and stressed.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:06.110
What was that precaution about not entering
caves with people that are afraid of them?

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:10.540
I know they were forced to enter the catacombs,
but generally you’d want to find a close

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.270
exit to let this guy out first so he doesn’t
become a danger to others.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:19.190
Something tells me they are going to force
this guy to come with them into the uncharted

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.760
cave network instead.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.100
Graffiti is one way to mark your way back
I guess..

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.520
But yah basically they don’t use any line
markers like we talked about.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:33.380
Notice how they don’t have the proper shoes
or clothing setup, considering they knew they

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:38.150
were going to be wading through freezing cold
water at the start of their trip.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.150
Yep.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:43.080
Oh shit it’s that creepy chick from the
party.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.170
She is a freak.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.420
And this is where the gloves and caving oversuit
would be helpful.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:52.550
They really are not prepared at all for things
they knew they’d run into.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.070
What the fuck did you think you were going
to be doing when exploring the off limits

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:57.550
areas of the catacombs.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.251
Again, nobody in this group is on the same
page here.

00:11:00.251 --> 00:11:04.310
And here we encounter the classic shortcut
mistake.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.810
Scarlett wants to save a few hours off the
trip by taking an unknown route.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:13.100
Where do I remember this from, oh yah, The
Ritual.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.140
That didn’t work out well for them.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.720
I’m with the tour guide.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.930
A map doesn’t tell you shit, and we know
nothing about this tunnel.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:31.920
Urban legends and evil mythology aside, if
the guide's friend, La Taupe, knew these tunnels

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:37.090
like the back of his hand and never returned
from that tunnel, at the very least it’s

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.630
just plain dangerous.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:42.459
Luckily, they follow Papi’s lead.

00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:48.660
Of course they brought a dude into the catacombs
that is scared of bones, rats, and confined

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.670
spaces.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:50.670
Good job team.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:55.740
I like how George’s brother died in a fucking
cave and he isn’t as panicky as Benji.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:05.120
To be fair, the satanic cult chanting in the
background is unnerving.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:10.150
Benji just nearly avoids becoming a permanent
resident of the catacombs when the tunnel

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.370
collapses behind him.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:16.420
The train really goes off the rails when they
end up at a dead end, which was impossible

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.589
according to Papi, as he knows this area well.

00:12:19.589 --> 00:12:24.160
Since Benji caused the tunnel to collapse,
the only way out now is the same evil tunnel

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.810
they avoided earlier.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:30.240
Maybe Papi just got turned around somehow,
but continuing deeper into the collapsing

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.970
off-limits area when you are already cut-off
from your exit route probably isn’t the

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:36.180
smartest move.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.700
I’d call off the hunt right here.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.710
Since we would’ve told a friend where we
were going, and used line markers, we’d

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.790
be here for half a day at most before getting
rescued.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.100
You can come back later once the tunnel is
cleared.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.860
Scarlett decides to boldly forge on through
the evil tunnel, and immediately things get

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.860
weird.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.950
They see Papi’s tag on the wall, but he
swears he never entered this place.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:04.760
He seems to be genuinely freaked out and not
fucking with us, but then again, can we really

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.760
trust the tour guide we met at a nightclub?

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.700
Okay.. how about fuck no.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.560
Now I’d definitely go back and chill at
the collapsed tunnel and wait for help.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.390
Since our protagonists didn’t let anyone
know or use line markers, their only option

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:26.370
is to push forward as it’s unlikely anyone
will find them for days.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.740
The weirdness continues when they find an
old piano.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.871
George says that it's the same type of piano
he had when he was a kid, except the A4 key

00:13:34.871 --> 00:13:37.110
was dead.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:45.020
I feel like I should break out the banana
split analogy from the Polaroid video I did.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:49.290
I don’t know what we are up to, maybe the
3 scoops of get the fuck out ice cream?

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:55.029
What do you guys think?

00:13:55.029 --> 00:14:00.209
Scarlett has the bright idea to keep moving
forward despite all this creepy stuff happening.

00:14:00.209 --> 00:14:03.279
She runs off further into the tunnel by herself.

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:05.620
She really wanted to know who was calling.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.810
George was right, this chick is nuts.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:11.330
They chase after her and catch up once she
finds the ringing phone.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:15.250
Papi’s tag showing up in unexplored tunnels,
weird.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.900
The piano, highly coincidental and very spooky.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:25.470
A phone ringing without any electricity, this
is the first truly impossible thing they’ve

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.470
encountered.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:34.920
Scarlett answers the phone.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.430
I was expecting Samara to give her 7 days,
but I'm pretty sure the guy on the other line

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.790
is thinking more like today instead.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:46.070
The impossibility continues as the man knows
it’s Scarlett on the phone.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.959
And I'd be back to the collapsed tunnel, line
markers or not.

00:14:49.959 --> 00:14:52.870
Clearly the gates of hell wasn’t just an
urban legend.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:57.170
I’m just going to cover a bunch of other
warning signs they blow past real quickly

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.800
as there are literally too many.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.600
There’s probably 3 banana splits worth of
warnings before people start dying.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.620
All the previously mentioned stuff, plus:
Finding a pissed off creepy La Taupe that

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.550
teleports.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:15.399
The ceiling cracked with loose stones falling
on the ground.

00:15:15.399 --> 00:15:26.029
La Taupe eerily saying the only way out of
the catacombs is to go further down.

00:15:26.029 --> 00:15:29.320
Having to rappel down a well without proper
gear or training.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.880
They aren’t wearing gloves, they don’t
have proper descenders with auto-stop mechanisms,

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:42.680
they are rappelling multiple people down the
well simultaneously.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.269
God damn Benji is a liability.

00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:49.680
Descenders would have prevented Benji from
an uncontrolled fall, gloves would’ve prevented

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.700
his hands from serious abrasions, and going
one at a time would’ve prevented George

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.710
from receiving Benji’s Diving Hurricanrana.

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:57.760
(wrestling scene)

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.579
Everyone randomly going deaf.

00:16:01.579 --> 00:16:04.430
A demonic earthquake.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.260
A ghost child.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:18.350
Egyptian padlocks that kill you Indian Jones
style.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.570
Great so there are ancient booby traps too.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:25.830
They correctly solve the riddle, which unlocks
the Egyption padlock, revealing a secret passageway.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:31.220
Why the fuck are ancient civilizations so
cryptic with these riddles, “The winged

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:36.170
vulture is the bright light in the seventh
hour of the moonlight's gaze upon a virgin

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.170
goat”.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:40.830
My security phrases are more like, what’s
your dog’s name?

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:48.430
Old dead guy in a tomb whose body hasn't rotted
for some mysterious reason.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:56.029
Having to cave dive in uncharted underwater
catacomb tunnels with no gear.

00:16:56.029 --> 00:16:58.540
Random treasures next to lit fires.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:04.040
Okay, that’s 12 right there, I think by
now you’d have ample evidence to suggest

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.339
backing the fuck out of the evil tunnel, and
just waiting for someone to hopefully rescue

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:09.339
you.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:13.000
You should be able to survive for long enough
by drinking tunnel water and eating Benji.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.650
I’m sorry guys, you should have known I'd
bring up cannibalism.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:19.860
They find the philosopher's stone, but it
too is booby trapped.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:30.040
And the ceiling collapses when Papi’s crew
tries to jack the treasure.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.390
How has nobody been killed yet, it’s honestly
a miracle.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:39.620
This kind of shit is why you’d want to be
wearing a helmet, any of those falling stones

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.910
easily could have killed them.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.390
Their luck has to be running out here.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.350
Suoxie’s arm gets smashed, but Scarlett
applies some stone dust which magically heals

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.350
it.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.760
Unfortunately, La Taupe was cut off from the
group.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.370
They don’t attempt a rescue for fear of
risking further collapse.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:58.220
I feel sorry for La Taupe, that’s the second
time he was left behind by Papi.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:03.420
Scarlett solves the most important riddle
of the movie.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.410
Which reveals another secret passageway below
them.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.150
They toss the rope down the shaft and make
their descent.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:12.250
The rope grinding on the edge of the rock
is not good.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:16.950
They need to use a rope protector to reduce
friction between the rope and the jagged edge

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:28.250
so the rope doesn’t get sheared in half
leaving them stranded.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.790
Nothing has deterred the group thus far, and
it’s not like they have any other option

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:32.790
at this point.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.780
It’s like Churchill said, if you’re going
through hell, keep going.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:41.160
Except I think he was speaking metaphorically,
while they are literally going into hell.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.400
I think Churchill would have advised them
to not enter literal hell since they have

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.400
a choice.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:50.970
Dude, Benji bitched about rats, but when Scarlett
mentions walking through the gates of hell,

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.160
he doesn’t voice any concern.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:58.520
There’s no backing out now, as the entrance
was sealed behind them.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:04.550
You’ve been saying that same stupid phrase
this whole expedition, and each time things

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.270
got markedly worse.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:17.950
They find La Taupe, only this time he wasn't
as forgiving as the first time Papi left him.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:22.670
Scarlett tries shaving some stone dust onto
Souxie’s caved in face, which surprisingly

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:23.920
didn't work.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:29.160
More red flags pop up like a random noose
and a baby crying.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.420
It was a baby crying, are you expecting a
response to your question.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:37.400
Not only that, but you’re in hell and it’s
obviously a demonic apparition.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.400
Come on.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.790
Benji forgot his auto-stop descender again,
and when the cult chick jumpscares him, he

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.240
falls to his death.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.570
This guy really sucks at rappelling.

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:47.570
Sigh.

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:53.690
George's see’s his deceased brother underwater
and flips out trying to save him, but his

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:55.490
ghost disappears.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:20:00.110
Hell puts on a little reunion for Papi and
his friend who he presumably killed in some

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:01.170
accident.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:05.910
Papi isn’t as lucky as George, and while
screaming it wasn’t his fault, he gets pulled

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.960
into the burning car before it vanishes in
thin air.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.150
I’m pretty sure he died because he didn’t
take extreme ownership of the accident.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:18.370
Okay, I seriously think Scarlett watched way
too many motivational videos with Rocky Balboa.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:23.330
They ‘keep moving forward’ because that’s
been working so well for them, and they run

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:29.700
into the fucking grim reaper.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.330
That's what you get for shining a flashlight
in his face while he's trying to sleep.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:38.490
It’s hard enough to catch some z’s with
the wall people moaning and whining.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:44.450
Zed’s doing a great job of keeping the main
protagonists centered in frame.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:45.690
Excellent camerawork.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:50.650
George gets his neck ripped open by the wall
people, and Scarlett tries to use the immortality

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.960
stone again, to no avail.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.450
For all the hype around this stone, it actually
kind of sucks.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:01.780
George mutters something about vitriol, rectifying,
hidden stones, I don’t know but Scarlett

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:06.240
bolts off, leaving Zed holding a dirty shirt
against Georges open neck wound.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:11.530
She jukes one cave demon, brutally stiff-arms
another, bare-handedly ascends the rope Benji

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:16.720
fell from, traverses the pit of blood filled
with creepy crawlers, slips past her own undead

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.830
corpse hanging from the ceiling, and returns
the ruby to its rightful place.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.320
This is like Hell’s version of Ninja Warrior.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.360
The whole, As Above, So Below epiphany hits
her.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:31.410
The devil just needed a hug to stop the violence,
and the only thing she has to fear is fear

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:32.410
itself.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:35.460
She returns to the hangman, which was actually
her dad.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:40.850
She hugs him and makes amends, which resolves
her inner conflict, ending the nightmare.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.630
Scarlett does some Trinity shit to bring back
George.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.270
Where the stone failed, love prevailed.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.240
So deep.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:54.000
I was thinking go back to back, but sure,
your mystical intuition seems to finally be

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.170
paying off, so lets do it.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:03.650
Well the catacombs do interconnect with the
subway system in some areas, just kidding

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.309
they survive it.

00:22:05.309 --> 00:22:14.360
They open a manhole cover and Scarlett pops
out and gets run over by a truck.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:19.370
Joking again but seriously she exited feet
first without checking if a car was coming,

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:20.730
it easily could have happened.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:25.300
I’m honestly shocked that zed didn’t die,
but like so many people mentioned in the comments

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.100
of my previous videos, he was holding the
main camera.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:34.230
The movie ends with Zed, George, and Scarlett
all severely crippled with PTSD and survivors

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:38.720
guilt for the rest of their lives, but having
learned a moral lesson about rectifying your

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.720
sins.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.990
Let’s recap whose lives we could’ve saved,
and whose death was inevitable.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:47.750
With the proper gear and training I think
that everyone could have survived.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:52.350
The most important thing they easily could’ve
done is to use line markers and let a trusted

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:55.600
person know where they were going and when
they should be back.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.290
These single-handedly would’ve enabled them
to chill at the collapsed tunnel and wait

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:00.340
for help.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:04.680
From the moment the tunnel collapsed behind
Benji, all the way up to them passing through

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:09.210
the gates of hell with La Taupe fuck-starting
Souxie’s head, they were given every warning

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:12.240
and every chance to backout and wait for help.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.080
It became so obvious that they were going
to get themselves killed that it almost seemed

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.200
miraculous nobody had died up until that point.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.660
So Scarlett, George, Benji, Papi, Souxie,
and Zed would all survive.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.490
I don’t know what the hell was wrong with
La Taupe, but i’m pretty sure he was already

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:28.490
dead.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.330
Overall, I’d say this situation was pretty
beatable.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:35.990
Thanks for watching, and remember, don’t
follow your Lara Croft, Indiana Jones wannabe

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:37.840
friends into the gates of hell .
