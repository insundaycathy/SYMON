00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.480
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.330
Today, I'm going to explain an action, fantasy,
thriller film called “Underworld.”

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.600
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.680
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.770
Vampires and werewolves, called Lycans, have
existed in the world for over a thousand years.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.010
These Immortals have been at war for centuries,
and the Vampires have successfully hunted

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.570
the Lycans, pushing them to the brink of extinction.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.130
The war had its first significant turn at
the death of the Lycan leader, Lucian.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.060
The vampires believe that they have gained
the upper hand, on the verge of eliminating

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.619
the Lycans from the world.

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.090
Or so they thought.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.960
Selene and another vampire are tracking two
Lycans headed to a subway.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.989
The Lycan, Raze, and his fellow werewolf are
also stalking Michael Corvinus, a human.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.229
As Michael boards the train, he sees Selene,
but she looks away.

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:45.360
Raze closes in on Michael but senses vampires
nearby.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.999
Before he could reach Michael, he warns his
companion that vampires are following them.

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:51.489
Raze starts shooting, and a firefight ensues.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.989
The other vampire gets shot, and Selene sees
the bullets glowing inside him.

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.769
A bystander gets shot, and Michael dives in
to help.

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.480
A Lycan tries to grab Michael, but Selene
starts shooting.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.379
The Lycans retreat, and Selene, along with
another vampire, give chase.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.710
Selene goes after one of the Lycans while
the other vampire pursues Raze.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.390
Raze gets tackled, and they end up on the
train tracks.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.689
Eager to finish the fight, Raze transform
into a werewolf and charges the vampire.

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.869
Selene tracks the other Lycan deeper into
the tunnels before finally finding the Lycan

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.729
and shooting him with silver bullets.

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.219
Selene checks the Lycan’s gun to see the
bullets are glowing.

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.310
Suddenly, Raze appears behind her, but she
escapes after impaling Raze with several bladed

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.310
discs.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.170
As she hides from Raze, she hears growling
and roaring from in the tunnels.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.470
Sounds of other Lycans fighting and cheering
in an underground fighting pen fill the tunnels.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.899
Before she could investigate further, Raze
appears, and she leaves.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.439
At the fighting pit, a Lycan, who appears
to be the leader, appears.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.939
He is visibly disappointed, even disgusted
by his fellow Lycans’ behavior, and stops

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.280
the fighting.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.159
Selene returns to the vampire mansion, heads
directly to Kahn, the vampire weapons expert,

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.850
and shows him the glowing bullets.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.060
He discovers that the bullets are laced with
ultraviolet radiation, making them highly

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.899
effective against vampires.

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.030
Kraven, the current vampire leader, heads
down to meet with Selene and Kahn.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.979
Selene tells Kraven that she sensed there
could potentially be hundreds of Lycans hiding

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:06.979
in the tunnels.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.299
Kraven listens but says they cannot act on
mere speculation, especially within the eve

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.390
of an important awakening ceremony.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.110
Kahn is in disbelief, saying a number of that
magnitude hasn’t been seen in centuries.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.819
Kraven tells Selene that he’ll have her
claims investigated, and Selene answers back,

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.470
saying Viktor would have believed her without
hesitation.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.810
Selene visits Viktor’s tomb and Erika, another
vampire who’s in love with Kraven, tells

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.819
Selene not to worry and reminds her to prepare
for the ceremony.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.010
Selene later checks on the images they captured
from the scene and sees that the Lycans were

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.290
following a human.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.120
Erika enters, bringing a dress for Selene,
but Selene is focused on the human.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.690
Kraven arrives and tells Selene he’d love
to have her by his side in the ceremony, but

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.080
she shrugs, telling him to have Erika instead,
as she’s the one who’s head-over-heels

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.330
for him.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.330
At the Lycans’ lair, a scientist, Singe,
mixes the blood of a human with a Lycan’s.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.209
He examines it, finding out that the blood
is incompatible.

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.270
Their leader enters and sees their experiment
has failed, and Singe tells him that they

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.549
need to get a sample of Michael’s blood
to see whether or not it would work.

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.950
Raze later arrives carrying the fallen werewolf.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.830
The leader is disappointed to hear that they’ve
failed to get a sample of Michael’s blood

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.849
and decides to do it himself.

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.689
Selene breaks into Michael’s apartment,
looking for clues as to why the Lycans were

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:11.690
after him.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.110
Michael arrives, and Selene grabs him, holding
him by the neck.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.340
She asks why the Lycans are after him, but
he denies any knowledge of what is happening.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.410
Michael recognizes Selene as the woman from
the train shootout.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.360
Not long after, Lycans appear.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.080
Michael runs to the elevator, and Selene misses
him.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.250
The Lycans burst through the windows, and
Selene starts shooting at them.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.000
The Lycans are less affected by silver bullets
in their pure form, so Selene tries to escape

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
through the floor.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.819
Michael heads down and comes face to face
with the Lycan leader.

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.340
Selene shoots him, but he bites Michael.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.840
Selene drags Michael away, and the leader
lets them go, having taken a blood sample

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.989
from Michael and placing it in a test tube.

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.280
The leader then uses his powers to push the
silver bullets out of his body and chases

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.280
Selene.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.790
Selene and Michael drive away, but the leader
catches up to them, jumping on top of the

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.790
car.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.700
He uses a blade and stabs through the roof,
wounding Selene.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.030
Selene manages to get the leader off the roof
and tries ramming him, but he rolls over the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.239
car and lands safely behind them.

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.870
Michael and Selene escape, and Michael sees
that Selene is bleeding profusely.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.080
He asks her to stop the car, but she shrugs
and keeps driving.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.329
She loses consciousness, and the car flips
and falls into a river.

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.510
Michael drags Selene to safety and tries mending
her wounds.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.400
At the Lycan lair, and Singe mixes Michael’s
blood.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.910
They confirm that Michael’s blood is what
they have been looking for.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.980
They need Michael for an experiment they’ll
perform on the Lycan leader.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.660
On the riverbank, Michael and Selene lay unconscious.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.220
Michael gets a strange dream before awakening
and seeing he’s at the vampire mansion.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.920
Erika sees Michael and is delighted to see
Selene has brought a human to the house.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.540
She tells Selene that Kraven is looking for
her.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.480
Selene meets with an angry Kraven.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.610
He scolds Selene for blatantly disobeying
his orders and for bringing a human into the

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.620
mansion.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.690
Selene maintains her theory that the Lycans
are interested in Michael, and she needs to

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.690
figure out why.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.170
Kraven thinks her theory ridiculous, saying
Lycans would only be interested in humans

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.430
for food.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.380
Erika takes a closer look at Michael and sees
the bite mark.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.250
She reels back immediately, launching herself
to the ceiling.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.030
Michael wakes up again, in complete shock,
seeing Erika on the ceiling.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.950
He rushes to the window and jumps out.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.030
He runs for the gate and escapes the estate.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.980
Kraven barges in with Selene seeing Michael
had escaped.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.870
He slaps Selene in anger.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.620
Selene is at the house’s firing range when
Kahn approaches, giving her a gun.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.340
She shoots and sees liquid oozing out of the
bullet holes.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.280
This is Kahn’s latest invention, silver
nitrate bullets.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.930
Once a Lycan gets shot, the silver injects
itself into their bloodstream, making it harder

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.150
to remove.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.670
Selene expresses her doubt about Kraven’s
stories.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.350
The vampires were told that Kraven killed
Lucian, but Selene is suspicious, saying the

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.870
only evidence they have is Kraven’s account.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.300
Kraven then leaves and meets up with someone
at an alley.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.300
He enters another car, and it’s revealed
he’s meeting with the Lycan leader.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.620
Kraven is mad about the Lycans overstepping
their boundaries, but the leader tells Kraven

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.160
they’ve been waiting long enough.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.470
Kraven then reveals that the Lycan leader
is Lucian, the Lycan who Kraven said he had

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.540
killed.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.710
Selene breaks into the mansion’s library
and reads about the past.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.230
She reads the story of the great vampire-werewolf
war and Lucian’s defeat.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.730
It turns out that Kraven was the sole survivor
of a group of vampires sent to assassinate

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.730
Lucian.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.780
Kraven returned with a piece of Lucian’s
skin as evidence of the kill.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.050
Selene then sees a drawing of Lucian wearing
a necklace, the same necklace she saw on the

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.730
werewolf that bit Michael.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.530
She then realizes that that werewolf must
have been Lucian.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.660
She then runs into Erika, and she tells her
that Michael has been bitten and will be turning

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.610
into a Lycan soon.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.370
Desperate for guidance, Selene decides to
awaken Viktor, one of three powerful elder

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.590
vampires.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.020
She enters Viktor’s tomb and begins the
awakening ceremony by herself.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.480
Selene draws her blood and lets it drip into
Viktor’s mouth.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.710
She apologizes to Viktor for waking him ahead
of schedule, but she is in desperate need

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.730
of his guidance, as she suspects Kraven had
lied about killing Lucian.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.250
Michael appears at the mansion’s gates,
and Selene goes to retrieve him.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.020
Kraven warns her that she will no longer be
welcome at the mansion if she goes out to

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.660
meet Michael, but Selene dismisses Kraven’s
threat, knowing Viktor is now awake and that

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.230
Viktor would vouch for her.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.400
She drives to Michael, and they take off.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.740
Selene tells Michael that he’s been dragged
into a war between vampires and werewolves

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.630
that has been raging for centuries.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.230
She tells him that he’s been bitten and
he’ll soon become a Lycan.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.140
Kraven enters the tomb, and Erika tells him
about Michael being a Lycan.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.020
Viktor then reveals himself, and Erika and
Kraven bow.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.770
Viktor expresses his disappointment in Kraven’s
leadership.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.710
He then orders to awaken Marcus, another elder
vampire.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.850
Kraven informs him that Marcus is yet to be
awakened, and Amelia, a third elder vampire,

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.950
is on her way to initiate the ceremony.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.300
Selene had revived Viktor an entire century
ahead of schedule.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.520
Selene takes Michael to one of their secret
interrogation rooms, and she tells her about

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.520
her origins.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.950
Selene was a young woman when Lycans came
and killed her whole family.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.670
It was Viktor who saved her and turned her
into a vampire.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.900
She now spends her life killing the monsters
that killed her family, treating Viktor like

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.980
a father.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.350
Selene intends to head back to the mansion,
but Michael wants to join her.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.410
She then handcuffs Michael to a chair and
tells him a full moon will rise the following

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.410
night.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.960
He’ll be unable to control himself and end
up eating and killing anything he finds.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.380
She then hands him a gun with a single silver
bullet.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.470
The bullet won’t kill him, but it could
delay his transformation.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.330
She then advises him to shoot himself.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.250
Selene arrives back at the mansion and finally
faces Viktor.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.700
He demands to know why she awakened him early,
saying the elders had never broken their chain

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.390
of command in over 14 centuries.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.590
Two of the elder vampires must be at rest
while one reigns.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.400
It was supposed to be Marcus’ turn to reign,
not Viktor’s.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.610
Selene tells Viktor she had no choice, and
she believes the vampires are in danger.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.010
Viktor distrusts Selene, knowing she’s protecting
the Lycan, Michael.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.590
She tells him she’ll gather evidence, but
Viktor prefers to have Kraven do it instead,

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.870
reasoning that Kraven isn’t protecting a
Lycan.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.740
Viktor then tells Selene that the council
would pass judgment on her for breaking the

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.340
cycle of command.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.750
Kraven then imprisons Selene at the mansion,
preventing her from going to Michael.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.580
Kraven then tells Kahn that a different group
of vampires is tasked to meet with Amelia.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.450
Khan is suspicious as it’s always been his
group’s job to do it.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.620
At the station, Amelia’s train arrives,
but Lycans ambush them.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.900
Amelia’s group battles them, but the vampires
sent to meet with them just watch the slaughter.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.579
Michael tries to free himself from the handcuffs,
using the silver bullet to break the chain,

00:08:42.579 --> 00:08:43.680
but he misses.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.970
He feels the effects of the full moon, and
his heart rate and breathing speed up.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:51.170
Jealous of Kraven’s lust for Selene, Erika
decides to free Selene, allowing her to go

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.170
to Michael.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.209
Erika hopes this would lead to Selene’s
downfall, and she informs Kraven that Selene

00:08:55.209 --> 00:08:56.230
had escaped.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.290
The Lycans waiting outside the mansion see
Selene leaving, and they follow her to Michael.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.470
As Selene makes her way up to Michael, she
sees Lycans following her.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.810
She reaches Michael, but Lycans are at the
door.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.560
She begins shooting blindly at the door while
Michael escapes.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.360
He jumps from the window and surprisingly
lands on his feet.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.810
Selene holds off the attacking Lycans, but
on the streets, Lycans subdue and capture

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.829
Michael, taking him into a police mobile and
driving away.

00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:21.810
Selene sees the men driving away with Michael
and decides to let them go for the time being.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.990
She then spots Singe alive among the pile
of lifeless Lycans.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.230
At the mansion, Kahn is convinced that Kraven
is up to something nefarious and orders his

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.920
men to check on Amelia.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.160
At the train station, Lycans kill Amelia,
and Raze draws her blood.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.980
Meanwhile, the men who took Michael are noticing
that he’s beginning to transform.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.370
They pull over and inject him with a substance,
preventing his transformation.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.709
Once his transformation is halted, they continue.

00:09:42.709 --> 00:09:46.959
Kraven meets with a now fully formed Viktor
when Selene arrives with Singe.

00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:49.850
Selene forces Singe to tell the truth, and
he does so.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.850
He confesses that the Lycans have been searching
for a direct descendant of Alexander Corvinus.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.519
He begins by telling them the origin of vampires
and werewolves.

00:09:56.519 --> 00:10:00.889
Alexander Corvinus, a powerful warlord from
the fifth century, had risen to power, but

00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:03.529
a deadly plague ravaged his village, and only
he survived.

00:10:03.529 --> 00:10:07.819
Alexander’s body had mutated the virus,
and instead of killing him, it gave him supernatural

00:10:07.819 --> 00:10:08.819
abilities.

00:10:08.819 --> 00:10:11.540
He became the first Immortal and gave birth
to three children.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.680
Viktor chimes in, saying they all know the
myth of the Corvinus clan.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.569
A wolf bit one child, a bat bit another, and
a third one walked the lonely road of mortality

00:10:18.569 --> 00:10:19.750
as a human.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.870
Viktor says Marcus, whose tomb is right next
to them, is a direct descendant of Alexander,

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.230
but Singe says Marcus is already a vampire.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.540
They needed to find the human descendant of
Alexander, one who carried the virus but is

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.749
neither vampire nor werewolf.

00:10:31.749 --> 00:10:34.879
They aimed to fuse Lycan blood with Vampire
blood but never succeeded.

00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:38.019
But when they found Michael, they discovered
that his blood would be the key.

00:10:38.019 --> 00:10:43.029
With his genetic makeup, they could fuse vampire
DNA with werewolf DNA, creating a hybrid half-vampire,

00:10:43.029 --> 00:10:45.319
half-werewolf creature that would be stronger
than both.

00:10:45.319 --> 00:10:48.370
They plan to have Lucian inject himself with
Michael’s blood, along with the blood of

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.390
an elder Vampire, Amelia.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:54.360
Viktor is finally convinced that Lucian is
alive and Selene is right all along.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.680
Khan then enters the tomb and announces Amelia
had been assassinated and Lycans had drained

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.750
her blood.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.380
Viktor strikes Singe, and he dies instantly.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.160
Viktor then tasks Selene with finding and
eliminating Michael.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.779
Lucian draws Michael’s blood at the Lycan
lair, and Michael pleads to Lucian to let

00:11:07.779 --> 00:11:09.769
him go, as he had nothing to do with their
war.

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:11.899
Lucian laughs, saying this isn’t his war.

00:11:11.899 --> 00:11:13.329
It is Viktor’s.

00:11:13.329 --> 00:11:16.399
Michael then gets a vision of the past and
sees Lucian in chains in front of a woman

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:18.290
vampire who’s also bound.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:22.129
Sunlight fills the room, and Lucian watches
as his beloved Sonja burns to death.

00:11:22.129 --> 00:11:25.640
Viktor then enters the room and retrieves
Sonja’s necklace, but the full moon rises,

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.449
and Lucian transforms into a werewolf.

00:11:27.449 --> 00:11:30.480
Lucian breaks free, taking the necklace and
escaping.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.699
Lucian then tells his side of the story.

00:11:32.699 --> 00:11:36.360
The Lycans were slaves to the vampires, forced
to guard their tombs in the daylight.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.680
He fell in love with Sonja, Viktor’s daughter.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.410
Viktor was enraged by the union and planned
to kill both of them, but Lucian escaped.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.630
Lucian then says Viktor started the war, spending
centuries hunting down the Lycans.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.870
Kraven arrives, and Lucian goes to meet him.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.290
Kraven is panicked, seeing how his plans are
falling apart, but Lucian reassures him that

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.790
with Amelia dead and with Michael’s blood,
their peace treaty would soon take effect,

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.430
leaving Krarven to lead the vampires.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.820
Kraven tells Lucian that Viktor had awakened
and they couldn’t defeat him, but Lucian

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.079
is confident Michael’s blood would give
him the power to defeat Viktor.

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:07.379
The vampires suddenly show up at the lair,
and the Lycans prepare for battle.

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:11.170
Kraven realizes he’s about to lose and shoots
Lucian with several rounds of the silver nitrate

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:12.170
bullets.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.579
Lucian falls, unable to combat the silver
nitrate coursing through his veins.

00:12:15.579 --> 00:12:19.490
Selene and Kahn lead the vampire charge and
dispatch the defending Lycans with ease.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:23.769
Raze arrives carrying Amelia’s blood but
discovers he’s too late, seeing Lucian dying.

00:12:23.769 --> 00:12:27.959
The gunshots continue, and Lucian tries forcing
the silver out of him, determined to live.

00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:31.399
Selene then runs to find Michael and eliminates
two Lycans along the way.

00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:35.110
Kraven tries to escape, making his way up
a ladder but sees Viktor arriving.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.230
He jumps down and tries to hide.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.230
Selene finally finds Michael, and Lucian sees
them kissing.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:43.449
He realizes the war would never be put to
rest as another Lycan has fallen in love with

00:12:43.449 --> 00:12:44.600
a vampire.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.190
Selene and Michael try to escape but run into
Kraven.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.170
Kraven then shoots Michael with the silver
nitrate bullets, and silver starts flooding

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.230
his blood.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.850
Kraven then tells Selene that it was Viktor,
not the Lycans, who killed her family.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:58.339
Viktor fed on them and only spared Selene
because she reminded him of Sonja.

00:12:58.339 --> 00:13:01.160
Lucian appears and stabs Kraven’s leg, disabling
him.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.620
Lucian sees Selene and Michael’s love for
one another, and he tells Selene to bite Michael.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.990
His stronger blood would survive a transmission
from both a vampire and a werewolf, and he

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:10.329
would rise stronger.

00:13:10.329 --> 00:13:12.829
Selene then digs her fangs into Michael’s
shoulder.

00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:14.959
Kraven recovers, and Lucian laughs at him.

00:13:14.959 --> 00:13:18.230
He’s satisfied because his mission is completed
in the form of Michael.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.980
Kraven then shoots several more bullets into
Lucian, rendering him lifeless.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.519
Viktor arrives and removes Selene from Michael.

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:27.089
Viktor then picks up Michael and throws him
through a wall.

00:13:27.089 --> 00:13:29.999
Selene tells Viktor that she knows the truth
about her family.

00:13:29.999 --> 00:13:33.540
Viktor admits it but reasons out that he has
given her much more in exchange.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.970
Now filled with both vampire and werewolf
blood, Michael begins transforming into a

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:38.779
hideous amalgamation of the two.

00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:42.079
Viktor prepares to battle Michael, but Michael
is faster and stronger.

00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:45.940
The two exchange blows, but Viktor still manages
to gain the upper hand even with Michael’s

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.940
advantage.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.930
The rest of the vampires help Viktor and shoot
Michael, but Selene neutralizes them quickly.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.290
Viktor and Michael continue fighting, and
Selene takes Viktor’s sword and slices Viktor

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:55.329
across the face.

00:13:55.329 --> 00:13:58.379
Viktor’s head is cut in half, and he falls.

00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:01.850
Selene and Michael now have to leave and remain
in hiding, knowing that the werewolves and

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.889
vampires may settle for a truce just to hunt
them down.

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:16.459
Back at the vampire mansion, Singe’s blood
drips down into Marcus’ tomb.

00:14:16.459 --> 00:14:21.109
The blood makes its way down to his mouth,
starting Marcus’ heart, awakening him.
