00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:09.839
Welcome to the breakdown where we breakdown
all the messed up shit! My name is Spooky,

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.650
and so in the last video that I uploaded,
the top comment thread was talking about a

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.540
film called Concrete. I've been holding it
off for a while and that's because I had a

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.270
pretty anxious moment. Let me explain. Concrete
is a film based on the murder of Junko Furuta,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.870
easily one of the most saddest and disturbing
murder cases I've ever heard of. If you've

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.870
been subbed for a while, you would know that
I had an anxious moment viewing a ero guro

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.870
manga from Uziga Waita based on that crime.
Only two times have I been scared to look

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.870
at something, which is that manga and Rare:
A Dead Person. So if its not obvious, this

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.950
film is based on her case, showing the delinquents
and their social conditions first before culminating

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.730
with their torture and murder of Junko. I
think its fair to say that the murder of Junko

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.270
has inspired countless extreme films, especially
when adolescents are the sick and twisted.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.390
This film was directed by the same guy who
did All Night Long. This isn't a complete

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.570
factual way that things went down. Its just
simply a retelling similar to The Girl Next

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.430
Door is a retelling of Sylvia Likin's murder.
So, if you want to see what happens, including

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:11.450
all the messed up parts, stay tuned for the
breakdown, cue the Gohan!

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.229
Concrete begins with a quote. "Youth is blessed
only in that it holds the promise of a future".

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.759
It next states that crimes committed by juveniles
have grown ever more heinous. The story we

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.140
see will involve young people who lost their
touch on reality and acted according to their

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.439
basest desires. Some teens are moving a barrel
of concrete. Believing that nobody will even

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.840
pay any mind to it. Then we cut back to the
past. A young guy named Tatsuo is called in

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.209
to be bullied by people in his little Judo
team. They are extra jealous that he won a

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:52.130
tournament. He beats them up pretty good at
first but soon just gets overwhelmed. After

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.289
his ass whupping, his mother desperately wants
to call for help. She is considering everybody

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.399
who could help even the police. He just wants
to stubbornly handle his own problems though,

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.209
an gets into an argument about her not really
caring about him. (Sarcastically) Yeah, I

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.480
see I mean, if I were bullied, and my mom
says "oh what happened, we have to call the

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.310
police, we have to get help", yeah she doesn't
care. What a b word. What a terrible mom!

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.590
That was sarcasm yall. He puts his hands on
his own mom, get this, because "she doesn't

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.140
show that she cares".
He quits school, working at some kind of tile

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.670
placing company. He is trying to raise money
so he can convince his girlfriends mom here

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.440
to agree to their marriage. This is his girlfriends
mother, who has trouble even talking to her

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.840
kids. They both leave just because they don't
get what they want. This kid here has a name

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.061
but I'll just call him Minato. Some time later,
Tatsuo gets in trouble with the police. His

00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:56.629
boss from his tile placing job helps him out
though. Probably the only person he likes

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.120
at all. He doesn't respect his family at all.
His father is gone and he beats on his mother

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.180
randomly. He says "Girls need hitting sometimes".
His boss stages a little intervention but

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.650
Tatsuo keeps insisting that "This bitch ain't
done shit for me". You know, Tatsuo you have

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.810
a fucking roof over your head. Shelter. I
think ass whuppings come in handy sometimes

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.480
yall. Sometimes you need a good ass whupping
to see the light, he probably hasn't even

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.480
got a spanking.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.440
Some time later, Tatsuo is at work but some
overconfident bullies in flashy suits bully

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.620
everybody. This must be the Dojima Family.
One of em, Shimada is an old friend of Tatsuo.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.329
Shimada is just rank and file member at the
moment, and reaches out to the patriarch or

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:47.400
chief to see if Tatsuo can accompany them.
He wants Tatsuo to join the Yakuza, walk with

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.139
your head high, get money and girls. So I'm
sure this is like a cabaret club or hostess

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:59.069
club. The Yakuza flex their status, and he
might definitely want to join their ranks

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.879
due to the reputation they carry. His girlfriend
though, doesn't agree with him getting money

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:10.290
in a sneaky way only seen by yakuza members.
Honestly she's kinda hard to read. Like at

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.530
this moment, she doesn't want him to be a
yakuza member, but at the same time, she fucking

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:22.230
sniffs glue. Like what is your stance on anything?!?
Tatsuo soon begs under the patriarch to see

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.280
if he can leave the family. If you've played
Yakuza 0, you know the only way you are leaving

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.860
the Yakuza is by death, and Tatsuo bitch ass
aint got hands Like A Dragon. Tatsuo just

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.280
sits awkwardly among his fellow members knowing
he wont be leaving any time soon.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.200
Sometime later though, he is chosen to lead
and organize his own gang called The Ryujin

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.980
gang. Tatsuo is the chairman and recruits
Ozaki with the brown hair and the blond Ikeda

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.590
to join his ranks and get some others to join.
Remember Minato here. Well I guess Tatsuo

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.600
is dating his sister who doesn't live in this
house but they bum rush his house and recruit

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.730
Minato against his will. They also make this
little room their base of operations, despite

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.820
the fact that Minato's parents are downstairs.
The Ryujin gang does criminal acts like stealing

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.130
purses and money. They imagine that maybe
high school girls may be an easy mark. That's

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.420
what we see here, them chasing some students
through a field, bullying them and even ripping

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.691
their clothes off. This Ryujin gang is just
a juvenile club used to gather money to the

00:05:29.691 --> 00:05:34.970
higher ranked Yakuza.
Soon they start kidnapping high school girls.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.400
Tatsuo rapes one while the others sit and
watch, but they let the girl go after. They

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.470
do this for countless girls. The weird thing
is that the girl does call the police, the

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.650
boys get questioned, but they get let off
the hook because they denied everything. "The

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.650
cops are worthless" they say. Its hard to
count how many girls they actually decide

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:03.430
to kidnap and rape. Tonight is the start of
44 days of hell. The gang often sit on their

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.310
little scooters and observe for girls to kidnap.
They see one girl cycling home from work and

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.360
decide to follow. Her name in the movie is
Misaki, but I'll just call her, Junko. Ikeda

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.190
rides along side her and knocks her down.
Tatsuo comes along pretending to be just a

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.960
helpful person and helps her up and walks
her home a bit. She lives pretty far off and

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.550
doesn't trust him so tries to get him to stop
walking with her, but he just admits that

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.160
he's a big bad Yakuza who will kill her and
her family if she doesn't tag along.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.370
He drags her into some kind of hotel and rapes
her. After he forces her to follow him to

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.430
a park where he meets up with Ikeda and Minato.
They sit and watch her as Tatsuo goes home

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:53.000
to sniff glue. When Tatsuo doesn't come back,
they just decide to hide her in their little

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.400
base of operations which is Minato's room,
and she is raped again in the bathroom after

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:04.770
pleading to be let go. Tatsuo brings out the
entire group to see the girl he has kidnapped.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:10.000
One of the first things they do is stick foreign
objects inside her. If you can see it in their

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.841
hands, then they are probably raping her with
it. She becomes detached from it all. The

00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:19.630
next day they talk about letting her go but
decide to keep her so they don't get arrested.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.930
They are serial rapists and criminals that
the police are familiar with but haven't caught

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.400
them in the act.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:32.290
Tatsuo is the most physically abusive of the
group, beating her for no reason at all sometimes.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:36.890
He also scares the other members into doing
stuff to her sometimes but they are still

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:42.620
demons in their own right. To cover for themselves,
he makes her call her mom saying she will

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:48.110
be at a friends place for a few days. During
these first days, she spends a lot of time

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:54.080
trying to win their trust before asking to
be let go, but like I said, everybody is scared

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.810
of what Tatsuo will do to them. Junko gets
the courage to do things when they aren't

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.240
watching her. Like call the police quickly
when they are sleep. She can't give enough

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.770
details though other than help me because
they hear her. She runs away but is caught

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:13.790
and dragged back in, and the police on the
line are told that it was all a prank.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:19.400
This is the mother of Minato I think. She
and the entire family is too scared to talk

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:25.290
back to their son and his friends. Like ridiculously
scared. The mother does try to help Junko

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:30.970
another night though, but she runs into Ikeda
and gets dragged back in again. As punishment,

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:37.000
they put lighter fluid on her leg and lights
her ablaze. So we are getting in the final

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.380
moments. Not to mention that I'm probably
skipping a lot of scenes because I don't feel

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:47.720
like saying then they did this or then they
did that. She is beaten a lot and loses control

00:08:47.720 --> 00:09:00.510
of her bladder and bowel control. And of course,
somethings they do are kinda unspeakable.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:05.540
Soon they discover that she died. It causes
panic in the group and one of them decides

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:11.390
to fight back against Tatsuo, the little bully
they were scared of. Tatsuo was like the mom

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:20.230
figure in The Girl Next Door, but I don't
get why he didn't grow a pair 44 days ago.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:25.280
People too scared of an ass beating.
They definitely didn't plan on killing her,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.640
but they decide to get rid of her body by
stuffing it in a barrel and filling it with

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:35.330
wet concrete, hence the title of the film.
They roll it far off into a field, where I

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:40.600
honestly think it's a possibility that Junko
could have never been discovered, at least

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:45.900
not immediately. This is the reason why they
do know of Junko's murder. The police take

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:52.210
Tatsuo in for custody for all the accusations
against him. The police also think that he

00:09:52.210 --> 00:10:00.280
might have murdered a family. They ask him,
"So you actually murdered too". Its am ambiguous

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:06.650
statement, but Tatsuo believes they know about
Junko, and he tells on himself. The police

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:12.380
are baffled of course, not expecting him to
admit to murdering a high school girl they

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:19.460
didn't think was related. And so..that's basically
the end of the film. Keep in mind this wasn't

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:25.420
a full factual retelling. I'm telling you
what happened in the film, not the case, so

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:30.520
things are different. I'll get on that more
later. Lets just talk more about it, in that

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:38.810
Spooky stuff
The four main murderers are walking about

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:44.460
as you hear me. They've been released. They
are living on without any sign of remorse.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:50.130
Its probably on one of the most disgusting
things I've ever heard. For starters, not

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:57.690
to quote Hiroshima, My Love, but you saw nothing.
This film is like the Nick Jr version of what

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:03.570
happened to Junko. I think its honestly unimaginable
to think of what she went through. And its

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:09.150
all because she was in the wrong place in
the wrong time. She was literally just riding

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:15.040
home from work, and being a pretty teenager
got her kidnapped and tortured for over a

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:21.130
month. And then they all get released because
they were under 18, and they don't feel a

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:27.540
single ounce of remorse, in fact they brag
about what they did. The amount of despair

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:33.180
I just read off is just painful. I just wanted
to make a little video to go ahead and get

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:37.900
through this film. I knew it would a bit tough.
I do think its great that we can look back

00:11:37.900 --> 00:12:16.970
on this case and remember her at least. Anyway
uh, thanks for watching this video. Spooky

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:17.110
OUT!
