00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.130
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:07.180
Today, I’m going to explain an American
sci-fi thriller film called “Time lapse.”

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.550
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.199
Watch out and take care!

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:18.410
The movie starts as we see a painter named
Finn trying to paint a canvas in his apartment.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.529
He lives in the same apartment with his girlfriend,
Callie, and his best friend, Jasper.

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.390
Finn is also the manager of that apartment
complex, while Jasper is a gambling addict.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.880
That day, Finn meets the apartment’s security
guard, Big Joe, who he invites to a house

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.980
party on the next day.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.280
Soon after, their landlord calls to inform
them that one of the tenants called Mr B,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.380
is two months late to pay his rent.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.790
So, Callie goes to check on Mr B. She knocks
on the door, but no one answers.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.710
There is also a pile of newspapers in front
of the door...suggesting that he has not come

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.350
out for a long time.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.210
Callie uses spare keys to go inside.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.789
Cut to Finn’s room.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.149
Finn and Jasper are talking when Callie barges
in and takes them to Mr B’s apartment.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.680
The three of them go in to see a wall full
of polaroid pictures of their living room.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.950
Mr B had been taking pictures of them through
their living room window.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.240
Jasper thinks he was spying on them, but there
are empty pictures of the room as well.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.850
Moreover, some of the pictures from the collection
are missing.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.100
Finn turns around and sees a huge machine
in the same room.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.860
It looks like a massive camera pointed directly
at their living room window.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.020
A polaroid picture hands from it.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.240
We see that the coat rack from their living
room is knocked over in it.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.200
They figure that the pictures on the walls
are taken from this camera.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.260
Later, they are in their apartment talking,
when Callie suddenly knocks over the rack.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.409
The group matches the picture with the look
of their living room and it is a perfect match.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.970
The group realizes that the camera takes photos
apparently 24 hours in the future.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.180
Suddenly, the camera takes a picture on its
own.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.910
They look at it to see it is the picture of
the next day when they were going to have

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.270
a house party.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.060
The three of them are in shock.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.159
Jasper still doesn’t believe that the camera
takes pictures of the future.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.229
Callie finds Mr B’s journal which says that
he has seen his death through the camera.

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.610
So, he planned to disobey the “cardinal
rule of time and causality.”

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.050
Finn examines the pictures and finds that
all of them are taken at exactly 8 pm.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.970
However, the wall has some pictures taken
during the day time.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.740
Strangely, some of the pictures from the wall
are missing.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.370
Then, the group goes to Mr B’s storage unit
and finds his dead body there.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.400
His face looks burnt and rotten but his clothes
are fine.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.239
Jasper thinks that he died because he disobeyed
the cardinal rule.

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.040
They are now back in their apartment, when
Jasper suggests they use the camera to gamble.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.510
Finn is doubtful of the idea, but Callie supports
it.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.150
That night, they have a house party.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.800
Jasper and Callie dance with the guests, while
Finn goes to Mr B’s place, and takes a picture

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.740
exactly at 8 pm.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.610
He compares the polaroid picture with the
picture he took, and it is exactly the same.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.170
Just then, a picture comes out from the camera.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.190
In the picture, he sees the three of them
posing for the camera; a paper with the gambling

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.620
results is pasted on the window.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.630
The following day, Finn is still doubtful
of the idea but Callie suggests that if they

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.680
do not do what the picture says, they would
be breaking the cardinal rule; they can end

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.360
up like Mr B as well.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.230
So, Callie starts watering Mr B’s plants
and taking his newspaper to make it seem like

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.140
he is still in his house.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.230
Finn looks at the canvas in the picture and
paints without having to brainstorm any ideas.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.434
Meanwhile, Jasper tapes the gambling results
to the window every day.

00:03:25.434 --> 00:03:30.155
Several days go by and the group earns a lot
of money through it, as they cover up Mr B’s disappearance

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.680
However, a week later, they receive a picture
in which Jasper and Callie are kissing in

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.550
the background, while Finn paints in front
of them.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.356
Finn is disturbed by the picture but they
have to do what it says to follow the cardinal rule

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.190
So, that night, Jasper and Callie kiss, as
Finn paints.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.560
But the actual kiss goes on too long...causing
Finn to get angry and jealous.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.739
He goes to Mr B’s place; and the new picture
is already there.

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.760
In it, they see Jasper’s gambling bookie,
Ivan, sitting in their living room.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.950
The group is shocked because Ivan is a violent
criminal.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.769
The following day, Jasper is very nervous.

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.900
He stays on the couch...waiting for Ivan,
as Callie and Finn leave.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.200
Soon after, Ivan comes to visit.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.000
He is suspicious of Jasper’s recent wins,
so he threatens Jasper to tell him his secret.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.199
Jasper tells him that Ivan can ride on his
gambles and leave them alone.

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.410
Just then, Callie and Finn arrive with the
next day’s picture.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.610
In the picture, Callie is nude...posing for
Finn’s painting, as Jasper’s silhouette

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.470
spies on them through the mirror.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.990
Ivan gets a look at the picture too; and then
he leaves.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.130
Cut to the next day, Finn and Callie get ready
to paint.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.380
Callie poses as Finn paints her; but exactly
at eight, they see Ivan outside the window.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.480
Turns out that the silhouette from the picture
was actually Ivan.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.860
He and his goon, Marcus, threaten the group
and find out about the camera.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.740
They make a deal, now the group has to pose
for the photos with gambling results every

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.910
day for Ivan to make bets on.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.639
He wants to profit off the camera himself.

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.530
The group does as Ivan says.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.620
They provide him with the gambling results
for a few days.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.750
When suddenly, one day, Finn notices that
the next day’s picture has a weird painting on it

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.630
This photo shows a hastily made skull and
crossbones on the canvas.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.919
It is not Finn’s usual style of painting.

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.979
The group thinks that the future Finn is trying
to warn them of something; so Jasper is very

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.150
nervous the next day, he hides several weapons
around the living room in case someone attacks them

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.536
He practices stabbing with his knife.

00:05:26.536 --> 00:05:31.192
That evening, Finn runs into Big Joe at the
gate, who has just gotten a job as a police officer.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.240
But as they talk, Marcus spies on them from
his car.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.630
Joe gives Finn his card, he is a police officer
now.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.770
When Finn comes back to the room, he tells
Jasper what has happened.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.669
Some time later, Ivan and Marcus arrive there
suspicious of Big Joe.

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.009
They find the card of the police, and question
the trio about their connection with Joe.

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:53.419
They threaten to kill all three of them.

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.600
But Jasper lies to him that he has seen tomorrow’s
picture which has Ivan being killed by Marcus in it

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.580
This makes Ivan suspicious of Marcus, so he
goes to Mr.B’s apartment to look at the

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.670
picture and confirm it himself.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.410
Meanwhile, Jasper stabs Marcus as he had practiced.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.860
When Ivan comes back, he sees Marcus dead;
and Jasper attacks him with a bat and kills

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.280
him as well.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.260
The group hides the bodies in Mr. B’s storage
unit.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.930
They see that the new picture is actually
a picture of Jasper sitting on the couch with

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.200
a pile of money in front of him.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.410
They take all of Ivan’s gambling money,
so now they have millions of dollars.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.270
That night, Finn suggests that they split
the money and get out of the country.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.220
But the other two are against the idea.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.250
At night, someone knocks on their door.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.740
It is Mr B’s friend and colleague, Dr. Heidecker,
who is looking for Mr B; however, Jasper can't

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.190
keep their stories straight about Mr B, so
Dr. Heidecker levels a gun at them and forces

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.817
them to confess.

00:06:47.817 --> 00:06:50.337
Mr B had written her a letter before his death.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.820
In the letter, he had told her about the camera
being successful and about his death.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.750
He had also sent her a picture.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.530
It is a picture of the group’s living room
with Mr B’s hat in the background and blood

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.150
splattered on the windows.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.370
He had seen the picture and thought that he
was about to die, so he locked himself in

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.820
his storage unit.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.620
They take her to the unit, and Heidecker realizes
that Mr B did not die because of the rule

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.949
of cardinals.

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:17.190
He reached for the shelves in the cabinet
and died because a chemical poured over him.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.733
It was just an accident.

00:07:18.733 --> 00:07:21.672
Heidecker also tells them that the picture
is of tomorrow.

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:26.000
Finn and Jasper are surprised to know that
the camera can click pictures more than twenty-four

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.520
hours in advance, but currently it is set
to 24 hours in the future, and the timer is

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.440
always set at 8 pm.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.979
Knowing that Heidecker is of no real use to
them, Jasper kills her with Ivan’s gun.

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:40.169
They hide her body there and come back to
their place.

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:45.000
Finn blames Jasper for killing an innocent
woman, so he has now decided to move out of their place

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.070
At 8 pm, Jasper takes the picture with the
pile of money, while Callie goes to look at

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.554
the picture for tomorrow.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.120
Finn comes out with his suitcase packed in
order to leave the place and flee.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.389
He goes to Mr B’s place, where Jasper and
Callie are sitting in distress.

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:03.690
The next day’s picture is a picture of Callie
and Jasper having sex as Finn sleeps on the

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:04.979
couch behind.

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:07.060
Finn is furious to see this.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.650
Callie runs away from there.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.410
Then, Finn shows Jasper an engagement ring
he had bought for Callie a long time ago.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:18.069
As Finn talks, Jasper hits him on the head...
making him go unconscious.

00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:21.050
He drags Finn to the storage unit and ties
him there.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.840
Jasper wants to do what the camera says...making
sure the photo happens, no matter what.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.190
Jasper then goes to the apartment and wait
until tomorrow at 8 pm.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:35.070
The next morning, Finn wakes up at the storage
unit; he burns the ropes and frees himself.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:39.100
He takes the keys from Mr B’s pockets and
escapes from the storage unit.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.430
He then takes a bucket of water and goes to
Mr B’s place.

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:46.220
He calls Jasper from there and threatens to
pour water on the camera.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.240
Finn wants Jasper to let Callie and him go
away and move to some other place.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.550
Jasper calls Callie outside and points his
gun at her.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.019
He tries to threaten Finn to kill Callie,
but it doesn’t work.

00:08:57.019 --> 00:09:00.920
Fin then asks Callie to look into Jasper’s
pocket where she finds the ring.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.530
She is delighted.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.709
Then she takes Jasper’s gun and opens the
door for Finn.

00:09:05.709 --> 00:09:08.100
All three of them are in the apartment now.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.280
Finn tells Callie to pack her clothes.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.519
They plan to flee as soon as possible.

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:15.570
But as Callie goes to do that, Jasper attacks
Finn.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.779
He is almost about to kill Finn when suddenly,
Callie appears from behind and kills Jasper

00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:20.970
to save Finn.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.720
Then, Callie goes into the kitchen to get
Finn ice for his injuries.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.790
But when Finn goes in to check, he sees her
going through a different drawer.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:32.210
Callie makes an excuse, but Finn senses something
wrong.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.030
She takes him to their room and leaves him
there with the ice.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:39.070
However, Finn comes to check and he sees Callie
posing for the camera.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.520
She has two notes pasted on the window.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.370
Finn is surprised to see the camera take a
picture because it is 8 am.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.230
This whole time, he thought the camera only
takes pictures at 8 pm.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.260
He asks Callie about it; and this is where
everything is revealed.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:58.016
Before the events in the film, Finn and Callie
had been having problems with their relationship.

00:09:58.016 --> 00:10:02.330
Finn had been acting distant and Callie was
not feeling the love, so Callie slept with Jasper

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.760
What they didn’t realize is that Mr B’s
time-camera had been taking pictures of their

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.920
naughtiness the whole time.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.920
When Callie went into Mr B’s apartment for
the first time, she saw the machine and the photos

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.050
She also saw the pictures that had been taken
during her naughtiness with Jasper, this includes

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.820
the photo of them having sex.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.120
She wanted to hide this, so she removed those
pictures.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.709
She also figured that the machine was set
to take pictures at 8 AM and 8 PM.

00:10:27.709 --> 00:10:32.150
But Callie kept the 8 AM part a secret, because
she saw a picture of herself from the following

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.900
morning standing with notes that read – “Knock
coat stand over.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.279
Hide last week’s daytime photos”, so she
decided to hide that 8AM information to pass

00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:42.779
instructions secretly to herself.

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:46.220
These instructions are to help her get Finn
back close to her.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:50.170
All this time when she went to water the plants
at Mr B's place in the morning, she always

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.970
took the 8 am picture with a message from
her future self.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:58.410
One morning, Callie got the 8 AM picture that
read “Kiss Jasper for too long”.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:02.940
So when 8PM arrived, she followed that instruction
and stretched out the kiss.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.340
She was rewarded with Finn getting jealous.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.600
All she wants is that for him to fight for
their relationship

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.360
The day before, Callie had already received
a message at 8 AM asking herself to swap out

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.240
that day’s picture with the sex photo, so
she followed the instructions.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.870
The purpose was to make Finn jealous and fight
for their relationship; and it turned out

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.110
to be successful.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.779
Today, he fought for their relationship harder
than she has ever seen.

00:11:25.779 --> 00:11:29.649
After Callie’s truth is revealed, Finn rejects
her.

00:11:29.649 --> 00:11:33.700
He decides that all of this is wrong and he
needs to destroy the machine, but Callie shoots

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.420
him first and kills him.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.740
This creates the blood splatter on the window;
just like in Heidecker's photo.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.880
She wants to put up a message for 8 pm saying
“Don’t get caught at the window”.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.769
She thinks that if she sends herself a message
in the window when the photo is taken, it

00:11:47.769 --> 00:11:52.690
will send a message to herself 24 hours ago,
preventing these events from happening.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:56.820
Just as she’s waiting for the camera to
go out, Joe, the cop, shows up and asks her

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.060
to open the door.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.160
He finds people dead in the hall so he takes
Callie away.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.950
Callie leaves peacefully...confident that
all this will be over once her past self sees

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.560
the message she has taped, and the timeline
will reset.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.780
Joe leads Callie out of the house to arrest
her... but just then, the note she left falls

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.160
off the window.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.700
Callie tries to run back to stick the message
back on, but Joe drags her away.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.990
The camera takes its 8 pm snap and before
the image develops, it cuts to black and the

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.450
movie ends.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:29.040
Callie cannot changed the event because this
is Predestination, the causal loop has already

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.310
occurred, it can’t be changed.
