00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.470
Hi, Movie Recaps here.

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:09.070
Today I will show you an action, adventure,
fantasy film from 2009, titled Daybreakers.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.280
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.160
Watch out and take care.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.330
In the year 2019, a little girl writes a letter
where she describes how she will never change

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.779
or grow up, which she can't take anymore.

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.019
She leaves the house to watch the sunrise,
and when she looks up, we see her yellow eyes:

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.210
she's a vampire.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.310
As soon as the sun comes up, her entire body
burns.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.519
Then we're shown how the world is empty during
the day.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.840
Because of a plague caused by an infected
bat in 2009, most of mankind has become vampires.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.930
The human population is plummeting, and researchers
are starting to look for blood substitutes

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.170
to keep the vampire population fed while a
small group of them fight for human rights,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.260
since they're being hunted and farmed.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.600
When night falls, the world comes alive again.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.960
We see vampires go on their normal lives as
humans used to do, hanging out or going to

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.960
work.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.070
There's even a hobo vampire begging for blood
that threatens a random citizen, the police

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.480
electrocute him for it.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.110
Meanwhile, taking his car and then the subway
for work is our protagonist, Edward Dalton.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.550
He works as a hematologist for Bromley Marks,
a pharmaceutical company and important blood

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.580
supplier.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.250
After going through security at the building
entrance, Edward passes by the rooms with

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.270
the machines that farm humans, which he hates,
before going to his lab.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.840
He's working on trying to find a blood substitute,
but his latest try is also a failure.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.490
Afterward, he has a meeting with his boss,
Charles Bromley, his lab partner Christopher

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.940
Caruso, a commissioner, and an army officer.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.980
The commissioner informs them of the results
of an experiment they've conducted on a death

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.770
row inmate: he was selected for a study on
the effects of blood deprivation.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.650
The lack of blood caused complete degeneration
of the brain's frontal lobe, the first signs

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.530
of it were his ears getting longer.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.390
He quickly deteriorated into a Nosferatu-like
creature with no rationality or emotions.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.610
They call these creatures "subsiders" and
they're becoming a problem on the streets.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.040
Only 5% of the human population is left, and
if they don't find a substitute soon, they

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.970
will all become subsiders.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.470
Bromley cuts in then and takes Edward to his
office for a private meeting, where Edward

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.550
ignores the coffee with blood he's served
while Bromley tells him his story: he used

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.050
to have cancer, but vampirism cured him.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.729
His daughter refused to turn, though, and
she ran away.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.510
He knows Edward pities humans and so does
he, that's why they need to begin the testing

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.459
as soon as possible to save the human race.

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.180
Edward goes to his lab and discusses this
with Christopher, who after some hesitation,

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.090
he points out the substitute is working on
a monkey so it's time to move beyond animal

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.090
testing.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.209
Moments later, the researchers begin the test
while Bromley and some officers watch through

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.209
a window.

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.219
Edward slowly injects the substitute into
a private's body, who at first feels fine,

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.650
but once the whole dose is in, he pukes and
starts convulsing as nasty blisters appear

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.270
all over his body.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.540
The researchers immediately move to hold him
down and inject him with epimone, which does

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.420
stop his shaking and makes the blisters disappear,
but a second later, his whole body explodes.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.459
Later that night, Edward leaves the office
and drives home.

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.000
He's watching the news on his car, which talks
about riots related to blood-rationing schemes.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.620
When he notices something wrong while scratching
his ear, he opens his camera-mirror and checks:

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.629
his ears are starting to grow long.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.069
This distraction causes him not to see a car
coming from the opposite direction - he manages

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.170
to dodge at the last second and stop his vehicle,
but the other car crashes against a fence.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.620
Edward comes out to help and takes an arrow
to the arm: the people getting out of the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.260
other car are humans and their leader, Audrey
Bennett, has a crossbow to defend themselves

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.480
from vampires.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.180
Suddenly, police cars can be heard approaching
them, so Edward swears he just wants to help

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.569
and asks the humans to get in his car, which
they accept after some hesitation.

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.609
Edward activates the car's daytime protection
driving mode, which turns all the windows

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.770
black, then takes out the arrow from his arm
as the police arrive.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.340
While he lies to them and tells them which
direction the humans ran to, Audrey finds

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.319
Edward's ID badge and learns his occupation.

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.930
After the police are gone, the humans get
out of the car and Audrey wishes Edward a

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.919
happy birthday as they all leave.

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:59.219
Moments later, Edward is arriving home, where
a community announcement is warning everyone

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.000
of the oncoming sunrise.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.819
Once he makes it to his house, he has dinner
and starts taking care of his plants when

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.930
he suddenly receives a visit from his brother
Frankie Dalton, who he hasn't seen in months

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.890
because he joined the army.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.079
Frankie comments on the lack of birthday party,
to which Edward replies that he's turned 35

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:20.130
ten times already, but Frankie doesn't care:
he thinks they must celebrate, and for that,

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.860
he's brought an expensive bottle of 100% pure
human blood.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.150
He pours two glasses as he teases his brother
for drinking pig blood, but Edward turns it

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.150
down.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.700
This enrages Frankie, who starts an old argument
of theirs: Edward doesn't touch human blood

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.530
but still works for a company that farms people,
which he sees as a necessary evil to be able

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.340
to find the substitute, yet he also looks
down on Frankie for hunting humans for the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.410
army.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.030
Edward suddenly grabs the blood bottle and
starts pouring it down the rain, but Frankie

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.650
takes it from him and smashes it against the
wall before trying to leave.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.840
He can't, however, because a subsider gets
in his way.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.430
The creature enters the kitchen and starts
licking the blood off the walls then moves

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.340
onto the glass on the table.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.890
Frankie grabs a knife from the holder, which
startles the subsider and makes it push him

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.810
against the wall, he falls on a glass table
and loses consciousness for a few seconds.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.950
The subsider moves towards Edward next, and
he keeps it a bay with a stool while calling

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.660
out his brother's name.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.230
Frankie wakes up and retrieves the knife,
together the brothers try to attack the subsider,

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.340
but it jumps away to hang from the ceiling.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.890
This allows Frankie to slash it a few times
before decapitating it.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.030
Moments later, the police arrive to take the
case, commenting on the fact the subsiders

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.720
are in the suburbs now.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.910
One of the officers finds a ring on the creature
which makes Edward realize it was the local

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.910
gardener, she also finds self-inflicted wounds.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.410
Feeding on themselves speeds up the mutation.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.810
The next morning, Edward is woken up by a
security alert.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.650
He goes to check and, when turning on the
lights, he finds Audrey pointing a crossbow

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:47.650
at him.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.060
She tells him they've been looking for vampires
they can trust and that they need his help

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.020
to find another way besides the substitute,
she also gives him a sheet of paper with a

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.120
map on it.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.440
Edward is suddenly distracted by a noise and
turns around, allowing Audrey to silently

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.440
leave.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.930
When he checks on the noise, it turns out
to be Frankie, who asks Edward about the woman.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.490
Edward replies it's nothing.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.150
Later at night, the news shows investors are
pulling their human supplies from Bromley's.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.830
Edward goes to work and meets with his boss
to ask for a guarantee that the substitute

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.460
would replace the need for human supply.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.900
Bromley replies that the majority of the population
will be happy with it, but a small sector

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.960
will always demand the real thing.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.110
Edward reminds him that would include Bromley's
daughter before going back to his lab to stare

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.150
at the map.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.810
When morning comes, Edward doesn't return
home.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.740
He puts up the light protection on the car
and follows the map into the countryside,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.780
where Audrey is already waiting for him and
tells him to approach a big tree.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.840
He parks under the shadow of that tree and,
after putting on a hat and sunglasses, he

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.360
leaves the car.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.780
Always being careful not to step into the
light, he approaches an old man, Lionel "Elvis"

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.780
Cormac.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.970
This man used to be a vampire yet he's human
now.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.750
Edward wants to know how but they're interrupted
by Audrey coming closer, held at gunpoint

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:59.940
by Frankie.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.760
Edward wants to stop him but Frankie won't
listen, and army backup is already arriving.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.670
Audrey pushes Frankie into the sunlight and
joins the men, they take Edward's car because

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.670
the soldiers have already opened fire and
destroyed Lionel's vehicle.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:17.080
They are chased and shot as they drive away,
which creates holes in the car's dark protection.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.340
At first, Audrey manages to cover them with
her hands, but they become too many, and the

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.710
camera is shot as well, so Edward can't see
ahead.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.200
Lionel takes over the wheel so he can see
the road through a hole and Edward can hide

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.200
from the light.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.540
When they reach a dingy bridge, Lionel drives
as fast as possible to cross it safely, but

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.490
the military truck is too heavy and the bridge
breaks under it, causing the truck to explode.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.740
The rest of the backup is left behind without
a way to follow.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.060
After night falls, they park next to a river,
and Lionel tells Edward his story.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.840
He used to work on daylight modifications
for cars and had one of the first shops in

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.630
town that made them.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.350
Daylight driving is amazing because there
are no other people around, but it can also

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.090
be dangerous for the driver.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.680
That's what happened to Edward: he wasn't
feeling well because he hadn't fed, so he

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.390
accidentally crashed the car against the river
fence.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:07.390
The crash ejected him from the car, and he
caught on fire before falling into the river.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.900
When he came out of the river, he was human
again.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.360
Lionel and Audrey want Edward to recreate
these conditions safely.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.510
Back at the company, Bromley's staring at
some pictures of his daughter when Frankie

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.080
arrives to see him.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.560
Bromley congratulates him on having reported
what happened and tells him that if Edward

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.130
returns immediately, no formal charges will
be laid.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:28.680
Frankie accepts to do anything Bromley asks
of him.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.180
Meanwhile, Edward and the humans are back
in his car, driving to their safehouse.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:37.169
Edward can't stop staring at Audrey's neck
- when she notices this and his pointy ears,

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.389
she cuts her hand and pours some blood in
a cup for him to drink.

00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:45.060
He refuses at first, but Audrey needs to know
the other humans will be safe around him,

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.139
so he accepts the cup and drinks it.

00:08:47.139 --> 00:08:51.680
A few hours later, they make it to an old
vineyard, where Edward meets other humans

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.230
including Jarvis, who is leading a group of
rescuers to find more humans.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:01.200
After entering the house, he also meets Senator
Wes Turner, a vampire politician in favor

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.310
of protecting human rights and finding a cure.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.420
After briefly cutting to Bromley watching
how one of his machines has lost all its humans

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:13.189
and his researchers taking out a body, we
are shown a coffee stand at the subway station,

00:09:13.189 --> 00:09:15.959
where a man complains about his coffee not
having enough blood.

00:09:15.959 --> 00:09:20.110
The employee tells him that 5% is as much
as she's allowed to serve, but the man won't

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.689
take no for answer.

00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:25.910
He steals a blood bag and when breaking it,
he splashes everyone around him, sending them

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.360
into a frenzy.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.279
The people riot and attack the coffee stand
to steal more blood, causing the police to

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.850
arrive to electrocute them into submission.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:37.670
The next morning, at the vineyard, Edward
takes some blood from Lionel to run some tests

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:41.550
while he asks him some questions about how
he felt the day he became human.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.180
Edward thinks maybe the only way to treat
the blood is inside the body, controlling

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.740
the daylight burn.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:51.700
Some hours later, when he leaves the lab to
take a break, most humans move away from him.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.550
Audrey comes and tells him they may fear him
but still think he can help.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:00.240
Edward confesses he didn't want to turn, but
Frankie betrayed him and turned him anyway.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.240
It's then that Edward notices the fermentation
tanks, and after Audrey confirms they're air-tight,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.400
they go to look at them from inside.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.399
The tanks have air extractors that would allow
them to put out the fire and Edward decides

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:15.360
to use them for their experiment, so they
start working on the necessary modifications.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.730
Later, in the middle of the night, we see
Jarvis' group on the road taking a convoy

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:24.029
of rescued humans to the vineyard, including
Bromley's daughter Alison.

00:10:24.029 --> 00:10:27.480
When a shot gets them a flat tire, they're
forced to stop their cars.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.149
They get out with their weapons ready, but
the army is surrounding them and after a short

00:10:31.149 --> 00:10:33.740
shooting exchange, all humans are knocked
out.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:38.100
Alison manages to contact the vineyard before
she falls unconscious too, so when Frankie

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.290
takes the walkie-talkie from her hands, they
use it to track the call and find the location

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:43.600
of the vineyard.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.470
At the vineyard, all the humans are grabbing
their things and getting into their cars,

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.529
ready to follow Tuner to his safehouse.

00:10:49.529 --> 00:10:54.149
But Edward wants to stay behind because there
won't be another chance to recreate the experiment,

00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:57.379
so Lionel and Audrey decide to stay behind
as well and help.

00:10:57.379 --> 00:11:01.519
Back at Bromley's, Alison wakes up in her
father's office and grabs a knife as he arrives

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:02.519
to see her.

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:07.370
Alison begs for her friends' lives, Bromley
says he is happy to see her but, as he hugs

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.069
her, admits he can't do anything for her friends.

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:14.509
Alison pushes him away and runs to the door
but she's knocked out by a soldier as Bromley

00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:16.700
realizes his daughter has stabbed him.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.180
When morning comes to the vineyard, the experiment
is ready to start.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.649
Audrey will watch the monitors while Lionel
will stay in the tank with Edward, who has

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:27.589
the heart monitor connected to his chest and
is covered by a wet blanket.

00:11:27.589 --> 00:11:31.850
The process is simple: they open a hole in
the tank to let the sunlight burn Edward,

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.800
then they use the air extractor to turn off
the fire.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.889
The first two tries are a failure, but they
let Edward burn longer for the third, and

00:11:38.889 --> 00:11:42.639
this time it works: Edward manages to become
human again.

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:46.449
Their happiness is interrupted by the army
arriving to raid the place, but they avoid

00:11:46.449 --> 00:11:48.930
getting caught by hiding in a wine barrel.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:52.769
We cut to the company again, where Frankie
is visiting Bromley, who is being treated

00:11:52.769 --> 00:11:54.180
for his wound.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.009
Bromley asks Frankie to do something for him,
and Frankie leaves the room to see Alison

00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:59.149
in her cell.

00:11:59.149 --> 00:12:03.249
She still doesn't want to be turned, but Frankie
goes ahead and bites her anyway.

00:12:03.249 --> 00:12:07.610
Back in the vineyard, the trio leaves their
hiding spot after making sure it's safe.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.750
Edward goes outside and is amazed by the sunlight
touching his skin without burning while Lionel

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.560
retrieves an old car of his.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.110
Meanwhile, in the company, Bromley sees how
all of his machines are empty now before checking

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.309
on his daughter, who is not drinking her blood
rations.

00:12:21.309 --> 00:12:25.279
Bromley enters the cell and discovers she's
biting herself, which will mutate her.

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:29.139
She attacks her dad and blames him for everything
before she's taken away.

00:12:29.139 --> 00:12:33.170
After the military imposes martial law so
they can freely fight the subsiders on the

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:38.220
streets, we cut to Edward, Audrey and Lionel,
who are arriving at Tuner's cabin, only to

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.910
find all the humans dead.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:43.730
Audrey is starting to lose hope, but Edward
says he knows someone that can help.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:47.480
After briefly cutting to Christoper achieving
a breakout at the lab, we're shown how the

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.089
military is dragging the subsiders out in
the sunlight for execution.

00:12:51.089 --> 00:12:55.709
Alison is among them, and watching her die
makes Franki re-consider his position.

00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:59.649
Later at night, Christopher returns to his
house, where he finds the trio waiting for

00:12:59.649 --> 00:13:00.649
him.

00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:04.240
Edward tells him he has a cure, which is better
than a substitute, and asks for his help to

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.860
recreate the experiment.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.470
Their talk is interrupted by the phone ringing,
so Christopher leaves the room to take the

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:10.470
call.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.499
When he takes too long to come back, they
get suspicious, so Audrey goes after him while

00:13:14.499 --> 00:13:18.309
Edward and Lionel check his coat: turns out
Christopher has left his cellphone open on

00:13:18.309 --> 00:13:22.369
a call all this time, and now everyone at
the company knows where they are.

00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:26.620
The army suddenly arrives and Audrey is knocked
out and captured, but Lionel and Edward manage

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.959
to escape using the subwalk tunnels.

00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:32.959
They decide to hide in an old abandoned garage,
where they're attacked by a subsider.

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:37.089
Frankie arrives then and shoots the creature
before noticing his brother has become human,

00:13:37.089 --> 00:13:41.379
making him confess he only turned him because
he didn't want to see him die.

00:13:41.379 --> 00:13:45.161
He admits he made a mistake and now he wants
to help, but when Lionel comes closer, his

00:13:45.161 --> 00:13:48.559
thirst gets the better of him and he jumps
on the human to bite him.

00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:52.499
Edward grabs him and pushes him off Lionel,
he's ready to shoot his brother but stops

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:54.520
himself when he notices something.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.699
Moments later, we see Edward willingly entering
the company building, setting off the alarms

00:13:58.699 --> 00:14:00.699
with his human condition.

00:14:00.699 --> 00:14:04.329
Security catches him and takes him to Bromley's
office, who currently has Audrey bleeding

00:14:04.329 --> 00:14:06.579
on a chair and is drinking her blood.

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:10.390
Edward tells him he regrets everything and
wants to be a vampire again, upsetting Audrey

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.079
with his betrayal.

00:14:12.079 --> 00:14:15.579
Bromley shows him they've finally found a
substitute so he doesn't need Edward anymore

00:14:15.579 --> 00:14:19.550
and calls him a coward, Edward says Bromley
is a coward too because he couldn't turn his

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:20.709
own daughter.

00:14:20.709 --> 00:14:25.310
Furious, Bromley bites Edward, but Edward
doesn't mind - in fact, this has been his

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.149
plan all along.

00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:30.800
Bromley starts transforming into a human and,
as Edward remembers how Frankie turned as

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.000
well, he explains drinking treated vampire
blood is the cure.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.149
Bromley presses an alarm to call for security,
and we cut to see a bunch of army trucks arriving

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:40.149
at the parking lot.

00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:44.200
When the soldiers leave their vehicles and
approach the elevator, the doors open to reveal

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.629
Bromley tied to a chair, causing the vampires
to go into a frenzy and feed on him.

00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:53.320
Meanwhile, Aubrey and Edward -now armed with
weapons he's found around- go downstairs and

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.800
are about to leave the building when more
soldiers arrive to block their way.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.740
The glass doors suddenly shatter when Frankie
drives Lionel's car inside, hitting all the

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.639
soldiers to save his brother.

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:05.839
But backup immediately arrives and now they're
surrounded.

00:15:05.839 --> 00:15:09.829
Frankie tells Edward to go before sacrificing
himself, allowing all the soldiers to jump

00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:11.329
on him and eat him.

00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:14.949
Edward doesn't have time to grieve his death
because a security guard has taken Audrey

00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:16.589
and he must rescue her.

00:15:16.589 --> 00:15:20.639
He follows them to the security room, where
after some struggling, Edward manages to kill

00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:23.689
two vampire guards and helps Audrey kill the
third.

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:27.679
Then they watch on the security cameras how
the soldiers that fed on Frankie became human,

00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:30.999
and the other vampire soldiers are now attacking
them as well.

00:15:30.999 --> 00:15:35.489
A feeding massacre occurs, and by the time
Edward and Audrey come back to the lobby,

00:15:35.489 --> 00:15:38.420
only a handful of human soldiers are left
standing.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.709
Christopher shows up then and shoots a couple
of soldiers, claiming there can't be a cure.

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:46.610
He's about to shoot them too when an arrow
hits his chest and kills him, it came from

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.589
Lionel who's arrived to help.

00:15:48.589 --> 00:15:52.069
Audrey gives him a hug while Edward watches
his brother's body and the light of the rising

00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:54.370
sun slowly makes its way inside.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:58.529
The movie ends with the trio leaving on Lionel's
car while Edward tells us that now they have

00:15:58.529 --> 00:16:00.440
the cure, they can change everyone back.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:00.459
It's not too late.
