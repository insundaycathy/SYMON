00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.200
Welcome to Moviecaps.
Today I will show you a Drama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.880
Mystery, Thriller film from&nbsp;
2018, titled Searching.&nbsp;

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.600
Spoilers ahead!
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.680
David Kim creates a new user account for his&nbsp;
daughter Margot and takes a picture with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.040
and his wife, Pam. As Margot is growing up,&nbsp;
photos and videos perpetuating the family’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.000
happy memories are being uploaded on youtube&nbsp;
or different files. Eventually Margot starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.880
taking piano lessons and David later buys her a&nbsp;
piano so she can practice with her mom every day.&nbsp;

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.240
One day, Pam finds out that she has lymphoma.&nbsp;
The family does their best to fight it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.880
but it doesn't work out and she ends up in the&nbsp;
hospital. Margot creates an event on her calendar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:49.360
and names it “Mom comes home”. At the hospital&nbsp;
Margot is playing a sad melody on a toy piano,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.640
while her pale mom barely manages a faint smile.
And so Pam passed away leaving her daughter and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.840
husband to take a picture by themselves&nbsp;
on Margot’s first day of high school.&nbsp;

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.200
Windows XP is updated to macOS and&nbsp;
David is messaging his daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.600
A not-so-happy father requests a FaceTime and&nbsp;
reprimands his daughter for forgetting the trash.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.880
He also asks about her whereabouts and plans.&nbsp;
Margot says that she’s gonna be running late at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.680
her bio study group and hangs up before David&nbsp;
could ask about her final. He still proceeds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.880
through messages and she admits not having done&nbsp;
so well but would still pass. David expresses how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.440
proud he is of his daughter and he types that her&nbsp;
mom would be proud too, but deletes the last part.&nbsp;

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.320
David is browsing the news while listening&nbsp;
to some relaxing music, when he gets a video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.360
call from his brother, Peter. David joins the&nbsp;
call and he’s welcomed with a cooking pot POV.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.000
His brother is trying to make a recipe&nbsp;
that was Pam’s specialty “Kimchi Gumbo”.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.760
David says that he will look for the recipe&nbsp;
but he was sure that there was no “pot” in it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.120
referring to his stash that he has left&nbsp;
on the counter near the other ingredients.&nbsp;

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.680
Peter puts the jar of “oregano” away&nbsp;
and when David inquires about his use,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.800
he quickly changes the subject. While David is&nbsp;
browsing Pam’s files looking for the recipe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.320
Peter asks him about Margot and how their&nbsp;
father-daughter relationship is going.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.240
Just as the pot master was about to&nbsp;
dig up further personal questions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.600
his doorbell rang and so he had to remind David&nbsp;
of sending the recipe asap before ending the call.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.240
While looking for the recipe, Peter comes across&nbsp;
a video of Pam making kimchi gumbo with young&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.840
Margot. Resurfacing feelings of grief and sadness&nbsp;
make David hide the video from his search results.&nbsp;

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.680
While sleeping, David misses 3 calls from Margot.&nbsp;
When he wakes up the next day he tries to reach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.120
his daughter via facetime, phone calls, and&nbsp;
texts but to no avail. By 3 pm there is still no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.600
response from Margot and after his work meeting,&nbsp;
David is about to text her when he notices that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.640
Margot has left her laptop at home which is very&nbsp;
unlike her. He leaves her another voicemail during&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.640
which he realizes that it's Friday and she&nbsp;
is usually at her piano lesson at this time.&nbsp;

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.440
He calls her piano instructor asking to&nbsp;
speak to his daughter but she is confused,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.280
since Margot had stopped attending&nbsp;
6 months ago. Taken aback by this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.120
he scrolls through his conversations with&nbsp;
Margot in which there are pictures of David&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.120
leaving her the money for piano lessons and&nbsp;
Margot saying the sessions were going great.&nbsp;

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.600
The worried father calls her school who informs&nbsp;
him that Margot hasn’t shown up to class that day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.320
Anxious, he texts his brother who suggests that&nbsp;
she might've ditched school to go on a trip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.560
with her friends and that David should ask them&nbsp;
about his daughter’s whereabouts. Not knowing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.040
any of her friends, David searches for Margot’s&nbsp;
social media accounts but they are all private.&nbsp;

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.720
David logs into the family’s old computer through&nbsp;
Pam’s session. She has been keeping the contacts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.680
of Margot’s middle school friends in an address&nbsp;
book. David dials the number of Isaac’s home and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.480
the mother picks up instantly recognizing Mr.&nbsp;
Kim. Isaac’s mom tells him that it might be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.200
reception problem since her son and friends went&nbsp;
camping and that Margot was definitely invited,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.520
and that they’d come back the next morning. The&nbsp;
angry father throws a tantrum through a long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.080
text but ends up deleting it and simply requesting&nbsp;
Margot to call him as soon as she gets reception.&nbsp;

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.560
The next morning Isaac calls David and says&nbsp;
that Margot never showed up to the trip,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.840
and didn’t respond when he tried to&nbsp;
reach her before taking off. And that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.800
was the last red flag David needed to file a&nbsp;
report for his missing daughter. Soon after,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.120
detective Rosemary Vick gets in touch with David,&nbsp;
saying she was assigned to his daughter’s case.&nbsp;

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.480
She sympathizes with him, being a parent herself&nbsp;
and asks him to give her a better insight into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.760
how the events unfolded. While the detective is&nbsp;
doing a recap of Margot’s disappearance timeline,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.320
David is googling detective Rosemary Vick&nbsp;
and he opens 3 different links: one video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.960
where she’s given an award, her Facebook page&nbsp;
that shows she has a son, and an article about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.560
her building a recovery clinic with ex-convicts.
David opens Margot’s laptop and tries to log in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.520
to her facebook, but her password isn't saved so&nbsp;
he clicks on “forgot account”. A code is sent to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.000
her email which he can't get into either, so&nbsp;
he sends another code to her recovery email,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.800
which he created so he manages to get in.
He then looks at her facebook friends list&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.520
and calls one of them. David asks him questions&nbsp;
like when he last saw Margot and where he was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.160
night she disappeared and notes it down into&nbsp;
a spreadsheet. He shows it to the detective,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.720
who asks David to update her if he learns anything&nbsp;
and also to share the spreadsheet with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.320
So David starts calling Margot's 289 Facebook&nbsp;
friends one by one, asking them the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.360
questions. After several calls with Margot’s&nbsp;
recent chats and acquaintances, he realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.440
that his daughter didn’t have any real friends and&nbsp;
that she was isolating herself most of the time.&nbsp;

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.040
After going through two thirds of her friends list&nbsp;
without learning anything useful, David voices his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.600
frustrations to Peter, who suggests taking a&nbsp;
look at her offline friends and activities.&nbsp;

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.400
David looks through her school files and contacts&nbsp;
Abigail, the girl who hosted the study group at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.040
her house that night. She says that it ended&nbsp;
by 9 pm and Margot had left by that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.840
She also enforces the fact that Margot&nbsp;
was a loner and used Tumblr a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.920
Just as he is checking it, he receives an&nbsp;
email from the detective who shares traffic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.880
footage of Margot filling up her gas and exiting&nbsp;
town. He notes down the place on Google maps.&nbsp;

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.440
David checks Margot’s bank account and he&nbsp;
notices that she has been depositing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:00.480
piano lesson money there. Six days prior she&nbsp;
made 2500$ payment to a deleted user via Venmo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.840
He checks her Instagram account&nbsp;
and notices a user called Derek&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.760
Ellis constantly posting inappropriate&nbsp;
comments on his daughter’s pictures.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.080
He looks up his number and asks him about his&nbsp;
whereabouts the night Margot went missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.240
He tries to dodge the question, but when&nbsp;
David threatens to get the police involved,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.960
he admits that he was at a Bieber concert.
Detective Vick sends David an email containing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.840
fake ID, saying that Margot met up with a forger&nbsp;
around the same time she withdrew the money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.040
The detective spoke to security&nbsp;
at Venmo and apparently she sent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.040
the $2500 to herself so it can't be traced,&nbsp;
and suggests that Margot probably ran away.&nbsp;

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.960
David refuses to accept that possibility&nbsp;
and continues his own investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.840
He goes through Margot’s most visited websites&nbsp;
and finds a streaming website called “YouCast”.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.280
Not knowing how the site exactly works, he clicks&nbsp;
on cast now and ends up starting a live stream.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.960
As soon as he does, a user called fish n&nbsp;
chips joins the cast and leaves seconds later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.880
David ends the stream and starts looking&nbsp;
through Margot’s saved livestreams.&nbsp;

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.640
Margot had few watchers but her regular&nbsp;
was “fish n chips” who initially asked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.360
her favorite pokemon to which she responded&nbsp;
with uxie, because it can wipe memories. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.680
talked almost every day and fish n chips once&nbsp;
opened up about her struggles with money to pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.600
her mom’s hospital bills as she has a bad tumor.
Afterward, David has a call with detective Vick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.600
who denies any of the YouCast members having&nbsp;
a connection with Margot’s disappearance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.400
even fish n chips had an alibi, confirmed&nbsp;
by her diner manager and CCTV footage.&nbsp;

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.800
Just before shutting down Margot’s computer, David&nbsp;
notices Picture of a lake. He goes on her Tumblr&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.680
and sees another picture of the same lake. He&nbsp;
finds it on google maps and realizes where she was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.360
going that night. He rushes to the lake and calls&nbsp;
the detective, but she's asleep because it's 4am.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.080
A bit later she calls him back and David shows her&nbsp;
Margot’s Pokemon keychain he found by the lake.&nbsp;

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.840
The following morning Margot’s case is all over&nbsp;
the news. Her car was retrieved from the Lake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.440
but Margot wasn't in it. People are&nbsp;
volunteering to search for Margot in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.520
the forest since there’s a lot of ground to&nbsp;
cover. The search gets halted due to heavy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.680
rain and the internet is flooded with articles&nbsp;
and videos about Margot from people blaming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.520
her father for negligence to her classmates&nbsp;
pretending they were best friends for clout.&nbsp;

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.880
Frustrated by Derek’s Facebook post, David&nbsp;
goes to meet him and beats him up. This causes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.200
Vick to cut him off from the investigation.
David comes across a subreddit dedicated to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.080
the case where a bunch of reddit detectives share&nbsp;
their theories. He finds pictures from the car and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.120
he notices a Fins hockey hoodie in the front seat.
This leads David through Margot’s chats with his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.920
brother. To his surprise, Peter and his nephew&nbsp;
were secretly meeting on several nights,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:39.280
and he finds some highly suspicious messages.
He starts writing an email to Vick, but changes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:45.280
his mind. Instead, he goes to his brother’s house&nbsp;
and plants cameras. He then starts asking Peter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.920
about Margot, what kind of relationship they&nbsp;
had and how often they would meet. Disturbed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.560
Peter replies that it was a normal uncle-nephew&nbsp;
relationship and that they didn’t meet often.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.440
He shrugged off further questions as he went back&nbsp;
to finish making the tea. David doesn’t stop and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.240
starts reading their texts out loud. Peter replies&nbsp;
that he can explain but David doesn’t listen and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.960
starts beating his brother up, accusing him of&nbsp;
the unspeakable. He doesn’t stop until Peter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.120
shouts that they were smoking “pot” and nothing&nbsp;
near the assumption his brother was making.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.880
David ignores a call from Vick and listens to what&nbsp;
Peter has to say: Margot was suffering. She needed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.760
to talk about her mother, which David never&nbsp;
did. And that’s why she stopped piano lessons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.240
because it reminded her of Pam and she still&nbsp;
didn’t have closure concerning her loss.&nbsp;

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.480
David realizes how little he knew about his&nbsp;
daughter and drops to the couch sighing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.840
He ends up picking up the detective’s&nbsp;
call that brings him to the ground crying.&nbsp;

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.520
Randy Cartoff, an ex-convict, has uploaded a&nbsp;
confession online of torturing and murdering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.600
Margot, before taking his own life. And&nbsp;
that was enough to declare her dead.&nbsp;

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.000
David starts uploading pictures for a&nbsp;
memorial service and when he's done,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.880
a thank you page appears with a picture of a&nbsp;
woman holding flowers. David realizes that it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.720
the same woman that appeared on Margot's&nbsp;
livestreams under the name fish n chips.&nbsp;

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.200
He searches the profile picture on google&nbsp;
and finds a bunch of pictures of her doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.200
various things. He doesn't realize that&nbsp;
Margot was catfished and that the woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.440
in the profile picture is just an actor&nbsp;
for stock photos kinda like ma boi Harold,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.240
so he tracks down her number and calls her.
She seems clueless about the streaming website&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.160
and all the details that the detective&nbsp;
presumedly checked out. David tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.960
reach Vick but she doesn't pick up. He then&nbsp;
reaches out to the 911 dispatcher who couldn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.760
connect him to Vick directly, yet she praises&nbsp;
Vick’s volunteering for the case. David makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.400
the dispatcher repeat herself twice, as he was&nbsp;
sure Vick said she was assigned to the case, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.960
the dispatcher said that it was done voluntarily&nbsp;
as soon as the missing person report was filed.&nbsp;

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.560
David takes another look at detective Vick.&nbsp;
Opening the same news page he did initially,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.080
he notices that one of the ex-convicts&nbsp;
next to her is Randy Cartoff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:53.040
so he asks to be connected to the Deputy Sheriff.&nbsp;
Next thing we see on the memorial stream is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.400
David Staring down Vick as she gets arrested.
When being interrogated, she explains that 6&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.200
months ago her son found Margot on the streaming&nbsp;
website. He had liked her since grade school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.840
so he made up a new identity and started talking&nbsp;
to her. They were friends and talked a lot until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:13.680
Margot found his Venmo account and sent him&nbsp;
$2500 for his mothers made up hospital bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.920
He had to come clean, but didn't want to do it in&nbsp;
public so he followed her that night to the lake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.080
As she was getting high, he got in her car, and&nbsp;
she panicked, before he could explain himself. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.800
tried to run and he accidentally pushed her off a&nbsp;
cliff. Vick assumed that Margot was dead because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.440
the cliff was narrow, jagged and at least 50 feet&nbsp;
to the rock bottom and she couldn't hear a sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.640
So she took lead of the investigation, convinced&nbsp;
David that Margot ran away and told the law&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.720
enforcement team that the zone her body was&nbsp;
in was already cleared. She still needed a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.040
confession so she drugged the ex-con, ordered&nbsp;
him to read a script and shot him afterwards.&nbsp;

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.640
Now knowing her location, a team has been&nbsp;
dispatched to retrieve Margot. Turns out she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.840
is still alive and makes a full recovery.
Some time later, Margot is continuously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.360
refreshing her application for the music&nbsp;
conservatory while texting her father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.720
She’s come to have closure concerning her mother’s&nbsp;
death and is ready to take back her piano passion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.880
Her father on the other hand is no longer&nbsp;
reluctant about bringing up Pam, and while telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.880
Margot that he’s proud of her he sends the text&nbsp;
that he deleted at the beginning of the movie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.200
that her mom would be proud too.
The End.&nbsp;

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.560
