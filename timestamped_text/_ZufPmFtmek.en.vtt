00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.820
Welcome to Cinema Summary,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.360
and CITIES OF LAST THINGS
is a dark movie that explores

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.960
one man's life, the mystery of why he does things, and

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.860
how he's slowly dying on the inside over
the years

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.340
and this is the City of Last Things

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.440
the film opens up on a building as
doowop music plays before a man jumps

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.080
off the roof ending his life and
establishing the tone of the film quickly

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.369
and efficiently: it's in the dystopian
future of Taiwan where drones are

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.690
commonplace and used to monitor the
people and the people themselves have

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.070
microchips in their wrists, where we find
ourselves following our protagonist the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.079
elderly retired cop Zhang Dong-LIng, a
cynical and jaded man who is out of

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.030
place with the world which isn't helped
by the fact that the film is shot on 35

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.710
millimeter which adds more grit to an
already gritty world and the first thing

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.640
he does after working out is heading to
a dance competition and punching out a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.170
man touching his wife after getting
kicked out he catches a self-driving bus

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.630
where he studies the Minister of Social
Resources Zhi-Shi Wei before he's told to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.729
meet up with a contact at the North
Municipal Hospital body takes a detour

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.840
stopping at a brothel to get a gun for
a contact there and learns about an

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.000
expensive drug that supposedly makes the
working girls 'beautiful' more on that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.470
later as he leaves the North Municipal
Hospital he runs into a corrupt

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.850
undercover cop who's trying to sell
the services of underage girls which

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.890
in the future is 24, believe it or not
and as he's showing Dong Ling the girls

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.570
he spots a foreign girl and takes
particular interest in her and wants to

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.430
meet with her. When he meets her he scans
her wrist chip with a POS, a super

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.020
futuristic smartphone of sorts and the
wrist chips themselves function as a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.520
form of ID and camera and he's
disappointed to learn that she isn't the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.799
person he recognises even though the
resemblance is uncanny and one thing leads

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.540
to another and he has a "session" with her
and while they're engaging in their

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.440
session he says a name "Ara"

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.940
A name which she responds to but

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.100
once the session is over she charges him
for a roleplay experience which clearly

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.580
confirms that she wasn't the girl he was
thinking of and she just thought that he

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.240
got really into the role-playing and called 
her that name then he gets on a bus

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.080
remembering his youth in the reflection
of a window as an announcement for a new

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.400
drug called Rejuvenator resounds in the
background. He goes to the North

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.570
Municipal Hospital where he gets briefed
on the target he's going to kill as well

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.410
as given a disguise and some other
things like a severed hand to break into

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.360
the targets room. The target in question
is a Minister of Social Resources Zhi Shi

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.540
and the way that dong Ling talks to him
implies familiarity and bad blood

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.530
it sounds like "Vice-Captain Zhi Shi" isn't
the upstanding man that he presents

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.270
himself as – as we will soon find out –
after messing with the minister's wrist

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.130
chip, Dong Ling kills him and escapes
getting rid of any evidence in a bin

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.060
he goes to meet his daughter and they have
a chat that reveals a lot of things for

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.810
one his daughter is dating a foreigner
named Tim and they intend to leave the

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.060
city and Dong Ling has had a strained
marriage with his wife Ya Fun for

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.410
something that happened 30 years ago
something that he hasn't forgiven her

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.400
for and after talking with his daughter
Dong Ling goes to visit his wife's

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.800
apartment where the man he punched from
earlier is walking out of who Dong Ling

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.989
promptly beats up after the man demands
that Dong Ling divorce his wife speaking

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.070
of his wife she's trying to take a new
fangled and pricey beauty enhancing drug

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.600
called "Rejuvenator" – that drug that I was
talking about earlier which has

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.180
anti-aging properties implied to also
have reverse aging properties he

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.269
confronts her about the drug use and
they get into a fight about her

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.680
infidelity and he ends up killing her
this sets off her wrist chip and the man

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.900
he beat up is found by a security guard
and Dong Ling is reported to the police

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.010
who send an aerial drone after the man.
Dong Ling with nothing left to lose or

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.760
gain shoots at the drunk before leaping
onto it sending them both to their death

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.980
and that's how he dies just like that
man from the beginning of the film we

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.239
then go back 30 years into the past
where we see a girl that kind of looks

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.850
like that prostitute from earlier who
is caught shoplifting in his

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.290
arrested by a young Dong Ling a
hot-blooded cop who works a little too

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.330
hard and too much something that
Vice Captain Zhi Shi, the man who

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.010
Dong Ling kills in the future, notices
about him after going on duty he stops

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.630
by his apartment to visit his wife just
to quickly drop by and stumbles onto his

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.580
wife with another man vice captain Zhi
Shi which explains why Dong Ling and

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.540
Ya Fun  have such a strained
relationship in the future and why Dong

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.520
Ling kills Zhi Shi in the future that
and one other thing and Dong Ling almost

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.260
kills him but is disarmed and is taken
down before being forced at gunpoint to

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.360
leave the apartment and after doing some
dark contemplation he goes back to this

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.370
police station and opens up Zhi Shi's
locker to find it filled with bundles of

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.840
cash and in anger he throws it around
getting the attention of the other

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.750
officers and his boss who demands to see
Zhi Shi. After trying and failing to go

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.380
back home and get answers from his wife
as well as spending time with his infant daughter

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.180
Dong Ling chills outside a convenience store

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.960
where he spots a familiar foreign
girl who is back to shoplifting again

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.130
Dong Ling stops her and buys the things
she steals, leaving her alone only to be

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.620
confronted by a black van and a
suspicious man who he runs away from he

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.700
doesn't make it far though and is
abducted by the men in the van one of

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.770
which is Zhi Shi and is taken to a
stairwell where he's beaten and humiliated

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.320
by Zhi Shi for screwing up everything and
 not taking any bribes and Zhi Shi almost

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.120
executes him before that girl from
earlier interrupts so Zhi Shi and his

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.680
men leave him alone as the girl takes
Dong Ling a long bus ride to have a smoke

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.550
before taking him to a house party where
they have a joint with their little

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.770
adventure ending in them going to her
friend's place where they make love and

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:23.140
where she introduces herself as Ara and
that's how Dong Ling and Ara met and

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.060
that's why he saw the resemblance
between the prostitute and Ara but their

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.900
afterglow is gonna have to wait as the
home owners come back and Ara sneaks

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.350
Dong Ling out only for the homeowners,
presumably Ara's friends

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.320
finding her and asking her why she's
stole a bunch of money

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.540
something that we never see in the film
and after a few tense words, Dong Li

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.490
and Ara drive away on a motorcycle and
chill before going their separate ways

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.790
never to see each other again
with Dong Ling going back to the station

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.850
where he's arrested and framed by Zhi
Shi and the other cops for taking bribe

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.620
money from gangsters as he sits
contemplating about his life Dong Ling

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.470
remembers a woman and we go back once
more into the past where we follow Big

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.550
Sis Wong a big-name criminal who's
probably connected with the Triads and

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.840
the Tongs, a fearsome lady who was
probably paranoid as she grabbed me

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.770
hostage while eating dinner after
spotting some suspicious men who

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.640
happened to be plainclothes police
officers out to arrest her so she runs

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.420
away ducking and turning down alleyways
hiding in the darkness of the night in

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.700
the city while at the same time a young
man tries to steal a motorbike and these

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.690
two unlikely figures end up literally
running into each other and running away

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.550
from the police and after being pushed
into a wall and hit by a car the boy the

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:47.500
woman respectively are arrested Big
Sis Wang is taken to an interrogation

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.180
room where we learn that her life is
in danger as she snitched on someone she

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.960
shouldn't have and will be taken to jail
she's brought back outside of the room

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.340
where she and the young men have a chat
and after a curious conversation that

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.330
turns to the topic of the boy's name – 
which is Dong Ling – the woman goes

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:09.070
ballistic: yelling and hitting the boy for
trying to steal a bike and going on the

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:13.720
wrong path in life because this random
lady who he had the misfortune of

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.580
running into is his real mom who wants
him to turn away from crime even though

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:23.320
she disappeared from his life years ago
and the film ends with them taken into

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.430
two separate police cars literally
separated once more and as they look at

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.840
each other through the car windows, Big
Sis Wang is shot leaving Dong Ling

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:37.450
motherless once more and distraught as
he can do nothing but watch as she's

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.000
taken from him one more time

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.900
Cities of Last Things is a tribute to film noir

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.100
with its chiaroscuro lighting
the themes of sexuality and the cynical

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:53.089
protagonist, it looks at the darkness
within man and society while framed

00:08:53.089 --> 00:08:56.779
against an ever-changing city which
takes on three different forms

00:08:56.779 --> 00:09:01.579
while still holding on to that darkness
with the city itself inflicting pain and

00:09:01.579 --> 00:09:06.709
loss on Dong Ling again and again
driving him to make decisions he

00:09:06.709 --> 00:09:09.529
becomes a cop to honor the wishes of his
murdered mom

00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:14.060
and he kills both his wife and Zhi Shi, out
of an anger that has been festering for

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:20.930
decades due to his wife's infidelity and
as the title implies it's a "city of last

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:25.880
things", again and again taking from Dong
Ling until all that he has left is his

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:31.100
life which in a way was already taken
before he ever gave it up because the

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.970
film starts in reverse order, he was
always fated to lose himself to

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:40.130
the city: it's a cynical piece of cinema
that is as gritty as the films strips it

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.399
was shot on and with that being said
