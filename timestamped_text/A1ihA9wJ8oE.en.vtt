00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.840
Story Recapped here. Today I'm&nbsp;
going to explain a fantasy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.960
horror, and thriller film called "The Heretics."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.320
Amid a cult ritual, Gloria is surrounded&nbsp;
by masked individuals under a locust moon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.960
All of them chant in unison&nbsp;
before taking their own lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.720
However, Gloria wakes up and realizes that it&nbsp;
is a nightmare of what happened five years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.560
She has been a victim of abduction&nbsp;
for that purpose, but she escaped.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.160
Her mother, Ruth, rushes to Gloria's room to&nbsp;
comfort her scared and distressed daughter.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.720
The following day, Gloria attends a&nbsp;
support group meeting at a local church.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.640
Most of the members are victims of&nbsp;
traumatic events and abuse in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.960
One of them, Mary, shares her experience, but&nbsp;
Joan, Gloria's lover, interrupts her by saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.760
that God isn't real. The therapist reprimands&nbsp;
her and asks her to leave the group, which she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.240
does. Gloria and Joan are both volunteers&nbsp;
in a shelter and work together with Kent.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.280
After the session, Gloria and Joan end the night&nbsp;
in bed together. As her way of showing love,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.080
Joan gives Gloria a bracelet and says she has&nbsp;
something special for their anniversary tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.760
According to Joan, the necklace will keep&nbsp;
her safe whenever they are not together.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.040
While walking alone to her house, Gloria passes&nbsp;
by an old van which she finds suspicious.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.480
A man from behind abducts her and&nbsp;
forces her inside the vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.000
Gloria gains consciousness and sees that she&nbsp;
is chained. While her abductor is busy driving,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.680
she tries to retrieve her bag quietly&nbsp;
and manages to get a hold of her phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.200
She contacts her mother, but she does not&nbsp;
pick up, so Ruth goes straight to voicemail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.680
The abductor notices it and immediately grabs the&nbsp;
phone before knocking her unconscious once again.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.040
After some time, the abductor brings Gloria&nbsp;
to a secluded cabin with chains hanging from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.080
her wrists and ankles. He lays her down to chain&nbsp;
her to the wall while she is still knocked out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.600
Gloria dreams of awakening from the&nbsp;
ritual with her body drenched in blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.680
She walks in horror through the corpses&nbsp;
of the cultists who took their own lives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.320
but she wakes up. Not long after, the&nbsp;
abductor's identity is revealed—Thomas,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.600
a man whose face is covered in scars and&nbsp;
other symbolic drawings around his body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.200
According to him, the cultists need Gloria before&nbsp;
tomorrow's sunrise, and after that, she will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.640
free. When Gloria asks why she has been abducted&nbsp;
again, Thomas says that she needs to be "saved."

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.600
Meanwhile, Joan calls Ruth after not seeing&nbsp;
Gloria in the shelter where they volunteer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.040
Ruth runs to Gloria's room to check and is&nbsp;
in shock to not see her daughter around. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.320
she rushes back to the phone, she discovers the&nbsp;
voicemail from Gloria, making her worry even more.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.560
Later that day, Ruth gets in touch with the&nbsp;
police and is interviewed by Officer Carter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
However, he claims that the police can&nbsp;
only do so much but wait for more leads.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.920
It prompts Joan to organize a search&nbsp;
with other volunteers from the church.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.880
Gloria lashes out at Thomas for the cult's&nbsp;
malpractices back in the cabin, claiming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.280
that they ruined her life. Thomas says that&nbsp;
he has been a part of the cult his whole life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.400
and he even saw Gloria five years ago during the&nbsp;
ritual. After seeing her on that horrible night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.440
he decided that the cult was delusional, and it&nbsp;
had to be stopped. On the night of the sacrifice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.120
Thomas faked his death because he&nbsp;
stopped believing in the cult's purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.840
He adds that Gloria's abduction serves the purpose&nbsp;
of finishing what he started and saving her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.640
Later, Thomas takes a break outside and&nbsp;
finds Gloria unchained inside the cabin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.240
When he turns back, she sees her&nbsp;
standing behind him as if seducing him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.720
It turns out to be a false vision, and he&nbsp;
sees the real Gloria spitting out blood.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.200
All the while, Joan tirelessly distributes flyers&nbsp;
around town, hopeful of Gloria's return. While&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.080
doing so, Joan puts a knife on a man who refuses&nbsp;
to look at Joan's flyer out of frustration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.320
Gloria's disappearance has spiraled&nbsp;
her into a state of panic and urgency.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.400
Back in the cabin, Gloria sees the door open&nbsp;
wide, and a cloaked figure emerges from the dark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.360
The chains make her more helpless in the given&nbsp;
situation, leaving her no resort but to scream.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.920
The figure approaches her, but it is just&nbsp;
a vision of one of the cult members. Thomas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.320
calms her down and tells her that the ordeal&nbsp;
will end once he protects Gloria until sunrise.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.800
That evening, Joan receives a call from Ruth, who&nbsp;
asks her to come over. As she arrives, Officer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.520
Carter questions her about Gloria's disappearance&nbsp;
with hints of suspicion. The officer brings out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.120
the necklace found at the abduction site—the one&nbsp;
she gave Gloria. Moreover, the issue about Joan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.400
pointing a knife at the uncooperative man is used&nbsp;
against her, as if she caused harm to Gloria. Ruth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.600
takes Carter's side while he orders Joan to come&nbsp;
with him to the police station. In a fit of rage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.920
Joan takes out her murderous impulses on&nbsp;
Officer Carter and Ruth, killing both of them.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.120
As the night grows, Thomas observes the cabin's&nbsp;
surroundings while tending to Gloria's needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.560
She begs him to tell her what truly&nbsp;
happened on the night of the ritual.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.600
Thomas informs Gloria that the cult intended to&nbsp;
welcome their dark lord Abaddon under the light&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.880
of the last locust moon five years ago. If so,&nbsp;
they will be reborn under the same locust moon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.520
five years later. The cultists believe that&nbsp;
their lord is inside Gloria for the past five&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.440
years and has been growing stronger. They&nbsp;
would have finished the ritual that night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.400
and she would have been sacrificed&nbsp;
to bring Abaddon into the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.960
He warns Gloria that not all cult members are&nbsp;
dead, meaning that they should be more careful.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.840
Meanwhile, an angered Joan opens a secret doorway&nbsp;
in her house and kneels before a figure surrounded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.120
by candles. She sincerely prays to it, claiming&nbsp;
it as her lord, revealing that she is part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.040
cult. While asking for strength, she flogs herself&nbsp;
as punishment for losing Gloria. Afterward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.280
she sets out on a journey to find Gloria and&nbsp;
continue bringing her lord into the world.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.880
As time passes, Gloria becomes weaker in&nbsp;
the cabin, so Thomas repeatedly comforts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.920
her. As he speaks, Gloria sees an apparition&nbsp;
of Abaddon, causing her to be more unhinged.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.800
Later, Thomas sees Gloria growing weird&nbsp;
holes in her shoulders and realizes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.080
truth to the cult's beliefs. He excuses himself&nbsp;
and walks away, disturbed by what he witnessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.040
When he turns back, Thomas sees Gloria standing&nbsp;
in front of him in an attempt to be a subject of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.760
seduction. She kisses him and pins him to&nbsp;
a chair, where they become more intimate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.040
Not long after, Gloria morphs&nbsp;
into a demon before vanishing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.080
Thomas is caught off-guard and checks on the real&nbsp;
Gloria, who has completely lost consciousness.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.160
Gloria's crippling state urges Thomas to provide&nbsp;
her more comfort, so he transfers her to a bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.800
When she tells him, she feels weird about herself,&nbsp;
and he is in denial of Abadoon's existence.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.320
Back in the shelter, Joan gets mad at the&nbsp;
volunteers for calling it a day to find Gloria.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:36.160
Kent approaches and introduces her to Mr. Vela,&nbsp;
who provides information about seeing a suspicious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.640
van. He provides the tip that the abductor's&nbsp;
face is covered in scars and is headed east.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.520
Instantly, Joan is certain of who the abductor&nbsp;
is and begins her journey of following his trail.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.600
Meanwhile, Gloria says that she could not take it&nbsp;
any longer in the cabin and needs Joan beside her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.680
Upon hearing her name, Thomas reveals&nbsp;
that Joan, whose real name is Gwen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.320
is his sister. She is the cult's "chosen one"&nbsp;
and is the only one left to finish the ritual.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.240
The scars and marks on his face are&nbsp;
all caused by his ruthless sister.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.240
All the information is too much for Gloria&nbsp;
to handle, leaving her even more confused.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.320
Out of nowhere, Thomas hears distant noises from&nbsp;
outside and comes out to check the surroundings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.960
While he is still preoccupied, an invisible&nbsp;
force unshackles Gloria from her chains,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.600
allowing her to escape. She gets up and stumbles&nbsp;
upon a room filled with pictures of her and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.640
Thomas' plot on her abduction. Suddenly, she&nbsp;
hears noises from behind and runs out of fear.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.560
Gloria runs through the woods and is reunited&nbsp;
with Thomas, who comforts her. As they embrace,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.560
Thomas notices her hair fall drastically&nbsp;
and decides to return her to the cabin.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.440
At their arrival, Gloria's metamorphosis continues&nbsp;
as she spits chunks of blood and grows wings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.520
Thomas discovers her semi-transformation&nbsp;
and persuades her to be locked up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.680
However, Gloria refuses to be&nbsp;
chained and restrained once again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.400
claiming that Thomas is selfish&nbsp;
and wants to protect himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.080
At the moment, Gloria is seemingly unrecognizable&nbsp;
because of her poor and evil-like appearance.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.880
Meanwhile, Joan and Kent drive through a&nbsp;
dark road until they locate the vehicle used&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.880
in the abduction. Kent says that it would&nbsp;
be better to communicate with the police,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.600
but she is hesitant to do so. Both of them&nbsp;
check the vehicle's interior from the outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.880
and out of nowhere, the sadistic&nbsp;
Joan stabs Kent and leaves him.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.920
With Gloria's progressing inhuman appearance,&nbsp;
random flashbacks on the night of her abduction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.840
resurface. Upon realizing that&nbsp;
the demon is already inside her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.040
Thomas holds Gloria at gunpoint, saying that&nbsp;
dark forces overtake her. On the other hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.360
Gloria starts losing herself mentally&nbsp;
and begins to speak in Abaddon's voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.400
She says that Thomas will be killed&nbsp;
before his soul is brought to hell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.880
He takes the gun away from her face and gets&nbsp;
a flashback of him being burned by Joan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.320
Thomas rushes outside while he continues to&nbsp;
remember the bitter past. All his sufferings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.120
are behind his sister's doing, whom he reunites&nbsp;
with again, in the most unfortunate situation.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.960
Gloria wakes up surrounded by candles while&nbsp;
she is tied to a chair. In a comforting voice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.600
Joan tells her that everything is going to&nbsp;
be okay. Despite Gloria's pleas, Joan pays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.040
her no mind and even taunts her about her physical&nbsp;
degeneration. Shortly after, she puts the necklace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.560
around Gloria's neck, planning to kill her without&nbsp;
remorse. Gloria is heartbroken, to say the least;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.920
Joan's surprise for their anniversary&nbsp;
turned out to be her untimely suffering.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.640
Meanwhile, Thomas wakes up inside the&nbsp;
cabin, but Joan has locked him from outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.400
He peeks through the door and persuades Joan into&nbsp;
stopping her sadistic ways, but to no avail. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.040
siblings continue to talk about their childhood,&nbsp;
revealing that their parents owned the cabin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.080
Determined to stop the cult's inhumane practices,&nbsp;
Thomas rips out the planks of woods one by one to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.480
escape captivity. He eventually escapes&nbsp;
and plans to stop his sister right away.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.240
While Joan chants an incantation for Gloria around&nbsp;
the pentagram, visions of other cultists appear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.800
behind their leader. Gloria is helpless and is&nbsp;
gradually taking the form of Abaddon while the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.160
occult ritual progresses. Thomas breaks the door&nbsp;
with an ax to stop the ceremony, but he ends up in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.360
an empty field. There, he sees Gloria approaching&nbsp;
her, letting him know how beautiful the place is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.840
Abundant plants fill the land as the skies&nbsp;
are similar to that of a beautiful sunset.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.120
Once again, Gloria seduces him, but he&nbsp;
soon realizes that it isn't her after all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.960
He breaks free from the illusion and&nbsp;
slashes the ax into Joan's back in reality.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.200
However, Joan survives the hit&nbsp;
while Gloria becomes more powerful.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.920
She continues reciting the ritual, putting&nbsp;
Gloria in total control of the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.280
Thomas tries to stop Joan countless times but&nbsp;
fails every time, in accordance with Gloria's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:39.280
powers. As the ritual nears its end, Abaddon&nbsp;
emerges from outside, walking toward Gloria.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.640
His evil figure overpowers the whole room, but&nbsp;
Thomas tirelessly tries to stop the ritual.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.360
Without a choice, he kills his sister with a&nbsp;
shovel, causing Abaddon to shriek and disappear.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.960
After some time, Thomas tearfully approaches&nbsp;
Gloria's seemingly lifeless body and brings it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:00.160
outside. As the sun is about to rise, Gloria&nbsp;
opens her eyes before saying, "it's over."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.280
Gloria suddenly attacks him and reminds the&nbsp;
poor man that his soul will burn for eternity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.640
In his dying breath, he witnesses&nbsp;
Gloria take a demon's full form.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.040
Not everything is as it seems,&nbsp;
and Gloria found out the hard way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.960
The woman whom she trusted her life was&nbsp;
the very person who wanted to take it away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.920
and the man who abducted her ended up being her&nbsp;
savior. But ultimately, Thomas pledged his life&nbsp;&nbsp;
