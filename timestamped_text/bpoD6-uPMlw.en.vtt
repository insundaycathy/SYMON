EPILEPSY WARNING AT 1:56
SKIP TO 2:00 IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.060
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.250
Everything changes for 3 friends after a hunt for a hacker goes terribly wrong.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.140
This is The Signal

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.770
So this is Nic, he's a cripple with a heart of gold

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.200
and he's smart enough to get into MIT [The
Massachusetts Institute of Technology]

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.860
Now he's on road trip with his girlfriend, Haley, and
his best friend and fellow hacker, Jonah,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.130
who is trying to track down a mysterious
hacker known as Nomad.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.719
Now, Nomad is really good at hacking: wayback
when, Nomad hacked into MIT’s servers which

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.780
got Nic and Jonah’s curiosity.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.879
That night, Nic and Jona stay at a motel,
where Nic and Jona get another message from

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.100
Nomad and it doesn’t say much.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.800
So Nic, fed up with Nomad, tells him “We
will expose you”.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.359
Only to get another message a few seconds
later, Nomad has hacked into Haley’s laptop

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.710
and is using its webcam to spy on Nic and
Jonah.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.620
And then they realize that Nomad is a hacker
on a whole nother level.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.530
So they track NOMAD’s IP address and figure
out Nomad’s real world location: somewhere

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.530
in Nevada.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.519
So off they go to hunt down Nomad.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.550
On their way there, they stop at a gas station
and we learn a bit more about the group: Nic

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.970
has become distant to Haley, because Haley’s
moving to go to a different school, away from

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.800
Nic and Jonah which is putting some stress
on Nic and Haley’s relationship.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.940
When he and Haley talk about her moving, he
confesses that he feels like he’s holding

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.200
her back and he’s afraid that when they
break up: it’ll hurt.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.220
And Haley takes it as well as you would.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.070
After driving into Nevada, the group tracks
NOMAD’s location to an abandoned house in

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.480
the middle of nowhere.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.310
So Nic and Jonah go to investigate and they
bring a video camera to film the whole experience.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.160
And after some searching, they find a room
that leads to the basement and down here they

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.470
find some strange server racks.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.320
And that’s when they hear a scream.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.320
Haley!

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.750
They run upstairs to find Haley is gone and
the car doors are left opened and when they

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.380
turn around they see Haley get violently pulled
up into the sky and they rush after her as

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.890
a bright light glows brighter and brighter
until finally...

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.240
He’s in some sort of facility where people
in hazmat suits work; he’s put in a wheelchair

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.739
and taken to a room.

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.400
Meet Dr. Wallace Damon, he is a scientist
that’s part of a team that’s trying to

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.420
understand what happened to Nic and his friends:
because Nic and his friends came into contact

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.380
with “The Signal”, which is an alien lifeform
or as they describe it

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.140
an ‘extra-terrestrial biological entity’.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.480
And to make matters worse, Nic and his friends
may have been contaminated by The Signal in

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.750
some way.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.569
And then Nic starts bleeding from the nose
and Damon walks over to Nic, reaching forward

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.480
and wiping it away.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.420
He’s relieved: it’s just blood.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.569
That’s the end of the ‘first’ session’,
and Nic is taken back to his room where he

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.900
finds a set of numbers tattooed on his arm:
2.3.5.41 as well as a seatbelt that’s locking

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.569
a blanket over his legs (Huh, weird).

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.530
And then we see that Nic is being watched
from behind one-way mirror.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.320
it looks likes he’s going to trapped here.
Maybe, forever!

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.850
But slowly he begins making a plan to escape,
he just needs to figure out a few things first.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.890
We then see Nic get wheeled around the facility,
and we see that there are rooms being deeply

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.500
cleaned but then he passes by a room and he
sees Haley, unconscious!

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.450
Something’s wrong with her!

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.450
But what?

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.120
And Nic desperately tries to get in there
but he’s taken away to his next session

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.120
with Damon.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.310
And it’s here, Nic asks him what’s wrong
with Haley and Damon brushes him off and begins

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.540
interviewing Nic.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.460
This time Nic is strapped to a lie-detector
and asked a series of questions.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.480
Like “Do you have 10 toes?” and “Are
you from Earth”

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.880
Dumb questions but he answers them

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.400
After he answers the questions, he’s shown
the recording of the night he and Jonah went

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.860
into the house.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.680
And then we see a face with big eyes, hiding
in a tree.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.310
Nomad isn’t just a hacker: Nomad seems to
be an alien.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.040
Nic is still shocked by the time he is brought
back into his room when he hears coughing

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.060
from the vents and he realizes it’s Jonah!

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.970
He begins talking with Jonah through the vent
and he finds out that they are somewhere underground,

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.470
contaminated with an alien virus or bacteria,
and that the scientists did something to Jonah.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.489
In their next session, Nic asks Damon why
the clocks don’t work specifically the one

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.960
at 7 windows back, left turn, 4 windows, right
turn, 2 windows on the right, next to the

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.400
bathroom with the sign that’s upside down.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.709
That clock.

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.480
And Damon just brushes it off as a ‘broken
clock’.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.120
After doing a stupid test for Damon, Nic makes
a deal with him:

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.840
I’ll only do more tests IF you take me to Haley

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.220
So Damon takes Nic to see Haley, and when

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.420
Nic checks the clipboard there’s no information
written on it.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.380
Strange.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.740
But Damon explains that Haley’s in a coma
and that she’s being cared for,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.520
so Nic doesn't have to worry.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.010
And Nic is taken back to his room where gets
to work on his plan and the first step is

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.030
to make a device that allows him to blow cracker
dust on the keypad lock to figure out the

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.030
password.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.700
He shares the password with Jonah but Jonah
tells Nic that he’s not feeling too good:

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.580
ever since he drank some weird stuff, Jonah
can’t feel his arms anymore.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.980
And then we see Damon overseeing an experiment
where a cow is in a room, and slowly a door

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.980
in the back opens.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.440
Damon plays a loud noise and then the lights
black out in the testing room and after a

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.960
few moments a chair hits the window.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.410
That’s when the lights come back on, we
see the cow hiding behind a pillar and an

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.490
alarm is ringing.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.500
But we have no idea what just happened, but
don’t worry, I’ll explain this later.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.980
We then see Nic get pushed along a hallway,

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.720
as the lights turn off and the alarms turn on

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.320
And we overhear an announcement

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.080
“A Subject has escaped”.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.440
As Nic gets taken back to Damon, he sees gouges
scratched into the walls of the hall.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.830
What could have done this?

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.410
In the next session Nic asks Damon what happened
to the hallway and about Jonah.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.060
But Damon doesn’t tell him about what happened
in the hallway but he does tell Nic that Jonah’s

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.130
body was never recovered: he was never here
in the facility.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.190
And Nic’s confused: Then, wait, who was
I talking to through vent?

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.700
And Damon is like “Really?

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.700
Through the vent?

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.169
Are you sure about that?”

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.419
Leaving us and Nic, confused.

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.950
The scene ends and we have no idea if Damon
is lying or if Nic is going crazy.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.490
And the next thing we see

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.229
Is Damon in Nic’s room, lifting his mattress,
to find Nic’s escape plan because Nic has

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:58.229
escaped.

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.979
And he has taken Haley with him, dragging
her bed behind him, attaching it to his wheelchair.

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.370
Dodging scientists and he almost manages to
escape but at the last moment he is stopped

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.449
by the scientists.

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.440
We then see a montage of Nic running and spending
time with Haley.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.200
These are his memories and when Nic wakes
up, he’s staring into Haley’s eyes.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.340
She’s awake now and they talk for a while
only for Haley to go back to sleep.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.639
And Nic begins freaking out and tries to reach
for Haley.

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.570
The scientists in the room try to push him
away but accidentally push him off the bed.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.780
And as soon as they realize this, the scientists
leave the room.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.889
Nic sees black blood on his fingers and then
he sees his legs.

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:36.120
And we see his legs are robotic.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.540
And he begins freaking out a bit but manages
to calm down and like any man makes sure it’s

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.240
only his legs and not his [Whistle] that’s
robotic.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.449
And then Damon confesses, they knew about
this: the scientists saw that his legs had

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.740
changed and were interested in how he got
them.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.300
But they didn’t want him to freak out so
they kept his legs covered up until now.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.210
And Nic uses tape to cover his legs with a
blanket and Nic decides then and there that

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.370
he’s getting out of here.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.040
He kicks down the door using his robotic legs
taking Haley with him, into the elevator.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.540
He's made it!

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.850
But Damon stops them and pleads with Nic to
stay down here, because only down here can

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.169
Damon protect Nic from ‘them’.

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:12.820
As to who or what Damon is talking about?

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.440
We don’t find out as the elevator door closes
and Nic escapes with Haley taking her outside

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.160
to the middle of nowhere.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.320
As Nic and Haley walk through the desert,
they’re picked up by a woman in an old car

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.320
and as they drive.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.400
Suddenly, she stops,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.790
listening to a noise.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.550
“it’s God’s little angels.”

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.889
Her words, not mine.

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:30.949
So she’s obviously crazy.

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:34.040
They stop at a gas station, with Nic going
into the nearby service center, where he makes

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.889
a call as Haley waits near a big rig truck.

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:40.670
But Nic can’t get signal on the payphone
and to make matters worse, there’s a PSA

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.710
on TV warning people not to come in contact
with him.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.419
And Haley just went into the big rig truck
and the truck is driving away.

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:52.170
So, Nic chases after the big rig truck and tries
to break in only to get knocked off by the

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.170
driver.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.170
But guess what?

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.919
This just makes Nic even more determined to
save Haley and he starts sprinting and thanks

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:00.699
to is robot legs, he can catch up with the
truck pretty quickly.

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:05.410
And as the driver reaches for his gun, Haley
threatens him with his own gun, and kicks

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:09.569
him out, driving away with Nic, leaving the
driver on the side of the road.

00:08:09.569 --> 00:08:10.960
And as they drive away, they suddenly stop

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.980
Because in front of them is a dead end.
The road is missing.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.639
Meanwhile, we see Damon interrogating the
woman from earlier, and she’s gone crazy.

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:25.240
Repeating herself, saying random things, and
just like Nic, her nose starts to bleed and

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.510
as he sees this, Damon opens his red briefcase
where inside there’s a gun.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.650
This can’t end well.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.589
Nic and Haley drive around until they find
themselves at an abandoned visitor’s center.

00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:38.979
Nic tries to find something inside that might help them but there’s nothing

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:42.300
although Haley has found a map and looking at it they realize that something’s wrong.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.030
The way they drove doesn’t match the map
that he’s looking at, and as Nic tries to

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.290
figure out where they went wrong, he realizes
Haley’s outside.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.120
And outside, she asks him if he hears ‘that
noise’.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.089
He doesn’t hear it and he doesn’t know
how to get out of here.

00:08:55.089 --> 00:08:58.810
Their best bet is to go across the river but
that’s going to be a challenge and right

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.050
now, they’re tired so can think about it tomorrow.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.730
They sleep at at the visitor’s center only
to get woken up in the middle of the night by a noise.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.520
And we see outside the visitor center a team
of gun men in hazmat suits approaching the

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.520
building.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.310
Damon and his team have found them!

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:17.910
And as Nic and Haley hide behind a desk, Nic
peeks around the corner to our surprise he

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.010
finds Jonah’s there!

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:23.680
So Damon isn’t at the visitors center, he’s
actually visiting the truck driver from earlier,

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.510
trying to find out where Nic and Haley are.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.500
And just like the woman from earlier?

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.040
The driver has gone a bit crazy and has become
childish, talking about his mommy and his

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.620
kitty until he finally snaps and tries to
kill Damon with a shotgun.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.830
Damon just shoots him dead.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.390
As Hailey sleeps, Nic finds a spinal implant
and some numbers on Haley’s back.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:47.720
He still has no idea what happened to them
well he doesn’t but Jonah does.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.670
Y’see, as Jonah and Nic talk, Jonah reveals
something very important: That ID number on

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.700
Nic’s wrist and presumably Haley’s back?

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.020
That’s not for a person.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:01.190
It’s for an area: Area 51, the legendary
military base of the US Airforce.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.870
So in case you didn’t know, is
a real place.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:08.060
It’s a United States Airforce facility situated
in the Nevada.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:12.170
Kept under heavy guard and kept top secret
so much in fact, that you can’t even see

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.170
it on Google Earth.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.170
They censor it.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.110
And because of this secrecy there are a lot
of theories as to what’s going on there,

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:22.050
and a lot of those theories believe that alien
technology is being studied at Area 51.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.950
Which would explain why Damon is so interested
in Nic and his friends: he wants to understand

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.269
how they’ve changed, he wants to understand
why they’ve changed, and he probably wants

00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:31.020
to know how he can use them.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.760
At least that’s what it seems like.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.430
So this whole area: the little town and the
roads and the buildings?

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:37.430
They’re fake.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.190
It’s all under the control of Damon and
his team.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:43.610
And that’s not the only reveal that Jonah
has for Nic: Jonah’s also changed.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.390
His hands are robotic just like Nic’s legs.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.380
So there are a few things about Jonah that you might not have realized yet:

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.120
#1) He was at the facility

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.080
Damon lied to Nic when he said that Jonah wasn't there
just to mess with Nic’s head.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.250
Secondly, Jonah was in the room with the cow,
he was supposed to kill the cow with

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:04.160
his hands but he didn’t and he escaped which
is why there are those gouges in the walls:

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.170
He created them.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:09.010
And chronologically, this makes sense, as
Nic tries to talk with Jonah through the vent.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:14.640
But he can’t because by this point, Jonah
has already left the facility, he’s escaped

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.720
But this is perfect!

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.030
With these obvious robot body parts, they
can find the police or a news team and tell

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.459
the world about the messed up experiments
happening here!

00:11:21.459 --> 00:11:25.360
They can expose Area 51 and Damon and then
they can go home free!

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.640
But first they have to get out and there’s
only 1 way out and that’s through a checkpoint.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.447
And it’s there at the checkpoint the next day, where things
go bad:

00:11:32.447 --> 00:11:33.830
They’re stopped at the checkpoint

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:38.240
and Jonah is asked to get out of the truck,
but if he does that it’ll reveal who they are

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.080
He tries to drive away only for the car blockers
to come up, stopping his wheels.

00:11:42.089 --> 00:11:46.160
There’s no way out, so Jonah attacks a guard,
taking his gun and runs into the guardpost

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.600
where he tries using a laptop to hack the
car stoppers.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.830
But he can’t!

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.110
His fingers too big and clunky.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:58.290
And that’s when a grenade comes flying through
the window and explodes, so as Jonah stumbles

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:01.230
to the truck, his arms are glowing, but he
ends up getting shot.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:05.709
He’s dying, he’s not going to make it
and so his last actions before he dies is

00:12:05.709 --> 00:12:10.050
to SMASH the car stoppers with his hands and
set Nic and Haley free.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:14.920
As Nic drives off, he leaves Jonah to his
last moments: smashing the ground and sending

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.700
the people around him flying!

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:22.540
But there’s one last roadblock: Damon with
his crew of guards, snipers and cars.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.940
The guard’s throw a spike strip that stops
the truck.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.210
And as it flips over and crashes, Haley
and Nic are left lying on the road, holding

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:34.310
their hands, and Nic can do nothing but watch
as Hailey is taken away in a helicopter.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.970
All he is left with, of Hayley, is Haley’s
necklace.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:41.880
He gets up, he’s so close to escaping if
he can just get past the guards!

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.480
But Damon warns him that there’s no way
he’s getting out alive.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.200
And Damon can’t help but be pleased.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:51.120
Nic is ‘their’ greatest achievement: The
Perfect Fusion of alien technology and human will

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.620
That’s when Nic has a realization: He stares
at Damon’s name tag.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.780
Damon.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.720
NOMAD.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:03.160
Damon is Nomad and with a furious yell, his
legs light up and he blazes a trail past the

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:07.980
barricade, past the gunman, screaming across
the bridge, breaking the sound barrier, and

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.790
straight through… glass!

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:15.410
And he finds himself in an industrial building
and as he turns back, he sees Damon take off

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:19.610
his helmet to reveal that he’s actually
a robot!

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:26.810
And as the movie ends, we get a better view
of where Nic is: inside Area 51, a giant floating

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:34.100
spaceship going into an even larger spaceship
in a galaxy far, far away from Earth

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.800
So what just happened?

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.300
Well, in case it wasn’t clear: Nic, Haley,
and Jonah were abducted by aliens.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.021
That desert that they were in was just an
elaborate, life-sized simulation created by

00:13:43.021 --> 00:13:45.570
the aliens to keep tabs on their human test
subjects.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.649
The simulation was meant to look and feel
like Earth to keep the humans calm and to

00:13:49.649 --> 00:13:51.870
allow the aliens to conduct their tests.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:52.870
What are they testing?

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:57.290
The ability of the humans to use the alien
technology to it’s fullest potential.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:02.579
Because the aliens are trying to find the
perfect fusion of human will and alien technology.

00:14:02.579 --> 00:14:06.660
And we see how they test this by sending the
characters into high stress situations where

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.860
they are forced to use their new body parts:
Like Jonah for example.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:14.250
Jonah’s put into a room where he was supposed
to kill a cow but he doesn’t and then later,

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:18.970
after he fails to hack a laptop he has no
choice but to smash the concrete car stoppers

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:23.440
with his hands and then he smashes ground
in his last stand showing the awesome power

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.740
of his hands.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.160
And like Jonah, Nic was also tested: when
he was escaping, when he was chasing after

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.360
the truck and of course at the end of the
movie: where after he loses all his loved ones

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.000
He runs across the bridge so fast, that he
breaks the sound barrier.

00:14:36.019 --> 00:14:38.990
Showing us what the perfect fusion of alien
technology and human will can do.

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:42.520
So before I forget, let’s talk about the
other people in the simulation.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.500
They are just like Nic: they’ve been abducted
by the aliens except hey’ve been kept in

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.970
the spaceship for so long that they’ve gone
a bit crazy.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:53.340
And interestingly enough, Damon calls a few
of them, like the truck driver and the old woman

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.660
By their names, which implies that he’s
had some time to get to know them.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.931
And just to illustrate how long they’ve
been stuck in the spaceship (or at the least

00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:00.931
the truck driver).

00:15:00.931 --> 00:15:03.910
Now It’s implied that the truck driver has
been here since he was a child.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:09.360
And we know because of a few things: #1) It’s
how he acts, and #2) it’s because he mentions

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.899
a few things specifically his ‘mommy’
and his ‘kitty’.

00:15:11.899 --> 00:15:14.310
It’s a very childish way of talking about
your mom and your cat. Right?

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.020
It’s not conclusive.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:20.660
But it is a subtle hint that he was abducted
as a child and he has grown up here in the

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:21.670
simulation.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.260
With that being said, thank you so much for
watching ladies and gentlemen gentlemen.
