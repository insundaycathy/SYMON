00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.970
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.450
Today I'm going to explain a science fiction
psychological thriller film called 10 Cloverfield

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.450
Lane.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.879
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:10.790
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.519
In New Orleans, a fashion designer named Michelle
frantically packs a suitcase.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.940
She heads out, leaving her keys and a diamond
ring behind.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.630
She drives out of the city, plagued with troubles
in her mind.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.520
While filling up her car at a gas station
that evening, Michelle sees a suspicious truck

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.330
park behind her car.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.970
She ignores it and continues her journey.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.910
Back on the road, she receives a call from
Ben, her ex-fiance.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.550
Ben begs for her to come back, but Michelle
refuses to speak.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.740
The couple had a fight which caused Michelle
to leave abruptly.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.170
Tired of his pleading, Michelle ends the call
and turns the radio on.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.030
The news reports a power surge that caused
a widespread blackout in the city.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.260
Ben calls her again, but something crashes
onto her car before she can answer, causing

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.510
it to flip off the road.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.290
Michelle wakes up in a nondescript concrete
room, seeing her leg injured and chained to

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.390
the wall.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.900
The power hums, waning in and out.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.590
Michelle tries to pry the shackles off, but
it's no use.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.200
Michelle weeps, confused and terrified.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.079
Not wanting to be a victim, she grabs the
IV pole and uses it to grab her phone from

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.219
the opposite corner of the room.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.479
She's successful only to find her phone has
no service.

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.549
Heavy footsteps sound from the other side
of the wall.

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.069
Michelle covers herself with a blanket, awaiting
her captor.

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:27.939
A large man enters, carrying a plate of food
and a gun on his belt.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.459
Michelle begs for her life, but the man doesn't
acknowledge her.

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:33.619
Instead, he fixes her IV bag.

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.659
The man, Howard, claims that he simply intends
to keep her alive.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.679
He gives her a set of crutches, telling her
to practice walking with them.

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.259
Michelle bluffs, telling him that her fiance
will call the cops.

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.789
Howard confidently tells her that no one is
looking for her before tossing her the key

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:49.789
to the chains.

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.349
As soon as he's out, Michelle frees herself
and puts on clothes.

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:55.810
She tries to open the door, but it's locked.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.159
Determined to escape, she uses the key to
file a sharp end on her crutch.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.960
She opens the vent in her room and lights
her shirt on fire, producing enough smoke

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.349
to trigger the fire alarm and force Howard
to return.

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:10.539
Ready to fight, she waits by the door and
ambushes him.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.180
But Howard grabs her and injects a sedative
on her arm.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.140
Michelle wakes up in the same room, food waiting
for her.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.190
Howard admires her spunk but says that she
should be thankful that he found her.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.850
Michelle begs for her freedom again, but Howard
tells her there's nowhere else to go.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.319
Howard recounts saving her from the car crash.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.900
He explains that a potential nuclear attack
happened, but they're safe in his bunker.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.129
Hoping to get on his good side, Michelle thanks
him but suggests that she needs a hospital.

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.140
This frustrates Howard, claiming that the
air outside is contaminated, and it could

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.019
be a few years before it's safe to go out.

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.849
Michelle wants to call her family, but Howard
is sure that everyone outside is dead.

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.810
A noise from outside informs Michelle that
there's someone else with them in the bunker.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.739
Howard locks her in the room again before
dealing with the other person.

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.569
Hours later, Michelle wakes up to find the
door is finally open.

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.209
She walks out and sees a hallway full of supplies.

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.379
There, she meets the other resident, Emmett,
whose arm is injured.

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.830
Michelle brings up trying to escape with him,
but Emmett is also convinced that the air

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.040
outside is contaminated.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.790
Howard finds them, telling Michelle that the
sound earlier was Emmett knocking down a week's

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.390
worth of food.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.910
Howard gives them a tour of the common area
stocked with DVDs, books, and other entertainment

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.040
media.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.280
Howard lays down some rules, including the
no-touch rule.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.319
He shows Michelle his private room, where
the only bathroom in the bunker is, asking

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.999
her to take a shower.

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:36.340
Despite Michelle's insistence on privacy,
Howard decides to keep watch by the door,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.349
as he doesn't trust her yet.

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.280
While preparing a meal, Howard mentions Megan
but only says that she's not with them any

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.420
longer.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.579
When the power fluctuates, Michelle suggests
that it's caused by a car above them.

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.060
Howard insists that there is no one above
them.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.530
Seeing that Michelle still doubts him, he
takes her to the exit with a window to the

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.730
outside world.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.170
There, Michelle sees his decaying pigs, whom
Howard claims have died due to the poisoned

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.250
air.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.620
Michelle turns her eyes across the field,
seeing Howard's truck.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.379
Her mind plays the moments before the crash,
sure that this was the same truck that ran

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.000
her off the road.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.690
Michelle's suspicions towards Howard grow.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.340
Emmet gives Michelle information about Howard.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.270
Howard worked on satellites for the military
before moving to the farm, where Emmett helped

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.160
Howard build the bunker.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.140
Michelle shares her theory that Howard purposefully
crashed her car to kidnap her, but Emmett

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.930
doesn't believe this.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.450
The day he came into the bunker, Emmett saw
the explosion.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.310
Knowing that Howard's theories about the apocalypse
were coming true, Emmett fought his way into

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.870
the bunker to survive, injuring his arm in
the process.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.380
Michelle insists that she heard a car above
the bunker earlier, but Howard interrupts

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.820
her and invites them to dinner.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.110
Michelle is uneasy at the dining table, wondering
if Howard heard what she said.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.550
Emmett tries to start a casual conversation
with the other two.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.150
This helps Michelle lighten up, much to Howard's
frustration.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.350
Emmett's jovial mood angers Howard, but he
pushes this down, simply telling Emmett that

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.610
he'd rather eat in peace.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.460
Watching how Howard is easily annoyed, Michelle
formulates an idea.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.900
She focuses her attention on Emmett, seemingly
flirting with him.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.310
Howard is visibly jealous and enraged.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.730
When he sees Michelle touch Emmett's hand,
he slams the table and corners Michelle, accusing

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.440
her of insulting him.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.390
Emmett tries to calm him down but is also
afraid of him.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.230
After they're seated down, Michelle hides
keys in her hands under the table, having

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.980
taken them from Howard.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.560
The sound of a car overhead catches all of
their attention.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.010
Seeing an opportunity, Michelle grabs a bottle
and slams it across Howard's face.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.680
She climbs up the table and to the bunker's
exit.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.260
Her hands shake as she unlocks the door.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.290
Howard clambers up the steps, barely reaching
her before she opens the first door and closing

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.630
it behind her.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.990
She starts opening the second door but spots
a car in front.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.220
Hope fills Michelle.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.650
She starts calling for help while still struggling
with the locks on the door.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.970
Suddenly, a woman covered with lesions crashes
against the door, begging Michelle to let

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:56.970
her in.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.470
Howard orders Michelle not to let her in.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.840
Finally realizing that Howard may be telling
the truth, Michelle stops unlocking the door

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.260
and asks Howard if they can help the woman.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.380
The woman starts banging her head on the door.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.080
The frightened Michelle backs away.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.650
After the event, Michelle is kept in the concrete
room again.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.020
Howard confesses that he crashed her car,
but it was an accident.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.750
He knew the attack was coming after hearing
the news.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.140
He drove in a panic to get back to his bunker,
and it caused him to crash her car.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.480
He offers her a set of Megan's old clothes
to clean up.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.451
After showering, Howard tells her that the
woman outside was a neighbor, Leslie, who

00:06:31.451 --> 00:06:33.390
could've heard about his bunker.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.150
He then has Michelle stitch up the wound she
caused on his face.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.650
After giving Michelle her belongings from
her car, Howard finally opens up about his

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.140
estranged daughter, Megan, who was taken to
Chicago by her mother.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.570
Later, Emmett tells Michelle how he competed
in track competitions, which got him accepted

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.790
to Louisiana Tech University.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.380
But he got scared about failing and didn't
go.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.600
This prompts Michelle to share how she was
always protected by her brother when their

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.170
father got mad.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.930
But when she had a chance to help another
girl with an enraged father, Michelle still

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.730
got scared and ran.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.640
She regrets her actions, but Emmett promises
her that their lives can still mean something

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.820
since they're still alive.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.070
Over the next few days, the trio adjusted
to life underground, enjoying each other's

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.370
camaraderie.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.680
One day, the bunker shakes, and they hear
helicopters flying overhead as the power flickers.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.410
Howard figures that even if it's the military,
it might be the enemy sweeping the ground

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.410
for survivors.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.530
An alarm sounds.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.170
Their air filtration system is blocked.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.710
Michelle is assigned to climb into the vents
and restart the air filtration system.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:40.110
Inside the cramped space, Michelle struggles
but eventually reaches the mechanical room.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:44.270
She restarts the system as Howard instructed
and is relieved to hear it running again.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.940
Then, she sees a ladder leading up to a hatch
to the outside.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.860
On the window, she finds scratches that spell
HELP.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.120
At the bottom of the ladder, Michelle picks
up a familiar-looking earring.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.380
While they're alone, Michelle shows Emmett
the earrings that looked like they had blood

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.450
on them.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.460
Then she shows Megan's photo wearing the same
earring.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.140
But Emmett recognizes the girl in the photo
as Brittany, who went to high school with

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.850
his sister and went missing two years ago.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.580
Michelle tells him about the word HELP scratched
from the inside of the room.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.050
Another photo slips out of Howard's book,
one of Brittany and Howard sitting together.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.170
Brittany's shirt is the same one that Michelle
is wearing.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:24.470
Emmett plots to take Howard captive and get
him to confess what he did to Brittany.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:28.400
Michelle questions who Howard can confess
to, as there's nobody else but them.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.580
Howard interrupts them and tells Michelle
to shower.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:36.260
While preparing her shower, Michelle stares
at the shower curtain, formulating a plan.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.070
She shows Emmett a drawing she did on a magazine,
convincing him to follow along.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.150
Later that night, Emmett grabs a pair of scissors
from the kitchen.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.500
Then, he convinces Howard that Michelle may
have contaminated his bathroom when she took

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.580
a shower after fixing the air filtration system.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:57.070
As a precaution, Howard disposes of the shower
curtain, but Michelle secretly retrieves it.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:01.140
Using various materials in the bunker, Michelle
makes a hazmat suit so that one of them could

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.580
go outside and look for help.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.950
While playing a board game, Emmett becomes
flustered, making Howard suspicious.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:12.400
Later that day, Michelle continues to work
on the hazmat suit when Howard arrives, barely

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.190
giving her time to hide everything.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.410
Michelle, Howard, and Emmet transfer a barrel
from the kitchen to Howard's room.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:24.130
Howard explains that the acid inside can dissolve
most biological material, including humans.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.670
Howard starts interrogating them about his
tools, threatening to dissolve them into the

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:28.980
acid.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.020
Hoping to calm him down, Emmett lies that
he took the tools to make a weapon, and Michelle

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.560
had nothing to do with it.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.580
He tells Howard that he wanted Michelle to
respect him the way she respects Howard.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.780
He apologizes, and Howard accepts it, then
shoots Emmett in the face.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.680
Michelle cowers in fear, with Howard holding
her, telling her that Emmett would have hurt

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.680
her.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.600
He asks her to go to her room while he disposes
of Emmett's body.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.840
Alone, Michelle mourns for Emmett, looking
at the ID from his wallet.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.240
Howard walks in, and she sees that he had
cleaned up and shaved.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.510
He leaves her a bowl of ice cream.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.690
Michelle finds the bus ticket that Emmett
was supposed to use to go to the university.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:09.080
Not wanting Emmett to have died in vain, Michelle
decides to go through with the plan alone.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.900
She continues making the hazmat suit before
Howard calls her for dinner.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.850
She hides the make-shift gas mask in the vent
just before Howard walks in.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.820
But a screw on the vent falls.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.080
He checks on it and asks her why it's loose.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.260
Then, he spots a part of the suit under her
mattress.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.610
Furious, he drags her off the mattress and
reveals the suit underneath.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.550
Michelle locks the door with Howard still
inside.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.730
She searches Howard's room and takes a chemical
coolant.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.800
Howard stops her, but she kicks the barrel
of acid towards him, causing him to tumble

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.620
down, gurgling in pain.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.900
Michelle climbs over him and escapes.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:47.070
The acid causes a fire in the living room,
setting off the alarm.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.240
Michelle gathers the hazmat suit and mask
from her room.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.180
Howard staggers towards her, his body half-burnt.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.100
She brings down a shelf to stop him, climbing
over it to escape.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.779
The fire blocks her way to the bunker's exit.

00:10:59.779 --> 00:11:04.410
Michelle climbs into the vent, hoping to escape
through the mechanical room hatch instead.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.990
Howard hears her crawling inside the vent
and starts stabbing a knife into it.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:12.480
He grabs Michelle by the ankle, but she kicks
her legs until he releases her.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.680
In the mechanical room, Michelle hurriedly
puts on the hazmat suit, using duct tape to

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.230
seal every seam.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:22.020
She climbs to the hatch and freezes the padlock
with the chemical coolant.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.230
After numerous attempts, she breaks it and
opens the hatch.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.740
Finally above ground, Michelle breathes heavily,
looking around for any sign of life.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.630
She sees Howard's old truck and gets inside
but rips a tear in her suit.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.070
Fearing contamination, she seals it with duct
tape.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.700
Once fixed, Michelle hears a flock of birds
flying overhead.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.020
She watches them, realizing that the birds
should have died if the air was poisoned.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.760
Taking the risk, she removes her mask, waiting
for the worst.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.260
But nothing happens.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.100
Relieved, Michelle chuckles.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.250
A rumbling from afar catches her attention.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.370
She climbs on top of the truck and sees an
aircraft.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.900
Something moves from inside the nearby shed.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.710
Thinking that it's Howard, Michelle hides
behind the truck.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:06.760
Instead, the bunker explodes.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.220
Michelle watches the aircraft turn, alerted
by the explosion.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.520
As it gets nearer, it dawns on her that the
aircraft is an alien.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.390
Michelle gets back in the truck, searching
for the key.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:21.650
When she can't find it, she goes to Leslie's
car but triggers its alarm.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:25.370
Michelle rushes to the shed to hide, seeing
Leslie's body inside.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.150
She checks outside and sees a creature coming
out of the field.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:33.520
Michelle searches Leslie's body for the keys,
but the creature peers into the shed.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.250
Michelle finally takes the keys and shuts
the alarm off, diverting the alien's attention

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:38.860
back to it.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.900
Michelle crawls out of the shed and runs to
the house nearby.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.029
The creature hears her and gives chase.

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:48.190
Both Michelle and the alien stop when a rumbling
comes from the house.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.010
Behind the house, the alien aircraft looms
over.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.330
Seeing it release gas, Michelle retrieves
her mask and frantically seals it on.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.990
The gas causes another explosion just before
it passes.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.750
Michelle gets up, alerting the creature to
attack.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.400
She gets inside the truck but fails to close
it.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.610
The creature opens its mouth, grabbing hold
of her mask, before pulling away with its

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:09.750
prize.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:14.360
Michelle closes the truck, but the truck is
pulled into the air by the alien aircraft.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.260
Seeing the large being above her, Michelle
sinks, losing hope.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.710
Beside her, she finds a lighter, giving her
an idea.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.730
She grabs the liquor rolling on the floor
and creates a Molotov cocktail.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:29.680
When the creature opens its mouth, Michelle
throws the explosive inside.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.940
The alien explodes and drops the truck.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.210
The alien aircraft crashes and burns on the
field.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.390
Michelle wakes up and gets out of the truck.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:41.800
She takes time to catch her breath, finally
having time to let the situation sink in.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.760
She spots Leslie's car, undamaged.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.320
She gets inside, thankful that the car still
works.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.220
Michelle drives off, knocking down the mailbox
that bears the address, "10 Cloverfield."

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.640
The car radio picks up a transmission.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.240
The broadcast directs survivors to go to Baton
Rouge.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.000
It also requests help from people with medical
and combat experience, asking them to help

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.210
survivors in Houston.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:09.070
Michelle finds herself at the crossroads between
Baton Rouge and Houston, thinking of which

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.660
path she'll take.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:18.519
She heads to Houston to help the survivors
fight.
