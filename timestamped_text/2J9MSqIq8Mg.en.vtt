00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.670
Hey guys, today we will be watching the movie
"The Tomorrow War".

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.010
The movie starts with a scene in which we
see some people falling down from the sky.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.360
Movie's protagonist Dan is one of those people
he along with other people fall into a swimming

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.180
pool of the high-rise building.
When Dan comes out of there he has a gun in

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.220
his hand and he seems ready for a war.
From here we go 28 years back it's Dan's daughter's

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.990
birthday and he has brought a lot of gifts
for her.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.380
Dan's wife reminds him that his father had
sent a letter for his granddaughter's birthday.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.950
Dan tells his wife that he doesn't need greetings
from his father and that he should forget

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.640
about his granddaughter as well.
Dan is a biologist and he has a job as a teacher

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.440
which he isn't very happy at.
He is going for a job interview but before

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.940
even he gets to leave his house he gets a
rejection call.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.540
Dan becomes frustrated and angry because of
the rejection he returns home and starts watching

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.280
tv with his daughter.
There's a football match going on suddenly

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.079
a portal of some kind opens up in the middle
of the football ground and out of that portal

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.460
lot of men come out in combat uniform and
Then their leader Lieutenant Hart makes her

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.969
entrance.
Lieutenant Hart starts explaining the situation

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:09.390
she explains that they have come from the
future and that there's a war going on in

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.090
the future.
She then reveals that they are here to recruit

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.159
people to join them for the war due to the
concerning threat to the entire human race

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.170
and its existence the government decides to
send the military from the present to fight

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.490
the war in future.
But the military from the present is unable

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.710
to win the war so the government decides to
send civilians as militants in the war of

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.609
future.
One day Dan is teaching to his class in the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:35.729
middle of which Dan receives a message which
tells him to report his draft status for the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.630
war.
After few experiments on him Dan is seemed

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.009
eligible to participate in the war.
When Dan asks why he is fit to go to the war

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.560
the people in the lab reveal that he is going
to die in seven years.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.079
So by logic his participation in the war isn't
going to change his and his family's lives

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.319
by much.
Hearing this Dan is confused and before he

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.259
can even comprehend what's going on a device
is fitted on his arm.

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.810
The device allows Dan to jump to and from
the future war they also reveal that if Dan

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.920
removes that device from his arm they will
put him in prison and his family member will

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.689
have to take his place in the war.
Dan now tells his wife about the whole thing.

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:15.099
Being worried she suggests that they should
run away from the government.

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.099
Dan says that they cannot run away from the
government but his wife asks him to go to

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.129
his father who can help him.
Dan at first refuses this idea but his wife

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.790
asks him to do this for their daughter.
Now Dan goes to his father his father tells

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.799
him that he can remove that device but later
it turns out that Dan's father doesn't believe

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.250
him and thinks that Dan is here to help the
cops arrest him.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.989
After this they have an argument.
Tt is then revealed that when Dan was a child

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.599
his father had left him and his mother.
Dan's father tries to explain why he did that

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.980
but Dan refuses to believe him and leaves
without removing the device from his arm.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.329
He goes to his wife and says that there is
no solution if I am chosen I have to go to

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.709
the war.
Dan's wife becomes sad after hearing this

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.160
she says that if he has accepted this decision
she cannot stop him.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.580
And now goes to his daughter he tells her
that he will be leaving for an urgent piece

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.580
of work and that he will be gone for a week.
Dan's daughter understands that he will be

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.379
leaving for war she gets sad but Dan assures
her that he will be back.

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.250
Dan now leaves after saying goodbye to his
daughter.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.829
In the next scene we see Dan with many others
reach the research center they're all handed

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.109
out weapons and are briefed that they will
be at war for a total of seven days.

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.940
And if they are able to survive those seven
days they will be brought back to the present

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.850
time.
At the center, Dan meets Charlie and few other

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.969
people. Charlie tells Dan that the person
in red shirt is called Dorian. It is Dorian's

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:41.400
third time going to war in the future. It
is also revealed that the thing over Dorian's

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.299
neck is the claw of a White Spike which is
the thing that the human race is at war against.

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.681
In a separate briefing for the first timers,
one woman asks an interesting question. she

00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:55.099
asks that if we have a time machine then why
don't we go to the time just before the war

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.610
started and not let it begin. Then a young
man explains that they can only jump to and

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.590
from time at a range of 30 years which is
between 2021 and 2051.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.620
Here it is revealed that the thing they are
going at war against are aliens called White

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.700
Spikes and that they rest every six days which
is when the people from present will go out

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.750
and fight while the aliens rest.
In the next scene Dan is talking with Charlie

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.470
then suddenly alarm starts going off a research
center in the future is under attack by the

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.230
White Spikes so they need to go right now
to stop it or else everything the human race

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.690
knows about the aliens will get lost in that
research center they all line up and the portal

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.390
opens up above them slowly everyone gets sucked
by the portal and the controller of the portal

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.100
senses something wrong but it's too late and
most of them are already gone to the future

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.390
now we go back to the scene which started
the movie due to the mistake in the time machine

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.350
many of them land to their death Dan however
with few others are lucky to land in the swimming

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.830
pool the remaining people group up and the
view of the future totally shocks them it's

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.900
total chaos and the city of miami is in total
ruins Dan gets in communication with the people

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.940
in the present time due to Dan's experience
in military he is told to assemble everyone

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.620
and rescue a team from a building which is
surrounded by the White Spikes Dan gets everyone

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.120
together and heads to the building the building
seems to already have been attacked by the

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.490
White Spikes Dan and his team find the research
team dead Dan tells this to the colonel who

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.150
commands them to collect few data and samples
from the lab and head out of there immediately

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.210
they all collect the necessary hard drives
and data from the lab the colonel commands

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.791
the bomb squad to drop bomb on the city so
Dan and his team have to get out of there

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:39.030
quickly White Spikes are surrounding the building
so Dan and his team decide to take the stairway

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.200
it's really quite here they're all cautious
of their surrounding Dan hears a soft growling

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.430
he tells everyone to stay silent he looks
down the stairway but there's nothing down

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.710
there so they all slowly go down the stairway
then one of the team members notices something

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.770
moving in the upper floors he calls out everyone
to notice it Dan points his flashlight to

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.920
the thing and then we see what the White Spikes
really look like the White Spike shoots a

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.140
spike from his body that instantly takes out
one of Dan's team members now everyone starts

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.500
shooting at the White Spike the attack provokes
all the White Spikes and they take down few

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.100
of the humans Dan and Charlie try to fight
off one of the White Spike they shoot at it

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.010
intensely but it doesn't die Dan tells everyone
to run while he attempts to hold one of the

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.820
White Spike that is after them Dan keeps shooting
but the White Spike isn't hurt and charges

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.680
towards Dan realizing that bullet isn't causing
any harm to it Dan takes out the axe from

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.670
the building and manages to hit it on the
White Spikes head but it still doesn't die

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.820
Dorian then comes back and shoots the White
Spike on the neck which finally kills it Dorian

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.310
explains that to kill it humans need to shoot
it on its neck or bellies that is the only

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.720
way to kill them Dan and his team are finally
outside the building and they get back up

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.630
from few tanks they're all happy to see the
backup but it doesn't last long as White Spikes

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.120
take down the tanks as well they have no option
but to charge forward as the bombing squad

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.800
starts dropping bombs on the city while running
away from the bombs one of the team members

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.480
falls down a rail and breaks his legs

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.170
Dorian wants to leave him and go to safety
but Dan wants to save the guy and so he and

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.770
the team jumps down as well but it's too late
to save him as the White Spikes are all over

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.620
there one woman from the team tells Dan to
leave as she has been shot they try to fight

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.190
off the White Spikes and get enough time for
others to escape the bombs drop in at the

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.930
same time killing the White Spikes in a matter
of seconds the whole city is bombed down Dan

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:36.090
Charlie and Dorian are the only ones that
manage to survive they are at a new base and

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:41.550
are safe for now Dan asks Dorian on why he
is at the war for the third time Dorian answers

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:46.800
that he has cancer and rather than dying a
slow death he prefers to die in his own terms

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.730
then an officer comes to them and says the
Charlie and Dorian are to redeploy against

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:55.940
the White Spikes as for Dan he was asked to
see by the colonel anne meets the colonel

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.140
who thanks him for bringing back the samples
from the research lab Dan then gets to know

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:05.200
that the colonel has the same last name forester
as him Dan asks her where she's from colonel

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.930
replies that she is from the same place as
himself Dan gets silent and realizes that

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:15.060
she is his daughter miri Dan tries to get
close to her but murray stops him Dan says

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:19.260
that he will respect her rank as a colonel
and not referred to as his daughter Murie

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.700
tells Dan that due to the lack of manpower
she's not only a colonel but also acts as

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:28.610
the lead researcher Dan seems very proud of
her Murie explains that she didn't bring him

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.860
here to spend time with him she brought him
there because he has to do something to save

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:38.479
the human race Dan asks her the reason but
murray says that he will know in time murray

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:43.520
now tells Dan about the female White Spikes
she tells him that the females are much stronger

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.010
and aggressive than the males the female White
Spikes nest underground and reproduce at a

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.360
massive rate while the males protect them
Muri further explains that they had found

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.700
out a way to kill the males but the females
were different she tells him that they plan

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.280
to capture a female White Spike and do tests
on her to find out a way to kill the females

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.640
to stop the reproduction of the whole species
of White Spikes the team heads out to catch

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.340
the female White Spike on their way Dan asks
murray what happened in the future between

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:15.260
him and his family murray refuses to tell
him anything but she seems sad about it they

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.510
reach the nesting ground of the female White
Spikes a few people are pulling the chains

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:24.440
tied to the female White Spike who is inside
the cave the female finally gets outside and

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.180
starts attacking everyone they are failing
to capture the female Murie decides to go

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:33.600
down to help her team Dan wants to go with
her but she commands him to stay there as

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.390
he is important to her plans murray goes down
and shoots off a tentacle of the female which

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:43.030
gets it really angry the White Spike attacks
murray while the others try to pull it inside

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:47.650
the cage meanwhile Dan notices a storm of
male White Spikes who are on their way to

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:53.020
save the female he sees one male coming towards
the cave so he goes down and kills it Dan

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:57.760
goes down into the cave and helps murray and
her team to finally get the female White Spike

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.430
into the cage after fighting off the White
Spikes with a tank Dan and murray managed

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.450
to escape from there they reach a beach and
wait for the rescue team to take them from

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.810
there while waiting Dan and murray talk about
what happened after Dan had returned from

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:15.420
the war Murie reveals that after Dan returned
from the war he was a completely different

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:20.279
person he left Murie and her mother to be
all alone by themselves when yuri needed him

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:25.130
the most he wasn't there for her because of
this Murie was sad all her life and didn't

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:30.700
seem too happy to see Dan come back from the
past Dan and miri now reach the new facility

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.520
they have the female White Spike with them
the White Spike is put to sleep with heavy

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.240
doses of sedatives all that is left to do
is to study the female White Spike's body

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.910
and find what is stopping the toxins to kill
it Dan and murray know that if they are able

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:48.330
to detect a female White Spike's defense against
a toxin they can create something that will

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:53.370
neutralize the White Spikes defense and subsequently
kill all of the species they're on multiple

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:58.080
tests but they cannot find anything that will
help them Muri starts getting frustrated with

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.720
the amount of failed tests Dan wants to help
her and asks how he is going to help her in

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.590
this war against the White Spikes murray then
reveals her plan on how to save the entire

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:12.280
human race Murie tells Dan that there is no
way they can kill all the White Spikes in

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:16.980
the current time they're in so when the toxin
is ready miri wants Dan to take it with him

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:22.520
in the past after which Dan is to mass produce
the toxin and use it to kill all the White

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.990
Spikes when they attack earth just then the
computer reads that the formula of the toxin

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:31.310
to kill the female White Spikes has been found
they finally have the weapon to kill all the

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:36.350
White Spikes but they don't get to enjoy the
moment for too long the female White Spike

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:41.080
is awake and the males have also reached the
facility to save the female Dan and murray

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.390
leave the research lab and head towards the
helipad thousands of White Spikes are attacking

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.770
the last remaining numbers of humans the male
White Spikes finally help the female out of

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:54.910
the chains and she is angry fear is only six
minutes left until Dan will jump back in time

00:11:54.910 --> 00:12:00.210
nuri has to protect him until then murray
and Dan try to reach the top but the White

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:04.670
Spikes are also in search of them while almost
reaching the helipad murray is attacked by

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:09.760
a White Spike and is thrown down Dan goes
down to help her he supports her and tries

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.750
to get her away from there the whole facility
is overwhelmed by the number of White Spikes

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:19.050
it really seems that it is the end of the
world Dan tells murray that they have to keep

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:23.910
moving but miri is in no shape to move at
all he finally realizes that she was heavily

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:29.100
injured by the attack of the White Spike they
both realize that she is going to die Dan

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.560
doesn't want to leave her but miri hands him
the toxin and tells him that he has to leave

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:38.560
her in order to save the world just then the
female White Spike appears in front of them

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.500
and the structure that they're on also breaks
down murray folds down with it but Dan manages

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:48.190
to hold her hand he tries to hold her with
all his power but murray's hands slip and

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:53.140
she starts falling down Dan throws himself
off as well to save Murie but the time device

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:58.339
on his arm takes him back to his time and
with other survivors reach the current timeline

00:12:58.339 --> 00:13:03.440
Dan screams in pain and medical staffs rush
in to help everyone injured Dan finally wakes

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:08.360
up explains that they have to mass produce
this toxin and go to the future to save murray

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.960
and others Lieutenant hart tells Dan that
the time jump link has been broken and now

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.190
there's no way they can go to the future Dan
gets discharged and meets his wife who is

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:22.270
waiting for him Dan gets welcomed by murray
at home he gets emotional after seeing his

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:27.370
daughter alive and hugs her tight that night
Dan and his wife talk about when the White

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:31.930
Spikes could attack earth there's no record
on when the White Spikes attack earth so they

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:36.110
don't know when they should be ready for it
his wife then suggests the idea that what

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:40.220
if they're already here on earth and they
only attack the humans in the future the idea

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:46.010
seems interesting to Dan so he goes to Dorian
and manages to get his help Dan with the help

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:50.660
of Charlie finds out that the White Spikes
had a volcanic ash in their claws but Dan

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.850
is confused how the chinese volcanic ash is
found in the White Spike's claws who first

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:59.130
attacked on russia Dan now tries to get the
help of this school student who seems to be

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:04.430
an expert in ancient volcanoes this part is
really silly I mean why does he have to go

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:08.240
to a school student to get information on
volcanoes when he could have just gone to

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.910
someone with more knowledge and expertise
this part of the movie was really unnecessary

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:17.790
and silly to me however the clever student
tells Dan that the ancient chinese volcanic

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.860
eruption had spread its ash up to the russian
glaciers which could be where they might find

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:27.180
the White Spikes in hiding Dan now knows where
to find the White Spikes so he goes to the

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:32.720
person in charge of all this and asks for
help which gets declined Dan now has no option

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:38.020
but to go to his dad his father is a pilot
and has a plane to help them in this mission

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:42.060
Lieutenant hart and few others join Dan on
the mission they all head out to the glacier

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:47.000
island to find and kill the White Spikes after
reaching the glacier island the team blasts

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.510
a magnetic area and find a cave that leads
them to the White Spikes aircraft they enter

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:56.510
the aircraft and find the White Spikes in
hibernation anne and his team inject the White

00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.850
Spikes with the toxins which seems to work
as the White Spikes get killed however the

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.580
ones behind them start waking up Dan hurries
to inject one of them but is thrown away by

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:10.430
its powers all the White Spikes are now out
of their hibernation Dorian says that they

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:15.200
have no time and they need to blow the entire
aircraft he then hands Dan the White Spike's

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:20.120
teeth which again seems pointless but it will
serve a purpose later on Lieutenant Hart finds

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:24.700
more White Spikes in the ship and she tries
to hold them off Dorian then presses the bomb

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:30.520
which blasts the entire ship Dan barely manages
to survive the blast Dan's father tells him

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:34.941
that the female was the only one which had
managed to escape Dan realizes that if they

00:15:34.941 --> 00:15:39.240
don't kill the female there will be no point
of this mission Dan and his father head off

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.900
in search of the female White Spike they finally
see the female who charges forward to attack

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:48.670
Dan's father Dan tells him to move away but
the White Spike gets a hold of him and attacks

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:53.390
him however it turns out that it was just
a decoy and Dan's father was in hiding who

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:58.060
shoots the White Spike on its head which surely
doesn't kill it the father and son duo both

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:03.090
shoot at the White Spike in order to kill
it after an intense fight Dan manages to inject

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:08.570
the toxin on the White Spike's hand it finally
seems that the female White Spike will die

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:13.399
but to everyone's surprise it bites off his
hand and is healthy as ever again the female

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:18.230
walks towards Dan who is just right at the
edge of a cliff Dan's father cuts his hand

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:22.780
to attract a White Spike away from Dan he
apologizes to Dan for not being there for

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.550
him and is ready to sacrifice his life to
save Dan the White Spike charges to attack

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:32.120
him but just then Dan manages to climb onto
the White Spike and cuts its throat with the

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:37.200
same thing that Dorian gave him minutes earlier
Dan then manages to get the last vial of toxin

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.990
he has with him and throws it inside the White
Spike's mouth Dan then lands a final kick

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.440
to the White Spike which falls off the cliff
to its death and now the whole human race

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.440
is saved Dan returns back to his wife and
daughter and this time he has brought his

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:56.130
father with him Dan's father finally gets
to meet his granddaughter Dan and his wife

00:16:56.130 --> 00:17:01.770
share a kiss and the movie ends overall a
good movie a sick plot with a decent storytelling

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:06.259
and a superb visual effects I was really impressed
by the effects with which they brought the

00:17:06.259 --> 00:17:10.390
White Spikes to life in the movie however
I really could have gone without the school

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:14.013

think did you guys enjoy the movie comment
