00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.340
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.519
Today, I'm going to explain a mystery psychological
thriller film called "Before I go to sleep."

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:09.130
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.920
Watch out and take care!

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.480
The film opens with an extreme close-up on
the bloodshot eye of Christine Lucas , a forty-years-old

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.720
woman who wakes up in a bedroom she does not
recognize.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.050
She has no idea where she is and does not
recognize anything around her.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.529
She realizes with shock that there is a middle-aged
man sleeping in the bed next to her.

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.360
She goes to the bathroom and finds pictures
taped to the wall of herself as a much older woman.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.960
She also sees a picture of the man in the
bed next to her labeled....:“Ben, your husband”.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.860
None of it rings a bell.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.820
Confronting the man in the bedroom, he tells
her that he is her husband, Ben.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.830
They have been married for decades.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.051
He tells her she was involved in a terrible
car accident 10 years earlier...that left

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.600
her with brain damage.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.280
Every evening when she goes to sleep, she
forgets everything; waking up with a blank

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.740
slate the next morning, with no memory of
her life from her early twenties onwards.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.580
Ben has to go through the same routine every
morning.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.290
He shows Christine photographs, while telling
her the story of their romance and marriage.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.510
Ben then gets ready for work and leaves to
go teach at a nearby school.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.150
While Christine looks around the house, a
neurologist named Dr. Nasch calls the house.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.970
He informs her that she has been in treatment
with him for the past few years.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.500
He tells her to locate a video camera which
is hidden inside her closet.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.130
Dr. Nasch tells Christine not to inform Ben
of the camera.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.370
He tells her to watch the videos and to call
him back.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.450
Christine watches a video diary of herself,
which she is unfamiliar with.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.830
She has recorded a video diary over the last
two weeks, prompting an extended flashback

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.380
to illustrate what she’s learned so far.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.320
She then meets Dr. Nasch, who explains that
she has been seing him for some time without

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.030
her husband’s knowledge.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.070
He tries to help her deal with her condition.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.960
Dr. Nasch further reveals that her memory
loss occurred ten years ago... after she was

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.760
attacked and left for dead near an airport
hotel.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.310
However, she is very confused.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.549
Her husband, Ben, said that she had a car
accident.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.430
She wonders why Ben lied to her about the
cause of her amnesia.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.240
Dr. Nasch suggests...perhaps it’s just easier.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.440
Dr. Nasch then takes her back to where she
was found after the attack, hoping it would

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.020
trigger her memory.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.790
She was found by the airport.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.150
The man who found her explains...that it was
a long time ago.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.730
She was found with blood all over her body;
she was naked (apart from plastic sheet from

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.880
a nearby hotel).

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.910
She questions...why would she be staying in
a hotel, which Dr Nasch suggests she was having

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.050
an affair.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.090
The medical examination indicated she had
sexual intercourse just before the attack.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.550
Later that evening, she’s back home and
begins to record her new discovery.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.950
At night, when she sleeps, flash-cut memories
emerge; the moment she got attacked by someone

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.580
in a hotel.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.600
The next day, Dr. Nasch shows her some pictures;
some were taken from random, others from her file.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.739
One particular picture causes distinct neural
excitation.

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.030
The picture of a red-haired woman named Claire.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.540
At home, when she asks Ben about this.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.000
Ben tells her that Claire was her best friend
who couldn't handle Christine's condition

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.230
after the accident; she has moved abroad and
ended contact with Christine.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.890
Ben then shows her pictures with Claire, saying
he kept this hidden from her...to protect her

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.260
The next day, Christine gets flashes of memory
and recalls that she had a son.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.940
She angrily confronts Ben over hiding their
child.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.800
However, to her surprise, he says their son
named Adam, died of meningitis when he was

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.800
eight.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.160
He has been keeping all these secrets away
from her....to protect her from reliving the

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.520
pain of that experience
Afterward, while crying, she continues to

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.580
record this painful discoveries.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.910
While sleeping, Christine continues to struggle
with her memories of baby Adam, which culminate

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.160
in a wickedly weird dream; a dream where Adam
leaves her a drawing of a man with a scar

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.450
on his face.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.550
The picture is labeled “Mike.”

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.530
The next morning, she tells Dr. Nasch that
she thinks Mike was the name of the man she

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.580
had an affair with; he was her attacker.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.120
Nasch hugs her to comfort her…he almost
kisses her.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.540
However, his jacket opens to reveal his hospital
I.D. and his full name.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.850
“Mike Nasch.”

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.130
She sees a vision where Nasch attacks her
in a hotel.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.690
Christine immediately pulls back and runs
from him.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.930
But he catches her and administers a sedative,
leaving her at home.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.780
Later that day, her phone rings.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.600
It’s Dr Nasch.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.180
He tells her that he administered a mild sedative
to calm her down.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.300
He explains to her that she experienced what
they call “confabulation”; her imagination

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.280
filling in the gaps in her memory, turning
him into the man who did this to her.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.380
The next day, Christine again meets Dr. Nasch.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.060
He doesn't feel he can treat her anymore,
because he has feelings for her ;and it’s

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.970
completely unprofessional.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.010
Before they part, Dr. Nasch tells her a shocking
revelation.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.440
In 2007, Ben had placed her in an assisted
care facility and later in 2009, he divorced

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.760
her, leaving her in the care facility.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.510
Furthermore, her best friend, Claire, had
been trying to contact her at the care facility.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.380
Nasch then gives Claire's phone number to
her.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.690
After hearing that revelation, Christine angrily
confronts her husband, asking the reason he

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.710
divorced her 4 years ago.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.360
She demands to know the truth.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.500
There, he reveals...that when they lost their
son, he got depressed, so he divorced her,

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.040
leaving her in the care facility.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.710
However, he soon changed his mind and came
back to her.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.360
He promises that he will never leave her again.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.790
Knowing this truth, Christine understands
his situation ,and she hugs him.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.610
Later that day, Christine contacted her best
friend, Claire.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.450
As she hears Claire’s voice, she begins
to get glimpses of her past memories with

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.450
Claire.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.650
They agree to meet at a local park..

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.650
On their meeting, Claire reveals that Christine
had embarked on an affair prior to her attack

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.650
and they often met in a hotel.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.101
Claire then explains why their relationship
drifted apart.

00:05:43.101 --> 00:05:48.830
Christine's husband (Ben) and Claire had a one-time sexual encounter,
due to their shared grief at Christine's memory loss

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.900
Feeling obliged to keep Ben and Christine's
marriage intact, Claire ended contact with

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.960
her and stay away from their lives.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.199
After apologising, Claire gives Christine
a letter written to her by Ben.

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.289
Ben sent this to her shortly before they got
separated.

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.140
He asked Claire to give it to Christine should
she ever be well enough to read it.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.740
In the letter, Ben tells Christine that he
loves her, but he had to place her in the

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.130
care facility due to her condition.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.620
She looked happy there.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.380
He decided to leave her for their son Adam’s
sake.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.509
Adam was unable to understand her memory loss
and begun to be afraid of her.

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:26.360
Ben believed for Adam’s sake that they needed
to leave her and he begs her to understand.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.199
After reading this letter, Christine understands
how difficult it was for Ben to deal with

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:31.199
Christine's amnesia.

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:36.490
Out of gratitude for his love and care, Christine
records a video, saying that Ben is her lover

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.230
and protector and she wants to make a life
with him.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.090
At night, she decides to let Ben see the videos
she has made on the digital camera; she also

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.700
tells him that she has been seeing Dr Nasch
for quite some time.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.660
She admits she didn’t trust Ben before,
but she completely trusts him now.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.080
However, Ben angrily accuses Christine of
having an affair with Nasch; he strikes her

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.560
and storms out.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.009
On the telephone, Christine talks to Claire
about what just happened.

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:05.949
Claire is confused, because she knows Ben;
and he is a very good gentleman; he will never

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:07.550
strike her like that.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.830
So Claire decides to give Ben a call.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.050
A few moments later, Claire rings Christine
back.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.480
She tells Christine that Ben claims not to
have seen Christine for 4 years.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.160
Claire asks Christine to describe the "Ben"
she is living with; whether he has a scar

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.660
across the right side of his face.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.300
She checks Ben’s picture; no scar.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.259
That moment, they realize....the man she is
living with is not Ben.

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:32.380
The wedding photo is fake.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.580
Christine immediately attempts to escape the
house, but "Ben" renders her unconscious.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.860
The next morning, Christine again awakens
with no memories .She finds the camera

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.510
and sees her entry saying she loves "Ben"
and wants to make a life with him.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.979
"Ben" calls Christine and tells her to pack,
that they are going on a trip that night.

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:52.800
That night, "Ben" takes her to a hotel close
to where she had been found.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.919
In the hotel room, she gets glimpses of what
happened 10 years ago.

00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:00.690
He reveals that he is Mike, the man she had
an affair with.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:04.680
Christine then remembers that Mike had wanted
Christine to reveal their affair to Ben, but

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.789
Christine refused and their argument culminated
in Mike viciously attacking Christine, resulting

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:11.210
in her amnesia.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.349
He also inadvertently reveals that Christine's
son Adam is still alive.

00:08:15.349 --> 00:08:19.520
Declaring his love for Christine, Mike deletes
the videos on her camera and states that he

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.550
is no longer interested in playing the part
of Ben.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:26.360
He tells Christine that they shall live together,
or no one shall live.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.690
Another struggle ensues, but this time Christine
knocks Mike out and gets away.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:35.919
She sets off the hotel fire alarm while running
from the hotel and is seen telling her story

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:39.179
on the camera while waiting in an ambulance.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:42.989
Christine wakes up in a hospital bed and is
visited by Nasch, this time as a friend and

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:44.620
not as her therapist.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.750
He assures her the man responsible for her
condition (Mike) has been arrested.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.569
He tells Christine that she has visitors and
that he hopes the visit will provide the breakthrough

00:08:52.569 --> 00:08:54.209
they have been hoping for.

00:08:54.209 --> 00:08:56.579
The real Ben comes to visit Christine.

00:08:56.579 --> 00:09:01.649
And he’s brought someone else: Adam, who
never died of meningitis.

00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:05.029
As she sees Adam entering her room, her memories
return.

00:09:05.029 --> 00:09:09.230
With tears full of joy, the two of them hug
each other, and the movie ends.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.860
Now, for the explanation...

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:15.860
I will explain the sequence of events that
happened...prior to the events in the movie.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.300
In 1999, Christine and Ben got married.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.009
But not this Ben; the real Ben.

00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:29.699
In August 1999, their son, Adam, was born
After 4 years, in 2003, Chritine had an affair

00:09:29.699 --> 00:09:30.899
with Mike.

00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:35.230
Mike wanted Christine to reveal their affair
to Ben, but Christine refused and their argument

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:39.639
culminated in Mike viciously attacking Christine,
resulting in her amnesia.

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:43.290
Due to her condition, Ben placed her in an
adult community care centre.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.110
Ben, and her son, Adam, visited her daily.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:50.999
But they had to suffer....as they needed to
remind her of her identity daily.

00:09:50.999 --> 00:09:56.329
During this time, her best friend, Claire
helped the family, and got closer to Ben.

00:09:56.329 --> 00:10:00.999
One day, Ben and Claire had a one-time sexual
encounter, due to their shared grief at Christine's

00:10:00.999 --> 00:10:02.660
memory loss.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.069
Feeling guilty, Claire decided to stay away
from their lives.

00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:09.449
After a few years, Christine’s condition
hadn’t got any better.

00:10:09.449 --> 00:10:11.459
Ben couldn't go on any more.

00:10:11.459 --> 00:10:16.209
Their son, Adam, grew desperately unhappy.

00:10:16.209 --> 00:10:20.850
In 2009, Ben and Adam left Christine for Adam’s
sake; they left her in the care facility,

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.629
not visiting her anymore.

00:10:22.629 --> 00:10:26.189
Mike used this opportunity to disguise as
her husband.

00:10:26.189 --> 00:10:29.079
Mike forged Ben’s signature and took her
home with him.

00:10:29.079 --> 00:10:32.689
For 4 years, she was tricked into thinking
that he was her husband.

00:10:32.689 --> 00:10:37.389
Until one day, she met Dr. Nasch, who gave
her a camera to record her thoughts and progress

00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:38.660
each day.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.639
What happens next are the events that you
saw in the film.

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:44.170
And that’s my explanation for the movie.
