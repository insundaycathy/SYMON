00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.240
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.780
Now I’ve got a question for all of  ya:

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.780
How would you get away with stealing a million dollars?

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.820
Well, buckle up because you’re gonna figure out how to do so

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.600
real soon.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.210
This is Logan Lucky.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.340
So the first thing we see is a man working
on his truck with a little girl helping him

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.509
out. This is Jimmy Logan, an unlucky man living in West Virginia and that is his precious

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.391
little girl, Sadie who's very excited to be part
of the beauty pageant that’s gonna happen

00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:33.250
real soon although she doesn't know what song she wants to sing. Now Jimmy was a construction

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.720
worker who’d been working on some tunnels beneath the Charlotte Motors Speedway. But

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.200
one day he’s fired because his paperwork
never mentioned that he had a limp

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.000
So, frustrated, he drives away, listening to John Denver’s classic

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
“Country Road (Take Me Home)”, his favorite song

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Which is gonna come up later in the film

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.010
He stops at Hairwer, a beauty salon where

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.440
his sister, Mellie works to pick up Sadie
from her rehearsal practice. Which is a shame

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.830
since the practice rehearsal was yesterday
and Mellie had to pick Sadie up. And Mellie

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.880
prattles on and on about what she had to do to pick up Sadie and ends it

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.840
by telling Jimmy, plain and simple that
“Bobbie Jo” is very angry with him.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.000
And then we Jimmy go to this really fancy pants house

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.520
and he’s here to talk to with his ex-wife, who IS Bobbie Jo. And BOY

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.380
is she ANGRY with Jimmy: she cannot believe he didn’t pick up Sadie from practice, and

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.500
just from the way they talk, this isn’t
the first time Jimmy Logan screwed up.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.600
And as they're talkin' and talkin', Sadie comes running up to greet her daddy,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.700
followed by Bobbie Jo’s current husband, Moody

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.380
Sadie tells Jimmy that she finally knows what she wants to sing

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.200
for the pageant: Umbrella, y'know, that "Rihanna" song?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.229
And after some bickering, Jimmy leaves, but not before Bobbie tells him that she will

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.520
be moving soon with Moody and Sadie’s coming with them. Jimmy doesn’t like it, and tells

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.460
Bobbie that he’s going to get a lawyer to
argue against it but with no job,

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.060
how’s he going to pay for the lawyer?

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.700
That night he stops by the Duck Tape bar where

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.210
his brother, Clyde works. Now Clyde’s interesting because he believes in the Logan Family curse:

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.189
misfortune and bad luck has followed the Logan family forever. Except for Mellie, their sister

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.689
and after listening to Clyde goin' on and on about the curse, Jimmy goes to the bathroom

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.060
moments before Max Chilblain comes in:

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.340
Now he's a British jackhole of a businessman who owns an energy drink brand

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.520
as well as a NASCAR team. And the first thing he does is make fun of Clyde

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.720
for his one arm,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.180
"The Kindness of a one-armed bartender!"

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.560
and then orders a Martini.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.560
I think what's scary is that there are actually guys like that around

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.700
The martini's great but it could use some ice.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.660
Although that's gonna be a problem since Clyde doesn't have any ice

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.700
since the local water plant got contaminated

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.960
and keep this mind 'cause this plot point pays off later.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.230
Then Jimmy comes back to the bar and has a back and forth between him

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.110
and Max, who continues to disrespect Clyde. And during this back-and-forth we find out that Clyde did a

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.000
few tours in Iraq which is how he lost his
arm,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.970
and after one final dig at the Logan Brothers

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.760
Max gets what’s coming to him. As Jimmy starts a bar brawl inside,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.020
Clyde, goes outside

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.160
and with the help of a smoker named Earl makes a Molotov cocktail and uses it to set Max’s car on

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.489
fire. Setting the car alarm off and bringing
Max and his goons running outside to see their car

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.240
burning, and as Jimmy leaves, bruised and bloodied.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.160
He says one word to Clyde: Cauliflower. 
And that gets Clyde a little steamed up

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.239
The next day, Clyde wakes up to find Jimmy

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.920
making bacon and there's a list of rules for robbing a bank on the wall. As they talk during breakfast, we

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.250
find out a few things: Firstly, Cauliflower
is a code word that Jimmy uses when he has

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.580
an illegal scheme that he wants Clyde to help him with. Secondly

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.390
Clyde went to juvenile hall when he was 13 because he helped

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.780
Jimmy with one of his cauliflower schemes. Which explains why he got so angry at the bar.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.660
But regardless of all that, Clyde is willing to listen to

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.880
Jimmy’s new Cauliflower scheme and that involves

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.660
"Charlotte Motor Speedway"

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.840
robbing the Charlotte Motor Speedway. Now the Charlotte Motor Speedway

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.989
is a busy place, that’s basically become
its own popular, little town meaning they

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.301
have their own security force with a lot of
rich people there who watch the race, but

00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:07.760
the thing about the Speedway is that it’s
built over landfills that have since become sinkholes,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.700
and it’s pipes have burst so now it’s
under renovations. Being fixed up by construction

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.289
crews like the one Jimmy was a part of. And because of his experiences fixing up the pipes he

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.639
knows that the Speedway uses pneumatic tubes to transfer money and they have these spread

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.819
throughout the entire stadium going to the
vault where all the money is kept. Jimmy plans

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:32.770
on robbing the vault on June 4, during the
Grocery Tax Lotto Show, when not a lot of

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.420
security will be there. But to get into the vault they’ll need Joe Bang's help

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.289
He’s a convict who knows his way around bombs and has experience breaking

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.689
into bank vaults. So, Jimmy and Clyde visit
him in prison and tell Joe that they want

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:49.330
his help but he refuses. He’s got money
from previous bank heists hidden in a secret

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.840
stash, why should he help them out?

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.300
Well, your wife found out about the money stash

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.900
and she ran off to Florida to marry a truck driver, and she took all the money with her.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.860
So now Joe is willing to help but he’s got 5 more

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.919
months until he’s out. And that won’t be a

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.289
problem, since Jimmy and Clyde have a
plan to not only break Joe out before he’s

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.520
released, but get him to blow up the vault
and put him back into prison before anyone

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.889
notices he's gone. Joe’s in, but only if he gets his brothers to help them out and

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:21.300
only if his brothers get a bigger cut. Something the Logans don’t like one bit.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.729
Sometime later, at a local fair, we see Mellie unpacking her car with Sadie’s help as Moody,

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.860
Bobbie’s husband, comes driving by in a
fancy car. And he starts ragging on Mellie

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.719
for her old car and how bad it is compared
to his own and Mellie makes fun of him for

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:37.200
not being able to drive stick, making him
feel a little self conscious.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.660
Now Jimmy is also here

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.020
to meet with Joe’s brothers: Sam and Fish Bang, to get their help for the heist

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.420
and after little finagling, they’re in.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.399
Later, Clyde runs his car into a convenience

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:51.530
store to get sent to the same jail that Joe
is in. As Mellie meanwhile takes note of a

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.559
prison transport van, writing down it’s
measurements as it stops at a gas station

00:05:55.559 --> 00:06:01.119
as its driver goes into the store. Clyde is
able to then take this note to Joe in prison

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:05.929
where they begin making something out wood and we see a conspicuous can of gray primer

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:06.929
sitting nearby.

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:11.540
Back home, Mellie paints cockroaches with nail polish, and the plan to break Joe Bang out of prison

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.200
is starting to take shape as the Fish brothers buy a few essentials like garbage bags, a prybar, and a shovel.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.789
Jimmy steals a firefighters outfit and a map from his old workplace and it’s there as he’s

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:25.360
leaving that he learns that the construction
at the speedway is finishing up real soon.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.080
So the breakout plan is going to have to happen a week earlier,

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.760
A WEEK. EARLIER.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.400
So Jimmy tells both Clyde and Mellie that they are going to need to hurry it up

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.440
And Mellie? Don't forget to call the baker,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.900
We then find out that someone has sent a cake to Gleema Purdue

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.680
a woman who works at the Charlotte Motor Speedway specifically with the Vault.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.569
And as Gleema is sharing her cake with her
co-workers, she’s called outside to find

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.680
that her car has been hit and she has to fill
out some paperwork. Eugh.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.300
But when she finally gets back inside,

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.840
the vault door is sealed shut. Since the office is closing early, there’s

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:58.339
no way back inside which means she’s going to have to wait until tomorrow

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:00.440
to finish her cake. Aww man...

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.930
That night, Fish and Sam sneak onto the construction

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.509
site at the speedway where they start tampering with the pneumatic tubes, pouring painted

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:11.140
cockroaches into different tubes.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.699
The next day, Joe asks a fellow prisoner, Naaman for help.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.900
And we'll see how this pays off, later.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.880
And while that’s happening, Gleema comes back to work, opening the vault

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.320
where she finds cockroaches crawling
all over the vault

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.320
and on her cake, she then calls a team of exterminators

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.160
and among them are Sam and Fish who after checking

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:33.409
the vault, call Jimmy to tell him that they
have a Code Pink. The heist is on.

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:34.478
So what is a Code Pink?

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.120
Well, if you remember from earlier, Mellie paints a bunch of different cockroaches, different colours

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.879
and these cockroaches are taken by Sam and Fish to the speedway, and then dumped into

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:45.339
the pneumatic tube system. Since it's only the pink cockroaches that got into the vault

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.160
They now which tube actually goes into the vault. And they're gonna use this information

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.920
In a very specific way. But first in order to get into the vault, they gotta get Joe Bang out of prison

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.780
It’s the day of the Race!

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.380
My heart's pounding! Boogidy, Boogidy, Boogidy!

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.250
Clyde’s working in the infirmary and Joe goes to the workshop

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:05.979
to drink some tap water before lunch, as for the Charlotte Speedway is filled with racers,

00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:08.200
spectators, and camera crews.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.000
As Bobbie and Moody are getting ready to take the kids to Sadie’s pageant,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.580
Moody shows off his new car (with stick shift) to an unimpressed

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:19.739
Mellie who begins packing things in her car’s trunk and we see that she has some firefighter’s

00:08:19.739 --> 00:08:23.979
outfits inside. Back with Joe, the warden
of the prison is making his rounds in cafeteria:

00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:26.820
he’s one of those guys that cares about
how his prison looks good

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.620
more than he cares about his prisoners

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.160
So when, Joe begins puking, he’s dragged to the infirmary.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.900
After all it wouldn’t look good if the prison had a ‘food problem’

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:37.560
As Mellie puts some finishing touches

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.769
on Sadie’s outfit and makeup, she begins
to make her way out of the building. She’s

00:08:40.769 --> 00:08:44.219
got an important job to do so she she steals Moody’s car to do it

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:47.390
So Joe goes to the bathroom after getting
permission from the nurse and with Clyde’s

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:52.220
help, they begin their escape. As that’s happening, a prison transport van stops by the workshop

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.790
just as Joe and Clyde make their way out of the infirmary. They attach their wooden box

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.860
things painted gray to the bottom of the car
just in time as the van drives away and the

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.040
race is 2 minutes from starting. And that's when prisoners know that its time...

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.000
For a riot! In response, the warden causes the prison to enter a lockdown

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.220
and stops a prison guard from reporting the riot to keep the prison's perfect record.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.440
Just as Fish and Sam blow up a generator, at least partially knocking

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.620
out power for the speedway, because now the electronic card readers at the speedway don’t work

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.450
"We got no plastic workin' at all."

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.760
Now everyone has to pay in cash.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.620
Just in time as Joe and Clyde roll
out from under the prison van and run into

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.290
a familiar car and drive away with Mellie’s
help.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.920
So it’s all coming together: The crowbar,
that was bought earlier in the film was smuggled

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.720
into the prison and used by Joe and Clyde
to get out of the infirmary. And the reason

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.470
why Mellie was watching that prison van 
weeks before was to figure out its size, it’s

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.800
dimensions, it's size and its schedule. That
way Joe and Clyde can make those wooden box

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.580
things, paint them gray, and fit them underneath the van

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.920
to create fake bottoms that they then use to

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.480
escape from the prison. And then meet up with Mellie who then takes them to the Speedway.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.850
Now the reason why Joe was talking with Namaan: was to get Namaan’s help in starting the

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.890
riot. That way they would enter lockdown mode for the prison and give Joe and Clyde enough time to

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.080
escape and make it to the speedway.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.720
And if you’re wondering why Joe was drinking tap water, well remember

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.970
how I said that the local water plant
got contaminated? Joe is drinking contaminated

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.389
tap water, and he drinks so much of it that
he gets sick and ended up puking and then he

00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:17.240
got sent to the infirmary. Where he Clyde
make their escape. You see how everything

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.160
is coming together? Now that he’s escaped,
now begins the actual heist. Are you ready

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.780
for it? Let’s go!

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.480
Jimmy breaks into the service entrance of

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.339
the Speedway, as the race is underway and
we find out that there’s a racer named Dayton

00:10:28.339 --> 00:10:33.459
White and he’s sponsored by Max Chilblain.
Now Dayton is very meticulous with his diet, keeping

00:10:33.459 --> 00:10:37.399
himself healthy to an insanely exact degree. But since he’s sponsored by Max, he has

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.340
to drink Max’s stupid energy drink on camera and let’s just say he ain’t happy about it one bit

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.680
Now since the race is really starting to get goin, the shopkeepers at the Charlotte

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.139
Speedway are forced to start putting away
their earnings into the tube system

00:10:49.139 --> 00:10:52.700
early, not even bothering to count the amount of money being sent to the vault

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.280
And keep this in mind, because this becomes very important later in the film

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.040
Finally, Joe, Clyde and Mellie arrive at the speedway

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.580
Where Joe buys some things for the heist.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.920
"Gimme two packs of those gummy bears."

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.000
And now the heist begins.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.640
First step: Get beneath track.
Second step: make the bomb.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.820
Sorry. Improvised Explosive Device.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.480
Step 3: Send the bomb through the tubes. Step 4: Boom

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.519
Smoke starts coming out of the tubes which gets the attention of local security

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.700
who send a few guys down to investigate

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.320
For the Logans and Bang Brothers,

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.760
The heist is going good so far,

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.240
as they hooked up a vacuum that sucks the money from the vault straight into the garbage bags

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.490
into their garbage bags. And then they get a little greedy and try to increase the sucking speed

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.399
which leads to Clyde’s arm getting sucked
into the vacuum and Clyde stops the vacuum

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:42.199
machine and gets into fight over whether
or not Clyde should get his arm. But after

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.020
some convincing, he turns the machine on.
They got a job to do.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.620
Meanwhile on the race track, Dayton starts
blacking out at the wheel and crashes his car

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:56.940
As for Fish and Sam, they put the moneybags onto a warehouse shuttle cart and drive off only to bump into two security

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.930
guards who ask them if they smelled any smoke. And although they act awfully suspicious

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:05.400
the guards let them go, but not without investigating further. There's something strange about those two.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.480
And as they investigate, they find a room with smoke leaking out of it and

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.740
and there inside they find: Earl,

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:15.540
a friend of Clyde and Jimmy smoking a ciggy, that you might recognize from these 2 scenes.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.770
who distracts the guards long enough for Joe to help out his brothers who can’t seem to get one of

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:23.000
the dang gates open. Realizing Joe’s been gone for too long, he goes to check on Joe and

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
runs into the guards who ask him if smelled any smoke. “Nope”. “OK, move along.”

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.420
and goes to help the Bang brothers out with the gate. Successfully opening it.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:30.640
The brothers get away as Jimmy and Joe go back, with Joe and Clyde making their escape.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.820
Meanwhile Dayton storms off in a huff: he
screwed up the race because he drank some

00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:40.050
of Max’s stupid energy drink and he blames Max for costing him the race. As Max follows Dayton

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:46.860
he runs into Joe and Clyde. And he recognizes Clyde. Uh oh. And to make matters worse!

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.750
Jimmy and Mellie are going to be late for
Sadie’s performance!

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.209
So Joe and Clyde get out of dodge heading
back to the prison and Jimmy leaves as well,

00:12:53.209 --> 00:12:57.180
checking his pickup truck to find the bags
of cash stored away in the back. By now, the

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.600
race is almost finished, and the prisoner’s
continue with the next step of the plan:

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.439
Cause a fire. Sort of. You see earlier in
the film, something I didn’t show you was

00:13:05.439 --> 00:13:09.339
that the prisoners covered up the windows
and the cameras using a variety of things

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:13.500
so the Warden and the guards can’t look
into the cafeteria, so they have no other choice

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.820
but to call the local firefighters just in time for

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.820
Clyde and Joe, to sneak on a firetruck and get back into the prison, disguised as firefighters

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.960
With the guards never noticing.
Mellie finds her way back to the pageant just

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.390
in time to put the final finishing touches
to Sadie’s outfit but there’s one little

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.700
hiccup: her daddy said he’d be here!

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.290
But with no dad in sight she goes on stage and

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.269
stares into the crowd, ready to sing
Umbrella but then she sees her daddy’s there.

00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:41.920
And she decides to sing a song that’s special to her daddy. Her daddy’s favorite song,

00:13:42.339 --> 00:13:46.410
Country Roads (Take Me Home). And Sadie finishes her performance to great fanfare and Jimmy

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:50.060
now finished with the heist leaves his truck
with the money at a gas station.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.220
The next morning, news reports come rolling in:

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.399
"Authorities, have confirmed, they have recovered money stolen from the Charlotte Motor Speedway"

00:13:55.399 --> 00:13:59.879
It was found in a pickup truck at a gas station last night

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:03.069
after an someone called it in.
We then see a woman walking through the crime

00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:07.209
scenes. This is Agent Grayson and she’s
investigating the Speedway Heist: checking

00:14:07.209 --> 00:14:10.999
the vault and the tunnel where the vacuum
machine was. And there’s not much there but

00:14:10.999 --> 00:14:13.120
she has a witness: Max Chilblain,

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.459
who claims that he saw Clyde and Joe at the Speedway and recognizes

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.960
Clyde as the one-armed bartender.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.180
"You don't believe me do you? Dayton saw them too! Dayton can back me up!"

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.660
And then we find out from Agent Grayson, that Dayton told her

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.959
that he didn’t see any one armed bartender named Clyde. He LIED.

00:14:28.959 --> 00:14:33.019
Speaking of Clyde, he’s armless and out of prison and when he gets home, glum as can be

00:14:33.019 --> 00:14:37.130
He finds a special surprise waiting for him in a box from the Department of Veteran Affairs

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:41.110
The next day, Agent Grayson, comes to the prison demanding information from the

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.839
warden who doesn’t say anything that helps with the investigation. In fact, he intentionally

00:14:44.839 --> 00:14:49.660
avoids any conversation about the riot. About Joe Bang, and about Clyde Logan.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.940
So Agent Grayson has no leads: her suspects

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.490
have airtight alibis so she can't investigate them. Because officially

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.639
Clyde and Joe were ‘still at the prison’ at the time of the riot as for Jimmy he doesn’t

00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:03.370
have a phone or a car with GPS so they can’t track his location. She’s got nothing.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.649
Fast-forward months later, and Joe is free and the first thing he does is visit Clyde’s

00:15:06.649 --> 00:15:10.920
bar to talk with Clyde who has new robotic arm. And we find out that since the heist,

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.879
Jimmy has been silent: neither Joe nor Clyde have heard anything from Jimmy. He might be

00:15:14.879 --> 00:15:19.589
in Pittsburgh since Sadie and Bobbie Jo moved there with Moody there a while ago. But even that’s

00:15:19.589 --> 00:15:23.959
debatable and so Joe leaves frustrated: Neither of them know what happened with Jimmy or why

00:15:23.959 --> 00:15:26.400
the money was returned. Or who returned the money.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.499
As for Agent Grayson? Well the company that

00:15:28.499 --> 00:15:32.999
owns the Speedway is shutting Speedway Heist case: since a large amount of money was returned

00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:37.540
and now they got a sizable insurance check, recouping their losses from the heist. But

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.999
here’s the thing: Agent Grayson and her
team have investigated and they couldn’t

00:15:40.999 --> 00:15:45.249
find an exact amount of money that was made on the day of heist. Because if you remember,

00:15:45.249 --> 00:15:49.089
none of the card readers worked and the money was never counted on the day of the heist.

00:15:49.089 --> 00:15:51.709
So it’s very strange that the Speedway company was able to make an insurance claim

00:15:51.709 --> 00:15:56.430
without ever knowing the exact amount of money that was lost. So for all they know: Only some of the money

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.709
money was ever returned. Now we then see Joe back home when he hears

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:00.900
a knock at his door.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.800
He checks outside where he at first sees no one, he even checks around

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:11.499
the corner brandishing a shovel in case anyone’s nearby. There’s no one there but wait a second:

00:16:11.499 --> 00:16:16.940
Why would this brand new shovel be here? And then he stomps his way to a nearby tree and digs into

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:23.430
his backyard to find a trash bag full of money marked with a red tie. Someone returned money

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:27.610
to his secret stash. We then see how the whole heist played out:

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:32.240
Jimmy hid a lot of details from the Bang Brothers. For one: he messed with the gate, stalling

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.640
the Bang brothers long enough for him to hide specific bags of cash, during the heist

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.580
these bags were then put into a dumpster, and then taken to a truck, driven by Earl.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.380
And then taken to a landfill. Where they were dug up later

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.180
As to how Jimmy was able to figure out where they were and which ones were the right ones?

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:52.540
Well, Earl marked them down on a map, and the garbage bags were marked with red ties.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.899
And also during the heist, Jimmy grabbed Clyde's arm and made sure

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.180
to hide any evidence that they were down there.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.600
As for Jimmy? Well, he’s living in Pittsburgh,

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.459
back on good terms with Bobbie Jo and able to visit Sadie whenever he wants. And after

00:17:04.459 --> 00:17:08.699
some time he goes back to visit Clyde where we reunite with our heisters: Clyde’s still

00:17:08.699 --> 00:17:12.779
bartending, and Joe and Mellie seem to have a thing going on. And while he's there

00:17:12.779 --> 00:17:16.990
Clyde asks Jimmy how he knew when to search for the money and the answer is pretty simple: because

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.649
the police were investigating Jimmy, they
tapped his phone however Jimmy

00:17:20.649 --> 00:17:26.680
didn't pay his phone bill but somehow the phone service wasn't cut off. So he knew they were tracking him

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.460
So all he had to do was wait until he lost reception and service, and he knew by then

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.500
the police had stopped tracking him. And that’s

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:37.929
how Jimmy got away with stealing millions
of dollars. I guess the Logan family curse

00:17:37.929 --> 00:17:41.880
was just a myth after all.
As Clyde continues to bartend, he’s called

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:48.028
over by a lonely woman who wants someone to drink with her. After all, it's bad luck to drink alone.

00:17:48.028 --> 00:17:49.750
But here’s the kicker that’s

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:54.180
Agent Grayson, whose thinking of staying in Virginia a little while longer: waiting for

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.320
her chance to arrest the Speedway Heisters. Looks like the Logan Family curse strikes again

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.780
So you’re probably wondering about a few
things like why did Jimmy return the money?

00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:12.530
And very simply it was to get the investigators off his trail. Because if you remember from  earlier,

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:17.140
they blow up a generator. That causes the
card readers at the speedway to fail meaning

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:21.340
that the shopkeepers now have to take cash only. And they put this cash into the pneumatic

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.669
tube system, with out counting it. And this
is crucial, because of this no one actually

00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:29.470
knows the exact amount of money made on the day of the heist and no one knows the actual

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:32.960
amount of money that was stolen.
By returning a 'lot of money', it looks all of it

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.240
if not a majority of it was returned, even though we know better.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.570
And it’s heavily implied that the amount
of the money the company made from the insurance

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:44.630
claim, was significantly larger than the actual amount of money stolen from them in the first place.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:47.890
Which is great for the company, except they made it through less than legal means and

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:52.342
they don’t want the FBI finding this out.
So they shutdown the investigation, and they close

00:18:52.342 --> 00:18:57.390
the case and consequently leave Jimmy alone. Now as to why Jimmy never told the Bang Brothers

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.860
about his plan? it's very simple: He didn’t want to split the money.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.600
You see originally there were only supposed to be 3 heisters:

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.000
Jimmy, Joe, and Clyde. But to get Joe’s
help, they had to hire Sam and Fish and as

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.420
a stipulation, they had to give the Bang Brothers a majority of the money.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.010
Which was a bad deal for the Logans

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:15.720
So in order to keep a majority of the money,
they had to make it look like all of it was given back

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.679
and that none of it was kept by the Logans that way the Bang Brother would

00:19:18.679 --> 00:19:21.360
leave them alone. Since they had no reason to hassle them.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.572
Now the reason why Dayton lied to Agent Grayson about not seeing Joe and Clyde at the Speedway

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:31.420
was that he wanted revenge.You see for Dayton: Winning is everything! and he blames Max for his losing the race

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.680
Because Dayton believes, that if he had never drank any of Max's

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.740
stupid energy drink before the race: He would've won.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:41.000
So as a form of revenge: he intentionally lies to Agent Grayson,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.120
telling her that he didn't see Joe or Clyde at the Speedway

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.560
making Max look like a liar in a federal investigation

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.380
Which finally brings me to  the Logan Family curse: Which I believe is

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.870
real and it’s that last shot with Agent
Grayson that convinced me. You see the Logans

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:57.600
have a lot of lucky breaks during the course
of the investigation: Max (Agent Grayson’s

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.300
only witness) is made a liar by Dayton’s
testimony,

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.590
and any questions that Agent Grayson has about

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:08.040
Joe and Clyde are left unanswered by the prison warden, and finally the company that got robbed

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.560
actually shuts down the investigation. All of these things allow the Logans to escape

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.660
but ironically they are also what bring Agent Grayson to West Virginia.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.960
It’s almost like all the luck, they had earlier got turned around

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.380
And it looks like the Logan family curse will strike again.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.289
