00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.520
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain an action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.160
sci-fi, thriller film called “Surrogates.”&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.440
In the near future, humans have created robots&nbsp;
that have replaced people for everyday life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.680
The surrogates, as they call them, are controlled&nbsp;
via stim chairs through neuropathic signals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.360
Humans remain in the safety of their homes as&nbsp;
their surrogates live their lives for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.040
Crime rates plummet, and societal living&nbsp;
improves as racism and hate dwindle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.720
Around 98% of the population uses&nbsp;
surrogates, and it has become the new norm.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.600
Recently, groups of people, called Dreads,&nbsp;
have started a movement against surrogates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.800
They brand the surrogates as lies and&nbsp;
deception. The Dreads have gathered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.080
in small isolation zones in cities&nbsp;
worldwide and are led by Zaire Powell.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.960
On a typical night, a rich young&nbsp;
man is chauffeured across town.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.960
He tells his driver that their prior&nbsp;
destination, the theatre, might be a little dull.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.400
The driver suggests a club instead,&nbsp;
and the man agrees. At the club,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.040
the man dances with strangers, and a woman catches&nbsp;
his eye. They sneak to the back alley to kiss,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.640
and a figure appears. The man tells the&nbsp;
figure to leave, calling the figure a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.480
meat bag. The two are suddenly bathed in&nbsp;
electricity, and the figure rides away.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.120
Agent Peters and Agents Greer from the F.B.I.&nbsp;
arrive at the scene and finds the man and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.280
woman surrogate. A police officer tells them the&nbsp;
male surrogate is unregistered while the female&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.280
is assigned to someone, but the owner hasn’t&nbsp;
filed any reports. They see the surrogates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.720
have their eyes burnt out, and Greer sees the&nbsp;
memory chip on the male surrogate is fried.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.320
Greer and Peters then head to the female&nbsp;
surrogate’s operator’s apartment and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.840
find him dead with his nose bloody. Greer&nbsp;
looks at the last thing the surrogate saw,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.880
and he sees the male surrogate’s eyes&nbsp;
burn and shatter before the feed cuts off.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.960
Greer then heads home and takes a glass of&nbsp;
water to himself, revealing that Greer is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.280
also a surrogate. The surrogate then steps&nbsp;
into a closet and parks itself. Greer then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.120
gets up from his stim chair and glances at his&nbsp;
surrogate. He steps out of his room and into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.960
kid’s room. He sees a photo of him and his&nbsp;
wife with a child before closing the door.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.840
He sees his wife’s surrogate, and Greer&nbsp;
suggests a vacation. His wife, Maggie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.480
suggests they could take their surrogates to&nbsp;
Hawaii, but Greer wishes to leave the surrogates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.920
at home and for them to go out physically. He&nbsp;
says they haven’t been together in a while,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.240
and Maggie appears to get upset. She says they’re&nbsp;
together every day, but Greer says it’s their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.760
surrogates that spend the time together.&nbsp;
Maggie insists that it’s better that way.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.440
In a college dormitory in San Diego, teens&nbsp;
find their friend, Jarid, on his stim chair,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.480
lifeless and covered in blood.&nbsp;
The police chief, Andrew,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.120
then briefs the station about the discovery.&nbsp;
They found that the two operators,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.600
Jarid and the female surrogate operator, had their&nbsp;
brains liquified. It appears that whatever had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.280
happened to their surrogates killed them. Greer&nbsp;
and Peters go through footage from the surrogates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.680
and see a man carrying a weapon. Greer tells&nbsp;
Andrew that the case might be a homicide. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.280
then get a phone call telling them that Jarid&nbsp;
is the son of surrogate pioneer Lionel Canter.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.440
A news report reveals that Lionel is considered by&nbsp;
many to be the father of surrogacy. He had built&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.240
his company, Virtual Self Industries or V.S.I.,&nbsp;
into one of the biggest corporations in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.960
Unfortunately, he had been ousted by his partners&nbsp;
several years ago. Humiliated and disowned by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.120
company he had built, Lionel had become a recluse,&nbsp;
avoiding the public eye for almost a decade.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.920
Greer and Peters then visit Lionel. They’re&nbsp;
led in, and one of Lionel’s surrogates meets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.560
them. Lionel then tells the detectives that Jarid&nbsp;
had been estranged from him since the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.240
When Jarid went to college, Lionel&nbsp;
offered him to use any of his surrogates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.680
This was a means of bonding for the two.&nbsp;
Peters stresses the importance of not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.440
allowing other users to borrow surrogates&nbsp;
registered to other individuals. Greer then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.960
reiterates that they mean no offense and&nbsp;
they’re only trying to solve Jarid’s death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.400
Peters’ questioning angers Lionel, but&nbsp;
Greer tries to diffuse the situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.960
telling Lionel that he empathizes with him as he&nbsp;
too had lost a son. Lionel pauses and calms down.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.520
Greer asks if Lionel knows of anyone&nbsp;
who would want to harm himself or Jarid.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.920
Lionel realizes that the assassination’s target&nbsp;
was him and not Jarid. The assassin didn’t know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.480
that the person using Lionel’s surrogate was&nbsp;
Jarid. Upon realizing this, Lionel logs out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.880
surrogate. Lionel sits weeping in his stim chair,&nbsp;
knowing he inadvertently caused his son’s death.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.720
Greer and Peters then head to V.S.I.&nbsp;
and meet with representatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.760
Greer asks if they know of any cases&nbsp;
involving a surrogate’s head exploding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.040
and the surrogate operator dying. The&nbsp;
representatives become defensive and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.000
ensure Greer that there are fail-safes&nbsp;
in place to protect from such accidents.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.640
They then head to the engineering floor and meet&nbsp;
with one of the engineers. Greer shows him the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.920
fried identity chip from Jarid’s surrogate,&nbsp;
and the engineer says the only thing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.520
could make this happen is if the circuits&nbsp;
all fired at once. The engineer also tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.360
them that a truckload of surrogates came from the&nbsp;
military with optics and identity chips missing.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.480
Greer and Peters then head to a military&nbsp;
camp and watch surrogate soldiers on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.640
battlefield fighting a war. A surrogate gets&nbsp;
shot and destroyed, and the operator hops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.000
right back in with a different surrogate.&nbsp;
The military colonel assures them that any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.920
weapon used on a surrogate would not affect the&nbsp;
surrogate’s operator. He also mentions that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.280
military typically removes motherboards&nbsp;
and optics from surrogates for analysis.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.120
Back at the station, Peters identifies&nbsp;
the man holding the weapon from the video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.920
footage as non-surrogate user Miles. They&nbsp;
then head to the monitoring department,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.280
where a non-surrogate technician, Bobby, tells&nbsp;
them Miles has been found. Greer heads up to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.440
meet with the pursuit team, while Peters stays&nbsp;
behind with Bobby to monitor Miles’ whereabouts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.800
Bobby then tells Peters that finding Miles&nbsp;
was easy since they have access to all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.440
surrogates’ feeds in the city. An alarm goes&nbsp;
off, and Bobby sees a man harming a woman. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.360
calls it in and requests an immediate shutdown&nbsp;
of the assailant’s surrogate. Bobby receives the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.440
disconnection warrant and immediately shuts the&nbsp;
surrogates down. Peters is shocked as she didn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.600
know surrogates could be shut down remotely and&nbsp;
questions the procedure’s legality. Bobby says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.600
it’s a brand new software and shrugs Peters’&nbsp;
concern off as the police are the good guys.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.960
Peters, however, is more concerned about&nbsp;
the software getting into the wrong hands.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.840
Miles rides his motorcycle through the streets&nbsp;
with police cars tailing close by. He swerves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.640
through traffic, narrowly dodging oncoming&nbsp;
cars. Greer follows the pursuit on a helicopter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.040
Miles then crashes into an ally and gets cornered.&nbsp;
Police swarm him, and Miles takes out a weapon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.960
and the pursuing officers are blasted with a&nbsp;
wave of electricity. The police surrogates all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.360
convulse, and their eyes pop out. He then&nbsp;
aims the device at the helicopter. Greer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.600
falls flat and disconnects from the surrogate as&nbsp;
quickly as he can. The pilot is less fortunate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.520
and the helicopter starts spinning out of&nbsp;
control. Miles runs into a Dread settlement, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.680
the helicopter also starts drifting towards it.&nbsp;
Greer gets back into his surrogate only to crash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.640
into the Dread isolation zone. Greer emerges from&nbsp;
the wreckage and starts chasing Miles. The dread&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.160
inhabitants are angered seeing a surrogate has&nbsp;
entered the zone and start chasing after Greer.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.280
Greer and Miles run through the slums, making&nbsp;
their way through trailers. Miles tries initiating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.360
the weapon, but it is currently disabled. Greer&nbsp;
leaps over trailers and climbs them with ease&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.680
until he corners Miles. Greer demands Miles&nbsp;
to give the weapon to him, and Miles complies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.640
handing Greer a bag. Before Greer could open&nbsp;
the bag, he gets blown away by a shotgun blast.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.000
Miles takes the weapon back, and a woman&nbsp;
shoots Greer, calling him an abomination.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.760
Greer leaves his surrogate and stumbles out&nbsp;
of his stim chair. He crawls on the floor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.960
calling for Maggie. She quickly&nbsp;
discovers Greer and calls an ambulance.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.440
Miles later wakes up and sees the prophet,&nbsp;
Powell, and his men ransacking his house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.200
looking for the weapon. Powell asks where&nbsp;
the weapon came from, and Miles confesses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.280
that he never found out who it was. They only&nbsp;
kept contact through disposable cellphones,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.360
and he was only paid to use the weapon. A news&nbsp;
report later states that Powell sees the crashed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.960
helicopter as an attack in the dreads’ home and&nbsp;
declares a revolution against surrogate users.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.120
Meanwhile, Greer wakes up at the hospital,&nbsp;
and Adam tells him he’s been suspended.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.640
Adam says he’d be handling the case&nbsp;
personally and advises Greer to rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.080
Infuriated by the bureau’s decision,&nbsp;
Greer breaks out of the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.600
He’s worried that the bureau may not&nbsp;
share his concern regarding Miles’ weapon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.520
Peters then meets with him, and they start&nbsp;
heading back to the station. As Greer walks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.840
he gets dizzy and disorientated. Peters says it’s&nbsp;
an effect of being in the surrogate for too long.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.920
Greer decides to head to the Dread colony,&nbsp;
thinking he’d easily get in now that he’s not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.880
using a surrogate. Inside, he sees his surrogate&nbsp;
crucified and finds out that Miles had died.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.160
Powell speaks over Miles’ funeral and&nbsp;
reminds the attendees how Miles’ death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.400
is a sign of true humanity, unlike the surrogates.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.920
Greer approaches Powell after the&nbsp;
funeral, but Powell’s henchmen beat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.920
him up after he refuses to leave. Powell&nbsp;
recognizes Greer as a surrogate user and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.120
tells him feeling pain is as close to&nbsp;
the human experience he’ll ever get.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.120
Greer asks about the weapon, but Powell laughs&nbsp;
at him and gives him a sarcastic answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.560
Greer leaves, and Powell heads into his trailer&nbsp;
to retrieve the weapon hidden under the floor.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.760
A car pulls up behind Greer, and he gets in.&nbsp;
A young boy speaks and reveals himself to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.920
another one of Lionel’s surrogates. Lionel says&nbsp;
he can’t use his usual surrogates because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.680
the attempt on his life. He then expresses&nbsp;
his frustration with how the investigation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.920
into Jarid’s death is leading nowhere. Greer&nbsp;
tells Lionel that Jarid’s assassin had died,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.680
and was killed by Powell. Greer then tells&nbsp;
Lionel how he had lost his son in a car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.400
accident and that the worst thing in the&nbsp;
world is a parent outliving their child.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.200
Lionel advises Greer to focus his investigation&nbsp;
on the weapon. If they find out where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.880
weapon came from, they’d know who wanted&nbsp;
Lionel dead. Lionel says the dreads are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.160
incapable of producing such a weapon as it&nbsp;
would require a lot of research and money.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.800
Greer then heads home and gets into an argument&nbsp;
with Maggie. He says that he only wants to be with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.600
his wife, and Maggie says she is there. But Greer&nbsp;
says he wants his real wife, not a surrogate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.920
Maggie says things have changed and that she’s&nbsp;
not the same person. Maggie leaves Greer, enters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.160
her room, and looks at herself. She takes her&nbsp;
goggles off and starts sobbing in her stim chair.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.560
Greer heads back to the station and finds&nbsp;
information about V.S.I. making a weapon contract&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:52.000
with the military. The contract, however, is&nbsp;
quickly terminated, but the reason is classified.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.680
Later that night, a surrogate breaks into&nbsp;
Peters’ home. It looks through recordings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.160
of what Peters has seen and learns about Bobby and&nbsp;
the police’s ability to tap into all surrogates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.240
The surrogate then shoots a sleeping Peters&nbsp;
several times. It then takes Peters’ surrogate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.080
and implants it with a remote operator. At&nbsp;
the station, Peters’ surrogate comes to life.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.400
Greer meets with the military colonel the&nbsp;
following day and shows a picture of the weapon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.600
The colonel confesses that he knows of the&nbsp;
weapon’s existence and explains that it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.760
an overload device created by V.S.I. for&nbsp;
the military. It was initially designed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.080
leading to operators dying. After the testing&nbsp;
period, all prototypes were believed to have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.000
destroyed. Greer then tells the colonel that&nbsp;
the dreads have the weapon. The colonel then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.280
rushes out and tells Greer that the military&nbsp;
will take charge of the weapon’s retrieval.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.840
At the dread zone, Powell hands the weapon to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.480
his henchmen and tasks them to bring&nbsp;
it to Peters at the police station.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.280
Meanwhile, Greer heads to Maggie’s salon and talks&nbsp;
to her about what happened the previous night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.080
Maggie is surprised to see Greer and&nbsp;
appears like she doesn’t want to discuss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.240
what happened the night before. Greer brings&nbsp;
up their dead son, and Maggie is frustrated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.760
telling Greer that the only reason why Maggie is&nbsp;
still alive today is because of her surrogate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.840
which provided an escape from her life. Greer&nbsp;
tries appealing to Maggie, but she logs out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.240
of the surrogate. At home, Maggie reaches for a&nbsp;
bottle from a pile of medication and takes one.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.640
Meanwhile, the military has initiated an invasion&nbsp;
of the Dread zone to retrieve the weapon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.720
Soldiers pour out of helicopters, and&nbsp;
the dread inhabitants rush to hide.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.800
Powell and his henchmen try to escape but run&nbsp;
into the soldiers. A firefight ensues between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.280
Powell’s men and the military, but Powell’s men&nbsp;
are overpowered almost immediately. Powell gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.360
shot, and as the military approach, they see&nbsp;
that Powell, the leader of the anti-surrogacy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.360
movement, is himself a surrogate. Lionel is&nbsp;
finally revealed to be Powell’s operator.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.280
Greer meets with who believes is Peters, and&nbsp;
the surrogate reveals that Miles had been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.040
working with Andrew. It turns out Andrew&nbsp;
had hired Miles to assassinate Lionel.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.840
Greer then heads into the station to confront&nbsp;
Andrew about what he had found. Greer asks Andrew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.720
what motivated him to have Lionel killed. Greer&nbsp;
theorizes that V.S.I. handed Andrew the weapon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.280
Andrew hired Miles to kill Lionel, but Miles&nbsp;
accidentally ends up killing Jarid. As Andrew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.760
looks away, Greer stabs the surrogate at the back&nbsp;
of the head, shorting it out. He then hacks into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.520
Andrew’s computer and downloads everything&nbsp;
that had any relation to V.S.I. and Miles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.840
He then meets with Peters’ surrogate, and they&nbsp;
drive out. From the files, Greer surmises that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.680
Lionel is funding the anti-surrogacy movement,&nbsp;
oblivious to the possibility that Lionel could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.000
have started the movement. Greer then finds the&nbsp;
codes necessary to activate the weapon. Peters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.480
then calls the station, telling them of Greer’s&nbsp;
whereabouts. At that moment, a truck hits them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.880
and the car gets thrown. Peters walks away with&nbsp;
the weapon, but Greer decides to pursue Peters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.360
trying to run her over. The pair end up going&nbsp;
through busy streets, running over surrogates, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.760
smashing into other cars. Greer ends up crashing&nbsp;
into a store window, and Peters gets away.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.600
Greer hides from the pursuing&nbsp;
F.B.I. agents and steals a car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.840
He calls Bobby and orders him to shut Peters’&nbsp;
surrogate down, but Peters has beaten him to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.040
Bobby tells Greer that Peters is trying&nbsp;
to tap into the entire surrogate network.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.400
Andrew heads to the monitoring level and faces&nbsp;
Peters. He tries to speak with Peters, but Lionel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.640
reveals it’s him controlling Peters’ surrogate.&nbsp;
Andrews reasons with Lionel, saying the surrogates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.520
are Lionel’s gift to the world, and now, Lionel&nbsp;
wants to destroy them. V.S.I. had no choice but to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.920
have Lionel killed, as destroying the surrogates&nbsp;
would move humanity backward. Lionel then says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.320
he only wants people to live like human beings.&nbsp;
He then fires the weapon at Andrew, shorting out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.520
his surrogate’s computer and destroying it,&nbsp;
finally getting revenge for Jarid’s death.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.440
Greer arrives at Lionel’s home and&nbsp;
demands to speak with the real Lionel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.560
He then forces his way in,&nbsp;
trying to find Lionel. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.320
Peters’ surrogate initiates a virus upload into&nbsp;
all the surrogates, intending to kill everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.800
who are using surrogates. Greer finds a hidden&nbsp;
door and enters it to find Lionel’s chamber.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.560
In the chamber, he finds many surrogates,&nbsp;
including Powell and the man that killed Peters.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.760
Greer then finds Lionel sitting in a wheelchair,&nbsp;
pointing a gun at him. Lionel asks if Greer could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.600
feel his accelerated pulse and sweating,&nbsp;
asking if he misses being human. He says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.760
nobody knows how it feels to be human anymore,&nbsp;
so he’ll be the one to eliminate the surrogates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.760
He argues that the people inside surrogates are&nbsp;
already dead, so he’ll be doing humanity a favor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.600
by killing all of them. He thinks surrogacy&nbsp;
is humanity’s perversion and a sick addiction.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.240
A warning rings out that the virus upload&nbsp;
is completed. Now that his will is complete,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.640
Lionel swallows a cyanide pill, taking his own&nbsp;
life. Greer then takes Lionel off the stim chair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.800
and logs into Peters’ surrogate. He asks Bobby&nbsp;
how they could stop the virus before it transmits,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.880
and Bobby talks him through it. With less than&nbsp;
a second left, Greer successfully stops the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.800
transmission. The operators are safe, but&nbsp;
the virus is still active and would still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.880
destroy surrogates. Bobby instructs Greer how&nbsp;
to prevent the surrogates from being destroyed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.600
while a team of operatives enters the facility. As&nbsp;
Greer is about to confirm the virus termination,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.120
he pauses and instead decides to allow&nbsp;
the virus to be sent to surrogates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.840
Just as Greer presses the button, an&nbsp;
operative shoots Peters’ surrogate.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.920
As the virus goes active, all the&nbsp;
surrogates suddenly turn lifeless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.160
Streets and buildings pile with deactivated&nbsp;
surrogates. Greer steps out to see the virus had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.480
successfully disabled all the surrogates. People&nbsp;
begin leaving their houses dazed and confused,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.320
some stepping out of their houses for the first&nbsp;
time in a while. Greer heads home and finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.240
sees his wife standing by the window. Maggie&nbsp;
touches Greer’s face and the two embrace.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.120
News reports later state that surrogates worldwide&nbsp;
have been deactivated, but no reports of human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.760
casualties have been listed. Humanity now stumbles&nbsp;
back into the world, unsure of what lies ahead.
