out of the spaceship into what appears to be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.640
concrete underground hallway he makes his way up&nbsp;
and exits to a wooded area clearly still on earth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.480
he loads his equipment to a truck and drives&nbsp;
through a secluded wooded area that appears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.360
to be a facility housing more bunkers similar&nbsp;
to helena's alex drives through security and&nbsp;&nbsp;

bunkers where people like helena are being kept&nbsp;
in isolation head scientist hugo informs alex&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.840

as close as 20 years alex expresses his concern&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.000
about the passengers and the simulated flights&nbsp;
and the ethical implications of their research&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.560

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.440
for a spacecraft that launched five years&nbsp;
ago carrying a crew of 207 headed for celeste&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.800
tells her the truth he asks her to go with him and&nbsp;
leave but she refuses until he shows her a camera&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.600
monitoring her as well as a microchip implanted&nbsp;
in her that monitors her vital signs and bodily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.480
functions alex hacks into the ship and routes a&nbsp;
video recording of helena so nobody would notice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.920
her gone the pair then head out helena steps&nbsp;
out of the dark bunker for the first time and is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.280
completely dazed by the sunlight she has trouble&nbsp;
seeing and even walking being new to the air and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.240
the environment alex tells helena all about the&nbsp;
experiment and stresses that nobody should know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.040
about her existence helena says she wants to&nbsp;
see her parents but alex dresses that must never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.320
know she's made it out the pair eventually reach&nbsp;
alex's apartment and helena explores the apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.400
discovering whatever knick-knacks and gadgets&nbsp;
and even experiences reign for the first time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.560
the next day alex heads to sylvia and informs&nbsp;
her of what he's done concern for his safety&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.760
sylvia promises to help him out in case things&nbsp;
get worse that night helena and alex head out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.720
to the city and alex shows helena his favorite&nbsp;
spots the couple shares a meal and alex shows her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.920
new food and experiences she never got to have&nbsp;
they even head to a massive aquarium and alex&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.320
explains that soon all the fish will have to live&nbsp;
in aquariums as the oceans could become too toxic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.000
several days pass and alex shows helena his home&nbsp;
office where he keeps tabs on everyone in all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.800
orbiters helena questions how he could bring&nbsp;
himself to be involved in a cruel experiment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.960
and alex answers that they are doing this for&nbsp;
the right reasons saying the insight they gain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.040
in the experiment would be invaluable when&nbsp;
the real earth to celeste flights take place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.680
alex and helena spend more time outside&nbsp;
even meeting alex's friends at a club&nbsp;&nbsp;

what it would mean for the future of humanity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.760
alex's friend dr xiao expresses his concern&nbsp;
that humanity is so quick to give up on earth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.600
and yet is willing to send civilians on a&nbsp;
decade's long journey to an unknown planet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.920
the following day helena notices bruises forming&nbsp;
on her back he takes her to xiao and he tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.160
that her skin is too delicate and sensitive&nbsp;
as if she hasn't been exposed to sunlight in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.360
such a long time xiao suspects that helena must&nbsp;
have something to do with alex's secretive job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.960
helena rummages through alex's office and&nbsp;
discovers her file she sees that she's not an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.840
offspring but is actually a clone she finds her&nbsp;
surrogate parents address and goes to find them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.720

heavy focus of consideration for the future and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.640
how they're paving the way for mankind's survival&nbsp;
this project is humanity's chance for a new start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.000
alex arrives home to an empty apartment and sees&nbsp;
helena has discovered the truth about her genetics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.520
meanwhile helena finds her parents and confronts&nbsp;
them her mother tells her that she is indeed a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.000
clone but she's a clone of people from several&nbsp;
generations back making her jeans extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.400

alex at his apartment helena cries angry at alex&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.480
for keeping the secret from her alex gives&nbsp;
a heartfelt apology and helena forgives him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.200

authorities and hugo are now probably after them&nbsp;&nbsp;

of the building sylvia denies knowledge of alex&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.600
saying she's never seen him hugo is suspicious&nbsp;
and they take her to one of the therapy booths not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.720
knowing alex and helena are just on the other side&nbsp;
of the glass panel hugo and one of his men mal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.440
treat sylvia and they notice movement from behind&nbsp;
the glass panel one of the men shoots sylvia and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.560
alex starts cursing and shouting at them the men&nbsp;
then give chase and alex and helena make their way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.160
through the building zigzagging through rooftops&nbsp;
avoiding gunfire the pair eventually get cornered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.200
on a rooftop and have to jump across to the&nbsp;
adjacent building alex jumps first but helena gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.320
left behind and hugo catches up to her they bring&nbsp;
her back to the facility and keep her under guard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.240
now in hiding alex sneaks his way to meeting&nbsp;
back with xiao xiao is immediately concerned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.240
about alex's safety and informs him that&nbsp;
he too has been harassed by hugo's goons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.280
he also tells alex that the biopsy of helena's&nbsp;
skin has found that she's too sensitive to live on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.240
the planet in its current state and she has to go&nbsp;
back into the orbiter to ensure her survival back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.280
at the facility helena begs to be placed back into&nbsp;
the orbiter 9 so long as they leave alex alone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.320
hugo denies her and meets with catherine who&nbsp;
tells hugo to kill helena as it's costing them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:52.080
too much to run the orbiters personnel prepares to&nbsp;
kill off helena but alex arrives forcing his way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.280
in through security and offering hugo a deal he's&nbsp;
willing to enter back into orbiter 9 and continue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.800
the study with helena their leverage he reveals is&nbsp;
the fact that helena is pregnant with their child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.760
he says this is what hugo wanted all along so&nbsp;
they can study the long-term effects of natural&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.040
birth and actually raising a child inside orbiter&nbsp;
hugo agrees and the couple head back into orbiter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.680
several years pass and an aged hugo waits outside&nbsp;
orbiter nine a young teenage girl steps out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.880
