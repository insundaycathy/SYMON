00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.400
in this video we will not make fun of the terrible&nbsp;
script, bad acting "my firearm is my friend"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.720
and ridiculous neurotoxin&nbsp;
presented in this movie, No

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.080
in this video we seriously analyze the threat&nbsp;
that makes you want to kill yourself faster then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.160
you can scream
Flower

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.000
We follow Marky Mark look at the&nbsp;
dumb mistakes he and the squad make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.880
and figure out what we would do instead to&nbsp;
survive and ultimately beat the happening&nbsp;

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.320
New York is in chaos all over New York people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.040
randomly start competing of who can&nbsp;
perform the most creative suicide&nbsp;

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.440
in the opening scenes there is a lot of happening&nbsp;
in the happening we got profound observations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.080
we got action loaded shots and we have&nbsp;
Mark hitting on his 15 year old student&nbsp;

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.440
"because your face is perfect. The&nbsp;
problem is your face is perfect at 15"&nbsp;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.920
I will not go into this when Mark gets summoned&nbsp;
by his principal, not because of his misbehaviour,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.040
he is told that there has been an airborne&nbsp;
biochemical terrorist attack at central park&nbsp;

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:10.080
The symptoms are confused speech, physical&nbsp;
disorientation and finally suicide and suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.520
i am very okay with covid and pm 2.5
If a fatal airborne biochemical is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.160
released i think it is safe to say not&nbsp;
to leave your house whatever the reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.760
tape shut your windows and wait it out but even&nbsp;
with completely sealed windows it is difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.160
if not impossible to make your home airtight once&nbsp;
the chemical enters you are pretty much done for&nbsp;

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.040
We don't know yet how the chemical is absorbed&nbsp;
by humans but most likely it's through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.240
airways however for what we know it could&nbsp;
also enter our bloodstream through the skin&nbsp;

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.040
The best way to stay safe in this situation&nbsp;
would be to get a military-ranked airtight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.600
overall plus same level gas mask
ain't no neurotoxin getting you in there&nbsp;

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.080
If you have an airtight bunker with&nbsp;
a sophisticated filtration system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.000
and enough canned food for several months then you&nbsp;
may take use of that too until the situation has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.840
improved just make sure you can receive and send&nbsp;
out signals to communicate and stay up to date&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.920
also you may want to store appropriate gear&nbsp;
in there as well if you need to peek outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.360
for whatever reason don't forget some legos&nbsp;
mangas and well other sources of entertainment&nbsp;

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.080
In the movie Philadelphia gets evacuated which&nbsp;
is probably the best way to go for most people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.360
since the tools i have mentioned&nbsp;
before aren't easy accessible for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.440
the average person - at least not prior 2020
But evacuating a massive city like Philadelphia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.960
comes along with different kind of challenges&nbsp;
having a population of well over 5 million people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.920
I am surprised there isn't much more of a mess
I mean if people are choking each other to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.840
some toilet paper these days, I don't want&nbsp;
to know what would happen in this situation&nbsp;

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.120
The biochemical gas has either reached&nbsp;
or been released in Philadelphia by now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.400
that is three hours since the first incident&nbsp;
in New York logical conclusions are that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.720
it's either another separate attack or&nbsp;
it traveled from New York down south&nbsp;

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.120
if it traveled down south we can assume that the&nbsp;
toxin travels around 40 meters per second given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.760
the distance between NYC and Philadelphia that&nbsp;
is pretty fast and impossible to outrun and still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.840
very difficult to drive away from
The dangers of an airborne attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.000
are mainly caused by its unpredictable nature and&nbsp;
incredible fast spread both dependent on the wind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.320
direction humidity and other environmental factors&nbsp;
such as temperature which we have no control over&nbsp;

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.800
Interestingly enough the chemical doesn't&nbsp;
seem to affect animals as we can see here

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.760
not sure what that means but it sounds like what a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.720
scientist would say before&nbsp;
he would solve the problem&nbsp;

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.080
The train that our characters took to get out&nbsp;
of the city has stopped in the middle of nowhere&nbsp;

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.840
Everyone gathers at the local diner and we&nbsp;
get to see another yet highly creative suicide

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.320
it seems like the neurotoxin not only makes people&nbsp;
invent incredible ways to dispose of themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.680
but it also seems to turn off&nbsp;
any kind of pain sensation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.680
sort of like being in a trance state if that's&nbsp;
the case then things start to look pretty grim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.000
because there is no chance of survival once it&nbsp;
enters your body so you better avoid any contact&nbsp;

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.920
The best way to do that is get the hell out of&nbsp;
the affected area newest reports show that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.000
only affected area thus far is the northeast&nbsp;
and that it is probably no terrorist attack&nbsp;

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.760
If it isn't a terrorist attack then&nbsp;
the next plausible explanation would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.760
be the government screwed something&nbsp;
up again and now tries to cover it up&nbsp;

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.240
In any way getting as far away as&nbsp;
possible is a simple thing to do&nbsp;

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.840
I personally wouldn't take any&nbsp;
chances and drive up north to Canada&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.720
and don't stop until eventually reach Ivujinik
That is here in case you wonder but i wouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.520
stop there neither, no once i arrived&nbsp;
there i would make my way further up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.800
until i have reached the land of Nunavut&nbsp;
so i can finally chill with some Inuit

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.760
Mark Wahlberg's friend has the incredibly heroic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.240
idea to go and save his wife who is&nbsp;
somewhere in the middle of the attack&nbsp;

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.560
he decides to pass his seven-year-old&nbsp;
daughter to his buddies in mere seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.440
and drives off with a couple of strangers
I ain't got no kids but that's sort of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.840
wrong priority lane isn't it your wife is a&nbsp;
grown-up woman stuck amidst a deadly bio-attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.040
you are as clueless as anybody else so you're&nbsp;
therefore completely useless even if you make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.960
it to her and if you somehow can escape together&nbsp;
she could have totally escaped on her own as well&nbsp;

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.160
So leaving your daughter behind.. I don't know&nbsp;
man, maybe the toxin has already sabotaged his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.520
brain or he never wanted any kids to begin with&nbsp;
and jumps onto the first chance to get rid of it

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.320
At first i thought she started screaming&nbsp;
because of the people hanging from the trees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.680
but then i realized she doesn't like math neither&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.800
"i'm gonna give you a math riddle&nbsp;
okay are you gonna tell me the answer"

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.920
jokes aside using math to distract people probably&nbsp;
won't work on ninety percent of the population&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:28.080
but if you need to get rid of them you may try&nbsp;
it mark's buddy here realizes pretty quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.000
that they are doomed but let's be honest that was&nbsp;
pretty clear to begin with when he sees to cut in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.800
the cloth cover he knows exactly what's coming but&nbsp;
in my humble opinion that's just freaking weird&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:47.120
that cloth is by no means airtight meaning if the&nbsp;
toxin needs such a huge passage to travel through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.440
i don't know what those people are afraid&nbsp;
of according to the logic in this scene the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.440 --> 00:07:01.840
molecules of the toxin must be so huge&nbsp;
you should see them with the naked eye

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.120
That storyline ended pretty quickly&nbsp;

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.520
Meanwhile mark his wife and the&nbsp;
kid travel with an elderly pair&nbsp;

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.120
I love how they spot dead people just meters away&nbsp;
from them implying the neurotoxin is definitely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.960
around here yet nobody puts in the slightest&nbsp;
effort protecting themselves it is well known&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.640
by now that it's an airborne chemical that is&nbsp;
wreaking havoc how come none of these people use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.400
something to cover their airways i mean at least&nbsp;
you're actively trying to stay somewhere inside or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:38.160
cover your mouth and nose with whatever you have&nbsp;
at your disposal those people do literally nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.160
ultimately they take a different route and meet a&nbsp;
bunch of other people coming from all directions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:51.200
reporting deaths everywhere around meaning they&nbsp;
were in an unaffected area with casualties 360&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.720
degrees around them if the toxin is literally all&nbsp;
around them it won't allow you to move anywhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.680
the obvious problem with that is that sitting&nbsp;
tight in an open area will inevitably end in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.520
your death it's just a matter of time but if you&nbsp;
can't move nor sit tight then what can you do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.800
one of the best solutions would be to&nbsp;
seal off your car and make it airtight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.600
assuming you have the appropriate tools to&nbsp;
do that let's calculate how long you could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:23.440
survive in an airtight vehicle before you die&nbsp;
of carbon dioxide poisoning exhaled by yourself&nbsp;

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.560
Our characters drive in a Jeep with pretty large&nbsp;
interior space let's estimate that to around 65&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:37.040
cubic feet of complete airspace the average&nbsp;
person breaths around 300 cubic feet per day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:43.840
thus that person will decrease room oxygen by&nbsp;
0.75 cubic feet per hour and increase carbon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:50.080
dioxide by 0.5 cubic feet during the same time&nbsp;
we have 5 characters in the car so we have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:57.600
multiply the digits with the factor 5 resulting in&nbsp;
a complete decrease of oxygen of 3.75 cubic feet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:04.240
per hour and an increase of around 2.5 cubic&nbsp;
feet carbon dioxide per hour dangerous carbon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:10.000
dioxide levels are above 10 000 parts per million&nbsp;
and especially dangerous above thirty thousand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:18.480
if we take thirty thousand parts per million as&nbsp;
an arbitrary death point then 1.95 cubic feet co2&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.680
inside our airtight jeep would cause a&nbsp;
potentially deadly carbon dioxide poisoning&nbsp;

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.800
leaving only roughly around 45 minutes&nbsp;
before our characters would need fresh air&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.800
suffocation triggered by low oxygen levels on the&nbsp;
other hand would not happen until well over 60&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:42.240
minutes inside our jeep but the group in our movie&nbsp;
has different plans "We need to stay in groups,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.440
stay together" Thank you captain thank&nbsp;
you for your elaborate presentation&nbsp;

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.960
The people pack their stuff and begin their&nbsp;
journey to Mordor is what i would like to say but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:59.280
they are just heading to Arundel county basically&nbsp;
they have somehow concluded that the neurotoxin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:06.400
somehow targets larger groups of people and well&nbsp;
Arundel apparently has no significant population&nbsp;

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.120
Mastermind right there i can tell you i&nbsp;
wouldn't stay with those people by choice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.480
"My firearm is my friend"
That were his last words&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:23.120
seems like one group got wiped out one thing&nbsp;
less to consider Mark miraculously concludes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:28.160
that it must be the plants and that the&nbsp;
plants only target large groups indicating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.840
why his group was left out sweet conclusion&nbsp;
and definitely helpful but it doesn't change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:39.360
the fact that the chemical that's making people&nbsp;
act more awkward than normal is still airborne&nbsp;

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.560
I'm not sure what's coming next but to me it is&nbsp;
still very obvious just to wear the right type&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.680
of protective wear and stay inside
luckily the next move isn't as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.080
stupid as some of the last few
Mark's group escapes to an abandoned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:59.440
house and everything in that house is fake for&nbsp;
whatever reason perhaps the movie is hinting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:05.760
on the mountains of plastic waste produced by&nbsp;
humans if it does it failed also mark seems to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.880
have a little bit of a talk with a fake plant&nbsp;
"Just going to talk in a very positive manner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:17.200
giving off good vibes" If Arundel was chosen&nbsp;
because of its insignificant population then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.160
this house should have been the holy grail&nbsp;
I don't see any reason to leave that place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:28.720
unless it's to gather food meaning they can easily&nbsp;
go for another day or two without having any&nbsp;

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:34.240
besides when you have to abandon your home due&nbsp;
to an attack or something of the like you should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:40.640
always bring along necessities such as snacks,&nbsp;
water, a knife and other essentials making your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:46.560
life much easier if the days to come look bad
The little girl gets hungry so naturally they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:52.000
stop by a random house and have some&nbsp;
fun on the swing hanging from the tree&nbsp;

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.080
I for a second forgot they are&nbsp;
escaping an airborne neurotoxin&nbsp;

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.760
Mark and the two teens are checking if somebody&nbsp;
lives in the house in the next 30 seconds the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:08.160
teens get shot through the opening in the windows&nbsp;
by the gentleman owning the house he didn't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:14.480
our characters to enter because of the deadly&nbsp;
gas that is lurking outside go figure how about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:20.240
you get some new windows without any holes in it
This movie is like a project done a day before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:26.080
deadline but our three characters continue the&nbsp;
development of this sophisticated storyline&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:31.600
and end up at another house whoa&nbsp;
this time a lone woman lives here&nbsp;

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.560
She lives off-grid grows her own food and&nbsp;
has no electric line connected to her house&nbsp;

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.320
She could be amish
She seems to be another brain dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:46.160
character in this movie paired with some paranoid&nbsp;
behavior our character spent the night there&nbsp;

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:53.920
if you had to choose between being an overnight&nbsp;
guest at the lone old paranoid lady's house that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:59.520
given off i'll poison you and eat you later vibes&nbsp;
or spend your night outside while a poisonous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:06.320
toxin is going to kill you would you sleep under a&nbsp;
tree or on a field our characters somehow survived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:12.400
this night but mark doesn't seem to be able&nbsp;
to avoid conflict with this creepy old lady&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:19.680
but he tries his best to establish common ground
"Just hear me out, see i'm a teacher"&nbsp;

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.920
Apparently telling other people that&nbsp;
you're a teacher is a strategy out there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.520
rhetoric 101 established trust
luckily this quick side story ends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:35.120
fast with Mrs Jones smashing her head through&nbsp;
the windows after the toxin has reached her

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:44.400
God bless her it seems like the flowers don't&nbsp;
care anymore if you are a group of people or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:50.960
just a solo traveler they target you nonetheless
Mark stuffs a cloth underneath the door to prevent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:56.400
airflow kind of like a teenager that is about to&nbsp;
light a joint but doesn't want his mom to figure&nbsp;

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.480
it out it doesn't work
but the greatest scene has yet to come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:06.000
mark hears odd sounds and goes having&nbsp;
a look he realizes that his wife and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.760
the girl are playing in the old field hut&nbsp;
over there both places are connected with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:17.520
speaking tube allowing effortless communication
"Close the windows and the doors Alma. -Why?"&nbsp;

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:25.600
Why. Really? You've been escaping an airborne&nbsp;
neurotoxin for the past 24 hours what the hell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.560
are you doing over there i don't think this&nbsp;
is the time to hang loose especially when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:36.000
you know that the toxin that's been killing&nbsp;
thousands of people in the past 24 hours is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.160
probably released by plants you are literally&nbsp;
surrounded by nature and if that isn't enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:48.480
you are in an open field making it very easy&nbsp;
for the wind to carry over any airborne chemical&nbsp;

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.680
To be honest if this movie is about nature&nbsp;
paying back i would have rather seen zombified&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.320
flowers hunting people than seeing whatever&nbsp;
the hell this was for 90 minutes straight
