he initially appeared to be a criminal
 

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.870 align:start position:0%
he initially appeared to be a criminal
i<00:11:17.440><c> think</c><00:11:17.680><c> it</c><00:11:17.760><c> became</c><00:11:18.240><c> more</c><00:11:18.480><c> apparent</c>

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
i think it became more apparent
 

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.710 align:start position:0%
i think it became more apparent
throughout<00:11:19.200><c> the</c><00:11:19.360><c> series</c><00:11:19.920><c> that</c><00:11:20.160><c> he</c><00:11:20.320><c> actually</c>

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the series that he actually
 

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.350 align:start position:0%
throughout the series that he actually
wasn't

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.430 align:start position:0%
wasn't
there<00:11:21.519><c> was</c><00:11:21.680><c> a</c><00:11:21.760><c> lot</c><00:11:21.920><c> of</c><00:11:22.079><c> talk</c><00:11:22.320><c> about</c><00:11:22.720><c> spies</c><00:11:23.200><c> and</c>

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of talk about spies and
 

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.350 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of talk about spies and
so<00:11:23.600><c> on</c><00:11:24.079><c> i</c><00:11:24.240><c> think</c><00:11:24.399><c> that</c><00:11:24.640><c> sang</c><00:11:24.959><c> work</c>

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
so on i think that sang work
 

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.190 align:start position:0%
so on i think that sang work
may<00:11:25.600><c> have</c><00:11:25.760><c> actually</c><00:11:26.000><c> been</c><00:11:26.240><c> one</c><00:11:26.399><c> of</c><00:11:26.560><c> them</c><00:11:27.040><c> he</c>

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
may have actually been one of them he
 

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.110 align:start position:0%
may have actually been one of them he
did<00:11:27.440><c> pretend</c><00:11:27.760><c> to</c><00:11:27.920><c> be</c><00:11:28.079><c> unable</c><00:11:28.480><c> to</c><00:11:28.560><c> do</c><00:11:28.720><c> a</c><00:11:28.800><c> lot</c><00:11:28.959><c> of</c>
