00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:06.529
If the creatures from Bird Box started appearing
in the news, causing mass suicides globally,

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:07.970
what would you do?

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.679
What could you do?

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.820
In this video on Nerd Explains, I’ll tell
you, how to survive Bird Box.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.710
Firstly, I have to laugh at the news stations
live broadcasting the demon that causes you

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.359
to kill yourself if you see it.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.820
I mean, the news would definitely do something
like that.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.980
If it bleeds it leads, ya know what i’m
saying.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:50.690
I mean the movie, the ring, has already come
out, we’re already aware of this concept.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.269
Good god I think suicide is a mercy killing
for Sandra having to be surrounded by nosy-ass

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:57.750
know-it-alls like this.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.480
Sandra did most things correctly given her
situation.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.910
I have to applaud a horror movie where the
people actually make reasonably correct decisions

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.200
based on their circumstances, and survive
not just through sheer luck like Brad Pitt

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.220
in WWZ.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.330
It just so happens that even with Sandras
good decision making and survival instincts,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.940
she barely makes it to the sanctuary.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.310
And that sanctuary isn’t a safe place by
a longshot, watch the film heralds video to

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.550
see why.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.860
We can’t honestly say we’d have made better
decisions which would lead to a better outcome.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.070
I know for a fact I'd have done what Greg
did and used the security cameras.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.200
Just pixels and heat, a very logical decision.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.360
And we know how that ended up.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.270
I do think the characters navigated their
surroundings too well though.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.010
I mean, you go get in your car and see how
far down the road you get using the GPS system.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.810
Don’t actually do that.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:20.860
But the point is even Ricky Bobby couldn’t
do it, and those roads didn’t have bodies,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.769
planes, cars, and other debris all over the
road.

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.680
Let’s just run through the reasons you wouldn’t
survive Bird Box if it occurred to you:

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.060
You’d probably be one of the initial people
that sees the demon before you have forewarning

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.219
of what’s going on.

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:40.480
Shit, like in WWZ, you’d probably get killed
in a car accident before you even knew there

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.290
was an apocalypse going on.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.680
If you made it long enough to realize looking
at the demons is suicide, well, congrats but

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.840
you’re still screwed.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.609
The demons aren’t really a threat if you’re
blindfolded, so the biggest reasons you won’t

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:01.790
survive is that finding and cooking non-perished
food and clean water is extremely difficult.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.599
Not only is sight restricted, but you can’t
make any noise or throw food on the grill

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:12.000
either as thousands of psychos are patrolling
the cities searching for you, and they can

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.480
use sight and all their other senses to find
you.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.579
They will probably watch grocery stores and
areas where clean water is available as well.

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:27.359
So Bird Box effectively has all the dangers
of A Quiet Place too, including badly timed

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.499
pregnancies.

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:34.219
The demons don’t seem to require sustenance,
they are everywhere, they are many, and they

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:37.310
invaded the entire globe in hours.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.120
This is similar to The Happening, except the
plants are invisible moving entities that

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.450
kill via visual stimuli that causes psychological
damage.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.650
So if you were thrust into that situation.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.000
You'd pretty much be dead.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.909
Instead, let's tackle this from the perspective
of a research scientist stationed at Area

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:57.180
51.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.799
Before we do, consider subscribing to the
channel so you can know how to survive all

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.620
kinds of situations like this.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.299
Lucky you, you’re in an underground military
installation in the middle of the desert where

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.299
you have fake windows with fake representations
of the outdoors so you don’t go insane.

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.749
But most importantly, you have all the tech,
food, water, and security you need so you

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:16.260
can focus on figuring out how to beat the
Bird Box apocalypse.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.210
Let’s also say that you are aware you can’t
look at cameras, videos, or any visual representation

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.790
of the demon, because your coworker did and
committed suicide, again, lucky you.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.540
You need to get more info on these demons,
but how, you can’t even see them.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.040
I’m going to take a shot in the dark and
say Area 51 has NSA access.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:47.680
Tune into the radio signals and read, emphasis
on read, the news reports, social media posts,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.240
phone calls, phone activity and location data,
everything.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.660
You can analyze all the global data and determine
a lot of the aspects of the demon.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.400
Considering the demons are global and everywhere,
you can still go outside and physically test

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.970
various hypotheses.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.530
What else did you find out about the demon?

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.870
They have strong abilities that enable them
to cause mass suicides of their prey, which

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.530
sounds supernatural but Jim Jones and many
other cult leaders have led mass suicides

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.920
throughout history.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.140
Some forms of hypnosis and Zoolander-esque
mind control could be at play.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:30.090
Seriously, there are conspiracy theories that
governments use electromagnetic radiation

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.380
to transmit sounds and thoughts into people's
heads to control them, illuminati confirmed.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:41.080
They occupy physical space, as they cast shadows,
move vegetation, and set off proximity alarms.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.210
They are quite large considering the trees
that they move.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.960
They are invisible, yet this may just be because
of how they manipulate our perception of them.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.870
They don’t enter buildings or homes.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.170
They show signs of animal level intelligence
with psychic powers.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.580
Probably why they can’t open doors or enter
homes.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.270
The demons know intimate things about you,
like past loved ones.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.610
Though this is actually probably a byproduct
of the psychological distress caused by the

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.610
demon.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:18.820
People with severe mental issues are turned
into crazies that attack others, but don’t

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.770
commit suicide themselves.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:44.390
It’s like Joe Rogan with DMT, except Bird
Box DMT causes you to commit suicide.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:49.800
It’s also similar to WWZ where being ill
protects you from being a healthy host for

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.240
the infection, the same applies to Bird Box,
except psychologically.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.550
Bird’s have a unique immunity, hence the
title of the movie, where other animals do

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.550
not.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:01.550
Birds are like the terminally ill people in
WWZ.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.720
But why, what is it about Birds.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.810
Well they have very distinct differences in
sight.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.210
They can see ultraviolet light and magnetic
fields, they have a much higher frames per

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.960
second that enables them to track rapid movements
that would be a blur to us, and they can detect

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:29.520
extremely slow movements, like Drax in Guardian
of the Galaxy.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.760
How does this all help us?

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:36.570
It’s possible that the demons are imperceptible
in visible light, but not in UV light where

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.850
the birds can see them.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:43.510
So you could use UV sensors to see the demons
and other horrors amongst your living space,

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:48.330
but items under UV light still retain their
form, so you’d still see the imagery that

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.220
causes you to commit suicide.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.770
Also, dog’s can see UV light and there’s
a peculiar lack of stray dogs.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:01.510
I also looked at intelligence and types of
intelligence looking for clues as to why birds

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:06.470
survived, thinking that they are too stupid
to comprehend the demon’s imagery, but again,

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.380
dogs don’t survive this so I have no clue
why.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.150
If you have a theory share it in the comments
please.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:19.550
It seems low fidelity vision works, as long
as faces or complete pictures don't form.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:25.030
So we could craft an augmented reality headset
that shows only rudimentary echolocation or

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.620
thermal imaging.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.880
Which may work depending on if the demons
give off heat signatures.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.490
If you have some dogs or animals around, you
could put the headset goggles on them and

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.430
send them outside to greet the creatures.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.440
I feel so evil for suggesting that.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:46.170
But it could be the difference in humanity
surviving or perishing so yah.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:52.389
Once you find the specific wavelength range
that the demon is visible in by trial and

00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:57.230
error, sorry doggos, you can then occlude
that wavelength from being visible in your

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.230
headset.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.230
The point is, this entity causes a unique
signature that we can occlude in the headset.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.120
This way we can see the entity by way of blackouts
in the headset.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.320
Np picture or imagery would be able to form,
as the entity’s wavelength is blocked out

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.160
before it can reach your eye.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.700
Now that sight is restored, you leveled the
playing field.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.240
You can broadcast this to the rest of the
survivors in the world (Independence Day)

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:31.790
and try to begin clearing out areas of psychos,
airdropping headsets, reestablishing supply

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.279
lines of food and water, etc.

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:38.870
Once survival is sustainable, we can locate
and test ways to kill the demons.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.420
We simply don’t have much information on
them right now to say what could kill them

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.700
for sure.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:49.139
If they are unkillable somehow, well everyone
would be transitioning to having brain machine

00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:55.019
interface headsets in the future anyways,
so society won’t look much different.

00:09:55.019 --> 00:10:00.519
Do you agree with augmented reality headsets
being the solution or at least a giant step

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:02.689
towards killing these entities?

00:10:02.689 --> 00:10:03.839
Let me know in the comments

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:19.290
Thanks for watching, later.
