video has you covered. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.240
is everything you need to know&nbsp;
before seeing Halloween Kills.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.920
The original Halloween from 1978 starts&nbsp;
back in 1963 when a six year old Michael&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.240
Myers stabs his older sister to death&nbsp;
after she has sex with her boyfriend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.360
Cut to 1978 and an adult Michael Myers has&nbsp;
broken out of Smith’s Grove Sanitarium,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.560
just as his psychiatrist Dr. Samuel Loomis&nbsp;
and Loomis’ assistant, Marion Chambers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.000
arrive to transport him to a court hearing that&nbsp;
would potentially keep Michael locked up for good.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.800
On Michael’s way to his hometown of Haddonfield,&nbsp;
he kills a mechanic and steals his signature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.160
coveralls, and steals his infamous mask and knives&nbsp;
from a hardware store. As Michael’s psychiatrist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.640
Dr. Samuel Loomis teams up with Sheriff Brackett&nbsp;
to hunt him down to lock back up forever,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.760
Michael begins stalking high school student Laurie&nbsp;
Strode after seeing her at his childhood home.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.320
On Halloween night, Laurie is babysitting&nbsp;
Tommy Doyle, a young outcast picked on by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.480
other kids at school, like the bully Lonnie&nbsp;
Elam. Across the street, Laurie’s friend Annie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.840
the sheriff’s daughter, babysits Lindsay Wallace.&nbsp;
Eventually, Annie drops Lindsay off with Laurie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.040
so she can go have sex with her boyfriend Paul.&nbsp;
Annnnd that’s when Michael kills Annie. Later that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.440
night, Laurie and Annie’s friend Lynda and her&nbsp;
boyfriend Bob arrive at the Wallace house and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.880
after finding it empty, decide to have sex. Annnnd&nbsp;
that’s when Michael shows up and kills them too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.920
Moral of the story? Never have sex in&nbsp;
the general vicinity of Michael Myers.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.680
Eventually, Laurie goes over to the Wallace&nbsp;
house to investigate and finds the bodies of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.320
her friends, and is then chased by Michael back&nbsp;
over to the Doyle house. Laurie helps Tommy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.640
Lindsay escape to call the police for help, and&nbsp;
then begins her violent confrontation with Michael&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.240
Myers. Laurie manages to stab Michael multiple&nbsp;
times before Dr. Loomis finally arrives to finish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.960
him off with some gunshots to the chest. Michael&nbsp;
appears to fall off the balcony to his death,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.360
but when Loomis and Laurie go to check, they&nbsp;
discover that Michael Myers has disappeared.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.760
The story continues in the 2018 version&nbsp;
of Halloween, where Michael Myers has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.800
been re-institutionalized at Smith’s Grove&nbsp;
for the past 40 years. After an attempted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.920
interview by two true crime podcasters, Michael&nbsp;
manages to escape and tracks the podcasters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.040
killing them and stealing back his infamous mask&nbsp;
before once again heading back to Haddonfield.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.680
In the 40 years since her&nbsp;
encounter with Michael Myers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.480
Laurie is still living in intense fear. She&nbsp;
lives in seclusion in a heavily fortified house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.560
and has little relationship with her adult&nbsp;
daughter, Karen, who the state took from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.000
Laurie’s care when she was 12. Her only real human&nbsp;
connection is her teenage granddaughter, Allyson.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.960
Upon hearing that Michael has&nbsp;
escaped, Deputy Frank Hawkins,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.000
who we learn is the officer that arrested Michael&nbsp;
in 1978 after his confrontation with Laurie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.880
tries to warn Sheriff Barker about the killer’s&nbsp;
imminent return, but the sheriff brushes him off.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.240
When Laurie hears of Michael’s escape,&nbsp;
she tries to warn her daughter, Karen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.160
but is similarly brushed off.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.840
At a Halloween night costume party, Allyson&nbsp;
discovers that her boyfriend Cameron,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.400
son of the original film’s school bully Lonnie,&nbsp;
is cheating on her. Hurt, Allyson leaves the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.800
party with Cameron’s friend Oscar. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
Allyson’s best friend Vicky and her boyfriend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.440
Dave are attacked and killed by Michael&nbsp;
while babysitting a young boy named Julian.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.680
Laurie and Hawkins are separately on Michael’s&nbsp;
trail, and Laurie’s first confrontation with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.240
the killer in 40 years ends with her shooting&nbsp;
Myers in the shoulder before he can escape.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.600
Walking home from the party, Allyson&nbsp;
and Oscar are attacked by Michael.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.800
Oscar is killed, but Allyson is saved by Hawkins&nbsp;
and Michael’s newest psychiatrist Dr. Sartain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.240
Hawkins tries to kill Michael, but Sartain&nbsp;
attacks him and leaves him for dead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.280
revealing that he’s become obsessed&nbsp;
with Michael and helped orchestrate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.760
his escape to study him in the wild.&nbsp;
This immediately backfires on Sartain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.640
who is swiftly killed by Michael. During this&nbsp;
chaos, Allyson manages to flee from the scene.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.680
Laurie, Karen, and Karen’s husband Ray all arrive&nbsp;
at Laurie’s fortified home to protect themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.160
When Michael arrives at the house in a stolen&nbsp;
cop car, Ray goes outside to speak with who he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.800
thinks are the police. Michael reveals himself&nbsp;
and strangles Ray to death. Laurie makes sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.880
Karen is tucked away safely and then prepares for&nbsp;
her showdown with Michael Myers. They trade blows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.120
and Michael ends up stabbing Laurie and pushing&nbsp;
her over a balcony. When Michael looks down at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.680
her body, he sees that it’s missing. A nice&nbsp;
reversal of the ending of the original film!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.760
When Allyson arrives at Laurie’s home, the&nbsp;
three generations of Strode women team up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.200
to fight Michael, shooting him and locking&nbsp;
him up in the basement before setting the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.520
entire house ablaze. As Karen and Allyson&nbsp;
rush a stabbed Laurie to the hospital,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.480
the Strode house continues to burn with&nbsp;
a still breathing Michael trapped inside.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.960
And that's everything that happened&nbsp;
in Halloween 1978 and 2018. Let me&nbsp;&nbsp;
