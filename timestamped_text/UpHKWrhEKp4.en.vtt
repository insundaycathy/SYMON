This is a spoiler content video

00:00:08.304 --> 00:00:10.684
Enjoy the video and let's start the story

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:20.345
The movie begins with a scene of making love between a wife and her mistress.

00:00:20.345 --> 00:00:23.711
After being satisfied, the woman went home and met her husband,

00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:27.994
the woman was named Emily, and her husband was named Steven

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:34.132
they are getting ready to attend a party, Emily doesn't seem to like her husband, because she doesn't love him.

00:00:34.132 --> 00:00:38.305
when they arrived at the party, they were immediately greeted by important people.

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:42.731
in the party, Emily also saw her mistress named, David.

00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:45.136
then she signaled that her husband was here.

00:00:45.136 --> 00:00:49.506
when her husband was busy talking. Emily went to see David and going to kiss him.

00:00:49.506 --> 00:00:52.127
Suddenly, Steven came and surprised them.

00:00:52.127 --> 00:00:56.072
Emily who was shocked, immediately introduced David to her husband.

00:00:56.072 --> 00:01:00.575
Emily said David was a talented painter who had studied art at a well-known faculty.

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:06.004
So Steven was interested and asked for David's phone number, maybe he is interested to buy some paintings.

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:09.995
The next day, Emily came to visit David's house, and they sleep together again.

00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:16.639
On the other hand, Steven got into a problem where his stock investment decreased which made his company lose a lot.

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:23.152
back to Emily, when She is making love suddenly Steven called David, they panicked and apparently Steven want to meet with David.

00:01:23.152 --> 00:01:28.160
When David already met Steven at the bar, he accidentally dropped a white envelope on his chair,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.810
so what's in the envelope? we don't know yet.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.157
Then David also brought Steven to his house which looked shabby and uninhabitable.

00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:38.854
Steven saw David's painting, and immediately insulted him.

00:01:38.854 --> 00:01:48.411
David was confused about why Steven insulted his painting, even Steven bluntly said that David's house was really ugly because it didn't have a chair

00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:52.160
In the house, There is also Emily's wedding ring which he forgot

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.599
so Steven is even more sure about his wife's infidelity

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:59.406
Steven also said that he was jealous of David's affair with his wife

00:01:59.406 --> 00:02:02.386
David replied by saying that he loved Emily

00:02:02.386 --> 00:02:04.448
This made Steven even more angry

00:02:04.448 --> 00:02:06.429
and revealed all David's secrets

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:13.552
Which is David lied that he was an art graduate at a well-known faculty it turned out that his painting skills he got while in prison

00:02:13.552 --> 00:02:18.536
David also cheated on a widow in San Francisco and currently david is still a fugitive

00:02:18.536 --> 00:02:24.162
Steven also offered David 500,000 dollar on the condition that David had to kill Emily

00:02:24.162 --> 00:02:27.621
at first David refused but he was threatened with reporting,

00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:32.102
because David did not want to go back to prison he accepted the offer,

00:02:32.102 --> 00:02:37.604
then Steven also told all his plans so David could easily enter his house to kill emily

00:02:37.604 --> 00:02:41.531
So here the question arises why does Steven want to kill his wife?

00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:48.031
Then steven returned home and entered the white envelope which turned out to contain a photo of david and emily's affair,

00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:50.407
the letter was made as if it was sent by david

00:02:50.407 --> 00:02:53.421
on the other hand, Emily meets her friend at a bar

00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:57.763
she says that she doesn't love steven so she wants a divorce and tells her affair

00:02:57.763 --> 00:03:03.067
And Here Emily realized that her wedding ring was left at David's house

00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:11.557
When Emily came home Steven said that he had come to David's house and made a deal with him. Emily was confused and curious about the deal

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:18.082
The next day, Emily immediately called David, and ask him about the deal, but David didn't want to tell her.

00:03:18.082 --> 00:03:21.994
David instead changed the topic by taking Emily to lunch the next day

00:03:21.994 --> 00:03:27.118
After that, David went to Steven's house which looks luxurious with expensive things.

00:03:27.118 --> 00:03:33.449
Steven explains his plan to kill Emily, from the entrance, until how to unlock the house.

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:40.411
At first, David wasn't sure that the plan would work, but Steven convinced David by paying him 100,000 dollar first,

00:03:40.411 --> 00:03:44.565
if David succeeded, the 400,000 dollar would also belong to David,

00:03:44.565 --> 00:03:47.259
David was immediately excited to see that much money.

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:51.084
The next day, when Emily wanted to keep her lunch appointment with David

00:03:51.084 --> 00:03:56.634
Suddenly, he met Steven on the street and immediately invited him to lunch too.

00:03:56.634 --> 00:04:01.354
After lunch, David saw Emily with his husband, whereas David was waiting for her,

00:04:01.354 --> 00:04:05.059
David became jealous and destroyed Emily's face painting.

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:10.663
Suddenly, Emily called and said, that she wanted to tell Steven about her affair.

00:04:10.663 --> 00:04:14.723
When she came home from work, Emily put the key in the place, as usual,

00:04:14.723 --> 00:04:19.558
then she approached Steven to ask him to talk, Emily wanted to be honest,

00:04:19.558 --> 00:04:24.185
but Steven refused on the grounds, that he was going to play cards with his business friend.

00:04:24.185 --> 00:04:32.150
Emily went into the room, and Steven took the key that Emily had placed earlier, and keep it under the pipe so that later David can enter.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.025
Steven also said goodbye to Emily, as if his wife would die by saying goodbye.

00:04:38.025 --> 00:04:42.304
When Steven leaves the house, a masked man enters his house.

00:04:42.304 --> 00:04:49.172
While Emily was getting ready to take a shower, then the masked man took the key and went straight into the house.

00:04:49.172 --> 00:04:52.811
On the other hand, Steven was waiting for 9 o'clock.

00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:56.844
at exactly 9 o'clock, he made an automatic call to his house

00:04:56.844 --> 00:05:04.045
Emily who heard the phone keep ringing went to pick it up, and suddenly the masked man attacked her.

00:05:04.045 --> 00:05:08.400
Emily was strangled almost to death, she tried to fight but failed.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.365
Emily didn't want to give up so easily, and immediately took the meat thermometer, then stabbed the masked man's neck.

00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:19.847
Emily who was shocked because she had killed someone, finally fainted.

00:05:19.847 --> 00:05:24.282
Steven thinks that Emily already dead, so he resumed his card game.

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:29.483
When Steven came home, he was shocked to see a lot of blood, and Emily was still alive.

00:05:29.483 --> 00:05:36.321
Steven immediately saw the body in the kitchen, and used gloves then took the key in the man's pocket, and put it back into Emily's key.

00:05:36.321 --> 00:05:39.387
after that, the police came, and asked Emily.

00:05:39.387 --> 00:05:43.125
Emily said she only took calls, then someone was coming.

00:05:43.125 --> 00:05:48.875
Later, the detective asked Steven a question, because the detective saw Steven's footprints near the body.

00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:52.355
Steven answered nervously, and the detective suspected him.

00:05:52.355 --> 00:05:57.013
When the mask was opened, it turned out that it wasn't David, but someone else.

00:05:57.013 --> 00:05:58.918
Steven was very surprised

00:05:58.918 --> 00:06:02.866
then Steven hugs Emily, so the police don't suspect him.

00:06:02.866 --> 00:06:09.208
when the black bag is brought out David looks sad because he thinks Emily is dead

00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:13.410
because of the trauma emily temporarily wants to stay at her mother's house

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.228
steven told emily to sleep

00:06:16.228 --> 00:06:19.192
after that, emily instead called david who was frustrated,

00:06:19.192 --> 00:06:25.544
david didn't have time to pick it up and instantly david was excited again after knowing emily was still alive,

00:06:25.544 --> 00:06:28.816
when re-calling it was steven who picked it up

00:06:28.816 --> 00:06:31.398
Then David and Steven are meeting somewhere

00:06:31.398 --> 00:06:37.670
Steven felt that David was playing joke with him, because David hired someone to kill Emily , why not himself?

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.338
David asks what is the next plan, but Steven doesn't want to tell his plan

00:06:42.338 --> 00:06:48.792
Emily, who was feeling better, came back to her house, but it turned out that she couldn't enter because her house key didn't match,

00:06:48.792 --> 00:06:54.052
so she asked the receptionist for a spare key, and she asked whether Steven had changed her house key?

00:06:54.052 --> 00:06:56.833
the receptionist said? NO.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.556
Emily came in and saw her house,

00:06:59.556 --> 00:07:02.972
suddenly Steven came, which made Emily very surprised

00:07:02.972 --> 00:07:06.636
then Emily said, that she no longer wanted to live with Steven

00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:09.924
Now, Emily also lives at her friend's house,

00:07:09.924 --> 00:07:14.689
In the house, they discuss about her marriage, So emily is a woman who is very rich,

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:20.610
She has a wealth of 100 million dollars, which is if emily dies then her wealth will be inherited by her husband,

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.170
But Emily's husband is also rich, so Emily doesn't suspect her husband,

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:31.678
The next day, Emily is told that her husband is in danger of going bankrupt, because of his messy stock investment,

00:07:31.678 --> 00:07:36.078
Now, Emily becomes suspicious that her husband is the one who wants to kill her,

00:07:36.078 --> 00:07:41.152
He also went to the detective who took care of the case, and got the address of the masked man,

00:07:41.152 --> 00:07:44.601
Emily immediately rushed to the masked man's apartment,

00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:49.754
In the apartment, Emily was very surprised because the key she had, could open the door of the apartment,

00:07:49.754 --> 00:07:55.037
so it turned out that the key that Steven took that night, it was the key from the masked man

00:07:55.037 --> 00:08:00.470
on the other hand, David meets with Steven and asks for the remaining 400,000 dollar,

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.684
otherwise he will distribute the sound recording of Emily's assassination plot,

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:09.451
Well, to be safe, Steven agree to give the remaining 400,000 dollars

00:08:09.451 --> 00:08:14.183
when steven and emily met he also asked why the killer's key was in my lock string?

00:08:14.183 --> 00:08:17.253
Steven immediately gave a photo of her affair.

00:08:17.253 --> 00:08:20.476
Steven also lied and made up a story for Emily.

00:08:20.476 --> 00:08:24.279
He said that David asked him for money to break his relationship with Emily.

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:27.325
Steven also said that David lied about himself,

00:08:27.325 --> 00:08:31.354
David is a fugitive from the police and just wants to take Emily's property

00:08:31.354 --> 00:08:36.514
Hearing that, Emily regretted and apologized to Steven, steven is really cunning

00:08:36.514 --> 00:08:43.593
Then steven went to take the 400,000 dollars to David's house but there David only left a note and Emily's ring

00:08:43.593 --> 00:08:45.824
The note then took Steven to a place

00:08:45.824 --> 00:08:49.557
When meeting Steven, he gave him the 400,000 dollars

00:08:49.557 --> 00:08:54.018
When Steven meets with David, he gave him the 400,000 dollars to david

00:08:54.018 --> 00:08:57.324
David immediately ran away as far as possible by train,

00:08:57.324 --> 00:08:59.834
but it turned out that steven was really sneaky,

00:08:59.834 --> 00:09:02.936
he already knew that david booked a ticket to canada,

00:09:02.936 --> 00:09:07.019
so steven suddenly appeared and killed david and then took the money back

00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:11.819
he also found that david had sent a voice recording his assassination plan to Emily

00:09:11.819 --> 00:09:15.199
Steven was very panicked and rushed home

00:09:15.199 --> 00:09:17.634
and luckily Emily had not had time to check the mail,

00:09:17.634 --> 00:09:23.328
finally, Steven took the tape and put it in the safe along with the 400,000 dollars.

00:09:23.328 --> 00:09:29.530
Emily also realized that steven was already home, Now, steven felt very relieved

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.173
When Steven went to the bathroom, Emily saw the bag that should have been given to David

00:09:34.173 --> 00:09:39.458
Emily also told steven that she wanted to change the house key because she couldn't find the key

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:42.187
Steven was surprised by what Emily said,

00:09:42.187 --> 00:09:46.324
then Steven took the key in the pipe and intended to return the key again

00:09:46.324 --> 00:09:48.597
but Steven was caught and Emily

00:09:48.597 --> 00:09:51.588
then Emily immediately played Steven's voice recording

00:09:51.588 --> 00:09:55.640
so now it was revealed that Steven had planned to kill Emily

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.644
Emily tried to run away but Steven blocked it

00:09:58.644 --> 00:10:01.093
Steven was annoyed then slammed Emily

00:10:01.093 --> 00:10:02.874
and until finally, Steven died

00:10:02.874 --> 00:10:04.406
because he was shot by Emily,

00:10:04.406 --> 00:10:07.554
so emily got the gun and the tape from steven's safe box

00:10:07.554 --> 00:10:13.772
when the detective comes Emily plays the tape, then explains what happened during the fight with steven,

00:10:13.772 --> 00:10:16.502
the detective says "What else can you do?"

00:10:16.502 --> 00:10:19.350
which means emily is not guilty of this murder

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.536
and the movie is

00:10:20.536 --> 00:10:21.941
