Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.259
Today I'm going to explain a drama, horror,
mystery, and thriller film called “The Unborn."

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:07.670
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.670
Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.420
&nbsp;
On her daily jog during a chilly day, Casey

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.390
Beldon, a young woman in her twenties, notices
a glove lying on the road.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.950
From behind, she notices a young boy with
bright blue eyes staring blankly at her, with

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.460
one glove missing from him.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.000
The boy suddenly becomes a masked dog, which
Casey follows to the woods.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.600
It leads her to a pile of dried leaves, where
the mask lies, so she digs to find out what

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.119
lies below and sees a fragile fetus who opens
its bright blue eyes.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.670
Casey wakes up and realizes that the incident
is only a dream, so she consults her best

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.929
friend, Romy, who is very superstitious and
spiritual.

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:43.390
According to Romy, dreaming of a baby is a
symbol of change and renewal, while dreaming

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.839
of a dog is weird since dogs, in mythology,
are often seen as messengers of the dead.

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.579
However, Casey does not seem bothered by this
and laughs the topic off.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.100
During the night, she is on babysitting duty
for the Newton family’s young boys.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.219
She hears footsteps from upstairs and hears
someone from the baby monitor saying, “look

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.539
in the mirror; some people are doorways.”

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.250
Alarmed by this, she calls for the kids and
heads upstairs to check upon them.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.740
She sees Matty, the older boy, showing his
baby brother its reflection with a mirror

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.600
while whispering phrases to him.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.180
When Casey calls Matty’s attention and demands
him to stop, he attacks her by smashing the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.080
mirror directly on her head before telling
her, “Jumby wants to be born now.”&nbsp;

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.920
&nbsp;
The parents eventually arrive at the house,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.860
and Casey tells them about the incident.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.680
The mother, Gail, insists on having Casey
checked up at the hospital, but she says that

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.909
everything is fine.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.619
Before leaving, she sees Matty still staring
intently from upstairs, so she hurriedly leaves.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.840
Outside, she stumbles upon the same glove
that she dreamt about, which weirds her out.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.400
When she arrives home, she greets her dad,
Gordon, and says goodnight after her long

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.400
day.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.499
After getting ready for bed, she turns off
her bathroom lights and hears noises coming

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:47.020
from the medicine cabinet.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.360
She turns the lights on and opens it, but
there is nothing there, so she disregards

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.360
it.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.539
While Casey sleeps, the knocking noises from
the medicine cabinet continue as if something

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.219
is on the other side.

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.270
&nbsp;
The following day, Casey makes her breakfast,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.049
and a giant insect comes out of the egg she
cracks, putting her in a state of shock.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.979
As she rinses off the skillet, she sees Matty,
the boy she babysat, from their kitchen window

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.159
just standing still.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.769
Already disturbed by the reoccurring sight
of the little boy, she tells Romy, her boyfriend,

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.129
Mark, and their other friend Lisa about it.

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.250
Mark defends the kid by saying that Matty
doesn’t know what he is doing, while Romy

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.140
warns Casey that showing an infant a mirror
is bad luck.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.269
Myths say that newborns aren’t supposed
to see their reflection until they are a year

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.290
old, which means that they will die soon.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.939
Mark is unconvinced and makes a joke out of
it.&nbsp;

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.659
&nbsp;
While she attends class, Casey gets fazed

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.769
again and starts seeing the phrase “Jumby
wants to be born now” on the blackboard

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.200
and in her notebook.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.569
She tries to focus and snap out of her hallucinations,
but she sees the same insect land on her hand,

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.319
causing her to walk out of class.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.410
She takes a shower to help clear her mind,
but she couldn’t help but be bothered by

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.900
what is happening around her.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.830
Shortly after, Romy has a conversation with
Casey in the locker, but she realizes that

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.650
her eyes are changing in color.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.400
Feeling alarmed, Casey seeks a doctor who
tells her that the condition is heterochromia,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.780
meaning one iris is a different color than
the other.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.980
He explains that it is usually congenital.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.450
It may occur after blunt trauma or an indication
of malignant melanoma.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.480
To be sure, the doctor takes pictures of her
eyes and inserts speculums to keep her eyelids

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.480
open.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.610
On their way out, Casey thanks Mark for accompanying
her and says that he could stay the night

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.650
at her place.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.700
In the busy streets, she sees the pale blue-eyed
boy from her dream once again, but he disappears

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.450
in a split second, leaving her confused.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.010
&nbsp;
That night, both of them cuddle in bed while

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.780
talking about life, death, and the afterlife.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.670
The topic shifts to Casey’s deceased mother,
Janet, whom she last saw in a mental institution

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.799
as a kid.

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.670
She remembers seeing her mother, who also
had heterochromia, in such a sad state, looking

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.370
like she had given up already.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.579
To this day, Casey still holds a grudge against
her mother for leaving her and her father.

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.540
Before going to bed, Casey checks her eye
condition in the mirror and hears the knocking

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.599
sounds from the medicine once again.

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.459
She checks, but again, nothing is there, so
she heads back outside.

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.790
For the second time, she hears noises and
returns to the medicine cabinet, where she

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.659
opens it and sees the pale boy.

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.000
Her screams alarm Mark, who comes to find
her in the bathroom frightened.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.469
To avoid any further encounters, Casey takes
down her medicine cabinet permanently.&nbsp;

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:04.030
&nbsp;
On one of her routine runs, Casey hears a

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.170
commotion in the neighborhood, specifically
in the Newton home.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.989
Curiously, she asks another neighbor about
it, to which she replies that the baby stopped

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:11.989
breathing.

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.190
She sees the devastated Gail reach out to
her deceased baby, who is being carried out

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.190
on a cart.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.810
Weirdly enough, she also sees Matty sitting
by the window, either clueless or unaffected

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.450
by the whole situation.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.980
Back at the doctor’s office, her doctor
asks if she has a twin, to which she replies

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.650
that she is an only child.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.920
If she had, it would explain why her eye colors
are different because of genetic mosaicism.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.350
When dealing with twins, the placentas become
fused, and a certain amount of blood would

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.250
be exchanged back and forth, causing the different
pigmentation in her iris as a result of a

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.730
foreign genetic strand.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.300
However, the doctor assures her that her eyes
are healthy, but she could consider seeing

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.300
a genetic counselor.&nbsp;

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.880
&nbsp;
Troubled by her thoughts, Casey seeks answers

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.270
from her father right away while he is at
work.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.510
She immediately asks if she has a twin, to
which he replies that she was supposed to

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.010
have a twin brother, but sadly he died while
still in the womb because Casey’s umbilical

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.610
cord suffocated him.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.970
Taken aback by this, she asks him if it was
the reason for their mother taking her own

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.940
life, but he strongly denies her claim.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.680
Gordon tells Casey that although the pregnancy
was too early for the twins to have names,

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.240
they did give nicknames, with Casey's twin
brother being Jumby.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.310
Shocked to hear this, she simply breaks into
tears and heads home, where she scours through

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.750
family memoirs.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.470
She finds a film reel and a newspaper article
about war survivors with the name Sofi Kozma

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.580
underlined.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.911
She also sees a picture of her pregnant mother
looking at her reflection in the mirror, with

00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:24.640
the boy just behind her.&nbsp;

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.580
&nbsp;
To learn more about her twin and her mother,

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.450
Casey and Romy go to a nursing home to visit
Sofi Kozma.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.990
From the hallways, they are greeted by Sofi
herself, who seems to be a very welcoming

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.990
woman.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.810
In her room, Casey notices a spot in the wall
where it used to have a mirror, and Sofi says

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.210
that she had it removed because it bothers
her.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.690
Without further discussions, Sofi immediately
asks Casey if she had a twin as she senses

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.240
it in others because she used to have one
herself.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.690
When Casey hands the old lady the article,
she sees the same red bracelet she saw on

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.490
her mother the day she passed.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.500
Casey also asks Sofi if she knows her mother
by any chance, but Sofi says she doesn’t.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.020
To be sure, Casey shows her the picture she
retrieved from her home.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.350
When the old lady sees the boy in the picture,
it frightens her and orders Casey and Romy

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.630
to get out at that instant.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.770
The old lady’s behavior puzzles the two
girls, and they discuss the incident in the

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:08.990
parking lot.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.080
Romy tries to calm Casey, who is highly paranoid
about Sofi hiding something from her.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.280
She reveals that since the night she babysat
the Newtons, she has been seeing things and

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.430
thinks that she is being haunted by someone
who was never born.&nbsp;

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.990
&nbsp;
With the help of Mark, they use a projector

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.400
to play the film she retrieved from her mother's
things and examine its contents.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.300
Both of them see nothing strange about the
film except for the fact that the place shown

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.960
is the hospital where Casey’s mother took
her own life.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.720
To forget all about it for a while, they decide
to go to a club and party the night away.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.330
However, Casey is still unable to escape her
visions and sees the boy’s face among the

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.800
people in the club.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.180
Still fazed, she goes to the bathroom to freshen
up but ends up throwing up in the toilet where

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.610
she sees a vandal of an eye.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.660
It grabs her attention, making her look&nbsp;
through it when insects and blood pour out.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.480
She quickly runs outside, but the door is
locked, and the insects and blood start appearing

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.240
from the bathroom sink, and fingers start
coming out from the walls, rendering the situation

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.820
in complete chaos.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.560
Casey freaks out, and from one of the bathroom
stalls, her mother appears, reaching out for

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.120
her while calling her name.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.650
Her friends come to her rescue and comfort
her until she calms down.&nbsp;

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.450
&nbsp;
After the disastrous night, Casey dials Romy

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.950
through a video call to ask her for some advice.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.940
She tells her best friend that she saw her
mother and expresses her worries about ending

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.510
up in the same fate as her.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.620
The superstitious Romy instructs her to put
a pair of scissors under her pillow with the

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.060
two points open.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.120
She learned this from her grandmother to keep
evil spirits away.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.230
Desperate for some peace of mind, Casey grabs
a pair of scissors and puts them under her

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.390
bed, as instructed by Romy.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.080
This is proven ineffective as Casey sees herself
floating from the ceiling, watching herself

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.080
sleep.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.460
Deeply panicked, she sees the boy beside her
in bed, opening her stomach to put himself

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.460
in.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.070
She screams and wakes up from the nightmare
to answer a phone call from Sofi, who apologizes

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.510
for their recent meeting.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.800
On the phone, Sofi tells her to come back
to the nursing home and reveals that she is

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.680
actually Casey’s grandmother.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.230
Still dark out, Casey makes her way to the
nursing home and meets with her grandmother,

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:55.880
who reveals that the boy in the reflection
is her twin brother, Barto, who died in 1944.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.640
With a collection of pictures, she recalls
the time that they were both captives of war.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.911
The military thought that examining twins
could unravel the mysteries of genetics, so

00:08:02.911 --> 00:08:06.090
they conducted numerous experiments on the
twins they have captured.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.620
Among the cruel experiments they made was
fabricating blue eyes from brown through painful

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.720
eye injections.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.580
The experiments caused blindness, and even
worse, death—a fate that Barto ended up

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.580
in.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.030
However, Barto arose from the dead after two
days, but she claims that it was not really

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.030
him.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.940
A doorway has been opened, and something else
inhabited his boy—a dybbuk.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.830
It is a dead person’s soul that is barred
from entering heaven, causing it to endlessly

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.310
wander around the world of the living and
the dead, trying to find a new body.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.629
Since twins are mirrored images of each other,
they are highly considered as doorways between

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:35.009
the different worlds.

00:08:35.009 --> 00:08:38.479
According to Sofi, she killed the spirit that
took over her brother, but it is endlessly

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:40.699
trying to come back into her life since then.

00:08:40.699 --> 00:08:44.259
The entity tried to take hold of Casey’s
unborn twin, and when it failed to have him,

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:45.870
it turned its gaze to Casey.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.519
Ever since Casey was born, the spirit has
been circling her life, waiting for the perfect

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:51.000
moment to enter.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.230
Desperate to get rid of it, Casey asks Sofi
how, and her grandmother talks about a Book

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.990
of Mirrors, a compilation of rites of exorcism,
and refers Casey to a rabbi named Josef Sendak,

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.790
who could be of great help.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.670
&nbsp;
Once Casey gets a hold of a copy of the book,

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:07.389
she visits Rabbi Sendak and asks him if he
could read the book written in Hebrew.

00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:11.709
He explains that the book is derived from
the Kabbalah, which is a form of Jewish mysticism.

00:09:11.709 --> 00:09:15.210
Moments later, Casey informs him that she
needs an exorcism immediately performed on

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.210
her.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.990
He brushes the topic away by saying that spirits
aren’t real.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.449
He also adds that what she is asking is beyond
his expertise as he has never performed an

00:09:22.449 --> 00:09:24.310
exorcism in his career.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.420
She desperately asks the rabbi to help her
as her life depends on it, but he doesn’t

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.420
promise her anything.&nbsp;

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.100
&nbsp;
As per Sofi’s advice, Casey keeps the protective

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.320
necklace given to her, gets rid of all the
mirrors in their home, and puts up chimes

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.040
to indicate if a spirit is near.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.750
Meanwhile, Romy drives to meet at Casey's
house when she runs over Matty, who is on

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.769
his bike.

00:09:40.769 --> 00:09:44.630
In a state of panic, she gets out of her car
to the boy, but to her surprise, Matty stands

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.689
up as if he hadn't been hit by a car.

00:09:46.689 --> 00:09:49.621
He then tells Romy in a very menacing way:
”He doesn't like you helping her" before

00:09:49.621 --> 00:09:52.980
warning her that if she keeps being around
Casey, then he will kill her.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.670
As Romy arrives at Casey’s house, she explains
what happened and notices that her eyes worsen

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.670
by the day.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:01.200
Concerned, she asks Casey if she is okay and
that she will always stay beside her as her

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.390
best friend.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:06.160
Later that night, Casey finds herself in front
of her mother, but she transforms into something

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.550
far from natural.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.079
She realizes that it is just a dream and hears
the chimes from downstairs, signaling that

00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:12.079
a spirit is near.&nbsp;

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:14.560
&nbsp;
At the same time in the nursing home, Sofi

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.980
cannot sleep after hearing wind chimes and
tries to turn on the lamp on her bedside,

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.329
but to no avail.

00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:23.140
She makes her way downstairs with a flashlight
and hears wailing noises from a distance.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.020
In the dark hallway, she notices Eli, the
paralyzed man who also resides in the nursing

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.699
home, is awake.

00:10:28.699 --> 00:10:32.699
Not paying much mind to him, she goes downstairs
and sees Eli below the staircase, crawling

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:34.769
on all fours as if he is possessed.

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:38.759
His head eerily turns around his neck, and
he chases her endlessly down flights of stairs.

00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:43.269
Struggling to move, she finds a closet where
she could hide, but behind her, the boy appears,

00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:44.519
making her scream out of fear.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:48.240
At daybreak, Casey visits the nursing home
but senses that something is amiss by the

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.130
number of authorities present.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:54.290
Making her way upstairs, she eventually sees
her grandmother lying lifeless on the floor.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.990
Another patient hands her a letter, which
should be given to Casey if something might

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.190
happen to her.&nbsp;

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:02.230
In the letter, her grandmother tells her that
Casey's mother lost and gave in to the dybbuk.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.329
She also writes that it feeds on fear and
will isolate her from her friends and family.&nbsp;

00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:08.160
&nbsp;
Meanwhile, at the rabbi’s office, the power

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.670
shuts down for unknown reasons, so he grabs
a flashlight and makes his way down the stairs.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.899
At the altar, he sees a growling dog with
its head upside down.

00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:20.399
He bravely shouts at it to go away from the
place, and in a matter of seconds, it disappears.

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:24.129
On the video call, Casey and Romy talk about
how Casey should not worry about the spirit

00:11:24.129 --> 00:11:26.499
and that her grandmother’s death may be
natural.

00:11:26.499 --> 00:11:29.400
Casey says it isn’t and that the spirit
will hurt everyone she loves, and they will

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.079
get her when she is helpless.

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:34.410
Romy hears her doorbell ring and leaves her
room to check despite Casey’s protests not

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:35.569
to answer it.

00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:39.121
While Romy is not in her room, she catches
a glimpse of the boy in Romy's mirror, so

00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:42.819
she calls Mark and tells him to meet her at
Romy's house without any explanation.

00:11:42.819 --> 00:11:46.279
The lights go out at Romy’s house as well,
and when she checks the front door, Matty

00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:48.410
stands while saying, “the doorway is open.”

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.639
The little boy stabs her right after saying
the phrase, making her run upstairs while

00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:53.420
he devilishly follows her.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.899
Just as Casey and Mark break a glass door,
Matty’s face transforms into something else,

00:11:56.899 --> 00:11:59.460
and she finds Matty standing by Romy’s body.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:03.309
As a reflex, Mark pulls the kid away, grabs
the knife from him, and is about to attack

00:12:03.309 --> 00:12:07.120
the boy when Casey stops him because the spirit
has transferred to Romy’s body.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.209
She twitches around and disfigures her body
before authorities arrive at the scene.&nbsp;

00:12:10.209 --> 00:12:13.100
&nbsp;
The following day, Rabbi Sendak brings Mark

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.490
and Casey to a basketball court where they
are introduced to coach Arthur Wyndham, who

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.430
is also a priest that could help them.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:23.210
To perform the exorcism, the venue should
be at a place that is negative to Casey, so

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.839
she opts to be at the mental institution where
her mother lived her remaining days.

00:12:26.839 --> 00:12:30.189
Other volunteers come along who are willing
to help as the specific exorcism would require

00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:31.420
ten people.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.089
All of them get informed about the methods
and the equipment that they will use during

00:12:34.089 --> 00:12:35.329
the procedure.

00:12:35.329 --> 00:12:38.430
She lays down in the middle of the now-sacred
circle while the others utter the biblical

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.490
phrases.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.870
Moments later, strong winds storm the entire
room while the participants start getting

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.959
possessed right before dying on the spot.

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:47.779
Casey moves frantically and gets visions of
all the traumatic incidents that occurred

00:12:47.779 --> 00:12:50.860
during the past days, all while the boy is
standing beside her.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.350
The whole room gets trashed in the boy’s
presence, so Mark decides to run away with

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.069
Casey, who is in the most danger.

00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:59.629
In the middle of the chaos, the boy approaches
Father Arthur and decides to take over his

00:12:59.629 --> 00:13:00.629
body.

00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:03.660
The priest chases the couple around the dim
hallways of the asylum, but they manage to

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.260
hide in a small space.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.399
Unfortunately, the priest grabs Mark from
the other side of the wall, and the two of

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:11.120
them fight, resulting in Mark being able to
bring him down.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.149
A bit relieved, she realizes that the spirit
has transferred to Mark’s body, so she runs

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:18.740
away from him, but he gets a hold of her and
strangles her against the wall.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.680
Casey uses the protective necklace from Sofi
to stab Mark’s neck, and he drops her.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.540
For rescue, the rabbi comes in and continues
to read rites from the book along with Casey.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.160
Mark’s body twitches around as the spirit
is slowly defeated, making him blast back

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.910
to the first floor of the building.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:35.250
The sight of it shatters Casey, and she comes
beside him as he bids his final goodbye.&nbsp;

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.040
&nbsp;
Days have passed, and the chaos has subsided

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.420
for a while.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.420
Noticing some symptoms, Casey takes a pregnancy
test and consults a doctor, finding out that

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:56.209
she is pregnant with twins, and once again
feels a sense of deja vu.&nbsp;

00:13:56.209 --> 00:14:02.209
&nbsp;
