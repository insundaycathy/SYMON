00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
Hello everyone, this is Mr. Brain Junkie&nbsp;
here! And today we'll be talking about an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.200
adventure fantasy film called Mojin, The Worm&nbsp;
Valley! Be ready for some spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.920
thousands of years ago, a vengeful goddess created&nbsp;
a terrifying punishment for those who defied her.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.480
A curse mark was placed on the people's shoulders,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.720
causing them to die horrifically and&nbsp;
prematurely before they reach the age of 40.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.720
The most heinous part of this curse is&nbsp;
that it passes down through generations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.600
dooming all the children to&nbsp;
the same fate as their parents.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.800
For this reason,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.840
those who are cursed have been looking for two&nbsp;
items, the dragon orb and the celestial bone.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.120
The legends states that only by&nbsp;
combining these two artifacts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.880
can the people lift the curse that was&nbsp;
placed on them through their ancestors.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.360
Bay is one of the people who's afflicted by&nbsp;
this curse, and he successfully found the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.640
celestial bone inside a tomb after going through&nbsp;
numerous monsters that killed most of his team.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.640
His friend, Professor Sun has decoded&nbsp;
most of the riddles on the bone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.680
and found out the location of the dragon orb,&nbsp;
which is located inside the dragon mountain.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.000
However, the magical item doesn't tell&nbsp;
them the dangers of it's location,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.160
nor how the combination of these two&nbsp;
artifacts are able to nullify the curse.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.000
One of Bay's friend, Shirley, has&nbsp;
come back bearing some good news,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.120
as she's made contact with a local family who&nbsp;
knows the secret pathway into the mountain itself.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.440
The man quickly recruits his old teammates&nbsp;
consisting of a large man named Kai&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.360
and his friend Yuke, along side&nbsp;
a woman who calls herself Ling.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.960
It turns out that all three of them are&nbsp;
cursed just like the main character,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.760
and they were also the survivors who previously&nbsp;
took the Celestial bone away from it's tomb.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.000
They travel across the vast country side,&nbsp;
eventually arriving at a house that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.240
right below the mountain, where a woman&nbsp;
appears and welcomes the group inside.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.040
She offers them to stay the&nbsp;
night like previously agreed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.240
but Bay wants to make sure that&nbsp;
there's a way into the mountains.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.240
She tells the man that there's only one&nbsp;
path which goes through a dangerous river,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.960
and her daughter Kong can&nbsp;
take them there tomorrow.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.200
At night, the group sees numerous&nbsp;
insects which appears to be fireflies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.920
and quickly run outside to enjoy the rare sight.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.280
Kai tries to grab onto one of the insects, but&nbsp;
it bursts into flames and burns the man's hand.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.680
Kong explains that these are not fireflies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.440
as they create miniature explosions&nbsp;
when their bodies touch other animals.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.600
The woman takes out a container where she&nbsp;
managed to capture one of their queens.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.760
Kong explains that the flies would be&nbsp;
attracted to the odor that the queen produces,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.640
and swarms at the location&nbsp;
where their leader has died.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.520
She demonstrate this by opening the jar, causing&nbsp;
the insects to follow them where ever they go.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.320
The next day, the group heads towards the&nbsp;
mountain by travelling through perilous pathways,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.240
eventually arriving beside a lake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.120
where Kong shows them the entrance&nbsp;
that they were looking for.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.320
As the team is heading towards&nbsp;
the mountain by using the boats,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.520
Kong warns them to be careful, as there are rumors&nbsp;
of monstrous creatures luring inside the lands.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.240
The group makes it into the cave, and Kai&nbsp;
reveals that he took the insect queen from Kong,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.000
trying to impress the girl that he likes.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.640
At the same time, Yuke notices a strange&nbsp;
fish inside the river and tries to touch it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.200
but the animal rushes towards the man and bites&nbsp;
him on the finger, leaving blood in the water.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.640
Very soon, hundreds of man eating&nbsp;
fish charges towards the group,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.720
and begins jumping out from the water,&nbsp;
trying to devour everything in sight.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.800
They try to defend their lives and fight&nbsp;
back by using their weapons, but the animals'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.120
numbers are too great, and Kai gets knocked&nbsp;
into the river while trying to save Ling.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.800
The fishes quickly notice the man's&nbsp;
presence and swarms right behind him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.360
while Kai paddles desperately towards the boat.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.920
Luckily, the man is able to climb back&nbsp;
onto safety before the fishes devour him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.840
as the team tries their best to kill the&nbsp;
vicious creatures that follow behind.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.560
Eventually, the group comes&nbsp;
to an area where countless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.520
mummified bodies are hanging&nbsp;
on the ceiling of the cave,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.080
and they all begin to drop into the water&nbsp;
after being disrupted by the people's presence.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.960
Strangely, once the bodies have entered the river,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.440
thousands of little creature begin to emerge&nbsp;
from carcasses and fly towards the group.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.480
The organisms attack the team&nbsp;
and bites them furiously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.560
while the people are having a very difficult&nbsp;
time trying to defend against the swarm.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.560
With no other choice, the professor&nbsp;
gives the team multiple flame throwers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.760
allowing them to more effectively&nbsp;
deal with the enemy's numbers.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.080
They are able to hold back the flying parasites as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.960
they barbeque the creatures and&nbsp;
feed them to man eating fishes.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.400
However, the fuel in their&nbsp;
weapons begin to run out quickly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.400
and they are still haven't reached the exit.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.880
Bay decides to improvise and throws one of their&nbsp;
bombs into the swarm, while Shirley shoots a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.160
flame arrow and hits the explosive, creating&nbsp;
large explosions that knock away the parasites.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.240
The shockwave pushes their boats into different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.240
directions, splitting the groups into&nbsp;
separate areas with alarming speed.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.160
The professor's boat breaks into pieces&nbsp;
while the team drops into the water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.000
but Bay's comrades are rushed out from&nbsp;
the caves and thrown into a waterfall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.400
where they drop down into the rivers below.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.400
Luckily, the three are able to recover&nbsp;
from the fall and swims towards land,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.800
where they continue forward into the unknown.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.960
At the same time, the professor and his&nbsp;
team have also made it out from the cave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.920
but sees the terrifying sight where numerous&nbsp;
bodies are mummified and kept in large containers.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.440
The professor tires to contact&nbsp;
Bay by using the radio system,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.280
but all the gadgets are not functioning&nbsp;
after being submerged inside the river.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.520
Bay has also found something strange&nbsp;
after venturing deeper into the forest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.640
noticing a giant footprint&nbsp;
that's clearly made recently.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.400
Suddenly, they hear a terrifying&nbsp;
roar from behind and turns around,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.760
only to see a giant lizard&nbsp;
appearing and jumping towards them.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.240
The massive creature appears to be hostile&nbsp;
in nature and displays incredible strength.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.480
It turns the attention to Shirley and&nbsp;
begins chasing the woman closely behind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.080
destroying everything in sight as&nbsp;
she tries desperately to escape.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.640
The monster eventually forces the girl inside&nbsp;
a tree, and she begins shooting arrow at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.040
creature, but the attacks are useless as&nbsp;
they fail to penetrate the lizard's skin.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.000
She's saved when Bay jumps onto the monster from&nbsp;
behind and tries to stab it using his knife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.520
giving the woman a chance to run and&nbsp;
telling her to find the professor.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.440
The giant lizard quickly throws Bay&nbsp;
off it's back using tremendous force,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.200
and begins charging at the man.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.840
Meanwhile, the professor's&nbsp;
group is also attacked by a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.960
similar creature as it chases&nbsp;
them with the intent to kill.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.600
The old man quickly falls behind from his team,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.520
as he clearly spent too much time on&nbsp;
computers and not enough on cardio.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.640
Luckily, before the creature&nbsp;
can devour the professor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.000
an arrow is shot towards the monster&nbsp;
and hits it right in the eye.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.720
It turns out that Shirley&nbsp;
has found her team members,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.520
and she tries to save them&nbsp;
by luring the creature away.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.480
The monster chases the woman relentlessly and&nbsp;
she eventually sees Bay running away as well.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.800
The two runs direcly at eachother and&nbsp;
jumps on a tree vine in the last moment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.320
causing the creatures to have a head on&nbsp;
collision and knock them themselves out.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.120
The teams have finally found&nbsp;
eachother, and the professor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.920
realizes that creatures may have very good&nbsp;
hearings, but their eyesight are very poor.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.480
However, their conversations are quickly&nbsp;
interrupted when the giant lizards recover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.920
and begins charging at the team,&nbsp;
forcing them to run once again.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.720
The group arrives on the edge of&nbsp;
a cliff and the main character&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.200
tells them to jump like in every hollywood movie,

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.480
but they quickly regret it after&nbsp;
realizing that instead of water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.640
they jumped into a valley of rocks.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.120
After tumbling down and surviving the fall,&nbsp;
Kai was able to dodge his girlfriend like he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.280
was dodging child support, and allows the&nbsp;
woman to face plant right on the ground.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.760
Before the man can apologize for his natural&nbsp;
instincts, they notice the growling beside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.760
them and realizes that they have landed&nbsp;
right in the nest of the giant lizards.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.840
The monsters approach them with hostility,&nbsp;
leaving them with nowhere to run,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.080
but the creatures are quickly stunned when they&nbsp;
hear the thunders from the approaching clouds.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.840
Apparently, their sensitive hearings&nbsp;
are also their greatest weakness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.320
which allows the team to escape temporarily.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.720
As they continue forwards, the professor&nbsp;
notices what appears to be a floating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.640
island in the far distance, and suggest&nbsp;
that that is where they should go to.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.040
By using the thunder's noise, the group is&nbsp;
able to run away from the giant monsters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.120
and cross the field, but their cover is&nbsp;
quickly blown when the lightning stops.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.320
With no other choice, Shirley decides to lure the&nbsp;
animals towards her by shooting arrows at them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.320
and quickly runs away from her team.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.280
She charges at the end of a&nbsp;
cliff and hides underneath,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.720
causing the lizards to fall one&nbsp;
by one due to their poor sights.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.840
The group runs towards the floating island as the&nbsp;
rest of the monsters pursue them closely behind.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.720
They run on top of a giant tree trunk which&nbsp;
appears to be the only way onto the island, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.520
the giant monsters also begin to climb on board,&nbsp;
breaking the bridge by their massive weight.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.960
Bay tells the group to run onto&nbsp;
the island while he stays behind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.760
trying to stop the lizards&nbsp;
by breaking the tree trunks.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.400
Eventually, he's able to snap the wood,&nbsp;
causing everything to collapse underneath.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.760
He runs quickly towards his friends&nbsp;
and jumps in the last moment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.840
barely escaping the fall as he watches&nbsp;
the monsters drop into the abyss.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.960
The group looks back and realizes&nbsp;
the beauty of this place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.800
as the massive island floats&nbsp;
magically on top of everything else.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.800
At night, the group is finally able&nbsp;
to relax after running the whole day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.520
and the girls decide to go for a swim inside&nbsp;
the glowing pond as they dive into the waters.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.640
The boys also join in on the&nbsp;
fun and jumps into the pond,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.040
leaving only Bay and the professor behind.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.760
After seeing the youth and happiness of his team,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.600
the old man questions why they don't&nbsp;
simply go back and accept their fate.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.800
He thinks that They should enjoy the&nbsp;
time that they have left instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.160
running into even more danger&nbsp;
and possibly getting killed.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.600
Bay tells the man that he refuses&nbsp;
to give up, and believes that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.760
can definitely remove the curse and get&nbsp;
back the life that's rightfully theirs.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.040
The next morning, the group&nbsp;
wakes up after a peaceful night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.160
and prepares for their journey&nbsp;
into the flower fields below.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.640
They cross the vast lands after climbing down&nbsp;
from the island, and the scenery eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.640
changes to something more haunting as&nbsp;
they venture deeper into the mountains.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.560
As they approach the walls, the team&nbsp;
realizes that its filled with coffins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.200
that spans all the way to the top of the mountain.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.800
Suddenly, they hear a bubbling&nbsp;
noise from behind and turns around,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.080
only to see a giant creature jump out towards&nbsp;
them, which appears to resemble a giant lobster.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.960
The professor explains that this creature is&nbsp;
immune to pain as it lack any nervous system,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.440
and it can heal very quickly inside the water.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.880
The team goes into their formation&nbsp;
and tries to wear the creature down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.600
by attacking it individually using their weapons,

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.680
but the monster does not flinch at all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.600
as it continues to retaliate and&nbsp;
knocks the people away like ragdolls.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.800
The men try to hold the giant lobster&nbsp;
in place by using their ropes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.400
but the creature's too powerful and&nbsp;
breaks away from their trap easily.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.520
The monster eventually turns the attention towards&nbsp;
Ling and charges towards her, forcing the woman to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.480
run desperately to the walls, as she tries to&nbsp;
escape the onslaught by climbing the coffins.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.080
However, the girl is not able to&nbsp;
escape from the monster's reach,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.640
and gets knocked away as&nbsp;
she falls from the height,

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.560
but Kai is able to catch her in the&nbsp;
last moment and save her from the crash.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.960
The monster charges in right away to attack&nbsp;
and Ling tries to save her boyfriend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.840
but they are both knocked away&nbsp;
and crashes into the walls.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.480
The creature turns the&nbsp;
attention towards the others,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.280
as they try to lure the&nbsp;
monster away from the injured.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.640
The team is able to trap the&nbsp;
monster by using their ropes again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.960
but this time they planted bombs in the area,

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.600
which explodes continuously, causing the&nbsp;
stone pillars to smash into the creature.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.480
Surprisingly, the monster is able to survive&nbsp;
the attack and turns away from the humans,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.520
trying to run into the water&nbsp;
where it can heal its wounds.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.520
Bay rushes inside the lake as well&nbsp;
and swims towards the fleeing animal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.000
eventually able to grab onto the creature.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.760
The man cuts himself using the blade&nbsp;
and spills the blood inside the lake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.240
attracting all the man eating fishes&nbsp;
towards the area as he rushes towards land.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.480
The little creatures are able to devour&nbsp;
the giant lobster in a matter of seconds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.200
as the main character escapes&nbsp;
the lake just in time.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.760
When the chaos is finally over, the group&nbsp;
sees Ling walking towards them slowly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.480
but quickly realizes that something is wrong as&nbsp;
the woman faints and drop towards the ground.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.760
They rush towards their teammate&nbsp;
and finds out that Ling is mortally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.960
wounded after trying to protect&nbsp;
her boyfriend from the monster.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.280
She tells Kai to not be sad and promise&nbsp;
her that he'll live on for both of them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.600
after removing the curse like they planned.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.040
The woman dies with a smile while looking a Kai&nbsp;
as the man embraces her and screams in agony.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.200
The team puts her body inside one of the&nbsp;
coffins and allows the current to take her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.920
to the entrance, but their morale are greatly&nbsp;
affected after seeing their teammate's death.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.040
The professor tells them to&nbsp;
give up and enjoy their lives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.880
instead of throwing it away and chasing&nbsp;
something that may not even be real.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.960
Bay disagrees and plans to continue&nbsp;
on, stating that if they give now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.040
then their friend would have died for nothing.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.680
The teams all eventually pull together and agrees&nbsp;
with their leader, but the old man is greatly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.800
disappointed at their choice and decides to&nbsp;
leave, promising to burry their bodies afterwards.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.920
The group eventually makes it onto the mountain&nbsp;
by climbing the coffins and arrives into a garden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.400
that appears to be celestial in nature,&nbsp;
as the buildings conceal inside the fog.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.440
They arrive to the center of the area and sees&nbsp;
the dragon orb being held by a giant statue,

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.240
but quickly hears a series of noises from below,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.760
as the coffins are broken into&nbsp;
pieces by something from inside.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.800
An army of scorpion monsters&nbsp;
appear in front of them as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.120
creatures proceed to corner the group in&nbsp;
hostility, giving them no where to run.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.080
The team begins to fight the&nbsp;
monsters by using their weapons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.800
but are pushed back quickly&nbsp;
by the enemy's numbers.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.120
They try to open a way for the main character,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.480
and Bay runs towards the giant&nbsp;
statue and grabs the dragon orb.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.600
He runs back to his team, but&nbsp;
soon realizes something wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.840
as the ground begins shaking like an earthquake.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.480
The bells all begin to ring, and surprisingly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.160
the scorpion monsters all turn back&nbsp;
in fear and runs for their lives.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.800
Rain clouds begin to form, covering the sun&nbsp;
very quickly, and the mountain starts to break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.920
apart while a giant serpent emerges from the&nbsp;
falling rocks, roaring furiously at the people.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.520
Bay tells his team to run quickly&nbsp;
and they try to escape the garden,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.160
but the monster is too fast and blocks the&nbsp;
way immediately as it surround the people.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.960
It attacks by using it's giant mouth, sending&nbsp;
the group in the air by the shockwave alone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.280
and making a huge crater in the process.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.760
The giant snake destroys the buildings nearby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.320
as it recovers and screams furiously at&nbsp;
the team, causing them to run in fear.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.200
The monster attacks them again, causing Kai to&nbsp;
fall and drop the jar with the queen inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.880
breaking a hole in the glass.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.080
The fire bugs are able to sense&nbsp;
their leader's presence and begins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.400
swarming towards the mountains all together.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.600
They quickly cross the fields&nbsp;
and passes the floating island,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.000
eventually arriving at the entrance of the&nbsp;
garden as they fly towards the giant snake.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.400
Bay sees this and conjures up an idea,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.200
rushing towards the queen bug&nbsp;
and grabs it from the ground.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.600
The man charges at the giant snake as all&nbsp;
the fire bugs follow him closely behind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.000
but the serpent attacks right in front of him,&nbsp;
causing Bay to fall and break the container.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.400
The queen slowly flies away as the group&nbsp;
watches hopelessly, but the bug is caught&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.560
in the last moment by professor Sun&nbsp;
who decided to come back for his team.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.040
The old man charges towards the giant snake&nbsp;
as his hand begins to engulf in flames,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.040
eventually spreading across his body&nbsp;
as he jumps inside the monster's mouth.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.960
The firebugs follow closely behind&nbsp;
and flies into the snake's body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.400
burning the giant creature from&nbsp;
the inside as it screams in pain.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.120
The monster struggles and&nbsp;
breaks the mountains apart,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.680
releasing all the water into the hills below.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.640
The group tries desperately to&nbsp;
run from the collapsing rocks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.960
eventually jumping down into the waters&nbsp;
below and escapes danger just in time.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.080
They head back to their village&nbsp;
after retrieving Ling's body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.920
and creating tombs for their friends&nbsp;
so that they can finally rest in peace.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.480
Bay combines the two magical items together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:15.280
and the dragon orb begins to levitate in the air&nbsp;
while the celestial bone glows in bright light.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.600
To their surprise, the objects did not&nbsp;
cure them of their curse, but instead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:25.920
reveals the clues to a new location, where more&nbsp;
danger is surely waiting for them in the unknowns.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.160
