00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:20.150 align:start position:0%
had no idea what was going on either but
 

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.060 align:start position:0%
had no idea what was going on either but
at<00:17:20.240><c> least</c><00:17:20.360><c> I</c><00:17:20.600><c> can</c><00:17:20.900><c> see</c><00:17:21.350><c> that</c><00:17:21.500><c> as</c><00:17:21.650><c> being</c><00:17:21.800><c> more</c>

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:22.070 align:start position:0%

at least I can see that as being more

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:23.900 align:start position:0%
appealing than the movie because it
 

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.260 align:start position:0%
appealing than the movie because it
doesn't<00:17:24.320><c> overshadow</c><00:17:24.589><c> there's</c><00:17:25.070><c> no</c><00:17:25.190><c> CGI</c><00:17:25.640><c> and</c><00:17:25.970><c> so</c>

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:26.270 align:start position:0%
doesn't overshadow there's no CGI and so
 

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.670 align:start position:0%
doesn't overshadow there's no CGI and so
in<00:17:26.540><c> the</c><00:17:26.660><c> performances</c><00:17:27.140><c> so</c><00:17:27.230><c> you</c><00:17:27.320><c> can</c><00:17:27.440><c> actually</c>

00:17:35.419 --> 00:17:35.429 align:start position:0%
I know there's been arguments that
 

00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:36.759 align:start position:0%
I know there's been arguments that
people<00:17:35.669><c> just</c><00:17:35.820><c> don't</c><00:17:35.909><c> like</c><00:17:36.059><c> they</c><00:17:36.269><c> aesthetic</c>

00:17:36.759 --> 00:17:36.769 align:start position:0%
