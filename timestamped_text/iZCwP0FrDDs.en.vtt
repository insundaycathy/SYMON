00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:16.320
Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here. Before we&nbsp;
start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today, I’m going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.880
to recap a 2021 Korean Sci-Fi Action movie, called&nbsp;
Space Sweepers. This movie tells the story of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.400
future where Earth is inhabitable due to pollution&nbsp;
and a Space Company monopolizes the economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.200
The Company seeks to destroy Earth and build a&nbsp;
colony on Mars to further rule over humanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.520
So, how bad are their actions? Will they complete&nbsp;
their mission to destroy Earth? Let’s find it out.&nbsp;

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.640
In 2092, Earth is no longer habitable&nbsp;
due to acid rain from pollution.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.640
5% of humanity are wealthy people who can afford&nbsp;
to live in Eden, a paradise in outer space made by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.240
UTS. The remaining 95% either remain on Earth’s&nbsp;
surface, or in outer space structures (Orbit).&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.200
Space Sweepers risk their lives to collect&nbsp;
space debris and sell it as materials or parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.000
They usually have their own turf in collecting&nbsp;
debris, but sometimes also compete in salvaging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.360
the materials. A team is the champion among&nbsp;
Space Sweepers. With Jang as the captain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.240
Kim with his piloting skill, Park the engineer,&nbsp;
Bubs the military robot, and their heavily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.960
modified vessel called Victory, they easily&nbsp;
snatch a cargo from other crews and get away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.800
However, they crashed into one of UTS’s&nbsp;
antennas. When they try to sell the cargo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.600
they find that they need to pay a&nbsp;
bigger fine due to the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.360
Frustrated by their debts, they salvage the cargo&nbsp;
to look for more materials. While they are trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.080
to dismantle the cargo, the airlock opens&nbsp;
and they find a little Girl in a space suit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.480
They take the Girl back to their ship in hope that&nbsp;
they can ask for a reward from the Girl’s parents.&nbsp;

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.720
While they are discussing their plan, news comes&nbsp;
up. It is reported that a terrorist organization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.640
called Black Fox, an anti UTS organization, has&nbsp;
made a weaponized android with a hydrogen bomb.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.400
The android is now missing and is searched&nbsp;
by UTS. Surprised to see that the mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.800
android is actually the Girl, they scramble and&nbsp;
try to come up with a plan to get rid of her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.440
Kim searches through her belongings and&nbsp;
finds a phone with many miss-calls from Kang,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.720
and a report indicating that Kang is an engineer.&nbsp;
The crew decides to call Kang to get a ransom of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.800
$2 million. They agree to meet at a club, but&nbsp;
unaware that UTS’ Founder has tapped the call.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.640
When they arrive on the agreed&nbsp;
time, the Space Guards sent by UTS&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.680
interrupt the exchange. The Space Guards try&nbsp;
to kill the crew but are saved by the Girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.760
The crew escapes with the Girl aboard their&nbsp;
ship and discusses what they’ll have to do next.&nbsp;

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.200
The Girl stays and starts to bond with them.&nbsp;
Captain Jang is also touched by the Girl’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.720
drawing of their portraits. Jang notices that a&nbsp;
near-dead tomato plant has mysteriously sprouted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.000
and bears fruits. Back in UTS, the Founder&nbsp;
reveals that they are going to terraform Mars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.800
to a habitable planet and colonize it with&nbsp;
the Super Plant as the anchor. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.000
the crew tries to repair their ship but are low&nbsp;
on cash. Kim and the Girl get an idea to sell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.440
tomatoes from the plant to raise money, and end up&nbsp;
having enough money for the repair. Bubs reveals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.160
to the Girl that Kim used to be a Space Guard&nbsp;
and lived in Eden. During one of his missions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.000
he saved a baby girl from an illegal personal ship&nbsp;
and raised her. As he grew more compassionate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.720
he couldn’t follow cold-hearted orders anymore&nbsp;
and was kicked out of Eden. Desperate with their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.360
living, he fell into drinking and gambling.&nbsp;
There was a disaster that made his Child got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.560
blown up to space. Kim has been focusing all&nbsp;
his money and time to recover his Child’s body.&nbsp;

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.320
The crew receives another call from Kang to do&nbsp;
a second exchange. Kim tells them that he wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.640
to continue with the plan, but Park rejects&nbsp;
it because he doesn’t trust Kang to take care&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.400
of the Girl. While they are discussing their next&nbsp;
step, the Girl got kidnapped by the Black Fox. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.920
crew chases the culprit and finally tracks them&nbsp;
down. Kim and Park are cornered by the Black Fox&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.120
but manage to fight back. On the ship, they are&nbsp;
surprised to see that the culprit is actually one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.080
of their acquaintances. They explained that Black&nbsp;
Fox is actually an environmentalist group trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.000
to fight UTS and save the Earth. They also explain&nbsp;
that the Girl was actually an ordinary child.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
However, she was born with an incurable disease&nbsp;
that attacked her nerves. As a last resort, Kang,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.080
the Girl’s father, injected her with nanobots. The&nbsp;
nanobots bonded with her body and cured her. In&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.440
addition, she also has the ability to communicate&nbsp;
with other nanobots to restructure living material&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.040
and restore the Earth’s life. The Founder used her&nbsp;
ability to grow the Super Plant and colonize Mars.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.720
However, after completing the Plant, he tries to&nbsp;
destroy all of the evidence, including the Girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.600
Since the Girl has the nanobots’ protection,&nbsp;
she can only be killed with a hydrogen bomb.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.080
The Founder plans to trap the Girl inside&nbsp;
a factory and detonate the bomb there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.160
The large debris will crash into&nbsp;
Earth and kill three billion people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.160
with the Black Fox to be blamed.
The meeting ends abruptly when Space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.760
Guards arrive. They try to escape but are chased&nbsp;
by the Guards. They are able to fly away but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.880
trapped inside the indestructible Lagrangian&nbsp;
nanobots’ territory. The nanobots quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.240
engulfs and eats Victory, but the Girl uses&nbsp;
her power to dispel them before she passes out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.880
When they are freed of the nanobots, they find&nbsp;
that they have been flagged as Black Fox’s allies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.280
Their background is also revealed. Captain Jang&nbsp;
used to be a member of the UTS genius program but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.520
joined the anti-UTS group. She almost assassinated&nbsp;
the Founder in the past. Park used to be a drug&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.880
cartel boss who had been escaping execution. He&nbsp;
used his money to help a lot of children in need.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.320
Kim used to be a prodigy among the Space Guards,&nbsp;
became a commander at a record-breaking young age.&nbsp;

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.600
The Black Fox calls the crew and asks to meet&nbsp;
them and Kang in an abandoned Orbit block.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.480
The mentioned Orbit block is actually the place&nbsp;
where Kim lost his Child during the accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.960
Victory makes its way to the block and the&nbsp;
crew meets Kang and the Black Fox there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.560
The Girl and her father finally unite but are&nbsp;
disrupted by the Space Guards once more. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.480
Space Guards use EMP that shuts down the ship’s&nbsp;
system. The Guards kill Kang and the Black Foxes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.000
and kidnap the Girl. The Founder also gives the&nbsp;
crew $4 million for handing the Girl over to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.360
The Guards leave the ship but watch over Victory&nbsp;
to kill them once the bomb has been detonated.&nbsp;

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.840
The crew argues once more to save the Girl.&nbsp;
Kim leaves them with his cut to look for his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.960
Child’s body that has been floating in space for&nbsp;
years. Before handing over the money, he comes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.960
his senses and decides to save the Girl. Kim comes&nbsp;
back to the ship and takes over the steer. Captain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.360
Jang and Bubs are ready to attack the pursuing&nbsp;
Space Guards, and Park readies the engine for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.160
maximum output. The crew manages to get away&nbsp;
and comes to the factory where the Girl and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.840
bomb are kept. They find out that the bomb will&nbsp;
emit Krypton waves that kill nanobots in a 5,000&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.280
kilometers radius upon detonating. Determined&nbsp;
to save the Girl, they plan to fly as fast as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.160
they can before the bomb goes off, even though&nbsp;
the factory debris will still fall into Earth.&nbsp;

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.680
Upon leaving the factory, they are confronted&nbsp;
by tons of Space Guards. Captain Jang uses the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.560
emergency channel to call their fellow Space&nbsp;
Sweepers to save the Earth together. Pierre,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.480
a man who likes Captain Jang, arrives early but is&nbsp;
quickly left behind. The Space Sweepers confront&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.200
the Space Guards with their ship, by grappling&nbsp;
and dismantling them. They cover Victory’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.360
track to make sure no Guard follows them and&nbsp;
let them get outside the bomb’s wave radius.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.200
Captain Jang also secretly broadcasts the Founder’&nbsp;
true intention of destroying Earth to monopolize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.400
the economy on Mars. When they are about to leave&nbsp;
the wave radius to save the Girl, the Founder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.680
latches his ship onto Victory. The Founder tears&nbsp;
the ship’s cargo to kill the Girl, but he finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.040
the hydrogen bomb instead. Turns out, the Girl&nbsp;
has been transported safely to Pierre’s ship and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.560
the Victory crew plans to sacrifice themselves in&nbsp;
saving the Girl and the Earth. The hydrogen bomb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:00.320
explodes taking Victory and the Founder down.&nbsp;
When the explosion clears, everyone finds that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.560
Victory is protected by the indestructible&nbsp;
Lagrangian nanobots commanded by the Girl.&nbsp;

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.560
Due to UTS’ hidden motives, UTS pledges to&nbsp;
repair the Earth’s environment and supports&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.720
the crew’s repair. Kim reconciles with&nbsp;
his Child through the Girl as the medium.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.960
Bubs buys herself a new human skin. In the end,&nbsp;
we are shown that the Earth is much greener with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.160
the help of the Girl and UTS. The Victory&nbsp;
crew continues their job as Space Sweepers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.320
debt-free, with an upgraded ship, and&nbsp;
the Girl as their additional member.&nbsp;
