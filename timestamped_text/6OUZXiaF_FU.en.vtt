Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.870
Today I'm going to show you a drama horror
mystery film called “Eli”.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.319
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.230
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.990
11-year-old Eli Miller is travelling with
his parents headed to a secluded medical facility.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.050
Eli suffers from a rare autoimmune disease
rendering him extremely vulnerable to the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.579
outside world.

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.579
Unable to breathe the air, Eli spends his
life in a sterile bubble and walks around

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.989
wearing an airtight hazmat suit.

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.839
His parents, Rose and Paul, seek the help
of Dr. Horn and bring Eli to her private medical

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.840
institution, an old mansion that’s been
converted to a sterile facility.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.629
Rose and Paul believe Dr. Horn is their last
hope to help Eli heal from his condition.

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.800
Eli arrives at his room and finally gets to
take his hazmat suit off.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.870
Eli and Rose are overjoyed, being able to
hold each other for the first time in years.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.820
At night, Eli hears strange noises and whispers
and has an unusual encounter with a mist window

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.859
but gets dismissed the following morning by
the adults when he informs them.

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.980
They begin the first stage of the procedure,
heading into an operation room and the nurses

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.129
strap Eli to an operating table.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.290
Dr. Horn informs him that she’ll be injecting
a modified virus to reset his immune system.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.829
Eli slowly falls unconscious as Dr. Horn operates.

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:15.550
He gains consciousness and is in terrible
pain.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.000
He asks to be let go but Horn tells him the
pain is a sign the procedure is working.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.990
Eli screams from the pain and his skin blisters.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.760
He writhes in pain trying to free himself
from the bonds before passing out again.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.390
Later in his room, Eli hears sounds coming
from his window again.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.700
He approaches it but instead of the mist,
he sees a girl outside throwing rocks.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.100
The girl gestures Eli to come follow her.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.840
Eli then explores the house looking for a
way to get closer to the girl and finds a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.960
room with huge glass windows.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.799
He finds the girl, Haley, on the other side
of the window and she tells him she’s seen

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.980
other kids in the facility before.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.210
Eli tries to impress her with a magic card
trick but Haley shows off a trick of her own

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.150
by setting a twig on fire.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.189
Eli invites her inside but she refuses saying
the house feels eerie and that she’s not

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.979
welcome inside.

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.180
On his way back to his room, Eli sees a sealed
room with lots of furniture covered with cloth.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.390
He shines a flashlight in and sees a ghostly
girl appear.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.120
Eli starts running but as he shines the flashlight,
the ghost gets closer and closer.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.830
Eli trips and sees a shadow closing in on
him behind a curtain.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.850
The curtain opens but it’s Paul who appears.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.220
Later while Eli lays in bed, he feels a sudden
chill and hears whispering.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.090
He looks around and sees a silhouette behind
a curtain but no one is there.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.750
He tries communicating via the mist on the
window and fogs it up with his breath and

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.090
writes his name.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.760
Eli is surprised to see the ghost writing
back.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.450
It erases his name and writes LIE instead.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.770
Eli steps back and sees from a mirror a girl
standing by the window writing with her finger

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.190
but when he checks, no one is there.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.780
Eli tries to calm himself but a ghost appears
in front of him.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.450
He tries to crawl away but the ghost grabs
him.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.580
He starts shouting but it’s actually Paul
who’s grabbing him, trying to wake him up.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.940
Dr. Horn, Rose, and Paul discuss what’s
happening to Eli.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.020
Horn tells them that this is all a result
of the medication.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.790
The medicine they placed him under is strong
and warns that Eli’s condition could worsen

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.760
before he starts healing.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.200
The next day, it’s time for Eli’s second
procedure and the nurses strap him to a table

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200
again.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.780
Dr. Horn injects him with a solution and Eli
immediately starts writhing in pain.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.310
He tells them it’s burning him but Dr. Horn
says it’s supposed to.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.970
As the medicine takes effect, they take a
drill and start drilling into Eli’s skull.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.000
Outside, Horn informs Paul and Rose that Eli
is having an adverse reaction to the procedure.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.730
At dinner, Eli tells his parents he wants
to leave because he feels like his condition

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.660
is getting worse and now he even feels more
sick.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.960
Paul gets angry and tells him the procedure
is working and that they should stay.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.770
Eli returns to his bedroom and he hears more
noises.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.620
In his bathroom, he sees a shadow walking
behind the shower curtain and later sees someone

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.590
standing behind him in the mirror.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.510
A hand reaches out for Eli and he sprints
for the door but it’s locked.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.510
He calls to his parents, begging to be let
out and sees the ghost slowly walking toward

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.510
him.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.180
With nowhere left to go, Eli hides in his
wardrobe closet.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.080
The ghost starts pounding and scratching on
the door and Eli keeps screaming.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.190
The pounding stops and Eli steps out to see
the ghost has etched into his wardrobe the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.160
word LIE over and over.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.019
His parents and Dr. Horn runs in and sees
the mess in Eli’s room.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.690
They confront him and Eli tries to tell them
what’s been happening but they don’t believe

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.490
him, citing the side effects as the cause
of Eli’s hallucinations.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.650
Later, Haley shows up again and she tells
Eli that a previous patient, Perry, came before

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.419
him and also mentioned seeing ghosts in the
house.

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.050
She also tells him that when it came time
for the third procedure, she never saw him

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.520
ever again.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.240
Before they could finish talking, Eli hears
strange noises again and goes to investigate.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.590
He checks the hallway when an unseen force
tries to grab him.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.729
Eli starts running but starts getting dragged
away.

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.690
From the reflection, he sees three ghosts
dragging him.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.380
They finally dump him at the house’s front
door.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.419
Knowing he’ll start burning and blistering
once he gets into contact with the air outside,

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.289
Eli begs the ghosts to stop but the door opens.

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.050
Eli tries to hold his breath and the doctors
and his parents come to the rescue.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.540
They try to subdue Eli but he tells them he
knows about Perry.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.500
Rose tries to calm Eli down but an angry Eli
answers back and accidentally slams his hand

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.710
through glass, wounding himself.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.720
Eli faints and wakes up back in his room.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.110
Back in his room, Eli sees the scratches the
ghost made is not the word LIE but may actually

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.749
be an upside down 317.

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:34.330
Eli meets with Haley again and tells her that
he thinks the ghosts aren’t trying to hurt

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.610
him but are actually trying to help him escape
and the 317 they’ve been writing may be

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.940
a code to a door somewhere.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.909
Later that night, Eli tries to sneak into
a locked part of the house and successfully

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.889
gets in by using the code.

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.800
He finds his way into an office and looks
for records of previous patients.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.090
He sees mists on the doors and hears whispers,
guiding him to a file drawer.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.800
He sees files for the other patients and sees
that all of them have died on the third procedure.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.710
Eli runs from the office to his parents trying
to tell them about what happened to the last

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.009
patients but only finds his father.

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.669
Paul talks to Eli and tries to apologize to
him, but as he hugs him, he injects Eli with

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:11.779
a serum.

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:15.009
The nurses rush in and drag Eli to the operating
room.

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.439
Eli breaks free and locks himself in Dr. Horn’s
study.

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:21.500
There, he discovers that Horn is actually
a nun.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.680
He also finds a secret passage that leads
underground.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.230
He finds a room with a circular tomb surrounded
by an altar with a cross and a dagger.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.289
The adults catch up and trap him in the underground
chamber.

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.849
Eli demands to be let back in but Horn says
they have to leave him in the basement.

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:38.870
Everyone leaves and Eli passes out.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.050
A few minutes later, Eli wakes up and finds
himself breathing normally.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.100
He calls for his mother and she comes back
down.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.159
In the basement, Rose tries to apologize to
Eli and tells him they’re all just trying

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:54.639
to help and promises to explain everything
once the final procedure is completed.

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:58.860
Eli slumps down pretending to fall unconscious
and Rose runs in to help.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.919
He slips away and runs up past the operating
room and into the room with the huge windows

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:05.259
where he sees Haley waiting for him.

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:08.460
She tells him he has to be brave and that
he mustn't be scared as it’s Horn and the

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.240
others who are scared of him.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.360
He tries breaking open the window but Paul
comes in and drags him away.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.990
In the basement, Rose opens the tomb and sees
all the past patients dead and buried.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.240
She finally realizes that none of Horn’s
patients have been healed and all of them

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.569
end up dead.

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:27.720
Paul helps the nurse restrain Eli but Rose
shows up with the dagger and holds everyone

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.720
at knife-point.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.210
Horn says she can still save him but Rose
is determined to escape with Eli.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.990
Paul overpowers Rose and holds her back as
Horn begins the procedure.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:42.090
Eli watches Dr. Horn reach not for surgery
equipment, but for a bible and holy water.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.139
Eli is confused but is still trying to get
himself free.

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:50.020
Dr. Horn starts by chanting the Lord’s prayer
and asking St. Michael to help Eli.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.490
She takes holy water and blesses Eli.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.139
She is performing an exorcism.

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:58.740
Eli’s skin burns and sizzles when the holy
water touches him and with his screams, the

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.979
lights flicker and sparks fly.

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:04.409
Horn takes the dagger and prepares to stab
Eli in the heart.

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:07.830
She brings down the dagger but it stops millimeters
from his heart.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.699
She tries to fight but it seems Eli is in
control of her hand and he makes Horn stab

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:13.120
herself in the heart.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.910
The nurses panic and try to run for the door
but Eli stops them.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:21.279
Eli’s restraints burn off and he stands
and makes Horn and the nurses levitate.

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:24.439
He turns to Rose and demands to know what’s
happened to him.

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:28.870
Rose finally confesses the truth and tells
Eli she’s tried to have a son but nothing

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:29.870
happened.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.970
Only when she prayed to the Devil was she
finally granted a baby.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:38.410
Paul runs up behind Eli dagger in hand, but
Eli turns and makes his Paul’s face implode.

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:40.620
Eli is the son of the Devil.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.640
Eli embraces his newfound powers and identity
and heads outside.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.800
Haley meets him at the door and reveals to
him that she, along with the previous patients,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.800
are half-siblings.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.200
They’re all spawns of the devil.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.960
Haley offers to take Eli to their father and
Rose appears behind them.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.540
Rose offers Eli a coat, telling him it’s
cold outside.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.640
Haley and Eli get into a car and order Rose
to drive them.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.950
A distraught Rose gets in and starts panicking,
but Eli tells her to breathe and calm down.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:15.920
They share a smile and drive away.
