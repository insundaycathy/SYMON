00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.440
Hey everyone. Welcome back to Movie&nbsp;
Recap. Today I'm gonna show you a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.609
2014 American fictional superhero movie&nbsp;
called, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.720
The villainous criminal organization known as&nbsp;
the Foot Clan has been terrorizing New York City,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.840
led by the ruthless Shredder. Beneath the&nbsp;
sewers, the rat sensei Master Splinter has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.160
been training his four sons until they are&nbsp;
ready to take Shredder on and become heroes.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.240
Meanwhile, Reporter April O'Neil pesters&nbsp;
a dock worker for information on chemical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.800
materials that the Foot Clan may be&nbsp;
involved with. Not getting any answers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.080
she and her cameraman Vernon Fenwick go into the&nbsp;
city to do a puff piece on trampoline fitness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.160
April wants to do better stories, but&nbsp;
Vern assures her that some people enjoy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.360
these kinds of stores the same&nbsp;
way they enjoy foam on coffee.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.680
April learns from the dock worker that&nbsp;
something is being brought in by the docks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.040
She rides her bike there at night to find the Foot&nbsp;
Clan, led by their lieutenant Karai, preparing to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.560
bring something in. April tries to get footage&nbsp;
on her phone, when a shadowy figure shows up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.480
takes out the Foot Soldiers one by one. The figure&nbsp;
leaves behind a symbol that April recognizes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.280
She tells her roommate Taylor about this, and&nbsp;
also at work to her boss Bernadette Thompson,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.275
but nobody seems to believe her&nbsp;
or care about what she has to say.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.160
We see a man with his hands tied behind his&nbsp;
back, and a Foot Soldier trying to attack him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.360
but the man easily takes the Soldier down.&nbsp;
This man is The Shredder. Karai reports to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.840
him about the vigilante activity, and that&nbsp;
these non-human creatures must be stopped.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.000
The NYPD teams up with Eric Sacks of Sacks Group&nbsp;
Inc. to take down the Foot Clan. April finds Sacks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.880
at an event, where we learn that her father worked&nbsp;
with Sacks on a project before he passed away.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.360
After the event, April and Vern drive home when&nbsp;
they see terrorized New Yorkers scrambling all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.800
around the streets. April leaves the van to check&nbsp;
it out, only to get grabbed by a Foot Soldier and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.080
thrown in with other hostages. Karai calls out&nbsp;
the vigilantes to show themselves, or the Foot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.280
Soldiers will execute the hostages. The Ninja&nbsp;
Turtles catch them on their cameras, and them ride&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.880
the subway to find the Foot Clan and beat them&nbsp;
down easily, freeing the hostages in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.240
April runs out and climbs a fire escape to find&nbsp;
the Turtles on the roof. She snaps a picture,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.760
which startles them. She gets grabbed and is&nbsp;
confronted by the Turtles, causing her to faint.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.160
When she s awake, she meets the four heroes&nbsp;
in a half-shell - the leader Leonardo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.480
the brainy Donatello, rebellious Raphael, and&nbsp;
goofball Michelangelo. Donnie wiped April's phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.520
and Leo hands it back to her, warning her not&nbsp;
to tell anybody about them, or they'll find her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.360
Mikey reiterates this, and it's&nbsp;
obvious he's attracted to April.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.806
The Turtles leave, but April still manages&nbsp;
to get a picture of them from a distance.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.600
April runs home and opens a&nbsp;
box filled with documents,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.800
pictures, and videos on Project Renaissance,&nbsp;
what her father and Sacks were working on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.920
April sees a video of her as a kid recording in&nbsp;
her father's lab, using a mutagen on the Turtles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.760
and Splinter, pre-mutation. She personally named&nbsp;
them and fed them pizza, which they all loved.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.120
She even recognizes the symbol&nbsp;
from earlier as meaning, "family."

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.280
The Turtles try to sneak back into&nbsp;
their lair without alerting Splinter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.440
However, he manages to catch them and&nbsp;
punishes them by making them maintain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.600
balance on certain items until they tell&nbsp;
him why they were out on the streets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.120
Splinter breaks Mikey by tempting him with pizza.&nbsp;
Mikey admits they were out fighting the Foot Clan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.240
and when he mentions April's name, Splinter is&nbsp;
alarmed and he orders the Turtles to go find her.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.600
April continues digging into&nbsp;
the Turtles' past, and she tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.320
Thompson about what she saw the previous&nbsp;
night. Unfortunately, this gets her fired.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.600
Afterwards, Vern takes her to the Sacks&nbsp;
Estate so she can personally ask Sacks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.480
about what he and Dr. O'Neil were working&nbsp;
on. She shows Sacks the photo of the Turtles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.440
and he takes her into his room to tell her about&nbsp;
his past in Japan, being abandoned by his father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.221
and learning of a legend about a ruthless&nbsp;
warlord in the area. He gives April his card.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.720
April logs onto her computer to find some news&nbsp;
on the Turtles in the subway, only to find that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.600
Donnie hacked her computer and sent her an address&nbsp;
for her to meet them at. She goes alone and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.440
Turtles take her into their lair. There, she meets&nbsp;
Splinter, who remembered April before he mutated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.600
He tells her that her father was working with&nbsp;
Sacks and Shredder, but he learned that Shredder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.880
was planning something evil, and so Dr. O'Neil&nbsp;
burned the lab down, at the cost of his own life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.484
April saved Splinter and the Turtles, and&nbsp;
she took them to the sewers to be safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.000
The mutagen later took effect and turned&nbsp;
Splinter into a walking and talking rat that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.040
raised the Turtles as his sons. The boys were&nbsp;
always curious about life above the surface,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.160
but Splinter tried to keep them away, and instead&nbsp;
taught himself the art of ninjitsu before passing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.040
it down to the Turtles. When they were ready, he&nbsp;
armed them with their trademark weapons. Leo with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.480
his katanas, Donnie with his bo staff, Raph&nbsp;
with his sai, and Mikey with his nunchucks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.360
Splinter expresses his thanks&nbsp;
to April for protecting them.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.640
Sacks is really working for Shredder, and they&nbsp;
come by his armor, which has been given some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.640
upgrades. The Foot Clan also manages to track the&nbsp;
location of the lair. They infiltrate the place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.520
triggering an alarm that alerts the Turtles. The&nbsp;
Foot Soldiers break in with a bomb and blow the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.880
place open. The Turtles fight the Soldiers,&nbsp;
and Splinter gets in on the action himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.320
Mikey brings April to a safe spot before returning&nbsp;
to fight. Shredder enters the lair, decked out in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.600
his armor with multiple knives on each arm. He&nbsp;
faces off with Splinter, who dodges Shredder's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.040
knives and gets a few good hits in. Splinter shuts&nbsp;
the doors to protect his sons, but they lift them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.760
up in time to see Shredder grab Splinter and hold&nbsp;
him before the Turtles, threatening to kill him if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.640
they don't lay down their weapons. They do so,&nbsp;
but Shredder still hits Splinter hard enough to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.680
take him out, while the Soldiers cattle-prod the&nbsp;
Leo, Donnie, and Mikey, capturing them and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.200
blowing the lair up. Raph emerges from the rubble&nbsp;
and goes with April to take Splinter to rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.480
He pleads with Raph to save his brothers and stop&nbsp;
Shredder. Raph gets ready to spring into action.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.880
April calls Vern to take her and Raph to&nbsp;
the Sacks Estate again. Vern sees Raph and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.240
although he's shocked, he complies and drives&nbsp;
them. In the laboratory beneath his home, Sacks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.480
holds Leo, Donnie, and Mikey in cages, trying to&nbsp;
extract their blood that contains mutagen. His and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.520
Shredder's plan is to infect the city with a toxin&nbsp;
that would quarantine the city, and then seize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:53.680
control over everyone with the mutagen to use as a&nbsp;
cure. Outside, Vern rams through the gate, running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:00.160
over Foot Soldiers. Raph busts out of the van&nbsp;
to go find his brothers. April and Vern follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.120
Raph fights Shredder on his own while April tries&nbsp;
to free the others by giving them an adrenaline&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.160
injection. This allows them to bust out and help&nbsp;
Raph fight Shredder before the villain flees.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.600
The heroes hijack a truck with Karai and&nbsp;
the Foot Soldiers chasing after them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.800
The Soldiers hit the truck with an RPG, causing&nbsp;
them to slide down the mountain. The Turtles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.360
slide down the mountain on their shells, taking&nbsp;
out the Foot Clan trucks by slamming into them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.960
or flipping them over. Donnie calculates a big&nbsp;
drop happening momentarily. Karai hooks onto&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.320
Leo as he tries to save April and Vern, causing&nbsp;
her truck to tumble over and crash into a tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.840
Raph pulls Leo, April, and Vern up in time. They&nbsp;
then head over to the city to stop Shredder.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.200
Shredder and Sacks make it back to Sacks's&nbsp;
tower to release the toxin. April and Vern&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.320
go look for the mutagen while the Turtles take&nbsp;
Shredder on. They charge in with Mikey yelling,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:02.400
"Cowabunga!" The Turtles gang up on Shredder, but&nbsp;
he proves a tough foe to beat. Meanwhile, April&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.920
manages to secure the mutagen as Vern knocks Sacks&nbsp;
out, even after Sacks shoots Vern in the arm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.880
The Turtles then band together with a maneuver&nbsp;
that allows them to push Shredder off the roof.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.320
Donnie goes to stop the toxin's release as&nbsp;
Shredder pulls himself back up. Leo, Raph,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.760
and Mikey continue to hold him off, and Donnie is&nbsp;
able to stop the release with a second to spare.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.000
Shredder then tries to knock the top of the&nbsp;
tower down, and the Turtles try holding it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.040
back until April gets to the roof and shows&nbsp;
off the mutagen to Shredder to distract him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.400
The top of the tower comes crashing down as&nbsp;
Shredder lunges at April and throws them both off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.760
They hang on for dear life, and the Turtles try&nbsp;
to save April. Shredder tries to finish them off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:49.040
but Leo throws his katana at him, causing Shredder&nbsp;
to lose balance and fall to the ground. The top&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.160
of the tower comes lose, taking April and the&nbsp;
Turtles with it. Raph admits his brash behavior&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.200
was out of fear for his brothers, and he admits he&nbsp;
loves them, right before he realizes they landed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.360
safely. Mikey notices he's crying, but Raph&nbsp;
brushes it off. They return to the sewers. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.160
citizens then crowd around Shredder, who slightly&nbsp;
moved his hand with mutagen on his fingers...

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.280
On the last scene of the film, The Turtles&nbsp;
get some mutagen to revive Splinter.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.196
He is proud of his boys.

00:09:21.772 --> 00:09:25.822
Later, April meets&nbsp;up with Vern, 
who is showing off his new car.

00:09:25.822 --> 00:09:29.483
The Turtles show up in their own 
vehicle to&nbsp;thank April for her help.

00:09:29.483 --> 00:09:33.799
Mikey then accidentally launches 
a rocket that blows Vern's car up.

00:09:33.799 --> 00:09:38.125
The&nbsp;Turtles offer to give them a lift, 
but April says they'll take the subway.

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:41.668
As they drive away,&nbsp;
Mikey sings "Happy Together" to April.

00:09:41.668 --> 00:09:43.024
She smiles.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.000
