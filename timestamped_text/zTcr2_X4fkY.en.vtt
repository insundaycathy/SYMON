00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.760
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.520
Today I will show you a zombie horror film
from 2013, titled World War Z.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.360
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.320
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.320
We see a suburban house.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.720
Two kids enter their parent's room and jump
on their bed.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.160
Later, Gerry gives his daughters pancakes,
and his wife Karin tells Rachel to get her

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.720
inhaler.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.400
He watches the riots on the news, where one
government has declared martial law.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.600
Connie asks what that is and if he was in
places like that with his old job.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.800
Gerry says that he was, but that he quit so
that he could be with them.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.520
Rachel brings Connie her toy, and they leave
for school.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.800
On the way, they play a game in the car because
they are stuck in traffic.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.520
Karin wonders about the number of helicopters
in the air.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.800
Gerry turns on the radio.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.320
The news report about an outbreak of rabies
that started in Taiwan and has spread to other

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.820
countries.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.280
Suddenly, a biker breaks the side view mirror,
and Gerry gets out to pick it up and see what's

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.080
happening.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.920
An explosion happens down the street.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.200
A cop on a motorbike orders him to get in
the car when a truck smashes into him and

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.960
continues to clear out the street.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.000
Gerry begins to drive behind it, thinking
it can be their way out.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.920
It rams into another truck and topples over,
but Gerry turns and avoids a crash.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.840
He drives through the city, filled with the
military, and on the verge of a crisis.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.840
Gerry turns around to tell Rachel to put her
seatbelt on when an ambulance hits their car.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.040
None of them are hurt.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.080
Gerry takes Connie out first and then Rachel
from the same side.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.760
Zombies can be seen chasing down frightened
people and attacking them relentlessly.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.440
A zombie woman smashes through the windshield
of a car to get to the people inside.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.160
Karin sees her bite into a man, and she freaks
out.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.680
Gerry tells her to run.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.640
As they do so, he observes the situation with
the woman.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.040
The bitten man turns into a zombie on the
spot.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.960
Gerry gets his family into an RV as the other
zombies ravage the people on the street.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.960
One zombie almost enters their car.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.560
Gerry rides furiously through the streets
as zombies keep attacking the vehicle.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.040
They eventually get to a road outside of the
city.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.320
Rachel has an asthma attack, and Karin tries
to calm her down.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.400
She checks her backpack for a spare inhaler,
and Gerry stops the vehicle to sit with Rachel,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.920
talking her through the attack.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.360
Karin doesn't find the medicine and wants
to start the RV so they can find a pharmacy,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.860
but it won't go.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.920
Gerry's phone rings.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.000
The call is from a former colleague Thierry.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.440
He tells him that they barely made it out
and that he doesn't know what happened either.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.880
Meanwhile, Connie finds a shotgun, and Gerry
takes it away from her.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.040
Karin manages to get the RV going.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.240
Thierry tells Gerry that he'll try to get
a chopper to them, calling him back with an

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.680
extraction point in an hour.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.040
Before he hangs up, he tells Gerry that he'll
need him back on the job.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.720
They arrive in Newark and proceed to a store
that has already been stormed by people.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.480
They split up, with Karin going to get some
food and Gerry taking Rachel to find the medicine

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.980
she needs.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.400
In the pharmacy, they run into a guy with
a gun who asks them what they need.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.160
He finds the medicine for them and gives it
to Gerry, along with something else that might

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.640
help.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.840
Meanwhile, Connie screams for him, rolling
by herself in a cart.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.160
They get to her and see Karin being attacked.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.720
Gerry goes after her, but the men start shooting.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.480
He shoots back and gets one of them.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.480
A police officer runs in, and Gerry puts his
hands up, but he just goes to get the groceries

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.360
he needs.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.080
The family gets out of the store and finds
the RV gone.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.280
Gerry calls Thierry to tell him where they
will be, but he says that he can get a chopper

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.960
to them earliest at sunrise.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.240
The family will be waiting on the top of an
apartment building with flares.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.400
They get to the building, and zombies chase
after them.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.400
Gerry holds them off outside, then joins the
family to secure the door.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.920
As they run up the stairs, the zombies break
through the door and follow them.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.760
In the chaos of the chase, they lose Connie
and go searching for her through the apartments.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.720
They find her in front of an open door with
another family inside.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.920
Gerry gets them inside.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.880
They get settled and communicate with the
parents via Thomas, their son.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.760
Gerry finds an emergency broadcast on the
radio.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.360
The message states that everyone should stay
indoors if possible because an unidentified

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.200
virus has spread across the state.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.080
Gerry wakes up from a nightmare and hears
something outside.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.920
He finds Rachel and Thomas in another room,
and the boy tells him that she was crying.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.120
Later, Gerry talks to the father and tells
him that they have a better chance to survive

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.240
if they come with them.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.200
He declines his offer.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.760
Gerry and his family leave the apartment.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.040
They hear the zombies inside the building
and run toward the roof while Thomas's family

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.840
argues about going with them because the zombies
are at their door.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.680
Gerry's family hides to regroup.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.560
When they open the doors, the zombies attack
instantly.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.080
They run up the stairs, and Gerry fights off
a few of them, with more zombies at their

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.640
tail.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.280
Meanwhile, the chopper approaches the building
but doesn't see them.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.560
Gerry fights another zombie as Karin and the
girls escape to the roof.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.200
Suddenly, Thomas kills the zombie.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.400
Karin lights the flares.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.840
The chopper sees them.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.720
Gerry comes to the roof with Thomas but gets
away from them to see if he'll turn.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.640
He takes a moment but hears the zombies at
the door and runs to holds it down.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.040
When the chopper lands, Karin and the kids
get on it.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.760
A soldier covers Gerry's back so he can get
to the chopper.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.880
They continue shooting at the zombies who
throw themselves after the helicopter and

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.080
fall off the building.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.560
The chopper lands on a U.N. ship in the Atlantic
ocean.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.680
Thierry greets them upon arrival, then leads
them to their bunks.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.000
He tells them that they're not dropping anchor
again.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.440
As he leads Gerry to command, he informs him
that all the major cities around the globe

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.040
took the worst of the virus.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.800
Inside the command station, a think tank is
seen brainstorming over the virus.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.000
Doctor Fassbach thinks that once they find
the origin of the virus, they could create

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.040
a vaccine.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.800
Thierry calls Fassbach their best bet to figure
out what the virus is, and tells Gerry that

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.520
the word "zombie" was first used in a memo
from South Korea.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.520
They plan to send the doctor there to look
for the source.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.520
Suddenly, a general walks into command, heading
straight for Gerry.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.880
He tells him that since he was Thierry's best
investigator, they want to send him to South

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.720
Korea with a team and Fassbach.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.120
Gerry says no because he can't leave his family.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.520
The general can't convince him so he threatens
him.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.400
If he doesn't work for them, they will kick
his family off the ship.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.560
Garry talks to Karin and tells her what their
situation is.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.280
He gives her a phone and tells her to call
him once a day.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.600
Gerry promises that he'll come back, then
says goodbye to his daughters and to Thomas.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.960
Gerry's plane takes off.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.840
He tells Fassbach that he needs to follow
the soldier's orders.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.200
Gerry also tells him to call out anything
he sees as important so they can make it happen.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.880
Fassbach thinks that they'll find something
there and says that sometimes what might seem

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.840
like the most brutal aspect of the virus turns
out to be its fault.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.240
Meanwhile, the ship is&nbsp;
relocating all non-essential&nbsp;

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.440
persons off-board.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.880
The airplane lands in South Korea even though
no one answers from the base to confirm if

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.600
they can.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.280
The hatch opens, and the team begins to move
out when they hear something outside.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.280
They exit slowly when zombies begin to attack.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.760
Fassbach gets scared and runs back to the
plane, slips and falls on the gun, accidentally

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.880
shooting himself.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.320
The soldiers fight off the zombies and proceed
to the base without Fassbach.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.440
Once inside they are met with the soldiers
from the base who ask them why they're there.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.880
Gerry tells them about Fassbach, then the
pilot asks about refueling.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.920
Captain Speke explains that when it comes
to it they'll have to be very careful because

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.600
the zombies are drawn to noise.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.640
He tells them that headshots are the ones
that do the trick, but they also burn the

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.920
bodies when they can.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.560
He asks Gerry what he'll do since Fassbach
is dead.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.880
Gerry explains the memo with the word "zombie".

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.840
They take him to a holding room with burned
bodies and explain that all of those were

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.760
soldiers trying to detain their doctor.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.040
He bit all of them.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.240
The only thing they know about how he got
the virus was that a soldier that had disappeared

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.680
a week before had bitten him.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.560
When the doctor returned, he bit as many as
15 men.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.920
Unfortunately, the documents with which Gerry
could track the soldier that bit the doctor

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.200
were also destroyed in the fire.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.960
Speke tells him that one of his men didn't
get attacked by the zombies, even though he

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.920
was right in the middle of them.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.520
Gerry sees a former CIA agent in holding and
talks to him.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.120
He had been selling guns to North Korea, but
he tells Gerry that guns are only half-measures.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.640
The ex-agent pulls out his last remaining
tooth and tells him that they pulled out the

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.920
teeth of the entire population in 24 hours
to stop the spread.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.360
Gerry calls it bullshit.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.880
Then the man says that Israel is the only
country winning the war by building an entire

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.200
wall around Jerusalem, and he tells Gerry
who to find there.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.640
Later, Gerry tells his pilot that they are
going to Jerusalem.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.960
The soldiers prepare Garry and his team to
get on the plane.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.480
Speke has an entire strategy on how to handle
the refueling of the plane.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.640
Gerry and his team ride to the plane on bikes,
and the soldiers surround the base with snipers

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.920
to cover their backs.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.960
Speke tells them over the radio that they
have to be quiet and get to the plane before

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.840
he can bring in the fuel.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.000
As they ride, Karin calls Gerry, and his ringtone
wakes the zombies.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.200
The men proceed to move with zombies on their
tail when Speke takes down a group of them

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.320
with the fuel truck.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.000
The refueling begins as Gerry and his team
fight zombies in front of the plane.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.720
A zombie attacks Gerry and Speke saves him
but gets bitten himself.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.040
As Gerry is being loaded on board, Speke tells
his men that he'll kill himself before he

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.840
turns.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.760
Gerry sees him do it from the plane.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.120
One of his team walks out to detach the fuel
line as Gerry gets in the cockpit, locking

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.360
the door behind him so the zombies don't come
in.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.600
When they lift off, they fall out of the back
of the plane.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.720
Gerry calls Karin and tells her that they'll
be going to Israel.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.400
She tells him that the kids are ok.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.960
Suddenly there's an explosion, and the call
is dropped.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.400
The airplane approaches Jerusalem, and they
ask for the MOSSAD agent Gerry is going there

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.920
to see, and they get granted access.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.640
Gerry tells his pilot to stay with the plane.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.720
Then he's taken with a convoy to the agent.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.760
Jurgen Warmbrunn tells him that it's human
nature not to believe something can happen

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.640
until it already has.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.560
Gerry asks him how Israel knew.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.320
Warmbrunn tells him that they interrupted
a communiqué from an Indian general in which

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.000
he mentions fighting zombies.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.800
Gerry doesn't think that was the thing that
convinced the veteran agent.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.560
He explains that in the '70s they made a strategy
in which the 10th man must disagree with the

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.160
other 9 that arrived at the same conclusion.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.120
The 10th man has to start digging with the
assumption that the other 9 are wrong.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.960
Since everyone else assumed that zombies were
a cover for something else, being the 10th

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.120
he had to work under the assumption that it
was true.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.720
Warmbrunn tells him that there are many potential
origins in play, but no one knows where the

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.000
virus originated.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.040
They finally arrive at the wall, through which
they let people into the city.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.280
Zombies gather around the wall.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.320
People inside begin to celebrate their potential
salvation.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.840
Since the singing becomes so loud it drives
the zombies to the wall, and they begin climbing

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.400
it.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.760
Gerry asks Warmbrunn if he could get into
India what he should look for, but the agent

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.000
tells him that he can only look for a way
to hide.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.160
The zombie horde climbs&nbsp;
the wall as the celebration&nbsp;

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.240
continues, but the authorities realize something

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:00.740
is happening.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.920
Zombies start falling from the wall and into
Jerusalem.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.920
Gerry tries to escape with Warmbrunn as the
zombies begin rampaging inside the wall.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.200
Helicopters pick them off from the outside,
barely making a dent.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.000
Warmbrunn tells Gerry that his people will
get him to his plane.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.600
The zombies make their way deeper into the
city, and the Israeli army can't do much about

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.160
it.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.120
Gerry runs with a crowd that is constantly
chased by zombies.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.200
Until a soldier activates a grenade.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.560
Meanwhile, the pilot of Gerry's plane gets
informed that the city is breached and that

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.400
zombies are headed towards the airport.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.880
A zombie horde follows Gerry and the officers.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.400
He looks out of a window where a horde rampages
and sees a child being completely avoided

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.200
by them.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.320
The officers keep staving off the zombies,
as Gerry hides.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.440
They activate more grenades, and v kills the
last zombie.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.200
She gets bitten in the process.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.480
When Gerry sees the bitemark he cuts off her
hand, and the virus can't spread.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.600
Segen loses a hand but doesn't turn into a
zombie.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.880
The last survivors run toward the chopper
that arrived for them, but it gets attacked

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.320
by a group of zombies and goes down.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.560
Gerry's pilot requests immediate departure,
as Gerry approaches the airport.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.560
He sees his plane already on air.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.000
They stop another departing plane.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.040
Only Gerry and Segen enter the plane through
the cockpit.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.920
The pilots don't know where to go and are
looking through a map when a zombie horde

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.720
surrounds the plane.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.360
Fortunately, it lifts off in time.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.880
Once in the air, Gerry takes a look down at
the city and watches as it gets decimated

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.400
by the zombies that entered.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.400
He finds alcohol and gives it to Segen.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.920
Gerry needs to change the dressing on her
wound and disinfects his hands, then the stump.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.840
Lastly, he dresses her arm and tells her that
he didn't know if cutting it off would work.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.080
Suddenly, Gerry remembers the story about
officer Ellis and remembers other people that

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.760
have not been attacked by zombies.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.360
He realizes what they should do and calls
Karin, telling her to find Thierry.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.800
Gerry tells him that he needs to locate a
research facility close to him.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.160
Thierry needs to know where he is, and Gerry
bangs on the cockpit door.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.840
He gives his phone to the pilot.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.360
After the conversation with Thierry, the pilot
tells him that they will be going to Cardiff,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.800
where there is a possibility of reaching a
W.H.O. research facility.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.560
Gerry hears the dog bark in the back.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.600
When the stewardess calls the elevator, the
dog runs away.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.760
She opens it, and a zombie attacks her.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.920
Gerry realizes something is going on as the
stewardess attacks people and makes more zombies.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.800
He sees what's happening and tells the passengers
to stay quiet.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.600
They work together to block out the door with
everything they can find.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.400
One of the passengers drops a bag and alerts
the zombies.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.560
They storm the plane and rampage through it.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.160
Gerry battles with the zombies, and he almost
gets bit when Segen shoots the zombie that's

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.040
after him.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.400
She keeps firing, and Gerry finds a grenade
on her belt that he throws in the back of

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.280
the plane.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.640
It shreds the plane, and the pilots have to
make an emergency landing.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.280
Gerry puts the seatbelt on Segen, then himself.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.400
A remaining zombie attacks them as the pilots
prepare for impact.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.080
The plane splits into bits upon impact.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.800
Later, Gerry wakes up, strapped to his seat,
and sees that Segen isn't in hers.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.040
He's badly wounded by a piece of shrapnel.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.160
Gerry drops from his seat.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.480
Suddenly, Segen shows up.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.960
They find their way to the W.H.O. facility.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.720
Meanwhile, the general at the U.N. ship is
informed that the Cardiff airport lost contact

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.000
with Gerry's plane.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.160
Karin is being called in to talk to Thierry.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.760
He talks to his commander, who tells him to
kick Karin and the kids off the ship.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.880
Back at the facility, Gerry is having delusions
and nightmares.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.640
He wakes up and sees his wound dressed, then
notices someone sitting next to him.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.160
As soon as Gerry wakes up, the man consults
with someone else in another room.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.080
They come back and ask him who he is.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.520
They show him the phone, so he says to call
it and find out who he is.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.120
Thierry is surprised that Gerry is alive then
introduces himself to the men.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.360
Before they can answer, Gerry asks about Karin,
and Thierry tells him what happened.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.560
Later, Gerry is out of the restraints and
they bring Segen in to see him.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.760
They say that his family has been sent to
a refugee camp, but Gerry knows that they

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.880
won't be safe there.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.880
The main W.H.O. doctor asks him what he needs
from them, then takes him to his team.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.240
Gerry asks for their deadliest virus with
a high mortality rate because he wants to

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.840
use it against the zombies.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.040
They tell him that he can't make the undead
sick, but Gerry explains that it's not for

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.160
them but for the humans.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.600
He thinks that the zombies' weakness is not
being able to infect a sick host.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.120
Gerry's notion is that the people he saw being
avoided by the zombies had a terminal disease

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.200
that the zombies could sense, so they didn't
attack.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.840
Using the lethal pathogen wouldn't be a cure
but camouflage.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.160
One of the doctors understands his reasoning,
so she explains that the only way to prove

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.320
that would be to meet with a zombie face to
face.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.840
She says that they have all the viruses, but
they are all stored in the B-wing that's infested

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.360
with around 80 zombies.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.720
Another doctor tells him that the zombies
in the B-wing are dormant at the moment.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.480
He shows him how they can get there.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.480
Next, Gerry, Segen, and the lead doctor are
preparing to go to the wing with the vaults

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.200
and get the virus.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.360
Gerry and Segen also get weapons, though the
doctors tell them not to kill any zombie because

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.960
it makes the rest more aggressive.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.880
The three of them walk into the hallway.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.080
The lead doctor tells his subordinates to
seal the doors for good if anything else but

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.520
them comes through the hallway.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.240
The doctors monitor them from the safety of
the other wing.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.160
Gerry walks in first, and the light comes
on as they slowly walk through the facility.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.960
They keep making noise and wake a few of the
zombies a little.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.040
When they reach a lab with glass doors, Segen
moves to the other side first, then the doctor,

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.680
and lastly Gerry, without alerting the zombies.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.440
They continue to the vaults but make a noise
with a flip door and wake up the zombies.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.360
They go through and arrive at the vaults.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.440
There is a zombie down there too, which hears
them.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.880
Segen shoots her, prompting all the zombies
to run toward them.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.600
Gerry distracts the zombies so the rest can
get to the vault.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.040
Most of them get stuck behind a door.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.120
Only one follows Gerry.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.720
He takes it down without too much trouble.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.240
Suddenly, another one appears, and Gerry gets
him too.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.280
Segen and the doctor get to the vaults but
run into more zombies.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.880
They run and are followed out.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.760
The other doctors open the doors for them
even though they are chased by a group of

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.560
zombies.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.600
They can barely manage to hold the door but
still close it eventually.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.120
Running away, Gerry manages to get to the
vault where the viruses are stored.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.080
He walks inside and tries to open the door
when the phone rings.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.120
The doctor tells him the passcode, and Gerry
walks inside.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.040
He grabs every virus that can fit in a box.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.520
Suddenly, a zombie appears at the door, and
Gerry is left with no other choice but to

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.520
inject himself with one of the viruses.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.200
He gives the others a message for his family,
prepares one of the viruses, and injects it

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.240
into his arm.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.920
Gerry waits for the virus to take hold while
the zombie is still outside of the vault.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.320
After a while, he decides to open the door.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.880
The zombie walks in, but it doesn't attack
him.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.160
His idea worked.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.680
Gerry drinks a can of soda and releases the
mechanism on the soda machine to distract

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.080
the zombies and get them moving in the other
direction.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.440
He walks back to the main facility without
the zombies giving him any trouble.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.800
The doctors give him a vaccine, and he leaves
the facility with Segen.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.360
Gerry goes to find his family in the refugee
camp.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.560
All of them are there waiting for him.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.920
Meanwhile, his idea gets spread out to the
entire world.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.080
The W.H.O. comes up with a vaccine that works
as camouflage, helping people become invisible

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.200
to the zombies.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.440
It gives humankind a chance to fight them
off.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.280
Humans have also devised strategies to annihilate
entire hordes of zombies with either fire

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.000
or with bombs.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.360
Survivors find each other and get prepared
for a war that's just beginning.
