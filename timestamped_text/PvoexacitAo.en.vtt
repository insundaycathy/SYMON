00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.430
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.420
Today, I’m going to explain an action, adventure,
and drama film called “The Book of Eli.”

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.640
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.460
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.570
Pieces of small debris are floating down,
hitting the ground of a dark, gloomy forest.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.109
A gun appears, along with a lifeless body.

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.130
In the background, a cat is scavenging and
looking for something to fill its scrawny

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.130
body.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.970
As the creature is looking for food, another
is doing the same.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.970
A man named Eli is breathing through a gas
mask, gasping for air.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.810
He steadies the aim of his bow, taking the
life of the unsuspecting creature.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.360
While walking through a desolate land, Eli
comes across a rundown car.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.760
He looks for something of use, but all that
is left is the driver’s skeleton.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.839
His next stop is an abandoned house.

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:42.960
He kicks the door open with his gun ready
in his hand.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.159
However, there’s no one there.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.329
He opens the door to a room and is surprised
to see a dead man.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.879
Aside from the smell, the dead man’s shoes
are the first thing he notices.

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.589
He grabs them, taking them out for a spin.

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.989
Walking, grooving, happiness clearly showing
in his face, almost seeming like he isn’t

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.120
in a post-apocalyptic world.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.570
He cooks the cat for dinner, talks to a mouse,
feeds it, and plays some tunes using his iPod,

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.979
all while sharpening his knife and cleaning
his gun like he’s preparing for war.

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.930
He proceeds to clean himself with a K.F.C.
wet wipe revealing his scars, a mural of sorts

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.049
showcasing everything he has been through.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.369
He reveals a book wrapped in cloth and reads
until he drifts off to sleep.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.549
Finally, the morning comes, and with a breath
of fresh air, a glance towards his powerless

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.130
iPod, he returns to his journey.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.579
Eli soon meets a broken and traumatized woman.

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.850
She asks him for help, but he knows better.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.039
He has seen this situation countless times
and could smell the enemies’ unbathed selves’

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.189
miles away.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.560
He shouts for the hijackers to show themselves
and they appear, knocking down their hiding

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.100
spots in the process.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.350
They ask for his belongings, clearly showing
their intent of violence.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.280
However, Eli is unfazed and warns the group’s
leader to keep his hands to himself.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.729
However, the leader doesn’t intend to listen.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.710
Within a split second, like magic, the hand
is cut clean.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.390
Then, with a mix of anger, fear, and shock,
the leader, with one hand, commands the group

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.840
to kill Eli.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.810
Eli survives and kills everyone except for
the woman.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.579
Eli grabs everything of use and leaves some
water for the woman.

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.509
He says his parting words and returns to his
path going west.

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.820
He continues his journey as if nothing happened.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.849
He sits atop a destroyed bridge, observing
a couple getting troubled by a bunch of bikers.

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.720
Deep down, he wants to help, but he will have
to go against his will to stay on the path.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.239
What’s happening isn’t his concern.

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.960
Later on, he finds himself at a crossroads
and goes right.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.720
Eli arrives at a city where a small community
resides.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.950
As a foreigner, the people are wary of him.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.500
He enters a shop and is quickly greeted by
a gun.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.790
He shows his hands to show that he means no
harm, and the owner of the shop checks if

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.560
he is one of them, but Eli assures him that
he is not.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.840
He trades a lighter and a couple of K.F.C.
wet wipes for a full charge on his fathom

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.310
900 battery.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.100
Meanwhile, the same biker group from earlier
comes into town with a bunch of books that

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.470
they give to a powerful man, their boss.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.890
Unfortunately, the book that the man is looking
for isn’t there.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.590
Eli soon enters a dining hall-looking establishment
thirsting for a drink of water.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.099
He sells a piece of cloth and two gloves for
a full refill on his container.

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.640
The bartender calls a woman named Solara,
and she goes to fill the container.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.080
A guy named Martz, who is the leader of the
biker group from earlier, confronts Eli.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.040
Martz shows signs of anger and hostility,
but Eli doesn’t want any trouble.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.209
Feeling trapped, he slams Martz’s face on
the counter while announcing that Martz is

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.620
a murderer of innocent people pertaining to
the couple that they killed earlier.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.110
Martz falls to the floor and Eli then tries
to leave the establishment, but everyone starts

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.489
to block the entrance.

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.860
He has no other choice than to go through
all of them.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.680
He proceeds to take the life of everyone who
tries to attack him.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.239
Solara enters the hall and sees what’s happening,
so she shouts loud enough to stop the chaos.

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.969
More of them arrive, and Eli quickly finds
himself playing nice with the boss.

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:39.280
They begin to interrogate him, asking him
questions about his identity, values, and

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.280
agenda.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.810
He refuses to reply with anything that will
lead to them knowing who he is and what he

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.950
aims to do.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.319
However, Eli and the boss share something
in common; they’re both educated and civilized.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.340
The boss offers him an opportunity to work
for him because he plans to expand his community.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.409
He turns down the offer, stating he has to
go west.

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.930
The boss then invites Eli to stay the night,
providing him a warm bed, food, and water.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.290
He agrees, but he feels as though disagreeing
isn’t an option.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.180
After a while, a blind woman comes into the
room, giving him food and water.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.709
He asks her how that came about, to which
she replies she was born that way.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.780
The woman reports to the boss that Eli is
different and he will not follow him like

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.780
the others.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.390
The boss thinks otherwise and decides to send
Solara to Eli’s room, even though the woman

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.070
begs him not to.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.730
Solara comes in, wearing a revealing nightgown.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.290
She tries to make advances, but Eli respectfully
declines, opening the door for her to leave.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.600
She pleads not to make her go as the boss
named Carnegie will hurt her mother, who happens

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.790
to be the blind woman.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.881
She offers to sleep on the floor and tells
Eli to lie to Carnegie by stating that they

00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:37.130
slept together.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.880
He agrees, and Solara starts asking about
the pre-apocalyptic world.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.910
She sees the book that Eli is hiding.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.070
He asks her where they get their water, but
she insists on telling him only if he tells

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.230
her about the book.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.770
The night ends with them eating and praying
together, resembling a date.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.830
When morning comes, Solara reports to Carnegie
and prays before eating with her mother.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.780
She's unable to finish the prayer, and Carnegie
notices this.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.060
He interrupts the prayer and interrogates
Solara, asking her if she has seen a book

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.500
or read anything.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.650
She refuses to answer, making Carnegie use
violence on her mother to make Solara talk.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.500
Finally, with no choice, she breaks and tells
Carnegie about the book with a leather cover

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.570
and a crucifix on the front.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.220
Carnegie and his men search for Eli, but he
is gone.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.590
Carnegie’s right-hand man then shoots the
ignorant guard looking after him.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.910
Meanwhile, Eli gets the battery from the shop
and then meets guns pointing at him as soon

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.260
as he steps out.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.050
Carnegie asks for the book, showing his intent
to kill.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.440
He wants the book for the power it has—the
power of faith and belief.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.480
Carnegie pitches the idea of a community and
a world where people are united by faith.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.740
Saying the book shouldn’t be kept by one
person but distributed to all.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.840
Eli shows a desire for that as well, but not
with Carnegie.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.310
Carnegie orders his right-hand man to shoot
Eli, but every bullet just seems to graze

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.460
and miss him.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.930
Then all hell breaks loose; Eli starts to
shoot with pinpoint accuracy hitting them

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.900
one by one while no shot is hitting him as
if he has the power of God protecting him.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.270
Finally, he hit Carnegie’s leg with a shotgun,
signaling the end of the brief battle.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.410
All that is left is him and the right-hand
man lowering his gun, allowing him to walk

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.630
away.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.830
Solara runs after Eli, but he doesn’t want
anything to do with her.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.750
However, she grabs his attention with a single
phrase.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.470
Solara says that she will take him to where
they get their water.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.070
So they make a visit to the spring, and as
they exit, Eli says to Solara that he forgot

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.800
his sunglasses inside.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.930
And her gullible self goes into the cave,
making it too easy for him to lock her from

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.160
the other side.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.410
He then expresses that the road is no place
for someone like her, to which she responds

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.480
with an unpleasant curse word.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.490
Carnegie is screeching in pain while someone
is fixing up his leg.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.870
He announces that they will go after Eli,
but his right-hand man shows dismay because

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.880
he doesn’t understand why they would go
to such lengths for a book.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.000
Carnegie argues it’s not just a book but
rather a priceless commodity.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.350
The right-hand man contracts a deal stating
that he will give his utmost loyalty in exchange

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.640
for Solara, and Carnegie laughingly agrees.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.240
They bring out their vehicles and start their
journey west in search of Eli.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.370
Solara is lost in the middle of the road.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.140
There she meets a familiar scene of a woman
asking for help.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.521
Solara offers her assistance, but the injured
woman tries to say she doesn’t need any

00:06:54.521 --> 00:06:56.130
and asks her to leave.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.080
She is stubborn, and that stubbornness leads
to her screaming as two thugs manhandle her.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.270
As she shouts for help and the feeling of
hopelessness grows, an arrow pierces through

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.870
the pants of the thug.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.690
Eli arrives at the scene just in time to rescue
her.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.780
Carnegie and his men arrive at the place of
the thugs who harmed Solara.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.940
They decide to stop for the night and plan
to make ground early in the morning.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.740
Meanwhile, Eli squats down to read his book.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.610
Solara asks him if he reads the book every
day and requests for him to read some to her.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.740
He obliges and starts a sermon just like a
priest to his listeners.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.580
He then explains why the book is just not
any book; it is the only one of its kind left.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.970
The rest of the copies are now ashes, and
its words and lessons are only memories to

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:31.970
some.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.580
He then tells more of how everything was before,
during, and after the war—telling a story

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.460
of how the sky opened up, burning everything
and everyone, leaving a lucky few that survived.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.750
And him being one of them.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.710
On how he got the book, he relays events that
start with a voice coming from inside of him.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.320
He follows it, leading him to the book under
a pile of rubble.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.860
Then, the voice instructs him to embark west
and go on a seemingly endless walk.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.760
Driving through the long road, Carnegie signals
his men to stop.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.070
They venture into an abandoned nuclear power
plant that the two stayed in the night before.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.570
Solara discovers that Eli has been walking
for over thirty years, and not once has he

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.240
thought that he is lost because he carries
his faith with every step.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.100
And his direction isn’t governed by just
sight.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.040
The two encounter an abandoned house.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.450
They approach cautiously with Eli leading
the way.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.660
With a slight turn of a doorknob, they find
themselves in a pitfall.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.240
The door opens, introducing an old woman,
and her husband looks down and threatens the

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.240
two.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.640
However, the old woman shows a shard of kindness
in her heart and invites them for a cup of

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.640
tea.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.130
A couple of sips in, a friendly bond starts
to form, and the old man invites the two outside.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.080
Before their eyes are graves lined up.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.659
Eli and Solara quickly assume that these were
from people the old couple killed and ate,

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:39.479
as Eli observes that the old woman’s hands
were shaking, meaning she is a cannibal.

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:43.159
They make their way out, but suddenly, they
see Carnegie and his men.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:47.459
They lock themselves in, and with no hesitation,
the old man lifts the cushions on his couch,

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:50.779
revealing a motherlode of weapons foreseeing
the chaos that is about to ensue.

00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:54.300
With a megaphone, Carnegie voices out his
requests which are Solara and the book.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.620
To their surprise, a book wrapped in cloth
flies out of a window.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.980
They begin to open it, and to a bigger surprise,
the book turns out to be a makeshift bomb.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.350
The timer goes off and causes a car to flip
from the explosion accompanied by the sound

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.639
of flesh hitting the ground and bullets firing.

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:10.670
The rain of ammunition punctures the house
through, with the holes showing the scenery

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.040
from the other side.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.310
They survive the onslaught, but the battlefield
is soon flipped upside down with the sight

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.310
of a bazooka.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.949
Carnegie’s right-hand man fires it, decimating
the old man’s wife, and he follows soon

00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:22.060
thereafter in a spur of rage.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.899
The disparity between the forces grows significantly
when a mounted machine gun introduces itself

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.080
to the fold.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.920
Their chances are thin; Eli and Solara realize
that there is no way out of this and soon

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.220
accept their fate.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.769
Carnegie asks him where the book is, but he
chooses not to reply, so they start searching

00:09:35.769 --> 00:09:36.880
for the book in his bag.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.860
It is nowhere to be seen.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.620
As a test of his fortitude, his eyes show
no fear in the sight of Carnegie’s gun.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.640
However, he does not realize that all his
strength falters because of this one weakness,

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.640
Solara.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.649
This leaves him no choice but to reveal where
the book is located.

00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:53.839
With the book in the wrong hands, Eli’s
faith has also left him.

00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:57.470
And with a pull of a trigger, he would stand
no more, and he would walk no more.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.910
With his dying breath and his body weak, his
strong faith gives up on him.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:04.339
Carnegie asks for his prayers and goes on
his way with a defeated Solara in his possession

00:10:04.339 --> 00:10:05.490
once again.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.990
But a sudden spark of fight lights up inside
of Solara; in her hands is a rope she uses

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.889
to strangle the driver causing a commotion
in the vehicle.

00:10:11.889 --> 00:10:14.730
With her gashed face, she gathers her thoughts
and acts quickly.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.660
A convenient grenade presents itself in the
seat of the car.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.080
She throws it across, and the grenade rolls
underneath the truck and explodes.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.930
Carnegie’s eyes exude the frustration he
feels.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.930
With her plan unexpectedly working, Solara
gets into the car, and a moment of shock occurs

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.699
as Carnegie’s right-hand man gets a hold
of her arm.

00:10:30.699 --> 00:10:34.579
But the hold isn’t a forceful one; instead,
it is a weak grasp, indicating that he’s

00:10:34.579 --> 00:10:36.269
letting go and saying goodbye.

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:39.870
Solara notices a blade that belonged to Eli
is piercing his chest.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.620
Without any fuel left, Carnegie decides not
to go after Solara, marking the end of his

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.620
chase.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.430
Solara drives to the house in search of Eli,
but he is nowhere to be found.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.959
Eli isn’t outside the house because his
journey isn’t over; instead, he walks down

00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:54.520
the long road going west, and Solara finds
him.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.949
Together in the car, they drive towards the
still unknown destination.

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:01.089
She apologizes for the trouble she caused
and for making the man give up the book.

00:11:01.089 --> 00:11:04.640
But, Eli soon realizes that what made him
give up the book was not the girl in danger

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.010
but the desire to do for others more than
he does for himself.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.759
Carnegie has the book in his hands, but he
soon finds out that it is locked.

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:14.540
Eli smells the ocean displaying his exceptional
olfactory senses.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.999
They’re now driving across the sea on a
bridge that’s still standing.

00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:21.149
She hit the breaks, and they start to go on
foot to get to the other side.

00:11:21.149 --> 00:11:24.720
The two ride a boat by the shore, taking turns
rowing and both feeling the coldness of the

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.779
ocean breeze.

00:11:25.779 --> 00:11:29.790
A man shouts from afar, cautiously asking
what their business with the place is.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.420
Eli introduces himself, claiming he has a
King James Bible in his possession, knowing

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.800
he does not.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.779
Back in the city, the engineer from the shop
shakingly attempts to open the locked Bible.

00:11:38.779 --> 00:11:42.779
Meanwhile, Eli and Solara successfully enter
the heavily-guarded place.

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:46.290
What meets them is a man and a plethora of
people, books, and machinery making up an

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:50.000
organization that aims to inform the rest
of humanity about the world they’ve lost.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.170
They have all sorts of documents ranging from
Mozart to Shakespeare, but they don’t have

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.889
a bible, which Eli claims he has.

00:11:55.889 --> 00:12:00.370
Back in the city, a few clicks and a few turns
after, the engineer finally picks the lock.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.019
And there, Carnegie has the secret to power
in his hands.

00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:06.160
The excitement on his face quickly turns into
sorrow and confusion.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.259
At the same time, Eli asks for some paper
and a lot of it.

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:12.660
Carnegie realizes that the book is not blank,
but it just doesn’t contain ink as it’s

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.880
written in braille.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.950
And with thirty years of reading or feeling
the book, Eli knows it by memory and by heart.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.779
As Eli speaks the book of Genesis verse by
verse, the irony rises as to how the verse

00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:24.529
“Let there be Light” sheds light on the
truth that Eli could not see the light as

00:12:24.529 --> 00:12:26.450
he is revealed to be blind.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.980
As a last attempt by Carnegie to receive the
word of God, he calls upon the blind mother

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.069
of Solara.

00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:35.160
A faint smile is seen on her face as she touches
the braille writing; unfortunately, she can’t

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.689
remember how to interpret it.

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:39.980
The infected leg of Carnegie is eating him
up, diminishing him to his weakest point and

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.459
with no one by his side.

00:12:41.459 --> 00:12:46.009
Solara’s mother teases him, making him realize
that he reaps what he sows, and this is Carnegie’s

00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:47.009
harvest.

00:12:47.009 --> 00:12:50.529
He sits leaning on a rail, observing as everything
he built turns into ash.

00:12:50.529 --> 00:12:54.579
There lies Eli, like a patient to a therapist,
speaking the word of God.

00:12:54.579 --> 00:12:58.540
Speaking his message of gratitude as his journey
to the west ends with God as his destination.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:10.269
With this, a new journey arises, Solara with
Eli’s blade and iPod, finds her way back

00:13:10.269 --> 00:13:11.999
home.
