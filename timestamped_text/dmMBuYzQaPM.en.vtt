00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.080
Welcome to Movie Shortens. Follow&nbsp;
us today to a movie titled:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.880
ATM. Be aware, there are spoilers!
&nbsp;

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.800
The movie begins with a mysterious man sitting in&nbsp;
his house. He is focused on drawing and measuring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.040
diagrams onto a printed map. He then puts on&nbsp;
a coat and leaves the house in a hurry.
&nbsp;

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.120
At a busy financial company, David is in an&nbsp;
uneasy conversation with his client on the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.760
As he hangs up, his co-worker, Corey comes&nbsp;
over and cheers him up. Corey suggests David&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.600
asking out Emily, a coworker, for a date after the&nbsp;
company Christmas party As David has had a crush&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.880
on the girl for quite some time. Hesitating,&nbsp;
David thinks it’s not a good idea especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.480
since the girl plans to leave the company at the&nbsp;
year’s end. Corey, argues it is now or never.
&nbsp;

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.680
At night, David and Corey have a lot of fun at&nbsp;
the party. David tries to catch up with Emily,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.520
but both of them appear to be&nbsp;
embarrassed and nervous. Eventually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.040
David asks Emily if she’d like a ride home. 
Just then, Corey, who is completely drunk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.640
asks David for a lift to his house, only 10&nbsp;
minutes away. Reluctantly, David has to help, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.320
made a promise to Corey earlier to drive him home.&nbsp;
During the ride, the three talk and laugh as Corey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.080
appears to be very funny. Since Corey’s phone was&nbsp;
lost at the party, he asks David to borrow his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.960
However, the phone soon runs out of battery.
It is almost 2 a.m and freezing outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.960
Corey insists on having pizza and begs David to&nbsp;
stop at a nearby ATM for cash so he can buy his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.320
food. David offers to pay by card but Corey says&nbsp;
that the restaurant doesn’t accept cards. Again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.120
David patiently accepts his friend’s demand.
At the ATM, the couple wait inside the car as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.720
Corey withdraws money. Just then, Corey signals&nbsp;
David as he is having a card problem. Being cold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.840
and alone in the car, Emily decides to join the&nbsp;
men in the kiosk. She carefully locks the car but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.960
it doesn’t work. When she enters the ATM, David&nbsp;
lets her know that the lock has been broken, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.760
they won’t take long, so she shouldn’t worry.
He then takes some cash from the ATM as Corey is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.680
denied for unknown reasons. As the trio&nbsp;
turn their back and prepare to leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.480
they notice a figure. He’s wearing a coat&nbsp;
and has appeared from nowhere. Emily thinks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.040
its very strange as she doesn’t see his car&nbsp;
around. David thinks it could be a robber. 
&nbsp;

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.880
Thinking the man only needs to use the ATM, Corey&nbsp;
tells the two to stop imagining and let the man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.840
use the machine. Corey shouts out asking if the&nbsp;
man wants to get inside, but gets no response.
&nbsp;

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.680
He stands there in the dark and looks at the three&nbsp;
of them. Suddenly, a dog walker appears behind the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.800
man. The man rushes to the dog walker and grabs&nbsp;
his head with his large hand. In a second, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.640
poor man is smashed in the head, killing him. 
Terrified, the three try to call 911. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.400
they learn that David’s phone is charging in the&nbsp;
car, Corey’s is lost and Emilys’ is in her purse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.520
also in the car. They have no choice but to&nbsp;
look for emergency buttons inside the kiosk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.560
but they find none.
Meanwhile, the man just stands there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.120
watching them after just coldly killing a person.&nbsp;
The friends are very worried and try thinking of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.720
a way to get rid of the man. David asks Emily to&nbsp;
give him his car key. Corey tries to stop him from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.920
going out. David thinks he can manage to run to&nbsp;
the car to take his phone and call the police.
&nbsp;

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.600
Strange enough, the man approaches&nbsp;
David's car, taking out a tool box,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.760
they stand there dumbfounded. The man goes&nbsp;
to the back of the kiosk instead of entering.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.840
It turns out he’s used the tool kit, breaking the&nbsp;
ATM’s heater. They become more scared as the man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.720
isn’t attacking as he did to the dog walker.
David hits the enclosing glass, hoping to set off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.680
the ATM’s alarm, but it doesn’t work. Emily stops&nbsp;
him and says that they should wait inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.400
booth as the man hasn’t yet attempted to enter.&nbsp;
David argues that they would die from freezing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.240
before being confronted by the man.
David and Corey then kick the ATM,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.040
trying to set off the alarm. Again, nothing&nbsp;
happens. Corey spots a police car, the three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.840
yell out to get its attention. However, the&nbsp;
car only passes by to their disappointment.
&nbsp;

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.720
Seeing that the man is not around, David suggests&nbsp;
giving the man their money and jewels. He slowly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.720
steps outside with Emily’s earrings, Corey’s watch&nbsp;
and his $500. He offers the man the property and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.440
pleads with him to let them go. The man stands&nbsp;
at one side of the kiosk and doesn’t say a word.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.320
Thinking the man has accepted the deal, David&nbsp;
tosses the envelope so the man can take a look.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.320
As he picks up the cash, David ceases&nbsp;
the chance, running to his car.
&nbsp;

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.160
The man quickly pursues him. As David&nbsp;
attempts to start the car, he finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.680
the wires have been destroyed. Running out of&nbsp;
time, he picks up Emily’s phone and dials 911.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.480
The man strikes the window, dragging David from&nbsp;
the car. As he is about to kill David, Corey and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.760
Emily scream from the kiosk. This distracts the&nbsp;
man long enough for David to get up and run back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.240
The man doesn’t give chase, and instead collects&nbsp;
the envelope along with Emily’s phone, throwing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.440
them back into the car. Scared and cold, Emily&nbsp;
uses her lipstick to write “HELP” on the door. 
&nbsp;

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.720
As time goes by the three begin to freeze, and&nbsp;
a security guard, who sees the message from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.840
window, drives over to investigate. He notices&nbsp;
a body and steps out to see what has happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.280
The trio try to warn him about the man, however he&nbsp;
cannot hear them due to the strong howling winds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.040
He is then beaten to death by the man&nbsp;
with a tire iron. The friends are shocked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.600
and speechless seeing the bloody scene.
Suddenly, the man enters the booth. David and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.960
Corey fight him back, the only choice they have.&nbsp;
They kill the man, strangling him with a wire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.600
Thinking that they have got rid of him, the three&nbsp;
begin seeing yet another man outside the booth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.720
It turns out the man they killed&nbsp;
was just a normal guy named Harley,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.240
who was wearing a similar coat. 
The friends start to blame each other for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.520
their stupid actions. Corey and David fight while&nbsp;
Emily tries to stop them. Tired and hopeless,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.040
Corey storms out to escape alone disregarding his&nbsp;
friends suggestions otherwise. He's tripped up by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.840
a wire the man has set up. The man stabs&nbsp;
Corey with a screwdriver. He then returns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.320
to the back door of the ATM continuing&nbsp;
his mysterious work with a fire hose.
&nbsp;

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.240
Seeing that Corey is still alive, Emily and&nbsp;
David run out to bring him back in before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.120
the man can catch them. The two manage to stop&nbsp;
Corey’s bleeding and keep him warm. Just then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.040
the man pushes David’s car in front of the ATM&nbsp;
and leaves. The ATM kiosk begins to fill with cold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.080
water through the heating vents. The two struggle&nbsp;
to lift Corey up above the water, but they can’t.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.240
David finds a lighter in one of Harley’s&nbsp;
pockets, and starts a fire using the flyers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.760
in the booth as fuel. However, Corey has died&nbsp;
due to his wound and the hypothermic water. 
&nbsp;

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.400
Meanwhile, the man sits on a folding chair&nbsp;
watching his victims from afar. Emily climbs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.280
on David's shoulders, managing to get the flame&nbsp;
close enough to the fire alarm triggering a loud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.320
distress signal. They have finally made it,&nbsp;
but David slips and causes Emily to fall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.280
she smashes her head on a shelf and dies.
While grieving for Emily, David sees the security&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.480
guard’s car ram into his car, which crashes&nbsp;
through the wall. Pissed at the evil man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.200
David uses Corey’s bottle of wine and turns&nbsp;
it into a torch. He throws it to the man who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.840
sitting on the chair. However, it is revealed to&nbsp;
be the security man’s body wearing the same coat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.840
driving David more crazy. The real man is still&nbsp;
alive and watches David from a distance.
&nbsp;

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.840
There are police cars rushing to&nbsp;
the ATM, the man quickly vanishes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.600
David is arrested as the cops find five casualties&nbsp;
in the area. They review the ATM video recording,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.800
but there's no audio. It looks like David, Corey,&nbsp;
and Emily were robbing the ATM and murdering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.080
witnesses. David shows to have murdered his two&nbsp;
friends on the soundless tape. No images nor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.400
signs of the man appear during the playback.
At the end of the movie, we learn that the man is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.840
a serial killer with very detailed and intelligent&nbsp;
plans. He carries out similar ATM attacks and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.280
blames it on the last survivor. David, Emily,&nbsp;
and Corey are his latest innocent victims. Only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.480
his coat is ever found at the crime scenes.
