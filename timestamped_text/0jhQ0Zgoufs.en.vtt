00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.569
Detective Recapped here. Today, I'm going
to explain a Mystery-Romance film called:

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.780
"Killing Me Softly." Spoilers ahead! Watch
out and take care.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.309
As a group of mountaineers climbs a snowy
cliff, a woman describes how the brain dies

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.670
from a lack of oxygen once a person reaches
a certain altitude. The brain just shuts down,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.019
and the body goes along with it. The woman
says she can't stop thinking about what it

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.450
must have been like, and the person she's
talking to asks her to start from the beginning,

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.470
so she tells him her whole story.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.609
An American woman named Alice describes her
life in London with her boyfriend, Jake. Alice

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.350
says she grew up on the plains in Indiana
and that she's always been a flatlander. She

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.440
had already been staying in London for a year
and a half, and the first six months have

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.220
been hard on her, but that changed upon meeting
Jake. Alice is a CD-Roms and Website designer,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.060
while Jake is an engineer.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.921
One day, Alice is about to cross the street
when she encounters a charming stranger. She

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:50.560
is completely enthralled by him as they cross,
and his very presence distracts her even after

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.559
they parted ways. Alice starts heading inside
her office, but she takes another look at

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.930
him and sees him entering a bookstore.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.300
After being continually distracted and unsettled
at work, she finally heads out. Peeking inside

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.570
the bookstore, she sees that the man is waiting
in line with his friend. He looks at her,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.680
embarrassing her, so she steps back and hides.
When she's finally about to go inside, Alice

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.630
finds herself face to face with the man, with
only the glass separating them.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.730
She accepted the stranger's offer to get inside
a cab with him. Inside the car, the sensual

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.580
tension between them hangs heavy in the air.
After the man takes Alice home, he grabs her

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.560
from behind and starts kissing her. Alice
then kisses him back, and it isn't long before

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.030
they make torrid and passionate love. Once
they're done, Alice dresses and turns away,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.831
embarrassed and perhaps even regretful. After
softly asking her to face him, the stranger

00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:37.810
helps her put on her undergarment. Maintaining
a gentle tone, he invites her to come back

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.950
to his house again, but Alice keeps insisting
that she can't. In the end, he assures her

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.240
that she can come over whenever she wants
and that he'll be there when she does. That

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.770
night, Alice makes love with Jake, but it
feels different and not nearly as thrilling

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.680
as it did when she slept with the stranger.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.970
The following day, Alice passes by the bookstore
with the hopes of seeing the stranger again.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.210
Instead, she sees a poster of him along with
his book. There, she learns that the man is

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.440
Adam Tallis, a mountain climber who saved
six people with no oxygen. After buying Adam's

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.500
book, Alice goes straight to Adam's house,
where she finds him waiting for her by the

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.000
door. The two make love once more, and afterwards,
they lie on the floor.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.250
Now resting, Alice tells Adam that she bought
his book. He corrects her, saying that it's

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.470
not his book; he's just in it. When she comments
that it looks good, he simply retorts that

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.310
people died. Adam gets up to smoke, then starts
telling Alice what happened. According to

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.980
Adam, he lost the whole group of mountaineers
he was with, including the woman he loved,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.030
Francoise Collette. There was no room for
error, everything had been checked, yet he

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.330
still doesn't know what happened. He then
asks Alice if he knows what it's like over

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.230
20,000 feet, and when Alice shakes her head,
Adam stands and snatches his goldfish from

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.450
the aquarium. Adam shows Alice the fish as
it struggles to breathe, saying that's exactly

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.400
how it feels. Without air, the brain cells
die. Once the brain shuts down, the rest of

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.550
the body follows. He then puts the fish back,
saying that it's been two years, but the feeling

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.330
doesn't go away. Alice then kisses Adam before
finally confessing that she lives with someone.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.840
Adam doesn't seem to mind, though, and when
Alice begins putting on her underwear, he

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.840
tells her not to.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.630
At home, Alice unexpectedly tells Jake that
she has to leave him. Shocked, Jake walks

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.060
up to her and hugs her, and as Alice cries,
Jake insists that they're perfect together

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.230
and that he wants to marry her. Stifling a
sob, she admits that she met somebody, and

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.430
while Jake tries to keep himself from exploding,
all Alice could say is that she didn't mean

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.760
to hurt him. Finally, Jake lets out his anger
and turns over a small table, while Alice

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.820
only listens to him before walking out.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.770
After heading to Adam's place, Alice meets
his sister, Deborah. She lets Alice know that

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.740
Adam isn't there at the moment before inviting
her inside. There, Deborah explains that Adam's

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.401
having some work done on his place, so he
stayed in her house while she was gone. As

00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:37.380
she arranges her photos, Deborah explains
Adam's aversion to looking at them. Alice

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.290
points to a woman in one of the pictures,
asking if it's Francoise. Deborah confirms

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.430
this and tells her that Adam can't look at
the photos because it's hard for him to see

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.380
Francoise. While he's a brave guy, he can
get scared of remembering, and he forgets

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.100
that the accident wasn't solely his fault.
Deborah adds that she was with the mountaineers

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.319
when the accident happened and that Francoise
was her best friend. Finally, Deborah calls

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.560
Alice by name for the first time, and she
compliments her on her beauty, saying that

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.770
she can see why Adam fell so hard for her.
After that, Alice asks her for Adam's address.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.270
Upon finding Adam's place, Alice rings his
doorbell several times, but there is no answer.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.150
When Adam finally shows up, he hugs Alice
tightly as she tells him that she left Jake.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.220
She starts telling Adam that he's hurting
her, but he ignores this and starts eagerly

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.830
kissing her. As usual, Alice returns his kiss,
ends up against a wall, and the two sleep

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.460
together again. The following morning, Alice
wakes up alone in bed, and when she gets out,

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.790
she sees Adam downstairs just coming in with
a woman. Adam introduces Joanna Noble to Alice,

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.220
and Joanna informs her that she's a reporter
from The Guardian, tasked to interview Adam

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.680
about his Himalayan clean-up project.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.550
After greeting the reporter, Alice tries looking
for a shirt in Adam's closet but finds it

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.670
locked. Adam watches Alice going through his
drawer and finding a key, only to put it back.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.260
Finally, she settles on the shirt that's on
the chair, and when Adam's phone rings, she

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.180
informs him about it. Adam then tells her
to answer it for him, and when she does, there's

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.550
nobody on the other line. Soon, Alice tells
him that she needs to go to work, and Adam

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.500
kisses her before asking her to see him afterwards.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.120
Adam takes Alice wall climbing, where Deborah
sees her and helps her put on her harness.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.730
As Adam gets down from the wall, he gently
pulls Deborah aside, saying he'll take it

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.050
from there. When he finished helping Alice
with her harness, Alice gets introduced to

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.490
Klaus, and she tells him that she liked his
book.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.730
Later on, Alice meets up with her friend,
Sylvie. She disapproves of Alice destroying

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.520
her and Jake's lives by letting go of a man
who loves her just for a good bang. Alice

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.450
tries to defend herself by saying that when
she's with Adam, everything is just more.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.850
As the two leave the bar, a man suddenly mugs
Alice before immediately running away.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.070
Witnessing the whole thing, Adam chases the
guy and catches up to him by the telephone

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.770
booth, where he smashes the mugger's head
against the glass and beats him up badly.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.000
Alice and Sylvie catch up to them, and Alice
tells Sylvie to call the cops while she runs

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.389
to Adam, telling him to stop. When Adam finally
relents, he embraces Alice and kisses her

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.040
deeply, promising her that that will never
happen again and that he will protect her.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.131
The sight shocks Sylvie, but Adam and Alice
pay her no mind and start walking away. Out

00:05:50.131 --> 00:05:54.230
of the blue, Adam proposes to Alice, saying
the sooner they get married, the better, and

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.910
Alice joyfully accepts.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.270
One day, Alice receives a mysterious letter,
asking her what she really knows about Adam.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.830
She shows Adam the telegram and informs him
about the call from that morning, saying someone

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.639
was on the line, but they weren't talking.
Adam says someone is just scaring her, and

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.100
as he lets her in his car, he reminds Alice
to tell him if anything like that happens

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.830
again. They then drive to Adam's family church
by the countryside to get married, where they

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.620
have two strangers as their witnesses. After
the ceremony, they get dressed at the way

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.460
station for hikers, where Adam takes a picture
of Alice while still naked.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.810
They change into their hiking outfits, and
as Alice recalls what she did with Adam to

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.100
celebrate their marriage, the person she's
telling her story to is surprised to learn

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.770
that they went hiking on their wedding day.
As they walk in the wilderness, Alice quickly

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.610
gets worn out and sits down. Because of that,
Adam promises to give her an unforgettable

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.419
honeymoon then teaches her how to conserve
her energy. Adam then goes ahead, leaving

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.410
Alice by herself. Since she wants Adam to
be proud of her, she follows the trail for

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.000
hours until she finally reaches his cabin.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.770
Inside, Adam makes an anchor and gives Alice
a long piece of silk, explaining that the

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.970
anchor is for catching a falling body. Without
hesitation, Alice lets Adam wrap the silk

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.780
around her neck and hook it on the anchor,
giving him control over her body. She lets

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.960
Adam decide when she can and cannot breathe,
and finally, after making love, Adam tells

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.860
her that he loves her. Alice continues her
story, recounting that they returned to London

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.840
and Joanna Noble's article came out. She was
happier than she'd ever been.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.630
As Alice gets home one day, she receives another
mysterious letter, warning her that marrying

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.551
Adam was a mistake. She quickly calls Jake
but gets surprised when Sylvie answers the

00:07:18.551 --> 00:07:22.590
phone. Sylvie tells Alice that she and Jake
have been seeing each other, but Alice doesn't

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.810
seem to mind. From the shower, Adam calls
Alice and tells her they'll be late, so Alice

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.160
ends the call with Sylvie. This time, Alice
doesn't show Adam the letter. They attend

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.210
a gathering together, and Alice feels completely
out of place. After looking at a picture of

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.889
Adam with Francoise, Alice goes to the bathroom,
where Deborah sees her wiping off her lipstick.

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:44.009
When Deborah asks if she's okay, Alice tells
her that she has a headache. To help her,

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:47.449
Deborah massages her hand and neck, and once
she's better, Alice thanks her sister-in-law.

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:51.770
Then, Deborah asks Alice to close her eyes,
and when she does, Deborah puts a necklace

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.120
around her neck. Downstairs, Klaus proposes
a toast to Alice, announcing that she has

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.820
conquered Adam. When Adam sees Alice with
his sister, he suddenly gets uncomfortable

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.280
but hugs them both anyway.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.660
While in a meeting, Alice receives a call
from Joanna and informs her that she's just

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.900
received a weird note about Adam's article.
Alice receives the note through the fax machine.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.570
It's from a woman who claims that Adam had
defiled her, and she's asking Joanna to report

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.900
the truth. Alice then receives the continuation
of the letter, which shows the name and contact

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.550
number of the sender, Michelle Stowe, who
says that she'll reveal the real story.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.860
Upset, Alice leaves the office and goes to
Michelle's place. Meanwhile, Adam calls Alice's

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.000
office and learns that she's just left. Posing
as Joanna, Alice interviews Michelle about

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.009
the incident. Michelle recounts it to Alice,
saying she and Adam were kissing at a party

00:08:33.009 --> 00:08:36.499
that time and before she knew it, Adam was
pulling her into the bushes and started forcing

00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:40.740
himself on her until he overpowered her. Michelle
then sarcastically asks Alice if she'll write

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.380
an article about it, adding that they can
make some money out of it. However, Alice

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.389
tells her it doesn't work that way, especially
since she has no proof against Adam. Later

00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:52.860
that day, Alice meets Joanna, who is unhappy
about what Alice did. She tells Alice that

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.800
she could get fired for her carelessness,
and Alice apologizes to her. Alice says she's

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.160
just really curious, but Joanna tells her
that curiosity gets people killed. Alice resolves

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.209
that she should trust Adam, and the two women
prepare to leave. Meanwhile, someone outside

00:09:05.209 --> 00:09:07.110
the coffee shop puts out a cigarette.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.880
That night, Alice contemplates how little
she knows about Adam. She's musing about how

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.800
everything she knows about him either came
from a book, a newspaper, or even shreds of

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.990
information from other people. With a strong
desire to know more, Alice takes the key that

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.660
she saw in the drawer the other day and opens
Adam's closet. In there, she finds a box of

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.590
letters from a woman named Adele Blanchard.
As she reads them, Alice learns that Adam

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:30.389
used to have an affair with a married woman.
Adele is telling Adam in her letters that

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:34.220
she's going back to her husband, and that
what they're doing is dangerous. Suddenly,

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.720
Adam arrives, and Alice hurriedly puts back
the letters inside the closet, struggling

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.689
to close it properly. When she finally does,
Alice greets Adam as if nothing happened.

00:09:42.689 --> 00:09:46.240
The following morning, Adam informs Alice
that he called her office the previous day,

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.689
and her colleague said she was out. Alice
stammers that she had a doctor's appointment

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:54.269
but wasn't able to leave her meeting. Skeptical,
Adam asks where exactly the meeting was held,

00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:58.259
and Alice nervously answers that it was at
The Hilton. Though he remains unconvinced,

00:09:58.259 --> 00:10:02.129
Adam apologizes to her for being nosy. He
then shows Alice her necklace and asks where

00:10:02.129 --> 00:10:06.050
she got it from, and Alice says Deborah gave
it to her. For a moment, there's a trace of

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:10.069
disbelief and uneasiness on Adam's face, but
it disappears quickly as he smiles, saying

00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:13.610
Deborah has good taste. As Adam reads the
newspaper, Alice tells him about Michelle

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.980
Stowe's note and accusation. Adam is quick
to deny it, saying it never happened, and

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.980
that he's not surprised that Michelle contacted
her. Adam then apologizes to Alice for having

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:26.910
to hear that story, and before she could reply,
Klaus shows up to take Adam to a talk show.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.899
Once they're gone, Alice goes through Adam's
drawer again to find the key to the closet,

00:10:29.899 --> 00:10:34.089
but it isn't there. Suddenly, she hears the
sound of the wind chime from the front door,

00:10:34.089 --> 00:10:38.079
and she immediately checks to see if Adam
is back. When she opens the door, Alice finds

00:10:38.079 --> 00:10:41.640
a package on the floor, containing a letter
that asks her how far she'll let Adam go and

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:46.040
a long piece of silk with bloodstains, similar
to the one Adam used on her during their honeymoon.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.170
Alice then quickly calls the Directory Inquiries
and asks if they have a listing for Adele

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:53.640
Blanchard on Marchmont Road. Posing as Joanna
again, Alice goes to Adele's house, where

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.430
Adele's mother greets her.

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.449
Alice learns from her that Adele's been missing
for eight months, and after Adele's mother

00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:02.720
invites her inside, she tells Alice that Adele
hasn't even contacted her husband, Michael.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.569
Then, she shows her Adele's photo album, where
she finds Adam in one of Adele's wedding pictures.

00:11:07.569 --> 00:11:10.649
Adele's mother says her daughter used to climb
with Adam all the time, but that stopped two

00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:14.569
years after she got married. She says Michael
got fed up with Adele's mountain climbing,

00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:19.019
so in the end, Adele chose to stop. To her
horror, Alice also sees a naked photo of Adele

00:11:19.019 --> 00:11:23.139
standing beside an angel's statue at the place
where they got married. Then, Adele's mother

00:11:23.139 --> 00:11:27.119
mentions that Adam called her, asking for
updates on the investigation. When Adele's

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:31.389
mother tells Alice that Adam is also coming,
Alice immediately excuses herself and leaves,

00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:35.309
secretly taking two photos of Adele. She throws
away her package before boarding the train

00:11:35.309 --> 00:11:37.509
while repeatedly looking behind her.

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:41.480
That evening, Alice is startled when she suddenly
sees Adam in the dark corner of their house,

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.749
smoking. Adam then puts out his cigarette
and picks Alice up before binding her on the

00:11:44.749 --> 00:11:49.050
table. Alice tries to protest, but Adam ignores
her and accuses her of being with another

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:53.480
man. When Alice denies it, Adam asks her why
she keeps sneaking around, and that's when

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.129
she admits that she's found Adele's letters.
Furious, Adam goes upstairs to retrieve the

00:11:57.129 --> 00:12:01.129
letters and starts throwing them down to Alice,
saying he has nothing to hide. When he goes

00:12:01.129 --> 00:12:05.690
back down, Alice asks him to untie her, but
Adam only sits on the floor and cries, lamenting

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.499
over how she wouldn't be in that position
if she trusted him.

00:12:08.499 --> 00:12:11.709
Trying to get Adam's sympathy, Alice says
she just wanted to know him more so that she

00:12:11.709 --> 00:12:15.440
could love him more. While he's crying, Adam
assures Alice that he's hers, and that he

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.709
loves her so much, he can break her neck.
Adam then asks if she likes what they're doing,

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:23.489
but she doesn't answer his question and instead
tells him that she needs to pee. After Adam

00:12:23.489 --> 00:12:27.199
unties her, Alice escapes his house through
the fire exit, and Adam quickly goes after

00:12:27.199 --> 00:12:31.149
her, begging her to stop. As she hides from
Adam, Alice witnesses how he could lose his

00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:33.499
temper over small things and throw a fit.

00:12:33.499 --> 00:12:37.309
Finally, it's revealed that the person Alice
has been talking to is a Senior Police Officer,

00:12:37.309 --> 00:12:40.490
and she explains that that's when she came
to him. She asks him if they can open Adele

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.920
Blanchard's case, but the officer says it's
not easy to open a case like Adele's. Alice

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.410
retorts that Adam killed Adele, but the officer
says she has no proof of that. Still determined

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:53.180
to have Adam arrested, Alice tells him that
Adam forced himself on Michelle, but the officer

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.339
curtly replies that Michelle never reported
it. The only proof she has is the two photographs

00:12:57.339 --> 00:13:01.819
of Adele, which prove nothing. The officer
then shows Adam through the double-sided glass,

00:13:01.819 --> 00:13:05.430
telling the officers about Alice's escape
in the other interrogation room. She hears

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.689
Adam saying he loves her, and the officer
tells Alice that even though he believes Adam

00:13:08.689 --> 00:13:12.829
has the potential for violence, he isn't sure
if he's a murderer. After closing the blinds,

00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:16.350
the officer informs Alice that they can only
keep Adam for a few hours, adding that she's

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.050
accusing a hero while providing no evidence.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:23.299
With no one to turn to, Alice asks for Deborah's
help to know the truth about Adam. After learning

00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:27.370
from Deborah that Francoise was with someone
else, Alice infers that Francoise left Adam,

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.790
so he killed her. Deborah agrees with her
then she shows Alice two different anchors

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.829
used in climbing, one of which is made of
cheap material. She says Adam could've switched

00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:39.420
the anchors, killing Francoise and her group.
Finally, Deborah advises Alice to leave Adam

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:44.329
for her own good. Scared, Alice tells Deborah
about Adele and gives her Adele's pictures.

00:13:44.329 --> 00:13:47.430
Alice still thinks that Adam killed her, and
she must've been be buried at the location

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:51.790
in the picture, at Saint Edmund's. Then, Alice
asks Deborah to come with her to find Adele.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.670
On their way to Saint Edmund's, Deborah confesses
to sending Alice the notes. She knows about

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:59.730
Adam's violence, and she wants her to get
away from him. Back at Deborah's place, Adam

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.559
finds the two photos of Adele, and after quickly
realizing where Alice is headed, he follows

00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:07.540
her. At Saint Edmund's, Alice finds a body
buried in the dirt, wearing a necklace like

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.360
the one Deborah gave her. When Alice confronts
her about it, Deborah ominously says that

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.049
Adele didn't have to die if only she'd told
her that she was going back to Michael. With

00:14:15.049 --> 00:14:18.639
a sneer, Deborah says she gave Adele a necklace,
too, and that she found it beautiful just

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:22.639
like Alice did. With Alice demanding to know
what Deborah did, the two women start fighting

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:23.869
and hitting each other.

00:14:23.869 --> 00:14:26.819
Deborah aggressively admits to sleeping with
her brother when they were kids, adding that

00:14:26.819 --> 00:14:30.809
she's the one who gave him his first piece
of silk. As they struggle, Deborah yells that

00:14:30.809 --> 00:14:34.009
Adam is hers and attempts to hit Alice with
a shovel, but Adam shows up and tackles her

00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:37.980
to the ground. Alice then runs away, and Adam
hits Deborah across the face, saying he was

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.929
never hers. As he starts looking for Alice,
Deborah is about to hit him at the back with

00:14:41.929 --> 00:14:45.939
a shovel, but Alice shoots her with a flare
gun. Deborah dies in Adam's arms, leaving

00:14:45.939 --> 00:14:49.629
him stunned and devastated. He confesses to
Alice that he and Deborah used to go there

00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:53.989
together, and with a betrayed look, Adam says
that he thought Alice just had to trust him.

00:14:53.989 --> 00:14:57.500
Deborah's body is taken by the cops the following
day, and so is Adam.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.230
Two years later, Alice and Adam see each other
again at the airport, as he is going up the

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.779
escalator while she is going down. Neither
of them says anything, but they just look

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:08.819
at each other. When Adam reaches the top,
he stays there for a moment and looks at Alice

00:15:08.819 --> 00:15:13.189
one last time before walking away. Meanwhile,
Alice starts thinking that a flatlander like

00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:20.790
her can't live at a high altitude, right where
Adam is.
