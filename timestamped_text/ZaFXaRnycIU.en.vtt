00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.790
On a train, a young girl enjoys lots of her
favourite food.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.740
Strangely, she feels like something is moving
in her hand.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.549
The symptoms then spread all over her face
and body, making the girl terrified.

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.450
As she looks at herself in the mirror, she
cries out loud seeing her face transforming.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.950
What is happening to the girl?

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.540
What makes her transformed?

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.260
This is Movie Shortens.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.390
Follow us to the movie titled: Species.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.150
Be aware, there are spoilers.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.350
Now, let’s begin!

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.260
In a secret government lab, the scientists
are watching a 12-year-old girl who is held

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.940
captive in a quarantine chamber.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.540
They are trying to gas her to death.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.829
Dr Xavier Fitch becomes touched and says goodbye
to her.

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.329
She looks terrified and confused at first.

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.690
As the cyanis gas is pumped to the chamber,
she realizes what is happening.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.620
Strangely, the toxic has no effects on her.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.350
The girl breaks the chamber with her bare
hand and escapes from the lab.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.870
Immediately, the military is called in.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.010
The girl rapidly jumps over the fence and
gets on the train, temporarily getting away

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.249
from the government.

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:05.580
On the train, the girl kills a homeless man
and steals his clothes to cover her appearance.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.369
As the train stops, she learns that she needs
to have cash so she can buy food.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.790
She then steals a random bag and gets back
to the train.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.280
There is no money in the bag but she finds
a very interesting machine that looks like

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.869
a portable TV.

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.590
As being so hungry, the girl sneaks into the
train dining car and takes some fruits.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.470
She eats the banana including the peel as
she never learned manners before.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.619
After consuming so much food, the girl begins
to transform.

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.370
In panic, she looks at herself in the mirror
and becomes frightened at her appearance.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.730
Suddenly, lots of tentacles growing from her
body spread throughout the car.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.679
When the ticket inspector checks on the noise,
she sees a huge jelly cocoon on the wall.

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.250
Coming closer, she immediately gets killed
by the creature.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.619
Shortly after that, the girl is now transformed
into a fully-formed adult woman.

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.490
Meanwhile, Fitch gathers a team of experts
to track the girl down.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.750
They are an assassin Preston, a psychic Dan
Smithson, an anthropologist Dr. Stephen Arden,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.649
and a molecular biologist Dr. Laura Baker.

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.869
Fitch briefs the group about Sil.

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.470
In 1974, a message was sent to any intelligent
life form that may be listening in space.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.160
20 years later, a response was received.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.489
The unknown civilizations provided scientists
with information on the structure of the DNA

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.599
of an alien species, and instructions on how
to mix their DNA with human DNA.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.040
The scientific team succeeded in creating
a hybrid, which they called Sil.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.569
As an empath, Dan tells the group that Sil
didn’t like being caged in and she holds

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.349
something enormous inside.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.850
To Fitch, Sil developed too fast by cocooning
herself every three month and had an over

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.040
violent tendency while sleeping.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.659
This is why the government decided to terminate
her.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.900
Fitch worries that Sil will hurt more people
if she feels fear or threat to her survival.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.790
The group has to take her down against the
clock before her next transformation.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.349
Back on the train, Sil is 21-year-old over
a night.

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.439
Sil takes a walk in downtown LA soon after
that.

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.290
On the streets, Sil encounters many pregnant
women and babies.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.739
She learns that with the rapid growth process,
she needs to mate with human males and produce

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:10.739
offspring.

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.010
In the search for the girl, the group of experts
is always one step behind Sil.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.530
They know that Sil has turned by her cocoon
left on the crime scene.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.750
Later, the team studies it to find Sil in
her new appearance.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.680
In the lab, Dr Laura works on the sample of
cocoon DNA.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.819
The camera goes off so she and Preston need
to change it inside the quarantine room.

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.020
When the camera is replaced, Dan senses something
wrong with this approach.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.209
Fitch sees the sample grows massively from
the monitor.

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.750
It rapidly turns into the tentacle monster
and spreads throughout the room.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.920
Fitch has to fire the monster inside the room
but it doesn’t get killed completely.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.239
In the last minute, the two can get out and
the whole room is burnt down in the nick of

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.239
time.

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.520
Fitch tells the group that this alien species
is only destroyed as a whole by firing the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.000
entire area.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.620
Back to Sil, she arrives at the hotel and
starts to dress up like a real woman.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.140
She asks the receptionist where to find a
man.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.310
He then shows her the bar at the corner while
taking her credit card for payment.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.170
In the bar, Sil looks around for a good mate.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.829
Being alone in the bar, Sil soon gets flirted
with by a handsome man.

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.600
Another drunk woman appears and steals him
from Sil.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.720
Jealous and threatened, Sil coldly kills that
woman in the toilet after that.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.280
Sil rushes out and seduces an artist man at
the bar upon her plan.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.169
Meanwhile, the receptionist realizes Sil’s
credit card was a stolen one so he called

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.169
the police.

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.640
Fitch and the team soon arrive at the hotel.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.479
From the hotel’s camera, the team can hardly
recognize Sil’s face.

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.610
Later, they rapidly go to the bar but Sil
has already left with the man she targeted

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.820
in his car.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.889
At his house, Sil watches him very carefully.

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.710
She needs to make sure the artist is a good
choice for her offspring.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.120
As the two are about to have fun, Sil strangely
requires the artist to drive her back to the

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.400
bar, saying she’s changed her mind.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.310
The artist feels offended by her denial so
he turns violent to Sil.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.449
The artist ends up being killed tragically.

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.310
Later, Fitch’s team lose tracking of Sil
again as they only find the body of the artist

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.310
left.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.120
Laura realizes that the artist was not an
option because he is a drug addict and diabete.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.470
Sil can sense it easily as a half alien half
human creature.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.740
The group then gets back to the hotel as Dan
thinks she appears there.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.940
Seeing the cops at the hotel, Sil decides
to change her location.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.770
Driving around in the artist car, Sil encounters
petrol running out.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.400
She abandons the car and walks on her foot
instead.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.620
As crossing the road, Sil is hit by a car
and becomes blackout.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.600
A man in a red car calls the ambulance.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.710
He then follows her to the hospital.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.160
Although he doesn’t know Sil, he generously
pays up her treatment.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.660
Meanwhile, the doctor is shocked to see Sil’s
wound can be healed by itself.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.789
Sil rapidly leaves the hospital with the man
who saved her.

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.610
At the abandoned car, Fitch receives a call
from the hospital about Sil.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.599
The team learns that Sil has targeted the
man as her next potential mate.

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.900
Laura and Preston immediately drive off to
save the man.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.790
At the man’s house, Sil knows that she has
not much time left.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.569
The man reluctantly enjoys a good time in
the pool.

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:12.370
Shortly after that, there is a doorbell ring
from Laura and Preston.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.040
The man insists on going out and checks for
the guests but Sil tries to stop him.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.240
Sil tells the man that she wants a baby.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.669
The man gets out of the pool, telling Sil
a crazy woman.

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.330
Sil then drowns him to death.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.990
When the two experts enter the house, they
find a bloody pool and a miserable body.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.130
Once again, the team loses the monster’s
track.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.530
Elsewhere, Sil steals clothes and a car from
a woman.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.789
She then drives at the cops and watches them
investigate her.

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.449
She even lipsync Fitch’s words by her telepathy
ability.

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:47.449
Later, at the woman’s house, Sil comes up
with a plan to get rid of the cops.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:51.419
First, Sil cuts off her thumb and exchanges
it with the woman’s.

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:54.229
She buys gallons of petrol and stores them
in the car.

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:57.800
Then Sil means to meet Dan in person outside
the bar.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.990
While Dan calls in the team, Sil flees away
in the car with the woman that she tied up

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.990
before.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.620
A tense chase between Sil and the cops eventually
happens, and it’s exactly like Sil predicted.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.389
She fakes the woman’s death by crashing
the car down the hill on purpose.

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:17.380
As the car and the woman explode, Sil manages
to get out in time and escape from the police.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.860
Fitch congratulates the team for the mission
completed.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.390
They celebrate the win at the bar.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.800
During this time, Sil changes her hair style
and continues her plan.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.630
Her next potential mate is Preston, who is
on his way to see his secret girlfriend.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.240
While working together, Laura and Preston
developed a relationship.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.550
Sil watches the two of them having fun from
the other room.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.170
It turns out Sil is in Stephen’s room.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.409
Surprised, Sil changes her target to Stephen
as he enters the room.

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:49.390
Sil rushes to have Stephen’s attention and
the two have fun right after that.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.819
In the hotel, Dan can sense Sil’s availability
and he comes to meet Preston.

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:57.210
Dan and Preston rapidly alert other members
about this.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:02.060
Meanwhile, after Stephen and Sil enjoy the
passionate moment, Sil becomes joyful telling

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.560
him that she can feel the baby inside her.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.789
Stephen considers her childish and laughs
at her innocence.

00:08:07.789 --> 00:08:13.009
When Stephen looks at Sil’s belly and realizes
something, she transforms and kills the man.

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:16.340
The team arrives at Stephen’s room but it’s
too late.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.360
Sil has escaped from the sewers.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.669
The team gets armed and follows Dan’s senses
to find Sil.

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:24.759
As they divide to look for Sil, Fitch gets
killed.

00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:27.580
Sil is now transformed into her real monster
mother.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.389
She gives birth to her offspring right in
the sewers.

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:33.390
When Dan reaches a cave, he sees a baby boy.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.150
The boy uses his tentacle to kill a rat for
his food.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:41.360
However, Dan can’t kill the baby as he thinks
it is better to capture him alive.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.850
The boy attacks Dan but luckily he is fine.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.760
The boy then transforms into a monster.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.540
Dan fires and destroys him with his weapon.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.700
Dan hangs himself on a cliff.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.010
In another sewer, Sil turns more violent,
knowing that her child is killed.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.000
Preston opens fire at Sil until the monster
falls off the fire.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.550
As Laura and Preston attempt to save Dan,
Sil manages to catch Dan in the fire.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.660
Preston uses his very last bullet and shoots
the monster in the head, eventually getting

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.700
rid of her.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.450
The trio leave the sewer with their mission
truly completed.
