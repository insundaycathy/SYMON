00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.040
Hey everyone. Welcome back to Movie Recap. Today&nbsp;
I'm gonna show you a 2017 American superhero film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.120
based on the Marvel Comics character&nbsp;
Spider-Man called, Spider-Man: Homecoming.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.800
The film opens in New York City after the&nbsp;
Avengers battled the Chitauri. Salvage worker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.680
Adrian Toomes is showing his co-worker a drawing&nbsp;
that his daughter made of the Avengers in action.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.000
They proceed to work on taking apart the&nbsp;
Chitauri leviathan and gathering any tech&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.520
they can get their hands on. Soon, a van from&nbsp;
the U.S. Department of Damage Control arrives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.560
Anne Marie Hoag orders Toomes to shut down his&nbsp;
operation, and adds that they will be confiscating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.760
all of their findings. Toomes protests and even&nbsp;
punches a Damage Control agent when he makes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.240
snide remark to him. Hoag then reasserts&nbsp;
her demand to Toomes to give up his work.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.000
After learning that Tony Stark&nbsp;
is behind Damage Control,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.440
Toomes gathers three of his co-workers, Jackson&nbsp;
Brice, Herman Schultz, and Phineas Mason,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.000
to continue their work in gathering Chitauri&nbsp;
tech regardless of what they are told.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.800
Eight years later, Toomes&nbsp;
and his guys are still at it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.720
with Toomes using his Vulture suit to&nbsp;
bring in a bag of Chitauri power core.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.680
Meanwhile, Peter Parker is recording a video&nbsp;
log as he travels to Berlin with Happy Hogan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.240
for what is really Tony recruiting Peter to&nbsp;
help him during the events of "Civil War".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.920
Happy shows off the new Spider-Man&nbsp;
suit that Tony made for Peter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.280
which he gets super excited about. He later&nbsp;
records his fight alongside Iron Man and everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.400
on his loyalist side during the airport fight&nbsp;
against Captain America and the other Avengers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.480
Tony then brings Peter home in his limo,&nbsp;
leaving him eager for their next mission.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.760
Two months later, Peter is still waiting to&nbsp;
hear back from Happy over any new missions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.880
He goes back to being a normal&nbsp;
student at Midtown High School.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.240
Peter makes plans with his best friend Ned to&nbsp;
build a Lego Death Star. Peter also has a crush&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.480
on a senior named Liz and is frequently taunted&nbsp;
by snotty rich kid Flash Thompson. When not at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.000
school, Peter continues going around the city as&nbsp;
Spider-Man to help people as well as fight crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.720
Peter refers to his Spidey work as the Stark&nbsp;
internship, and as a result, he quits his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.320
school's decathlon team. While at school, Peter&nbsp;
secretly creates new web fluid for his shooters.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.280
One night, Spidey catches four crooks with&nbsp;
Avengers masks trying to rob a bank using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.480
high-tech equipment. Spidey shows up and fights&nbsp;
the criminals, until one of them uses a device&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.320
that emits a powerful blast, blowing up not only&nbsp;
the bank, but also the bodega across the street.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.840
Spidey rushes over to save the&nbsp;
owner of the bodega and his cat.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.400
Peter quietly returns to his room through his&nbsp;
window while not trying to let Aunt May know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.520
that he was out. He crawls across the ceiling&nbsp;
and comes down to find Ned sitting on his bed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.720
holding the completed Lego Death Star. He&nbsp;
drops it and it breaks upon Ned's discovery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.560
that Peter is Spider-Man. Ned is shocked but also&nbsp;
thrilled. Peter forces him to keep it a secret.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.960
Peter later goes with May to dinner.&nbsp;
May is trying to get the silent Peter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.520
and Peter admits that he's been tired out from&nbsp;
the "Stark Internship," with May admitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.440
to not being a fan of Stark. They&nbsp;
see footage of the bank robbery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.840
and May warns Peter not to go anywhere&nbsp;
near that type of chaos in the city.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.400
The entire next day at school, Ned asks&nbsp;
Peter questions about being Spider-Man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.320
They even watch a PSA from Captain America during&nbsp;
gym, and Peter briefly mentions fighting him. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.280
boys then hear Liz talking to her friends about&nbsp;
how she's got kind of a crush on Spider-Man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.440
leading Ned to blurt out in front of&nbsp;
everyone that Peter knows Spider-Man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.239
Liz then invites Peter and Ned to a party at her&nbsp;
house so that Peter can try to invite Spider-Man.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.360
The boys attend the party, and almost&nbsp;
instantly, Ned tries to get Peter to change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.480
into his Spider-Man outfit. Peter doesn't&nbsp;
want to until Flash starts pestering him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.760
He goes to change, but then sees an explosion&nbsp;
in the distance. He goes to investigate and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.960
finds Brice and Schultz selling Chitauri tech&nbsp;
to a local gangster named Aaron Davis. Peter's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.320
cell goes off when Ned tries to call him, making&nbsp;
Brice and Schultz think Aaron was setting them up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.840
Spidey intervenes and tries to fight the crooks.&nbsp;
He chases them until Vulture swoops down and grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.680
Spidey. He drops him into the river as he gets&nbsp;
tangled in his parachute. Iron Man then comes down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.200
and saves Spidey, finding out where he was because&nbsp;
of a tracker in his suit. Tony is not in the suit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.000
as he is basically calling Peter, but he tells him&nbsp;
to stay out of crime-fighting for his own good.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.240
Peter considers returning to the party, but&nbsp;
Ned has him hear on the phone that Flash has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.960
everyone mocking Peter. Peter then finds a&nbsp;
weapon that one of the crooks left behind.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.520
At Toomes's lair, Brice admits to dropping his&nbsp;
weapon as he was using his electric gauntlets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.480
calling himself "Shocker". Fed up with Brice's&nbsp;
carelessness, Toomes cuts him from the team,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.280
but Brice threatens to spill their secrets to&nbsp;
Toomes' wife and the public. Toomes responds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.160
by grabbing a powerful gun off Mason's desk&nbsp;
and incinerating Brice with it, mistaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.440
an anti-gravity gun for a laser gun. He then&nbsp;
gives Schultz the gauntlets so he can be Shocker.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.120
With Ned's help, Peter cracks open the weapon&nbsp;
to find a power core. He finds Schultz again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.840
and places a tracker on him, discovering&nbsp;
that he is going to Maryland. To get there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.160
Peter rejoins the decathlon team as they&nbsp;
head to D.C. for the Nationals competition.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.440
Peter sneaks out and goes to find Schultz as&nbsp;
Spider-Man. He catches the villains attempting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.400
to hijack a Damage Control truck with more&nbsp;
weaponry inside. During his attempt to foil&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.040
the villains, Spidey is knocked unconscious&nbsp;
and wakes up in a Damage Control warehouse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.480
unable to leave because the door is sealed until&nbsp;
the morning. Peter talks to the A.I. system in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:12.560
suit, whom he refers to as Karen. She helps Peter&nbsp;
get a better understanding of how his suit works.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.920
He even tells her about his feelings for Liz.&nbsp;
He also learns that the power core is basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.640
a bomb that will go off when exposed to&nbsp;
radiation. When he realizes he is about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.680
to miss the competition, Peter has Karen help him&nbsp;
unlock the doors as he rushes to the competition.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.960
Peter misses the whole competition, but the team&nbsp;
wins thanks to the help of reserved loner Michelle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.560
Jones. The team then heads over to the Washington&nbsp;
Monument. He calls Ned to warn him about the power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.280
core that he was holding, but is unable to&nbsp;
get the message through. As Spidey, he rushes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.640
to the Monument, but the core goes off in Ned's&nbsp;
backpack as the team is riding up the elevator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.640
Spidey climbs up the Monument to save the&nbsp;
team, but he can't get in through the window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.160
without using great force. The police arrive in&nbsp;
choppers and order Spidey to get to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.320
Against their orders, Spidey leaps over&nbsp;
the choppers and swings from the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.640
He breaks in and tries to hold the falling&nbsp;
elevator with his web, but the weight pulls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.240
him down. He is able to hold the web and the&nbsp;
elevator as everyone inside climbs out. Liz is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.360
last person and nearly falls with the elevator but&nbsp;
Spidey catches her with the web and rescues her.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.560
Back in New York, Karen reveals that the&nbsp;
Spider-Man suit records everything that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.320
Peter has seen. She gets a visual on Aaron,&nbsp;
and Spidey later finds him in a parking garage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.120
He attempts to interrogate him to find out why he&nbsp;
was trying to get the tech from Toomes's goons.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.160
Aaron says he was trying to get&nbsp;
them out of his neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.160
He figures that Spidey is new to&nbsp;
being a hero. Aaron tells Spidey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.480
that Toomes is meeting to gather more tech at&nbsp;
the Staten Island Ferry later that afternoon.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.040
On the Ferry, Toomes is meeting with&nbsp;
another criminal named Mac Gargan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.240
Spidey gets a call from Tony, but he lies about&nbsp;
what he's up to. Spidey spots Schultz on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.000
boat but sees Toomes and doesn't realize he is&nbsp;
Vulture. He swings in and incapacitates Gargan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.440
and his goons. Toomes tries to use a weapon on&nbsp;
Spidey, but he holds it down with his webbing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.680
This backfires since the weapon becomes&nbsp;
unstable and splits the Ferry in half.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.360
Spidey then tries to hold the&nbsp;
Ferry together with his webbing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.960
but it's not strong enough and it continues to&nbsp;
split. As Spidey holds on as much as he can,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.440
Iron Man and his little drones show up to put&nbsp;
the Ferry back together and save everyone.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.440
Spidey retreats to a rooftop. Iron Man finds&nbsp;
him and chews him out for not listening to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.240
him and lying to him about what he's doing with&nbsp;
the suit. Peter then attempts to put the blame&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.160
on Tony for what happened with the "Ferry"&nbsp;
for not listening to him about the Vulture,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.960
but Tony steps out of his suit this time and&nbsp;
reveals that he did in fact listen to Peter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.880
as he sent the FBI on the same Ferry that Toomes&nbsp;
was on. He goes on to remind Peter that, while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:04.160
nobody got harmed, if somebody did, it would've&nbsp;
been on Peter. Feeling that he's unworthy of it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.520
Tony demands that Peter give him back the Spidey&nbsp;
suit. Peter pleads with Tony, saying that he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.880
nothing without the suit, to which Tony says that&nbsp;
he doesn't deserve it if he's nothing without it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.840
Peter is failed to convince Tony to let him&nbsp;
stay with the suit. He goes home to Aunt May&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:25.120
dejectedly. She gets on him for not answering&nbsp;
his phone all day, even going to the police to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.160
find out where he was. She also knows about him&nbsp;
skipping detention at school earlier that day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.880
that he missed out on the Decathlon competition&nbsp;
in Washington and he sneaks out out of the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.520
every night. Demanding an explanation, he&nbsp;
admits to getting fired from the Internship.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.320
Peter resumes his life as a student&nbsp;
and spends more time with Ned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.360
Peter finds Liz at school&nbsp;
and admits to liking her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.760
which she already knew. He then asks her&nbsp;
to the homecoming dance, which she accepts.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.000
On the night of the dance, Peter goes to&nbsp;
pick up Liz, only to learn that her father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.880
is none other than...ADRIAN TOOMES. After&nbsp;
some awkward photos, Toomes drives Peter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:10.560
and Liz to the dance. As Liz tells Adrian about&nbsp;
Peter's background and the events at Washington,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.320
he slowly starts putting together&nbsp;
the pieces of Peter's circumstances&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.840
and realizes that he's Spider-Man. Liz leaves&nbsp;
the car and Toomes quietly threatens Peter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.800
by telling him to stay out of his business or&nbsp;
else he will kill him and anyone he cares about.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.800
During the dance, Peter learns that Toomes&nbsp;
plans to steal a shipment of weaponry from a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.400
plane coming from the Avengers Tower&nbsp;
heading to their new headquarters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:40.240
Peter ditches Liz and rushes to get his homemade&nbsp;
Spider-Man suit to stop Toomes. He heads outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.440
and is attacked by Schultz with his gauntlets.&nbsp;
Peter tries to reach his web shooter, but Schultz&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.720
continues to pummel him. He is saved by Ned, and&nbsp;
Peter sticks Schultz to a bus with the webbing.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.240
Spidey rushes to stop Toomes with Ned being his&nbsp;
eyes and ears. Ned tries to get in touch with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:04.800
Happy, but he doesn't care about it and hangs up&nbsp;
on him. Spidey finds Toomes in his lair. Toomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.360
attempts to reason with Peter that he's only&nbsp;
doing what he believes is necessary and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.080
the world isn't as black and white as the young&nbsp;
Peter believes it to be, but it turns out to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.120
a distraction as Toomes unleashes his suit as it&nbsp;
flies around the area, destroying support beams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.480
and causing a pile of debris to fall on Spidey.&nbsp;
Toomes leaves him to die. Peter struggles to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.600
lift the rubble off of him and he fears he is&nbsp;
going to die. He then remembers Tony's words,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.560
he uses all his strength to pull himself out and&nbsp;
he'll have to do it all alone without Tony's help.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.080
Spidey latches onto Vulture's suit as he&nbsp;
intercepts the plane. Toomes tries to gather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:48.080
what he needs, but Spidey foils his plan. Toomes&nbsp;
gets in his suit and fights Spidey on the plane.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.920
They knock out the turbines, sending&nbsp;
the plane toward Coney Island.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.960
Spidey is able to maneuver the plane away from&nbsp;
the city and onto the beach as it crash-lands.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.880
Toomes attempts to get away with the&nbsp;
weaponry, but Spidey tries to warn him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:06.080
that they are about to explode. Toomes tries&nbsp;
flying away anyway, but the cores blow up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:12.960
he goes crashing down. Spidey finds Toomes&nbsp;
and saves him, but he leaves him next to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.680
rest of the weaponry for Happy and the police to&nbsp;
find later, leading to Toomes getting arrested.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.320
At school, Peter finds out that Liz is moving&nbsp;
to Oregon with her mother while her father is on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.920
trial. She is still upset with Peter for leaving&nbsp;
her at the dance. She says goodbye to Peter and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:35.600
hopes that he can figure himself out. Peter is&nbsp;
back on the decathlon team, and Michelle is made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:42.320
captain. She quickly mentions that her nickname is&nbsp;
MJ. Peter then gets a text to go to the bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.440
Happy is there, thanking Peter for what he did.&nbsp;
He then tells Peter that Tony wants to see him.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:56.320
Tony and Happy bring Peter to the new Avengers HQ.&nbsp;
Tony presents Peter with a brand new Spider-Man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.640
suit, telling him that there are reporters&nbsp;
behind the wall waiting for a big announcement,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:06.400
meaning Tony is about to officially make Peter&nbsp;
a new Avenger. However, Peter turns Tony down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.840
saying he prefers to be a "friendly neighborhood&nbsp;
Spider-Man" for now. Peter leaves, and asks Tony&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.560
if he was testing him and whether or not he&nbsp;
passed, and Tony seemingly confirms it adding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.600
that there are no reporters. However, Tony is&nbsp;
actually surprised that Peter made the mature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.160
choice of turning him down, and that there&nbsp;
really were a bunch of reporters outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.880
Pepper Potts comes out, asking where Peter&nbsp;
is. She is frustrated that he walked out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.960
so Happy covers for them by giving Tony&nbsp;
a ring so he can propose to Pepper.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.760
When Peter gets home, he finds&nbsp;
a bag from Tony on his bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:47.120
Tony is convinced and has given Peter back the&nbsp;
original Spider-Man suit. Peter then proudly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.318
puts it on, not realizing Aunt May is behind&nbsp;him.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.840
In Mid-Credits Scene. Toomes is locked up at The&nbsp;
Raft and he runs into Gargan, who mentions that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.880
and other criminals are trying to come together&nbsp;
to kill Spider-Man. Gargan then reveals that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:08.000
heard a rumor of Toomes knowing who Spider-Man&nbsp;
is. Toomes denies it, saying Spider-Man would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.040
already be dead if he knew. He then leaves&nbsp;
Gargan to see Liz and his wife visiting him.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.400
