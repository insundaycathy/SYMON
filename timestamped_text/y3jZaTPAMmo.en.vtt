00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.590
Me Softly, Thriller Romance Movie,
So Know The Story Of This Movie In Today's

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.460
Explanation, so Without Wasting Any Time,
Let's Begin,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.660
At the beginning of the movie, we are shown
climbing a mountain group. But suddenly they

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.190
all start falling down, due to which they
die. After this we see the main character

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.350
Alice of the movie. Which is American, but
she lives in Landon with her boyfriend. Alice

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.420
never met her dad and didn't even talk to
her mom. One day she was going to her office

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.420
when she meets a boy on the rode. And she
starts getting attracted towards that boy,

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.120
but they do not talk to each other. And Alice
goes to her office and that boy also goes

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.379
inside a bookshop. Alice does not like work.
Alice keeps thinking about that boy only.

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.829
Alice goes back there at lunch time and secretly
starts seeing the boy. That boy also sees

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.489
her and both of them sit in a taxi. The boy
takes her to his house and then both of them

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.469
become intimate. And Alice starts feeling
guilty while coming back. Because she already

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.510
has a boyfriend. Yet she became intimate with
another man. She tries hard not to think about

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.710
the boy, and she can't stop herself. Next
day while returning home from office, Alice

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.049
goes to bookshop. On the other hand, he sees
a book which was written on that boy. The

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.229
shop owner says This boy's name is Adam had
seen an accident on the mountain at the beginning

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.670
of the movie, there was also Adam in it. killed
many people. But Adam saved the lives of 6

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.219
people there. That's why everyone considers
him a hero, and a book has also been written

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.280
on Adam. Alice buys this book, and Alice goes
to meet Adam at his house. Again these two

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.130
get intimate and Alice asks him about that
accident. Adam says he doesn't even know.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.829
How did it happen because everything was going
well. There was no fault anywhere. Yet this

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.869
accident happened even today, this incident
haunts him. His girlfriend was also among

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.880
those people. When he too dies, Alice takes
care of Adam and decides. That from now on

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.869
she will remain with Adam. Alice comes home
and breaks up with her boyfriend. Then, after

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.259
packing the bag, she goes to Adam's house,
but there was another girl there. Alice thinks

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.759
this is Adam's girlfriend and Adam has cheated
on her, but she says girl. She is Adam's sister.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.890
Her name is Deborah and this house is hers.
Alice takes Adam's address from him and goes

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.600
to his house, but Adam is not at home, so
she starts waiting outside. After sometime

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.959
Adam comes and hag him. At night, both of
them get intimate again. The next morning,

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.760
a reporter comes there to interview Adam.
The reporter's name is Joanna and Alice meets

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.080
him. Then Alice gets ready and goes to the
office. In the evening, I go to meet Alice

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.349
Adam at his training center. There she meets
Adam's sister. She also went on that trip

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.630
with adam. Deborah asks Alice to try climbing
once and starts wearing her harness. Then

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.560
adam comes over there and says you go, I wear
Alice in Harness. One thing is clear from

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.450
this that adam does not believe in his sister,
the live living relationship of Alice and

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.830
adam goes on very well. Alice tells her friend
about this. His friend says You already had

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.689
a boyfriend, and you were happy with him too.
You are just attracted to adam. Do you really

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.019
love Adam, I think your relationship will
not last long, Alice does not pay heed to

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.680
her words and both of them go shopping. After
shopping, both of them were going to meet

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.410
Adam and then a thief steals Alice's purse
and starts running. Then Adam comes over there

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.909
and starts killing the thief. Alice stops
him before he can kill her. Then Adam proposes

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:23.849
her for marriage and Adam also says yes. The
next day, Alice receives a letter that read,

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.290
“You don't even know Adam well and are going
to marry him.” What are you talking about

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.209
so soon? Alice shows the letter to Adam. Adam
says all this is useless, you just believe

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.260
in me, one day both of them go to church and
get married. Adam lived in this TOWN as a

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.120
child. He shows her his favorite walking place.
Adam asks her to change the dress by taking

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.980
her to the statue and he clicks a photo of
Alice without clothes. And then both of them

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.969
go out for hiking. The two make a honeymoon
at a house in the middle of the woods, a few

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:57.720
days later, Alice receives a letter again.
It was written in that. You have made a big

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.060
mistake by marrying Adam, Alice thinks. Her
ex boyfriend is sending this letter to her,

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.280
then calls her but CALL receives her friend.
Alice discovers her ex-boyfriend and her friend

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.400
are dating. Alice understands. It was sent
by someone else who wants to tell him something.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.919
In the evening go to a party with Adam. All
the friends of Adam had come there, while

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.800
Deborah was also there. Deborah gifts Alice
a necklace. A few days later, when she was

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.670
in her office, reporter Joanna calls her,
she says that a girl called him after seeing

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.550
Adam's interview. A few years ago, Adam raped
her. Alice takes Joanna's address and goes

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.940
to meet her. Then she says that she met Adam
at a party. Both of them were dancing. Adam

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.630
took me home and raped me. But today everyone
is considering Adam as Hero. Actually he is

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.920
a villain. Alice gets very upset after hearing
all this and now she also starts doubting

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.751
Adam. He sees a lock wardrobe at Adam's house.
She opens it. On the other hand, Adam's ex

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:57.160
girlfriend had some letters written in this
letter. I don't want to be with you anymore

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.940
because you are such a strange person. I'm
going back to my husband Michael's. When Adam

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.780
returns home, Alice quickly hides the letter.
Adam also suspects Alice But Adam doesn't

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.170
tell her anything. After Adam leaves, she
goes to open those wardrobes again. But she

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.750
doesn't get the key because Adam has taken
that key with him. Meanwhile, he gets a package

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.820
and letter. The package had the same dress
that she wore in the honeymoon and was written

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.440
in the letter. Do you still believe in Adam,
Alice thinks. Adam's ex-girlfriend is sending

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.530
these letters to him, so Alice goes to meet
Adele at his house. But on the other hand

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.640
his mom says that Adele is missing since last
8 months. Even her husband does not know.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.180
Where is he, there was also a group photo,
Adam. Adele's mom says Adele and Adam are

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.500
good friends From then on she sees the same
photo of Adele as Adam clicked on her without

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.950
clothes in front of that statue, then she
thinks maybe Adam has murdered Adele. When

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.770
she comes home, Adam feels it. Alice is having
an affair with someone else. Alice tells him

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.970
everything, the truth. She says that she had
received letters from Adele and went to his

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.120
house too. She asks Adam. did you murder Adele.
Then Adam says no. He didn't kill her. He

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.120
conferences that earlier he had an affair
with Adele, but now he is in love with Alice,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.100
but Alice does not believe in Adam and runs
away from the house on the pretext of the

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.010
washroom. Adam also follows him. But Alice
hides. Alice goes to the police station and

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.200
says. Her husband has murdered a girl. Now
the officers ask for evidence from him, but

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.090
he does not have any evidence, so the officers
are also unable to help him. At the same time,

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.730
Adam also comes there and says that his wife
is missing. There was some miss understanding

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.430
between them. So she has left the house. The
officers show all this to Alice, and they

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.130
don't think Adam can murder anyone. Still,
Alice does not believe in Adam, and she goes

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.540
to Deborah to ask for help. Deborah says she
was already suspicious of Adam. Deborah thinks

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.260
that the accident on the mountain happened
only because of Adam because the instruments

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.830
that those people use are of good quality,
and they do not break easily, and they broke

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.620
very early that day. Adam knew the girls by
using them. Kills with. In order to kill his

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.650
girlfriends on the mountain, he also killed
other people so that it could be an accident,

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.911
then Alice says that maybe Adam killed Adele
and buried him in front of that statue. Both

00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:15.650
of them go to the statue to check. Deborah
says this time. She had sent him those letters

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.850
because she wanted to warn him. Adam, on the
other hand, goes to Deborah's house and sees

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.440
a picture of both Adele and Alice's statues.
He understands. Alice has left the statue

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.000
with Deborah, so he also goes after her. On
the other hand, both of them start digging

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.300
the ground. He found the dead body of a girl
and had a necklace around her neck. She understands,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.290
as Deborah gave it to her. This murder was
done by Deborah not by adam Deborah confirms

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.580
that he killed Adele and that accident on
the mountain also happened because of him

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:48.160
Deborah says it was necessary to kill Adam's
girlfriends because Deborah likes Adam since

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.300
childhood does. She thinks Adam is just her.
In childhood, both of them had also become

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.520
intimate in front of this statue. Deborah
says that I have killed all the girlfriends

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.520
of Adam, and now it is your turn to kill,
saying that she attacks Alice, but then Adam

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.910
comes there and Alice saves it. Adam tells
Deborah that whatever happened between them

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:10.940
in childhood was a mistake, and he already
suspected Deborah that he had committed the

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.850
murders, so he did not believe in her. Now
Deborah also attacks him and then Alice shoots

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:19.670
him with flare gun. On the spot he dies. The
next morning the police comes and takes Adam

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.710
with them, after that 2 years pass and these
people meet at the airport but these people

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:34.220
do not talk to each other and the movie ends
here.
