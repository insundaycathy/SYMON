00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.900
Drugs, drugs, drugs; euphoria in the evening, come-down in the morning.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.360
Addiction in this film has never been so beautifully shot and edited.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.880
Presented in a beautifully depressing, yet tonal piece of art

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.160
capturing the intensity of drug addiction's effects, and the destructive lifestyle that ensues.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.120
Bleak, graphic and grungy--an all-around feel-bad movie.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.640
Tighten that tourniquet.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.420
You ready?

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.420
Here's Requiem for a Dream.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.820
During the summer in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn,
widow Sara Goldfarb spends her time watching

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.559
electrifying infomercials.

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.219
Meanwhile, her son Harry occasionally pawns
her cherished television to fund the recreational

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.739
drug use of his best friend Tyrone and his
loving girlfriend Marion.

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.170
After Sara receives a call that she has won
a spot on a television game show, she becomes

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.120
excited about attending it in her fancy red
dress she used to wear with her husband.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.790
However, she is very disappointed to learn
that she no longer fits into it.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.369
After failing a strict diet, an unscrupulous
physician prescribes her a regimen of weight-loss

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.409
amphetamines.

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.969
She begins losing weight, while becoming manic.

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:25.859
Weight loss pills in reality do exist.

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:32.029
At the very least, historically
Harry and Tyrone dream of becoming big drug

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:36.689
dealers, having all the drugs and money they
need, and at first their small-time dealing

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.630
business thrives.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.320
Harry and Marion are deeply in love, and Harry
tells her that he will soon have enough to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.859
launch the clothing design business she desires.

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.829
Sara and her friends wait expectantly every
day for the game show invitation to arrive.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.450
Harry stops by to give his doting mother an
impressive television, but when he implores

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.069
her to get off the amphetamines, she confesses
that the only thing she has to live for anymore

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:06.259
is the dream of looking glamorous on a television
stage, and the extra attention she receives

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.899
now from her friends.

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.180
As Sara’s tolerance for the amphetamines
increases, she craves the high she once had,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.540
while becoming frantic about the invitation.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.629
When she increases her dosage she develops
amphetamine psychosis.

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.450
When Tyrone is arrested, Harry has to use
most of their earned money to post bail.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.660
The local supply of heroin becomes restricted,
and they are unable to find any for either

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.939
use or sale.

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:36.020
Eventually, Tyrone hears of a large shipment
coming, but the price is doubled and the minimum

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.020
high.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.900
Harry, desperate, suggests Marion ask her
psychiatrist for money in exchange for affection;

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.579
she does so at great cost to her romance.

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.040
When the drug buy goes bad, Harry returns
empty-handed to Marion, who is desperate for

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.069
heroin, and they argue.

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.560
He departs after giving her the number of
a pimp who trades heroin for sex.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.310
Harry and Tyrone decide that to put their
business back on track, they will drive to

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:18.239
Florida to buy directly from the wholesaler
there.

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.689
After a series of horrifying hallucinations,
Sara flees her apartment for the office of

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:28.260
the casting agency in Manhattan, to confirm
when she will be on TV.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.159
She is taken away by ambulance and committed
to a psychiatric ward where she is subjected

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.159
to degrading treatments.

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:55.500
When none work, the physician induces a barely
lucid Sara to approve electroconvulsive therapy.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.659
Driving to Miami, Harry and Tyrone visit a
hospital because of Harry's increasingly infected

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.120
needle injection sites.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.810
The doctor notices the symptoms of drug abuse,
and Harry and Tyrone are arrested.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.230
Back in New York, Marion has sex with the
pimp to get heroin.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.810
Recognizing her addiction, he entices her
with a bigger score of heroin if she returns

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.410
that weekend for a party.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.610
In the climax, Tyrone does hard labor in jail
while being taunted by guards and suffers

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.259
from drug withdrawal; Harry’s infected arm
is amputated; Sara undergoes violent electroshock

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:34.509
therapy; and Marion is humiliated as the subject
of sexual acts at the pimp’s sex party.

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:39.070
When Sara's friends come to the hospital to
visit, they are distraught by her almost vegetative

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.090
state.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.950
Harry wakes crestfallen after the amputation,
knowing that Marion will not be visiting him.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.950
Tyrone suffers in the prison workhouse remembering
his childhood when he was with his mother.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:54.250
Marion lies on her sofa comforted by the heroin
she injected, clutching the large bag she

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.250
earned.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.090
That night, Sara dreams she wins the grand
prize on a show hosted by her favorite TV

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.889
host, with Harry as the guest of honor.
