I mean I'm not allowed to say anything

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
but I would say that just based on your
 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.220 align:start position:0%
but I would say that just based on your

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.020 align:start position:0%
hypothesis if he's died four thousand
times<00:02:46.500><c> then</c><00:02:46.860><c> I</c><00:02:46.950><c> would</c><00:02:47.100><c> say</c><00:02:47.310><c> that</c><00:02:47.459><c> the</c><00:02:47.550><c> odds</c><00:02:47.580><c> are</c>

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 align:start position:0%
times then I would say that the odds are
 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.660 align:start position:0%
times then I would say that the odds are
probably<00:02:48.390><c> strong</c><00:02:48.810><c> yeah</c><00:02:49.440><c> and</c><00:02:49.739><c> you</c><00:02:50.040><c> know</c><00:02:50.220><c> but</c>

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 align:start position:0%
probably strong yeah and you know but

it's<00:02:50.790><c> a</c><00:02:50.880><c> question</c><00:02:51.360><c> I</c><00:02:51.480><c> can't</c><00:02:51.720><c> answer</c><00:02:51.840><c> and</c><00:02:52.260><c> I</c>

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 align:start position:0%
it's a question I can't answer and I
 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.630 align:start position:0%
it's a question I can't answer and I
think<00:02:52.769><c> time</c><00:02:52.980><c> will</c><00:02:53.010><c> tell</c>

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
