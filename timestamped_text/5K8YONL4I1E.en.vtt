00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.720
﻿Hi guys, Scifi Recapped here. Before we&nbsp;
start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.680
I`m gonna explain an American superhero,&nbsp;
crime, and drama movie, called Hancock.
&nbsp;

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.480
Starring Will Smith. The film tells the story of&nbsp;
a man, named John Hancock. He is an alcoholic who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.680
possesses superpowers, including flight,&nbsp;
invulnerability, and superhuman strength.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.120
But unlike superheroes in general, he is not a&nbsp;
superhero loved by the people of Los Angeles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.240
Almost everyone hates him,&nbsp;
both good and bad people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.600
He also becomes enraged when referred&nbsp;
to as an "asshole" by the locals.
&nbsp;

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.800
At the beginning of the movie, Hancock falls&nbsp;
asleep on a public bench by the side of the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.640
Not long after, there is a boy who suddenly wakes&nbsp;
him up. The boy hopes that he can wake up soon and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.280
stops the criminals who are in action, which&nbsp;
is reported on the television. Knowing this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.200
he immediately reacts by capturing the&nbsp;
mafia group who is running away in a car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.400
These mafia members have weapons, but that&nbsp;
is not a problem for him who has superpowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.800
However, he is scolded by the police and&nbsp;
local residents for his reckless nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.320
When he tackles a problem, he makes an even worse&nbsp;
mess. In overcoming these three criminals, Hancock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.200
in his heroic action makes a big loss because he&nbsp;
also destroys police cars and public facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.920
In other words, the losses he incurred are greater&nbsp;
than the losses incurred by the criminals.
&nbsp;

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.600
Meanwhile, there is a man named Ray Embrey.&nbsp;
He works as a public relations specialist in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.800
a private company. He offers a business concept&nbsp;
to the board of directors, but sadly the concept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.760
is not approved by them. On his way home, he&nbsp;
gets stuck in traffic right on the train tracks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.960
where a train is about to pass. Frantically, he&nbsp;
cannot go anywhere because the car in front and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.680
behind him cannot move either. Then he decides&nbsp;
to get out of the car, but unfortunately his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.720
clothes get stuck in it. Just at the right time,&nbsp;
Hancock appears and irrationally derails the car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.480
to save Ray. As a result, Ray's car crashes into&nbsp;
someone else's car in an overturned condition,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.800
then he instead crashes himself into the train&nbsp;
to stop it, making the environment around there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.880
become chaotic. As usual, the citizens immediately&nbsp;
criticize him, except for Ray who is very thankful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.800
to him for saving him just now. With his flying&nbsp;
ability, Ray is escorted by Hancock to his house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.560
Arriving there, Ray is greeted by his wife,&nbsp;
Mary and also his son, Aaron. From now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.640
it can be seen that Mary is one of the people&nbsp;
who does not like Hancock as a superhero.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.400
Even she has refused him to eat together at her&nbsp;
house. On the other hand, Aaron is a fan of him.
&nbsp;

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.240
From all the Los Angeles residents, Ray is the&nbsp;
only one who believes that Hancock has a good side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.000
in him. That way, he can turn into a superhero&nbsp;
that people love by improving his public image.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.400
To make it happen, Ray encourages him to&nbsp;
admit all the mistakes he has made so far,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.720
such as destroying public facilities to other&nbsp;
things that harmed the citizens in his actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.640
Ray also tells him to grant the&nbsp;
wishes of the residents all this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.160
namely the residents want him to be&nbsp;
imprisoned for all the losses he has made,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.840
until Los Angeles needs him properly. At first, he&nbsp;
is reluctant, but in the end he agrees with Ray.
&nbsp;

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.720
When he arrives at the prison,&nbsp;
he meets another inmate. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.320
they stare at him in disgust and immediately&nbsp;
block his way when he wants to pass.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.400
Turns out, most of them are the people&nbsp;
who went to jail because of Hancock,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.520
so they seem to be really annoyed with him. After&nbsp;
that, he politely asks them not to get in his way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.480
but they still don’t heed his words. Because he is&nbsp;
so upset, he ends up assaulting the two of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.480
Thus, the other inmates avoid him out&nbsp;
of fear and quickly leave him alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.760
Later, Hancock is visited by Ray who knows about&nbsp;
the mess that he caused earlier, encouraging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.560
him to be patient. He is also visited by Mary&nbsp;
and Aaron who bring him homemade spaghetti.
&nbsp;

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.480
Since Hancock was in prison, Los Angeles’s&nbsp;
crime rate rises. The climax is when there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.080
is a bank robbery, where the criminals&nbsp;
carry a lot of weapons and explosives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.160
Therefore, Hancock is eventually released to help&nbsp;
the police. He also gets his superhero costume for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.880
the first time after being taught manners by&nbsp;
Ray. He then foils the robbery orchestrated by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.360
Red Parker, with Hancock slicing off his hand to&nbsp;
prevent him from activating a detonation switch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.320
Because of this, he is praised as a&nbsp;
superhero for the first time by the locals.
&nbsp;

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.600
Afterwards, Hancock has dinner with Ray and Mary.&nbsp;
He asks them how they come to meet each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.480
In essence, Mary turns out to be Ray's second&nbsp;
wife, while Aaron is the son of his first wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.640
who had died in childbirth. When it is&nbsp;
Hancock's turn to tell his story, it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.600
revealed that he is amnesiac and an immortal.&nbsp;
That moment when he woke up in Miami hospital,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.560
he had no idea who he really was. The only thing&nbsp;
he knew was that there was a chewing gum and two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.280
movie tickets in his pocket, but he couldn't&nbsp;
remember anything about it. Strangely enough,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.400
it happened 80 years ago. In the meantime,&nbsp;
Mary looks at him with pity. It seems that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.920
is familiar with his story, causing her to cry.
After they finish dinner, a drunk Ray is carried&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.280
by Hancock to his house. Before Hancock wants&nbsp;
to go home, he meets with Mary in the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.600
He then kisses her, only for her to toss him&nbsp;
outside, destroying the walls of her house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.320
It turns out that she has superpowers like&nbsp;
him too, looks like they are the same species.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.960
Hancock is very surprised not to think&nbsp;
that Mary has the same superpowers as him.
&nbsp;

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.240
The next morning, Ray who has woken up from his&nbsp;
sleep is very surprised to see that his house was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.280
so messy. Mary then explains to him that it was&nbsp;
Hancock's doing because he sneezed last night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.080
causing the wall to shatter. After a&nbsp;
while, Hancock comes to Mary’s house again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.560
He then does some tests on Mary because he is&nbsp;
still curious about what happened last night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.440
When he presses the fork against her shoulder,&nbsp;
the fork bends instead. And also, when he hits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.320
her head with a rolling pin, Mary feels fine&nbsp;
about it. Because of it, he has many questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.760
for her and tells her to come to his residence.
Arriving there, she talks with Hancock in private.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.760
She claims that actually she is his little sister&nbsp;
and they have lived for three thousand years.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.360
She also explains that they are the&nbsp;
last descendants of their species.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.400
On the other hand, Hancock disbelieves her about&nbsp;
the last claim, thinking that the whole thing was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.600
bullshit. Furthermore, he immediately leaves and&nbsp;
flies away to inform Ray about her superpower.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.880
Mary, who does not want Ray to know about&nbsp;
it, chases after him. The two of them incite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.200
a violent battle across the city, until Ray&nbsp;
quietly witnesses the fight from a building.
&nbsp;

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.360
After the fight, he returns home. At the&nbsp;
same time, Hancock and Mary also arrives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.240
there. At that time, Ray is very surprised&nbsp;
why Mary can fly and has superpowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.920
Mary then explains the truth. She admits that&nbsp;
Hancock is actually her husband from the past, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.720
that she chose to quietly leave him once he had&nbsp;
lost his memories about them. Knowing this fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.600
Hancock feels sad and disappointed with Mary, as&nbsp;
well as Ray who is also annoyed by her statement.
&nbsp;

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.920
One night, Hancock stops a liquor store robbery.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, the criminals are able to shoot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.360
him in the body, causing him to be hospitalized.&nbsp;
After a while, Mary approaches him and continues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.760
her explanation that their species has a weakness,&nbsp;
that is if they are close or have feelings for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.920
each other, then the superpowers possessed&nbsp;
by them will slowly disappear for a moment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.720
becoming mortals. She also tells him that the last&nbsp;
time they were together was eighty years before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.360
At that moment, Hancock was attacked right&nbsp;
in his head by the criminals to save Mary.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.800
Consequently, he had amnesia and only had one&nbsp;
chewing gum and two movie tickets in his pocket.
&nbsp;

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.320
Meanwhile, Parker, whose hand has been sliced&nbsp;
off earlier, manages to escape from the prison&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.960
with several other criminals. He decides to&nbsp;
attack Hancock in the hospital for revenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.320
Unluckily, Mary is caught in the crossfire when&nbsp;
she tries to protect Hancock, causing her to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:32.080
injured. After that, an angry Hancock immediately&nbsp;
recovers and immediately kills the criminals while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.280
the doctors are trying to save Mary’s life. But in&nbsp;
the process, Hancock gets shot in his body again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.640
by Parker. Just in the right time, he is saved&nbsp;
by Ray who cuts off Parker’s other hand with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.920
fire axe before killing him as well. Some time&nbsp;
after that, he finally realizes what to do next.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.320
He immediately throws himself out of the&nbsp;
hospital, trying to increase his distance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.400
from Mary so that she can recover quickly.&nbsp;
He eventually flies towards the Moon.
&nbsp;

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.400
A month later, Ray and his family suddenly receive&nbsp;
a call from Hancock who is now in New York.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.880
He reveals that he has imprinted the Moon's&nbsp;
surface with Ray's All Heart marketing logo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.240
which was previously rejected by his directors.&nbsp;
The movie ends happily, even though Ray already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.360
knew all the facts about Hancock and Mary. In the&nbsp;
end, they remain good friends and Mary remains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:23.360
Ray’s wife. In a mid - credits scene, Hancock&nbsp;
confronts a criminal holding a woman at gunpoint.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.440
The criminal demands Hancock to help him escape&nbsp;
from the police while calling him an (bleep)&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.400
in the process which infuriates Hancock.
