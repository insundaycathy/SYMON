00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.760
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.680
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.120
the 2019 American black comedy&nbsp;
horror film called 'Villains'.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.800
The film is written and directed&nbsp;
by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.800
Warning: there will be spoilers&nbsp;
ahead, so please proceed with caution.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.800
Mickey and Jules, two lovebirds dressed in animal&nbsp;
masks, clumsily loot a gas station and flee,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.360
enjoying their final sting before heading to&nbsp;
Florida. Their automobile runs out of petrol&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.440
while travelling through the woods. Jules&nbsp;
discovers a mailbox, and the pair comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.320
across a big lonely home. They notice a car in&nbsp;
the garage, but the home looks to be vacant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.200
After smashing down the front door, they&nbsp;
proceed to the basement in search of a gas can,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.640
where they discover a young girl,&nbsp;
filthy and silent, tied to a column.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.600
They return upstairs to find a method to free&nbsp;
the girl, but they are met by the homeowners,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.440
George, Gloria, and their baby son Ethan, who are&nbsp;
startled. George and Gloria provide money gently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.560
but Jules insists on knowing why the little girl&nbsp;
is below. George says that their 'Sweetiepie' is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.440
in the basement for discipline. Mickey threatens&nbsp;
them with his gun, but George calms them down and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.320
persuades them to sit down and speak. Mickey&nbsp;
has his gun primed while George calmly offers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.160
them the option of simply taking their vehicle&nbsp;
and driving away, claiming that he would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.200
considerably less inclined to call the cops if&nbsp;
they abducted Sweetiepie. Micky refuses their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.840
offer and supports Jules' desire to release the&nbsp;
girl, compelling George to unlock her at gunpoint.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.280
Mickey, free of her shackles, attempts to persuade&nbsp;
Sweetiepie to come forward, but she bites his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.600
hand. Gloria restrains Jules after George knocks&nbsp;
him out. Mickey awakens tied to a bed, Gloria&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.840
dancing in front of him in lingerie, but she is&nbsp;
disappointed when he does not have an erection.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.840
Mickey apologises the next time Gloria pays him a&nbsp;
visit. He seduces her and persuades her to let go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.520
of him, then pushes her away and flees. Mickey&nbsp;
recoils at a near gunshot as he tries to flee.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.720
George fires again, wounding him in the leg, and&nbsp;
ties him up with Jules in the basement. Mickey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.720
learns he can pick the locks on their handcuffs&nbsp;
with Jules' tongue ring, and after tearing it out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.840
he uncuffs her. Jules tries to pick Mickey's cuff&nbsp;
lock, but she breaks her tongue ring and is forced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.040
to seek aid on her own. Sweetiepie suggests&nbsp;
using the laundry chute as an escape route.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.000
George believes Jules has escaped and assaults&nbsp;
Mickey in search of information. Mickey lies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.840
and tells George that Jules has already left&nbsp;
the home and is waiting for Mickey to join her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.000
at their meeting point, and that if Mickey does&nbsp;
not show up in an hour, she will call the police,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.680
so George agrees to let Mickey go. Jules hides&nbsp;
upstairs in Ethan's nursery, only to discover that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.040
he is a porcelain doll covered in a blanket. She&nbsp;
overhears Mickey and George conversing downstairs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.960
and misinterprets their discussion as George&nbsp;
threatening to kill Mickey rather than let him go.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.440
Jules uses 'Ethan' as leverage, and&nbsp;
when she walks out onto the landing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.240
she threatens to drop the doll and&nbsp;
demands that they release Mickey.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.600
An furious Gloria shoots at her, prompting Jules&nbsp;
to drop the doll, which shatters on the floor.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.280
While Gloria prepares a dinner, the prisoners&nbsp;
are duct tied to the dining table. Gloria has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.560
always wanted a child, but George has been unable&nbsp;
to provide for her. They abducted Sweetiepie to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.960
their child, but Sweetiepie just served to remind&nbsp;
Gloria of the children she could never have.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.840
Gloria wanted to murder Sweetpie, but George&nbsp;
believed keeping her in the basement would be more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.280
compassionate. Gloria tells Jules that her mother&nbsp;
gave her 'Ethan' as a present when she was a child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.080
and died soon after. Mickey and Jules begin&nbsp;
to feel queasy after eating food that has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.280
tainted with what was discovered in Jules' bag.&nbsp;
George says that after Mickey and Jules pass out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.280
he and Gloria would give them heroin and then&nbsp;
report them as two drug addicts who overdosed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.160
while stealing them. A police officer knocks on&nbsp;
the door to notify George that the thieves' car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.200
has been seen nearby as Mickey and Jules begin&nbsp;
to lose consciousness. The officer requests to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.760
come in and check about, but there is no trace&nbsp;
of Mickey and Jules, who Gloria has concealed in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.400
a bedroom. The cop goes down to the basement but&nbsp;
is called away before he gets to meet Sweetiepie.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.280
Jules awakens from her drug overdose and&nbsp;
crawls to her suitcase across the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.760
snorting a cocaine bump. She regains her&nbsp;
strength and injects cocaine into Mickey's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.240
nostrils to give him a 'boost' and rouse&nbsp;
him up. When George and Gloria return,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.480
the room is vacant and the window is open, so&nbsp;
they go outside to explore the surrounding land.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.680
Mickey and Jules never left the home and simply&nbsp;
fooled George and Gloria into believing they did.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.800
They take advantage of the situation by grabbing&nbsp;
Sweetiepie and stealing the homeowners' car keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.280
Before they can go, George reappears and&nbsp;
waits on the driveway with his rifle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.240
Mickey urges Jules and Sweetiepie to duck&nbsp;
before driving forward, running over George&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.280
and inflicting deadly bullet wounds. Sweetiepie&nbsp;
takes up his gun and fatally shoots George in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.000
the skull as George, wounded but alive, drags&nbsp;
Jules out of the car and tries to strangle her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.600
Gloria walks out to see her blood-soaked husband&nbsp;
and collapses next to him in hysterical ecstasy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.120
saying that he is simply sleeping and that&nbsp;
they are ready to depart to begin a new life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.600
Jules and Sweetiepie set out on foot&nbsp;
to Florida, intending to hitch a ride.
