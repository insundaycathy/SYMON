00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.320
Welcome to Slash Forward. We’re almost there,&nbsp;
people. We’re looking at Saw 3D, renamed Saw:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.800
The Last Chapter even though it’s not. Hit the&nbsp;
like button if you’re ready to get to the traps,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.840
and I’ll do so, right after I unpack the storyline&nbsp;
to see what we can learn. Let’s get to it.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.640
We open, surprisingly, on Dr. Gordon,&nbsp;
wriggling his way along and finding a nice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.320
steamy pipe with which to cauterize his stump.&nbsp;
Before flashing to an unknown time and place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.680
where the bustle of the big city is brought to&nbsp;
a standstill by a curious storefront display.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.160
A couple of bros awake, attached to a saw&nbsp;
table, with their mutual lover dangling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.960
betwixt. Some of the gawkers call the police,&nbsp;
and one of them bangs on the glass. Otherwise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.280
they don’t really do much. Billy the automaton&nbsp;
then pedals out to Brad and Brian and...Tina,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.920
the ruiner of fine alliteration, letting them&nbsp;
know that the boys were played for simps,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.640
manipulated to provide for Tina’s every whim.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.800
So now they have sixty seconds to either&nbsp;
push the saws to one side or the other,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.600
cutting up a slab of man meat, or leaving it&nbsp;
in the middle to bifurcate Tina. Tina tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.960
charge Brad up with some encouraging words,&nbsp;
but Brian absolutely wrecks his Carhardts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.800
drawing first blood. But then he has&nbsp;
second thoughts and, after an apology,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.520
the police run up just in time to see the&nbsp;
boys awash in the blood of their sacrifice.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.360
We then circle back to the last&nbsp;
ending to watch Jill stagger off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.560
trying to avoid Hoffman who is out for blood.&nbsp;
He finds a nice, clean rag for his mangled hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.240
but opts to let his face air out a bit.&nbsp;
He soon arrives at his private toolshed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.640
to catch some news and sew himself up,&nbsp;
and the results are barely noticeable.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.040
Then we go back to the station where Jill&nbsp;
is looking for help outside the FBI and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.200
homicide department. For protection from&nbsp;
her various pursuers she enlists the help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.160
of Gibson from Internal Affairs. She agrees&nbsp;
to give him some moisture rich evidence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.240
but only if he grants her full immunity,&nbsp;
as is the purview of the police force.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.240
He’s a bit incredulous, until she drops the hot&nbsp;
stuff and he nearly explodes with anticipation.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.200
Back at the toolshed, Hoffman makes like he never&nbsp;
existed as he prepares for the inevitable fallout.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.560
Which may include Bobby Dagan, a Jigsaw survivor&nbsp;
who’s written a book about his experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.080
He explains to his expectant host how he had to&nbsp;
pierce his breasts in order to hoist himself to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.160
platform of salvation. Near death, he recognized&nbsp;
his was a life left unexamined and dug deep to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.680
find the strength and courage to carry through.&nbsp;
He pretty much slaughtered this performance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.480
but his management team disagrees about whether&nbsp;
he was exploitative enough of his own trauma.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.240
Elsewhere, Jill emerges into the evening fog&nbsp;
and finds a strange scene. It seems a bit too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.280
set up and, as suspected, she gets grabbed&nbsp;
here. You see, he’s got this rocket sled,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.600
and it would be terribly disappointing if he&nbsp;
had to run before using it. As it screams down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.400
the track and quarters her helpless body, we&nbsp;
discover this to be a rare dream sequence.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.760
In the junkyard district of town,&nbsp;
Evan wakes up in his project car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.120
which powers on its magical 8-track player. It&nbsp;
announces that he and his friends are racists and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.280
since they all follow his lead, it’s&nbsp;
time for him to lead them all to safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.920
All he has to do is pull the lever before&nbsp;
him. The process of doing so should help him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.800
to understand how we’re all made of the same&nbsp;
stuff on the inside. He makes a go of it and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.480
despite getting 3/4s of the way, he gasses&nbsp;
out, which results in a tremendous catastrophe.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.240
Now that the story’s been properly&nbsp;
advanced, we meet back up with Bobby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.760
leading a survivor’s meeting with cameras in tow.&nbsp;
He attempts to help them cope, but is he licensed?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.720
We don’t know. At any rate, if we’re&nbsp;
getting a bit tired of hearing him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.360
talk about the goodness of suffering, we&nbsp;
have Simone joining the chat to call BS.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.520
She insists there is no absolution through&nbsp;
pain, but Bobby rallies and insists they all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.280
must search for the positive to derive&nbsp;
some meaning from their experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.320
This is mainly for the cameras,&nbsp;
and you know who’s not impressed?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.840
Dr. Gordon. He leaves him with some choice&nbsp;
words. However, the final verdict? He crushed it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.680
again. And when he gets out to his car he&nbsp;
learns he’s going to be doing it all over.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.520
Meanwhile, the cops have discovered the most&nbsp;
recent site, and call in Gibson to lend his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.400
expertise as an IA administrator. The tape is&nbsp;
warped from the crash, so they’re left to wonder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.960
why. But it appears possible this was&nbsp;
all to flex a little on old Gibson.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.880
Bobby then wakes up inside a tumbler and learns&nbsp;
it is, again, game time. But actually not...again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.080
it is game time, but he lied about his previous&nbsp;
experience. So now he gets to learn a valuable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.480
life lesson. He has sixty minutes to pass&nbsp;
some tests and save his wife. The cage is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.560
then lifted above a spike platform with a&nbsp;
ring hanging above. With no instruction,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.640
he immediately pulls the ring, which drops&nbsp;
out the bottom. He hangs on tight and donkey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.440
kongs his way to safety while Joyce gets a&nbsp;
little preview of what’s to come on the CCTV.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.920
He takes a moment to flash back to when he and&nbsp;
his bud were just a couple of washed out losers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.320
and a news story of a survivor’s travails&nbsp;
gave him the motivation he needed to kick off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.200
his self-help empire. Then he heads to the only&nbsp;
unlocked door and follows the trail before him.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.520
As we catch up with all our various characters,&nbsp;
we find that Jill is safe and sound in witness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.840
protection, and that Gibson is so upset that&nbsp;
she’s still holding out on him about some key&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.040
details. She’s concerned about her safety&nbsp;
even here, at which Gibson scoffs. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:28.240
it’s a safehouse, is it not? But then they get&nbsp;
a DVD delivered from Hoffman I know, right?

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.240
Gibson gets an update from Rogers, who has&nbsp;
to hang up when a bomb goes off at the yard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.920
So they focus their attention to the&nbsp;
DVD, which must’ve been copied off a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.520
VHS judging by the tracking bars.&nbsp;
In order to stop the ongoing game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.000
they’ll have to turn over Jill. Instead,&nbsp;
Gibson orders her locked up in a holding cell.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.920
When Bobby makes it to his next challenge,&nbsp;
he finds his associate strapped down with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.320
some menacing pipes pointing at her. It seems&nbsp;
that this contraption was devised to help with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.840
pulling loose teeth, but he plays the tape to be&nbsp;
sure. The key to her padlock is inside of her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.560
attached to a hook. If time runs out or she&nbsp;
screams too loud, the pipes will enter her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.520
Naturally, she immediately starts screaming. Nina&nbsp;
gets calm and gives Bobby permission to just go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.080
for it. But honetly, that sucker is in there so&nbsp;
tight, they didn’t really need to have a time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.200
limit imposed. Cause ya girl can’t help but to&nbsp;
scream. He does get it out with only a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.880
of her esophagus, but he misses the timer. After&nbsp;
he shouts out his dissatisfaction into her cold,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.840
dead face, we see that failures cause Joyce&nbsp;
to get pulled a little closer to the floor.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.400
In the next room, he finds a copy of his book&nbsp;
that he had previously signed for a teenaged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.640
John Kramer. He gives him a little&nbsp;
guff about his lying ways, which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.280
really coming home to roost now, as the kids say.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.880
Back at the precinct, Gibson recognizes&nbsp;
a lawn cherub from the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.240
and then they’re alerted of some security&nbsp;
footage that shows them the abduction,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.320
getting them one step closer to the edge.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.720
In the next room Bobby finds his attorney&nbsp;
Suzanne pinned to a table. Before he can do much,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.600
kool aid Billy smashes his way into the room. He&nbsp;
learns that she’s on a rotating table that’s set&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.840
to pierce her eyes and mouth unless he’s&nbsp;
able to lift a set of bars that closes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.520
a circuit and slows her table. Ya boi manages&nbsp;
to press a full stack like an absolute madman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.400
and even while getting fully stabbed in the&nbsp;
ribs. But he’s untrained in static contractions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.600
causing him to continuously fail. A necessary&nbsp;
step for building mass, but only delaying the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.960
inevitable as regards Suzanne’s face, making&nbsp;
her death, in a way, much, much worse.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.680
Back at the station, Gibson asks Jill about Bobby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.080
but she claims to know nothing of him. When they&nbsp;
return, they’ve received a new video from Hoffman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.520
He drops a little riddle for his old pals, which&nbsp;
Gibson immediately picks up on, so they head out.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.280
Bobby then advances again, but not&nbsp;
to Joyce. Cale is the next victim,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.560
on the other side of a catwalk and&nbsp;
presently freaking the freak out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.400
due to a head contraption that prevents him&nbsp;
from seeing. Bobby is to guide Cale across,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.320
then meet him with the key before the winch&nbsp;
engages and cranks on his neck. They make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.520
their way across and Cale nearly denies the winch&nbsp;
her prize. Bobby snags the key with ten seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.880
to spare, but then tosses it to a blind man,&nbsp;
sealing his fate. So Bobby exits stage right.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.680
Gibson and Rogers bust in to find the cherub.&nbsp;
This is the location where Hoffman saved Gibson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.440
as a beat cop. Gibson got jammed up&nbsp;
and, while thankful for his life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.840
did not appreciate Hoffman’s disdain for&nbsp;
the citizenry. Gibson turned him in and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.080
has been trying to put him away ever since.&nbsp;
The clue trail then points him at an old,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.440
abandoned psychiatric hospital. He goes to check&nbsp;
that, and sends Rogers back to hover over Jill.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.840
Meanwhile, Bobby gets to the final room, where&nbsp;
he can see and communicate with his baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.400
He tries to reassure her before Billy cuts&nbsp;
in. The door before him has a four digit code,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.320
and he has the numbers etched into his&nbsp;
molars. The next steps are obvious,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.680
so he gets started as a police&nbsp;
tactical unit works to catch up.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.480
He makes good time, wrenching out his bloody&nbsp;
chiclets. And halfway in, they track the video’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.440
source to the address of the junkyard. So Gibson&nbsp;
peels off to finish his unfinished business,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.520
and is unable to share in Bobby’s&nbsp;
success as he gets the code and proceeds.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.760
The team then pulls on a door that engages&nbsp;
a gas trap, taking them out of the equation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.160
While Gibson arrives at the junkyard and finds&nbsp;
a secret entrance through which he eventually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.200
presumably, finds Hoffman in his Jigsaw robes.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.440
Back with Joyce, Bobby’s final test is&nbsp;
to earn her love by surviving the very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.520
game he contrived for his book. He has&nbsp;
to pierce dem titties and hoist himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.200
up to connect some extension cords.&nbsp;
He comes clean about his deception,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.840
and apologizes for lying as she admonishes&nbsp;
him, even though he’s doing the dang thing.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.520
At that same time, we learn the man at&nbsp;
the chair is actually one of the corpses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.120
and that Hoffman’s had eyes on them the&nbsp;
whole time. Gibson puts together that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.440
while distracted by the explosion, Hoffman had&nbsp;
pulled the old switcheroo with the body so he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.160
could get back into the station in the manner of&nbsp;
a true mastermind. Gibson tries to call Palmer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.480
to have her order everyone back to the station,&nbsp;
but he and the boys get squibbed up while Hoffman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.600
emerges and slathers his face wounds in fresh&nbsp;
blood as he kills his way to the holding cell.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.200
When we circle back to Bobby he’s looking fit&nbsp;
and moist, and getting the job done. Luckily,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.320
skin is very easy to puncture. Joyce professes&nbsp;
her love for him pursuant to this new sacrifice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.440
and he cranks his chain all the way&nbsp;
to the top. He basically makes it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.680
but finds he didn’t go deep enough and crashes&nbsp;
back to the floor. The timer then counts down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.600
and Joyce is entombed in a brazen hog,&nbsp;
which lights up and roasts her alive.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.760
Meanwhile, Hoffman lands a perfect eye shot&nbsp;
from the observation room. He walks in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.800
thinking he has the edge, not realizing&nbsp;
that she used her time to craft her first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.120
shank. She sticks him and runs until she finds&nbsp;
a little spot to duck away in. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.760
Hoffman finds her and renders her unconscious.&nbsp;
He then dusts off the torture chair they keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.440
around and buckles her down. After&nbsp;
that, he hooks her up with a classic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.800
sets the timer and lets it ride - giving the fans&nbsp;
the payoff they’ve been waiting for? Who knows.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.560
He then waltzes back to his toolshed&nbsp;
to continue escaping. But while he’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.680
walking away slowly from an explosion, he’s&nbsp;
pounced upon by the cult of John Kramer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.800
led by none other than Dr. Gordon. We find&nbsp;
he was indebted to Jigsaw for nursing him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.880
back to health and caring tenderly for&nbsp;
his stump. He is then enlisted to employ&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.560
his surgical skills in the execution&nbsp;
of various traps that required it.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.640
We learn that in exchange for his help, and&nbsp;
in acting on his behalf after his death,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.840
John agreed to share with him the final secret -&nbsp;
the location of his old room that he was so fond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:13.040
of. This is where he leaves Hoffman but,&nbsp;
unlike before, he offers no redemption.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.120
This was the first film that feels distinctly&nbsp;
different from the rest of the series.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.720
As we’re looking for bigger payoffs, things&nbsp;
are getting progressively more silly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.880
and I wonder if they’re drifting from the original&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.520
intent? Is this good or bad from a trap&nbsp;
perspective? Let’s take a look and see.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.400
We’ll start, as the movie does, with the triple&nbsp;
saw situation. Here we have an opening trap to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.120
set the tone. Incidentally, it’s not connected to&nbsp;
any of the other scenarios that unfold throughout&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:42.720
the movie, and comes across as contrived merely&nbsp;
for shock value. Tone set, let’s go. This trap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.840
seems to be initiated by magic - what is the&nbsp;
timing on it, in terms of starting the motor and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.480
rolling Billy out and the participants actually&nbsp;
waking up? This may seem nitpicky, but it’s highly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.360
problematic, because if magic is involved, I’m&nbsp;
going to have to do a lot more research. The basic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.800
gist here is the boys can either fight it out in&nbsp;
a reverse tug of war, pushing the saws to one side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.440
or the other and obliterating their partner.&nbsp;
Or, they can leave them as-is and let Tina get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.960
split into two medium-sized portions. They end up&nbsp;
with option B, although I’m not sure they had to.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.360
It’s hard to tell what all is going on with these&nbsp;
quick cuts and close shots, but I think there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.400
at least two possible ways to beat this from the&nbsp;
inside. Obviously, if some of these bystanders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.080
would have gotten off their ass and done&nbsp;
something, it may have been a very different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:31.520
outcome. Yea, a 110 lb lady slapping the flat&nbsp;
side of her briefcase against the glass didn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.000
break it, but are we to assume this structure&nbsp;
was purpose built? Is this bulletproof glass,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.280
or just the window glass from a building that&nbsp;
already exists? Does the building have doors or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.640
employees? Already we’re starting off with quite a&nbsp;
few absurdities just to bring this thing together.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:51.120
But from inside, the fellas are harnessed to&nbsp;
the frame by their wrists and hips. Even so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.760
they seem to have a good deal of range of motion.&nbsp;
And, they don’t seem to have to move too terribly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.560
far to get that center saw to start dropping&nbsp;
significantly. With their saws oriented upward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.480
it seems possible that they could cheat&nbsp;
far enough to one side or the other,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.640
moving their bodies out of the way of the saw, to&nbsp;
create a safe environment for all three of them.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.960
It can also be confirmed that these are gas&nbsp;
powered tools. The exhaust builds up over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.360
course of the trap, and some still shots reveal&nbsp;
that the exhaust ports are unprotected and right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.680
on the side. One of the boys could likely put&nbsp;
their foot over the end of the exhaust, or even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.480
rest their face across it or their mouth to choke&nbsp;
it out and stop it’s rotation. It would then be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.960
safe to pull the contraption all the way over on&nbsp;
the side where the saw is no longer functioning.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.800
Next is the junkyard set up. If you were&nbsp;
unfortunate to find yourself involved in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.200
this trap, you’re probably going to wind up dead.&nbsp;
But, based on the recording, as long as you’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.600
not a racist that would be unlikely to happen.&nbsp;
This is another trap designed for death. Yea,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.480
I think we may want to believe we would&nbsp;
have the inner strength to be able to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.600
what needs to be done, but this is a full&nbsp;
thickness degloving of Evan’s entire torso.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.320
Absolutely brutal and, I’m going to say it,&nbsp;
probably not possible. I think it likely you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.680
would go into shock before you ever got&nbsp;
far enough, even if it was possible to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.840
separate this much skin from your back&nbsp;
slowly and through sheer force of will.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.000
No, in this one, Hoffman needed this to go&nbsp;
down. It was integral to the overall plot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.720
and initiated all the key requirements of his&nbsp;
master plan. If this trap didn’t kill, none of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.440
the rest of the movie would happen, which is why&nbsp;
it’s such a ridiculously impossible scenario.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.000
Just glancing it over, I do wonder if your skin&nbsp;
would actually give way before the upholstery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.520
If you don’t want to test it, perhaps there is&nbsp;
a sharp enough object lying around nearby that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.680
would allow you to cut it away enough to be able&nbsp;
to lean toward the lever? This then leads me to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.400
acknowledge the importance of always carrying&nbsp;
a knife on you, a vital survival tool in all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.200
situations. But then it seems likely you would&nbsp;
be stripped of useful tools before being put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.960
into the setup, which naturally leads to&nbsp;
the rule amendment that you should always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:48.080
keyster a knife so you have access to a useful&nbsp;
and vital tool in all survival situations. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.680
the newest rule would be to always have a&nbsp;
knife, ensured by storing it up your butt.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.080
Moving on to Bobby now, as he&nbsp;
dominates the remainder of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.840
traps through this movie. Just to set&nbsp;
the stage, he is inside a very much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.600
uncleared area with sixty minutes to&nbsp;
make his way through the various rooms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.840
saving his cohorts along the way, until he&nbsp;
eventually gets the chance to save his wife.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.400
He starts out inside a cylindrical cage&nbsp;
that hangs above some spikes. This one has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.880
no instructions and no broader message. It’s&nbsp;
sort of a light warmup for what’s to come,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.960
and represents more of a physical challenge&nbsp;
than what we normally see. He also escaped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.360
it with no problem, so it doesn’t warrant much&nbsp;
analysis. Realistically, if you were attempting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.200
to release yourself, it would behoove you to&nbsp;
start by getting your feet wedged into those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.400
squares to maintain a solid base. Also, the&nbsp;
swinging and jumping aspect would be easier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.280
from the very bottom of the cage rather than&nbsp;
several rungs up, but these are minor quibbles.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.320
This brings him to fishhook Nina,&nbsp;
restrained in a straightjacket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.360
and tied down in the center of this&nbsp;
contraption. First step here is to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:49.440
ignore the key. The fact that there’s sound&nbsp;
control on this device makes it impossible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.200
and there’s enough blood coming out here that&nbsp;
she’s unlikely to survive anyway. She would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.600
probably end up suffocating from the pressure of&nbsp;
the blood pooling up around her internal organs.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.280
You’d want to focus on trying to stop the&nbsp;
machine to give more time to disassemble&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.680
it and get her out. As an initial point, the&nbsp;
timer device has an on/off switch contained&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.560
directly on its face. That would be a first&nbsp;
step. From there, it might be worthwhile to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.560
find something you could use for leverage,&nbsp;
possibly from the prior area, and see if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.960
could pry against the frame of the machine to get&nbsp;
the gears to gap just enough so they can’t grip.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.520
If this process is a bit too noisy, risking the&nbsp;
victim’s throat, this device has a variety of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.138
exposed wiring you could tug on to various&nbsp;
effect. The SPL meter is fully exposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.137 --> 00:16:25.839
The cord coming out of the lockbox is similarly&nbsp;
exposed. Once you’ve taken care of that aspect,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.400
you could keep working on pulling things apart. I&nbsp;
see no reason why you wouldn’t be able to wrench&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.640
this padlock off the box or its little metal&nbsp;
strap. With the presence of so many cans along&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.560
the wall here, I also wonder about the presence&nbsp;
of a can opener somewhere. It seems like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.960
could be helpful in regards to cutting wires,&nbsp;
if needed. So really, there are a lot of options&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.880
with this one, you just have to look beyond&nbsp;
the person and become one with the machine.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.040
This brings us to Suzanne’s table. I would’ve&nbsp;
liked to have come into this room to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.520
Suzanne partially free. She really had a lot of&nbsp;
arm freedom here, and I feel it was squandered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.760
somewhat by her. But that’s a secondary concern&nbsp;
as there are several, simple options elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:04.560
Her table is motivated by a simple gear and chain&nbsp;
system. These types of chains are adjustable in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.400
length, and will typically have a connecting&nbsp;
link that allows you to shorten or lengthen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.640
it before closing it off again. Pulling this link&nbsp;
out of the chain would completely negate the trap.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:17.120
There are also a couple of options at the actual&nbsp;
machine, which was not well thought out. First,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.720
the expectation is that he will press&nbsp;
the weight upward. But, in so doing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.200
it enters his ribcage from the side. How is he&nbsp;
supposed to press up while this thing is going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.920
in from the side? This complication is ultimately&nbsp;
negated, however, in how the system works.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.520
By pressing up to the top, he touches&nbsp;
two bars that then close a circuit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.200
slowing the table. If he slows it to&nbsp;
the end of the timer, she will survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:42.720
Atop this contraption are some clearly visible&nbsp;
exposed wires. It seems possible to pull these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:48.960
wires and attach them in the middle. Barring that,&nbsp;
you could also put any of a variety of random,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.880
conductive objects between these two connection&nbsp;
points in order to close the circuit without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.840
having to move the bar at all or very much. In&nbsp;
particular, there were some warmers or coolers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.920
or something near the kitchen that had some metal&nbsp;
wire racks in them that could be propped up here.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.600
From here we find ourselves at another&nbsp;
challenge that rewards physicality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.560
Cale’s winch-noose. This challenge seems a bit&nbsp;
stretched. The odds of guiding Cale blindly across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.800
these boards is so small, and it takes so much&nbsp;
time to talk to him, the best odds would really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.760
be for him to stay put and for Bobby to just come&nbsp;
all the way over. Realistically, this is doable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.320
with a bit of agility and some calculated risks.&nbsp;
For instance, Bobby tossed him the key at the end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.200
rather than hopping over to him. But why not hop?&nbsp;
He did it once before, and there had to be some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.280
way for Cale to get to where he was so they could&nbsp;
exit the door at the end? This trap really puts a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.160
lot of emphasis on the downward dangers when it’s&nbsp;
really upward that’s the problem. Cale is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.800
get hung if you don’t get across quickly enough,&nbsp;
and the drop is just one floor. You would have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:48.080
fall from higher than four floors to ensure death.&nbsp;
So, as uncomfortable as it may be, you’re really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:53.200
weighing the risk of minor to moderate injury&nbsp;
over someone else completely dying. Here I will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.360
have to also invoke the technique previously&nbsp;
established by Hoffman of pulling down hard to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.640
get out of a head harness. Cale is likely familiar&nbsp;
with this style of device as it seems the sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.200
thing he would have at home, and if he could get&nbsp;
vision, everything would run a lot more smoothly.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.240
The final two challenges are fairly&nbsp;
straightforward and, since they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.760
designed with the intent of wrapping up the&nbsp;
final plot points of the movie, there isn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.080
a lot of detail available for them. The first&nbsp;
involves a simple code lock to open a door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:23.200
and the code is imprinted on Bobby’s teeth. He&nbsp;
did pass this one. And, with such limited time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.520
and resources available, the option he went&nbsp;
with isn’t necessarily a bad one. It’s not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.080
clear exactly how this mechanism is set up, but&nbsp;
these types of devices are typically very simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.680
There are a couple of wires intended to provide&nbsp;
power to the keypad, and then a couple of wires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.320
that communicate the signal as to whether the&nbsp;
circuit is open or closed in order to engage or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.560
disengage the locking mechanism. Would it have&nbsp;
been possible to bridge them and open the door?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.960
Perhaps, there are wires sticking out on the&nbsp;
front here. But at this point you’d be tired&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.640
and emotionally exhausted. A little pain&nbsp;
might actually perk you back up and give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:57.760
you the drive you need to see this thing through.&nbsp;
Especially on the heels of so, so many failures.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:02.160
Which finally brings us to dear, innocent&nbsp;
Joyce, who paid a tremendous price for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:07.120
transgressions of her husband. Bobby is to hoist&nbsp;
himself up to plug in an extension cord via a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.520
simple chain and pulley device with two hooks&nbsp;
on it. It seems the primary thing slowing him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:17.200
down was the pain of piercing his pecs and pulling&nbsp;
himself up by his flesh. So, don’t use your flesh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.960
bro. Put your belt at approximately&nbsp;
nipple height and latch onto that. Or,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:25.120
leave it on your waist. Or, if you don’t have&nbsp;
a belt on, use the top part of your pants,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.960
which can also be rolled over a few&nbsp;
times to enlist the help of more fabric,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.640
increasing the tensile strength and improving&nbsp;
the odds of getting yourself up there.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.240
All in all, this whole funhouse of challenges&nbsp;
would be an easy one to make it through.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.960
You could really fail as much as&nbsp;
you’d like, and still get to the end,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.600
which would then just require you&nbsp;
to pull a couple wisdom teeth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

which you were going to have done anyway,&nbsp;
and then you’re golden. You’ve got this.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.120
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;
my donors, memorialized in the hall of headshots.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.400
I have a website set up where you can&nbsp;
support the channel through donations or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:09.120
merch. Any donation unlocks uncensored movie&nbsp;
reviews of Lifeforce and Under the Skin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.080
with others to be added over&nbsp;
time. If you enjoyed the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.840
I’d love for you to become a part of the&nbsp;
channel by subscribing. Thanks for watching.
