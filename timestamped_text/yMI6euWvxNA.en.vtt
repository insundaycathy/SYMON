00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.560
plans are in motion the team goes to their&nbsp;
hideout where dom feels that he must carry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.600
the weight of the mission due to jacob whoever&nbsp;
jacob meanwhile roman muses to tedge and ramsay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.560
that they must be invincible due to coming out of&nbsp;
numerous insane scenarios practically unscathed&nbsp;&nbsp;

for jacob i need to be here ramsay then explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.960
to everyone that the device is called project&nbsp;
aries which can be used to hack into any system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.600

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.320
after testing it out the trio is proud that&nbsp;
it made it far enough without blowing up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:18.320
ramsay notices that the security cameras are going&nbsp;
haywire meaning something from jacob's team is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.520
blocking them out roman and ted find some large&nbsp;
truck drivers and fight them on roman's suspicion

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.880
it turns out they are driving a&nbsp;
truck with an electromagnetic field&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:35.760
you know silver ain't magnetic right you know what&nbsp;
just shut up and it has allowed jacob to find the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:41.600
second piece of aries he starts making his escape&nbsp;
via zipline but dom spots him and chases after him

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.040
roman and tedge fight more goons inside the truck&nbsp;
while ramsay clumsily commandeers it through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.040 --> 00:11:13.840
the streets of london crashing into many cars&nbsp;
along the way dom catches jacob and fights him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:28.320
but the younger toretto makes his escape by&nbsp;
stealing a car after dom joins the other three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.640
they use the truck to pull jacob's car toward them

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.360
after this setback otto and&nbsp;
his men return to their base&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.120
cipher taunts him and says that this is the&nbsp;
part where the villain suffers a setback&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:50.400
and she is prepared to offer a solution no&nbsp;
offense the team brings jacob into their custody

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.120
mia and letty return with han and l to the hideout

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.560

he explains the circumstances surrounding his&nbsp;
death after jisel died the car exploded and you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.280
still alive like i'm trying to roman can you can't&nbsp;
just be quiet for one minute he went to tokyo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.080
where he had been recruited by mr nobody&nbsp;
since he had previously worked with jisel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:36.480
and thought he could also trust han elle's parents&nbsp;
worked on project aries and were killed for it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.680
when she was a child han came to protect her since&nbsp;
her blood is the key component in activating aries

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.360
after deckard shaw came into the picture they&nbsp;
saw it as an opportunity to fake his death

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.880
now for the hard part

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.840
keeping you dead otto and his&nbsp;
goon soon attacked the hideout

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.840
here it is revealed that jacob was an&nbsp;
agent of mr nobodies that went rogue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.880
and he also reveals to dom that their father&nbsp;
had intended to throw the race that day to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.880
compensated for the family's debts dad died&nbsp;
because he was trying to throw that race&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.520
we were in deep debt and he personally&nbsp;
asked jacob to mess with the car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.040
but they kept it from dom to protect his view of&nbsp;
jack and jacob never anticipated what would happen

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:49.520
i will stop you and that's my promise the heroes&nbsp;
fight otto's men as most of the team gets out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:54.400
dom stays behind and pulls on some chains to bring&nbsp;
down a platform with himself and the other goons

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.040
hitting the water below dom&nbsp;
appears to have a vision&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.640
showing jack teaching him and jacob as children&nbsp;
about fixing cars he sees little brian asking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.360
him when he is coming home he then sees a memory&nbsp;
in which he saw jack having a tense phone call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:30.240
lending credence to what jacob&nbsp;
said about their troubles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.280
just when it looks like dom is ready to give&nbsp;
in letty jumps into the water and rescues him

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.720
auto launches a satellite into orbit&nbsp;
that will help with control of aries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.480
they also for sale to activate it

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.160
otto and jacob drive their armored&nbsp;
truck through tbilisi while the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:57.920
heroes make their way toward that area&nbsp;
tedge and roman use a rocket car on top&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.200
of a drone and they are launched into&nbsp;
orbit as well to try and destroy the

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:11.840
satellite

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:24.080
we ain't out of space man&nbsp;

gang uses the villains electromagnets to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.160
take out incoming bands as they&nbsp;
get closer to jacob and otto

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.720
mia and hand make it to the truck with&nbsp;
elle inside and kill the goons guarding

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:53.840
her

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:07.840
otto reveals he is betraying jacob and is now&nbsp;
working with cipher you were never my competition

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.840
dom sees jacob is in danger and&nbsp;
quickly maneuvers to help him

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:35.840
mia helps jacob get to safety

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.200
elle used the machine gun to&nbsp;
try to slow down the truck

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.480
dom tries to use the magnet to pull&nbsp;
some cars to slow down the truck

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.440
but still it keeps on going dom then&nbsp;
comes up with a plan to get the cars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.600
to magnetize to the front of the&nbsp;
truck and jacob comes back to help

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:17.840
they send it flipping upwards&nbsp;
until they get it out of the city&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.440
ares is nearly done uploading but&nbsp;
tedge and roman's car craps out on them

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.360
leaving them no choice but&nbsp;
to ram into the satellite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.280
in order to destroy it and sever the link

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:46.000
on the outskirts of the city dom is still inside&nbsp;
the truck with otta while cipher sends a drone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.960
after dawn just as she fires a blast at&nbsp;
the truck dom manages to jump out while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:56.640
otto blows up inside the truck and the impact&nbsp;
causes the truck to smash into cypher's drone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:02.400
frustrated at another defeat she makes her getaway&nbsp;
once more dom then buries the hatchet with jacob

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.360
that's the second chance

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.720
and he parts ways with dom and mia once more

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:30.400
meanwhile some astronauts from a space station&nbsp;
come across tedge and roman after returning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:36.000
