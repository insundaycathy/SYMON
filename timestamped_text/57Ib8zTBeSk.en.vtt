00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.619
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:07.019
Today I will show you a Comedy, Crime, Drama
film from 2015, titled Focus.

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:08.710
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.490
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.940
The con man Nicky Spurgeon goes to a bar in
New York City.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.140
There he sees a beautiful young blonde woman
with a man who seems to be pestering her.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.840
She flees from him and goes to Nicky's table
to use him as a scapegoat.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.410
Her name is Jess.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.650
After a few drinks, she seduces Nicky into
going upstairs to her hotel room , and they

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.730
start making out.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.070
Then a man storms into the room with a gun
and threatens to shoot Nicky.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.090
Jess says that he is her husband.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.080
Nicky then jokes that he has cancer, and Jess
figures that he's onto them.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.400
Nicky says that the attempt was atrocious
and how they should have done it if they really

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.900
wanted to rob him before he leaves.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.070
Curiosity gets the better of him and after
Jess leaves the hotel, he approaches her and

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.080
invites her out for coffee.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.211
Nicky tells her a story about two partners
who were involved in a scam gone wrong, where

00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:59.320
one partner had to shoot the other to make
it appear they were not working together.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.130
The partners in question were Nicky's father
and grandfather, and one shot the other with

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.619
something called "Toledo Panic Button".

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.420
Jess begs Nicky to teach her.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.280
He agrees and says that the con is a game
of focus.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.880
Outside, Nicky explains that attention is
a spotlight and their job is to dance in the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.880
dark.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.970
The human brain is slow and can not multitask,
you have to get inside the victim's head and

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.459
perceive things from their perspective, he
continues as he lifts things from her.

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.780
He wishes her luck and leaves.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.380
Nicky takes his business to New Orleans with
his friend Horst and his own team of grifters.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.229
On a side note, Nicky has a gambling problem
as he loses money on a horse race.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.969
Jess finds Nicky a few days later after doing
her research on him.

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.399
She asks him to let her join the team.

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.689
Nicky agrees to try her out and instantly
introduces her to Horst, he knew Jess was

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:47.689
coming.

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.649
It's Super Bowl week and the town is packed
with people.

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.859
Jess joins them for a practice round.

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:56.439
They lead her through the crowded streets
where they swipe watches, purses and other

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.000
jewelry from unsuspecting people.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.619
Nicky is impressed and she gets to join the
team.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.939
They also take her to a hotel casino where
they let her in on even more of their schemes,

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.509
like identity theft and credit card forgery.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.879
They even set up fake ATMs to record the pin
codes.

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.580
Jess meets Nicky's friend and partner Farhad.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.409
He's involved in even more complicated schemes.

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.150
Farhad basically ignores Jess' existence and
asks everything about her, even if Nicky will

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.459
be tapping that because he surely would.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.870
Despite his behavior, Jess still takes a liking
to him.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.260
When explaining to Jess what they are doing
with the stolen data in their base and how

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.790
they are splitting the profits percentage-wise,
she notices a necklace she likes, but Nicky

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.599
tells her that everything they steal has to
be sold, so there's no proof.

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.990
When Jess inquires to Nicky about a big con,
so big that they can retire on the spot, he

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:50.590
just says that they are in a bulk business
and that big scams are just a fantasy.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.270
Nicky asks for a cash stack to bid on a race
track, while all the bags are checked and

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.270
the money is counted.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.409
Nicky gets Jess a place to stay and when she
asks him for a lift, he tells her she'd better

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:58.719
get a cab.

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.799
He points out to her that there should be
no romantic relationship between them.

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.750
Some time later, he comes to her anyway and
they start getting it on.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.610
Jess asks Nicky why some people call him "Mellow."

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.090
He says his dad used to call him that because
he told him he was soft like a marshmallow.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.420
Nicky believes that there is no room for heart
in this game because it can get you killed.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.500
The night before the big game, when all the
cheating is through, Nicky turns to the team

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.209
and congratulates them on a record-breaking
week that brought in $1.2 million.

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.969
He sends everyone home with the usual promise
to send them their cut.

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:34.580
Horst gives Nicky the bag of money and makes
Nicky promise that he will not gamble with

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.580
it.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.829
Nicky promises as Jess looks on.

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.290
Nicky and Jess are going to a football game.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.110
Jess mentions that she does not like football,
so Nicky makes a game of making little bets

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.890
with each other, like whether one fan will
catch a hot dog and whether another will be

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.890
too drunk to stand up for the wave.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.170
They see a woman in short shorts and bet how
many men will look at her butt as she walks

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.170
by.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.269
Jess bets 8 and Nicky bets 3.

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.209
A curious man named Mr. Liuyan joins the game
and bets 5.

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.290
Seven men look at the woman's butt as she
walks by, with Jess being the closest.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.239
Liyuan suggests they place some bets on the
game.

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.959
Jess declines, since she does not know anything
about football.

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.360
Nicky accepts his suggestion and they bet
$1000, with Nicky losing.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.300
When Nicky wants to fold, Liuyan practically
begs him to play along.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.240
Reluctantly, Nicky agrees and raises the bet.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.710
He loses and gives him the stack of bills.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.330
The stakes escalate as the two get going.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.110
After losing $100,000, Jess thrusts the bag
of cash into Nicky's arms and tells him they

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.260
have to leave.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.190
He takes the money, slides it on the table,
and bets all of the remaining cash ($1.1 million)

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.940
on a simple high card draw.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.410
Liuyan is thrilled, he calls and draws a 5.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.150
Nicky is elated as the odds are in his favour,
when he turns the card over he sees a 3.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.020
He loses everything their team has been working
on.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.320
Jess sits down in shock and Nicky just stands
there stunned.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.800
Nicky finally has enough and wants to leave.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.020
Mr. Liuyan goads him again, "That's what you
get for playing with the big boys."

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.000
Nicky turns around and decides to double the
bet again.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.020
He tells Liuyan to pick any player on the
field, and he will guess which one it is - a

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.100
seemingly impossible chance.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.770
Mr. Liuyan thinks he's crazy and does not
bet on crazy people, so he declines.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.960
Nicky sweetens the deal by saying Jess will
pick the player Liuyan saw, much to Jess'

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.050
dismay.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.560
Liuyan can not turn down free money, so he
picks a player.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.310
As Jess nervously looks through the binoculars,
Liuyan gives them a chance to back out.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.350
Jess looks to Nicky, who seems to be begging
him to take this chance to back out, but Nicky

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.920
tells her to pick.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.250
Jess nervously scans the players again.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.950
Suddenly, she spots Farhad, who is wearing
a number 55 jersey.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.950
She grins and picks him, and to everyone's,
but Nicky’s surprise, that's the right answer.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.280
On the cab ride home, Nicky, now carrying
a lot of money, explains to Jess that this

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.140
was planned from the beginning.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.440
He knew Liyuan was a notorious gambler, so
he set it up so Liuyan would see the number

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.570
55 throughout the day, subconsciously making
him pick that number when the moment was right.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.650
Nicky then has the taxi pull over while another
car pulls up behind them.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.460
He instructs the cab driver to take Jess to
the airport.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.660
He leaves her her share of the money and drives
off without another word, leaving Jess confused

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.300
and heartbroken.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.910
Three years later.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.490
In Buenos Aires.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.480
Argentina, Nicky is working with a billionaire
race car owner named Rafael Garriga and his

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.780
partner Owens.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.500
They are in possession of a revolutionary
new fuel burn algorithm that will give them

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.400
an edge in the upcoming season.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.920
However, Rafael is worried that this will
not be enough.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.570
Therefore, Nicky is to pose as a disgruntled
former employee of Rafael and sell a fake

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.260
version to another team owner, McEwen, who
is his biggest competitor.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.340
As a result, the competition gets slower while
he gets faster.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.910
Nicky goes to a party at Rafael's mansion.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.290
He tells the bartender to pour him water when
he asks for vodka on the rocks, since he is

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.450
an alcoholic, to give the impression that
he is getting drunk.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.930
Nicky makes conversation with all the guests.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.230
When he goes to confront Rafael as part of
his plan, he sees Jess coming down the stairs

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.620
in a stunning red dress and freezes.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.190
She kisses Rafael to Nicky's disdain.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.120
He then approaches Jess and she assures him
that she's doing fine on her own and has moved

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.170
on from the deceitful game.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.070
Nicky looks dejected and goes to get a glass
of vodka.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.240
He gets poured water instead, another bartender
told everyone about his problem so he does

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.090
not even get a drink.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.320
After getting drunk on appletinis Nicky plays
his part as a disgruntled employee, but instead

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.570
of shoving Rafael, he punches him right in
the face, venting his pent-up anger at him

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.230
for being with Jess.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.670
After Owens escorts Nicky out, he is approached
by McEwen’s guard and is given McEwen’s

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.860
credentials inviting him for lunch.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.200
The next day, while Nicky is having lunch
with McEwen, Ricky finds it hard to concentrate

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.930
on talking to him.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.840
He is irritated and stares at Jess, who is
flirting with Rafael.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.700
They resolve to get back to each other later
when they have definitive proof that the fuel-burning

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.090
algorithm Nicky has is real.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.630
He approaches Jess while she's away from Rafael
and tells her not to trust him.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.980
She turns the tables and asks why she should
trust Nicky after he left her behind.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.540
As she walks away, she tosses him his wallet,
hinting that her game is still on point.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:16.200
Ricky strikes a deal with McEwen for 3 million
euros after data shows Nicky's fake algorithm

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.830
is credible.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.350
Nicky spends a lot of time trying to get closer
to Jess, using nasty strategies like the old

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.480
granny who loses her handbag just to talk
to her.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.600
Jess tells Nicky everything he wants to hear
in a flirty voice, and just before a kiss,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.969
she whispers softly, "I have learned a lot
since we last met, and I'd love to show you,

00:08:33.969 --> 00:08:36.719
like how I learned to play men like I just
played you."

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:40.960
She tells Nicky to stay away from her, she's
not falling for his bullshit again.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.220
As a last resort, Nicky brings in Farhad to
convince Jess that she should give Nicky a

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.810
break and that he's sorry about New Orleans.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.120
He hands her the necklace she had her eye
on 3 years ago.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.860
Nicky manages to have another conversation
with her.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.700
He tells her that he has not worked in a few
years because it does not feel right and that

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.100
he even turned to his father for help.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.030
Jess gets right to the point, "What do you
want from me?"

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.170
Nicky says he's a different person, but as
much as she wants that, Jess has a hard time

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.820
believing it because he's a fraudulent man.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.660
Jess leaves and was followed.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.800
When Nicky returns to his hotel suite, he
sees Jess sitting next to his door.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.240
They make love.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.500
The next morning, he tells her he's leaving
tonight and wants Jess to come with him.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.050
Right after that, Owens is at Nicky's door.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:28.860
He tries to get rid of him, but Owen just
walks in while Jess tries to stay out of sight.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.400
Owens complains about his feelings towards
the younger generation and Nicky's lack of

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.760
progress on the job while pacing around the
flat like he's looking for someone.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.580
Jess escapes to the balcony where she manages
to elude Owens and he leaves after setting

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.450
down a package.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:46.760
Nicky ends up selling Rafael's real algorithm
not only to McEwen but to every other race

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.620
team for the same price.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.360
He wishes them all luck and gets the same
response, "Who needs luck with friends like

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.360
you?"

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.640
amounting to about 27 million euros in cash.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.170
Nicky receives word that he has been found
out, but he hesitates to leave without Jess.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:06.680
With time running out, he grabs his bags and
opens the door to see Jess, "Sorry I am late."

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.110
One of McEwen's guards buys unusual things
in a shop, the cashier gives him a look.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:15.940
After a quick meal, he checks his watch, buckles
up, puts on his protective gear, and floors

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.000
the gas pedal, ramming into Nicky's car.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.010
Jess and Nicky are kidnapped and taken to
one of Rafael's warehouses with duct tape

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.510
around their mouths.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.180
He was a spy in McEwen's company to keep an
eye on Nicky.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:32.761
Rafael tells Nicky that he knows he sold the
real algorithm to McEwen for 3 million, but

00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:37.420
there is 27 million in his bags, from which
he concludes that he sold the algorithm to

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.420
everyone.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.440
Rafael wants to know how he got the real algorithm.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.640
He holds Jesse's nose until Nicky starts talking.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.890
Nicky finally admits that he used Jess and
put a bug on her necklace, so when she returned

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:53.330
to Rafael's hotel room, the bug intercepted
his computer password.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.920
Jess starts to cry.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.970
Rafael laughs because he knows it's a lie
and takes the tape off her mouth.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.120
She admits to Nicky that Rafael is not her
boyfriend - she just wanted his watch, which

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.110
is worth two hundred thousand.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:09.010
She never slept with him and was not even
in his room, even though Rafael kept trying

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.710
to get into bed with her.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.970
Jess did all this to make Nicky jealous and
to get revenge.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:18.030
Nicky finally settles for telling the truth,
and just as he's about to start, he's shot

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:22.510
in the chest by Owens, which horrifies Garriga
and causes him to leave.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:26.030
Nicky appears to be bleeding out while Jess
cries and tells him she loves him.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.850
It looks like Nicky is going to die until
Owens says he hit Nicky in the right place

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.610
to avoid the major arteries, even though he
punctured his lung.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.220
Owens gets the blood out of Nicky's lungs
and brings him back to life.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.760
Owens then calls Nicky "Mellow", making Jess
realize that Owens is Nicky's father, Bucky

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.190
Spurgeon, that he was in on the scam all along
and that they just performed the "Toledo Panic

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.190
Button".

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.900
The package Owen left Nicky one morning was
the real algorithm.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.770
Owens drives Nicky and Jess to the nearest
hospital.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.480
He reminds Nicky of what he said regarding
putting your heart into the con game and adds

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.460
that he'll take all the money.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.339
Jess helps Nicky walk to the entrance of the
hospital.

00:12:02.339 --> 00:12:09.579
Nicky grins when he notices that Jess is wearing
Garriga's watch on her wrist.

00:12:09.579 --> 00:12:11.579
