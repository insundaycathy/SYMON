00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.360
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.000
Love makes you do crazy things and in today's film:
one our main characters takes this to the next level

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.540
To get what I mean, this is SECRET OBSESSION

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.700
So the film starts with Jennifer being chased by 
a mysterious man with a knife and after trying to

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.520
drive away in her car which is connected to
a white pick up truck through a winch, she

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.380
runs away and gets hit by a car and is taken
to a hospital where she has flashbacks of

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.620
her husband and the man who was 
chasing her breaking into their home.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.960
As she’s being prepped for surgery, we see
man with glasses rush in: this is Russell

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.010
Williams, Jennifer’s husband who wants to
know if she remembers what happened to her

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.580
since she the accident.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.430
Though he will have to wait for answer as she’s
still in surgery and we see him holding a lighter

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.610
that was gifted to him from Jennifer, we then
go to Silverado Canyon, California, where

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.790
we follow Detective Page who gets a call and goes

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.650
to the rest stop from the beginning of the
film.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.640
Page interviews Russel asking if he knew what
happened on night of the accident and Russel explains

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.640
that his wife went out to get groceries for
dinner and he hadn’t gotten a call from

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.600
her and with no marital problems since they’re
newlyweds, he has not motive to hurt her and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.080
he doesn’t know why she was at that rest stop that night

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.020
So Page doesn’t really get any answers from
him although something that Page says is that

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.189
Jennifer’s car went missing that night

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.510
Back with Russell, he’s taken to meet with
Jennifer but finds out from a doctor that

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.900
due to the accident she’s gotten amnesia
and probably won’t remember her own husband.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.140
And when they meet: She really doesn’t remember
him or anything about the accident that sent

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.620
her here or who that man chasing her was.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.360
At the police station, Page interviews the

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.620
driver who hit Jennifer and asks him if he
saw anyone or anything else at the crash site.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.790
and the man mentions there was a white pickup truck
with a winch that was pulling a car that disappeared

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.180
when the ambulance arrived.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.560
Someone was there, Page is sure of it and he
continues working on the witnesses of the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.950
car crash: including a man in black.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.799
Back with Jennifer and Russel he shows her
a photo album of the times they had together,

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.920
and tells her they had worked at the same company and
somewhere along the line he proposed to her

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.060
and while Jennifer and Russel are reuniting,
we someone peeking through the window

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.790
Though looking at these photos, Jennifer wonders
if her parents called her yet?

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.319
And Russel pauses.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.420
It’s kind of weird but then we learn that
her parents died in a fire.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.470
So, it makes sense that he’d be so awkward
about it.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.080
That night, the man in black – Mr. Kahn
arrives with a bouquet and acts

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.640
sketchy: he’s not family, just a "concerned
citizen", who wants her to have some flowers.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.950
Which is quite suspicious to say the least

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.260
From then on we follow Jennifer as she recovers
from her injuries, going through rehab with

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.370
Russell’s help until finally she’s able to check out.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.250
And as she’s checking out, she’s given a cane
and made to sign a document when she pauses.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.860
She can’t seem to remember how to write
her name and when she does, it feels off,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.280
not that it matter since she’s going home
but while in the car, she remembers

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.690
looking into a rear view mirror and has a
flashback on that rainy night.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.600
She’s starting to remember what happened
the night of her accident.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.201
Russel and Jennifer drive to a house, where
Jennifer spots wedding photos of her and Russel

00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:28.740
and adjusting to whole "being married thing"

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.140
Anyway, Russell takes her on a tour of the
home, but when she sees the living room with

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.520
the fireplace she remembers the hooded man
plunging a knife near a fireplace.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.560
They continue going on the tour and we find
out that the nearest neighbors are a mile

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.650
away and that Jennifer can’t remember the
life they had together.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.650
Once Russel has taken Jennifer upstairs

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.940
he gets a call from Detective Page which Jennifer overhears. Page tells him that he hasn't found

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.680
the missing car, but one witness,
driving a vintage Cadillac Convertible might

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.400
have seen the plates of the white pickup truck.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.520
and Page ends the call saying he 
wants to meet with Jennifer tomorrow

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.520
to get her statement about what happened that night.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.200
At dinner, Jennifer asks Russel about what’s
happening tomorrow and he lies to her saying

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.830
it was work calling him.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.310
When she asks if their company is worried
about her, Russel tells her that she quit

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.810
her job shortly after moving out here and
getting married.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.129
So she has no job or parents who ‘care for
her’ what about friends?

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:27.090
Oh yeah, a few though they won’t be calling
or coming by anytime soon.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.360
Which reminds Jennifer that her phone is missing,

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.800
and Russel promises that he’ll buy her a new phone

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.870
Later that night, the man in black, Mr.
Kahn is visited by Russel who hits him over

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.180
the head with a crowbar before he kills him, and as suspicious as Mr. Kahn was he really

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.500
was just a concerned citizen but as we find out
someone has a few secrets of there own.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.970
Russel drives back to the house and buries
Mr. Kahn's body in the backyard as Jennifer

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.300
wakes up seeing Russel doing something over
there and the next morning, Jennifer spots

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.340
a human shaped mound of dirt in the backyard
which makes Jennifer a little suspicious something

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.180
because something doesn't smell right about this

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.600
Meanwhile, Page finds out that there are hundreds
of people with white pickup trucks and that

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.199
Russell has decided not to come in to talk
about the case.

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.190
So, Page calls him and tries searching for
his home address and finds out that Russell

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.699
Williams had no address in the Silverado Canyon.

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.660
So, Page tells a coworker to trace a phone
number as he goes out to the hospital where

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.930
Jennifer was at.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.240
He gets Russell’s home address from the
Nurse there and asks her if Russell mentioned

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.920
a white pickup truck which he didn’t

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.120
and Page goes to the address and finds 
out not only is it NOT Russell's address

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.900
the people there have never
even heard of Russell Williams

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.260
meaning that Russell has lied about his home
address and what makes it even more suspicious

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.220
is that the phone number he 
gave belongs to a burner phone

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.740
Meanwhile, Jennifer checks out her photo album when
she realizes something’s wrong: Russell looks

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.830
a little photoshopped in the pictures.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.900
and after struggling to get downstairs since she hasn’t
recovered from the accident she finds that

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.760
same photoshop effect on her wedding photo.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.680
and she tries logging into Russell’s computer
using her name as a password but it doesn’t

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.860
work and that’s when Russell comes back in and 
gives her a phone that doesn’t have any service

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.700
That night, Russell tries to get Jennifer
in the mood but she freaks out after having

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.720
a flashback again and can’t get into it.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.760
And Russell gets angry with her: Trying to guilt 
her into doing "it" and its a strategy that fails

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.550
As she settles in for the night, Russell leaves
to go to his study where he spies on Jennifer

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.400
through a hidden camera. Huh....

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.330
Detective Page meanwhile calls the nurse,
asking for surveillance footage from the night

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.729
Jennifer was admitted to the hospital, hoping
to find a white pickup truck with a winch.

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.060
She sends him the footage and after getting
asked how Russell confirmed his identity as

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.780
Jennifer’s husband, we find out he did this
by showing some family photos along with identifying

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.039
a back tattoo on Jennifer, one
that looks like a stylish A.

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:56.949
When Page checks out the footage not only
does he spot the pickup truck but he also

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:00.389
sees Russell get out of the pickup truck before
heading inside the hospital.

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:04.640
Seems likes Russell’s is a big fat liar. But why?

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.440
Later the next day, Page hits up a tattoo
artist and asks about the tattoo on Jennifer’s

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.440
back which the artist recognizes as a heritage
tattoo referring to the family surname “Allen”.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.520
and it’s an exact match for Jennifer’s tattoo

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.750
and  when he puts her unmarried name 
in the database – Jennifer Allen

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.410
he finds her parents’ home address which 
has been abandoned for a while and

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:31.270
inside Page finds a room with the rotting
bodies of Jennifer’s parents.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.150
We then see Jennifer running away from the
man with the knife before she wakes up.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.470
And as Russell takes a shower and prepares for
the day, Jennifer goes through Russell’s

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.060
pockets finding his wallet which doesn’t
have any ID and hides it.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.759
After sending him on an errand for groceries,
he leaves and locks the door behind him and

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:52.100
Jennifer finds her old ID card with her maiden name: Jennifer Allen

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.630
Before she manages to pick the
lock and escape the room

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.160
Page investigates Russell and Jennifer’s
old company, and finds out that the man he

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:04.009
met, is not Jennifer’s husband but is in
fact Ryan Gaerity a coworker of Jennifer and

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:08.759
the real Russel, Jennifer’s actual husband who
left a note for Jennifer in her old desk before

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.960
he disappeared.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.780
While at the same time, Jennifer finds evidence that
“Russell” or Ryan as I will call him from now on

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:20.360
faked his photos and finds the real ones on his
computer after using her real name as a password.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.460
Then Jennifer’s memory of what happened that
night of the accident returns and she realizes

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.060
that the hooded man was Ryan. So she's trapped here with no way to contact anyone as there's no wifi

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:35.360
and her phone has no ception since Ryan messed up the 
phone and after falling nearby the corpse in the yard.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:41.120
Ryan hits her on the head, taking her inside where he forces her to take some medication and ties her up

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.400
after she reveals she that she knows Ryan isn’t her
husband although doesn’t know his real name.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:51.300
Ryan leaves to get lye and runs into the nurse who reveals that Detective Page is onto him

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:56.250
Ryan drives off in a rush and returns home
as Jennifer wakes up from the meds and escapes

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.739
her bindings, making it to the kitchen to
wrap her hurting ankle in tape, before going

00:09:00.739 --> 00:09:04.249
into the car in the garage where she finds
her old phone.

00:09:04.249 --> 00:09:09.600
Just as Ryan comes home and we find out that
he left the real Russel’s body in Jennifer’s car

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.380
and Jennifer sneaks her way back to the room,
hiding the phone just in time for Ryan to

00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:18.550
come in who gets distracted as Detective Page
has come by to ask some questions.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:23.839
When Page comes to the house, he finds that
it belongs to Ryan and also finds the white

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:29.480
pickup truck, confirming his suspicions that Ryan had
something to do with the accident as Jennifer comes

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.279
downstairs to try and get his help, Ryan knocks
out Page and locks Jennifer up in her room

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:39.550
binding her to the bedframe revealing that
he’s a stalker with a crush whose been studying

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:45.130
her for a long time, ever since they worked 
together,and he killed her parents and Russell.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:50.189
and he WAS originally going to kill her but since
she lost her memory, he could now have her

00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:55.839
all to himself and that  what
his secret obsession was all about.

00:09:55.839 --> 00:10:00.220
Ryan then goes to dispose of some evidence
including that of Page who is stuck in a ice

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:05.449
chest as Jennifer burns through her bindings
with the real Russell’s lighter – the lighter

00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:09.820
that was stolen by Ryan and that we see
in the earlier in the film and she escapes.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:14.390
Running into the woods trying to call
someone with her old phone as Ryan chases

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:19.950
after her armed with a gun and as Page finally
manages to escape from the chest.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:24.139
After a long chase and a fight between Ryan
and Page who disarms Ryan, Jennifer shoots

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.740
Ryan with his own gun. Killing him

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.360
We then fast forward 3 months later and Jennifer
comes to visit Page to thank for his help

00:10:31.369 --> 00:10:33.259
and to say goodbye as he’s moving.

00:10:33.259 --> 00:10:37.880
But before he leaves, Page gives Jennifer
the thing that Russell, the real one, left

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:45.400
in her desk and the movie ends with her reading
a love letter dedicated to her by Russel. The End

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.540
With that being said, thank you so much for watching ladies and gentlemen.
