00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.480
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain an American&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.520
psychological thriller film called "RUN."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.120
The film begins with a team of doctors....trying&nbsp;
to save the life of a premature newborn baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.680
A few moments later, the baby's mother, Dianne&nbsp;
Shermann, is called to see the condition of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.920
her baby who has passed the critical phase,&nbsp;
and she asks...if the baby would be okay.
&nbsp;

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.600
The scene shifts to a child named Chloe,&nbsp;
who has 5 major diseases including asthma,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.760
diabetes, and paralysis. 
At home, Chloe has a routine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.360
of taking many medicines and checking&nbsp;
blood to control her blood sugar levels. 
&nbsp;

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.880
Chloe is shown to be a very intelligent young&nbsp;
teenager, she has a desire to study at one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.280
the top universities in the city, and applies&nbsp;
to her college application with such passion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.720
She is always excited when a letter comes, and&nbsp;
hopes that it is a university acceptance letter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.240
But unfortunately, she never gets&nbsp;
any letter from the university.
&nbsp;

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.680
Chloe also loves to do experiments&nbsp;
and assemble sophisticated tools&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.920
that she taught herself at home. 
One day, when Chloe is studying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.200
Chloe hears the sound of a car. She thinks it is&nbsp;
a mail delivery car, but immediately looks out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.880
the window, and it turns out to be her mother&nbsp;
who has just come home after buying things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.400
When her mother is on the phone, Chloe immediately&nbsp;
peeks into her mother's grocery box and takes some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.680
chocolates in the box. However, Chloe accidentally&nbsp;
sees that there is one pack of green medicine with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.400
Diane Sherman's name on it. And naturally, Chloe&nbsp;
is curious about what disease her mother has. 
&nbsp;

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.080
At night, Chloe's mother gives some medicine&nbsp;
for Chloe to take before going to bed. Chloe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.280
is surprised because there is a green medicine she&nbsp;
saw before. She queries this to her mother and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.760
claims that it is Chloe's medicine and the name on&nbsp;
the medicine package is only the recipient's name.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.080
Chloe who is still astonished continues to&nbsp;
take the medicine and go straight to sleep.
&nbsp;

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.960
The next day, curiosity gets the better of&nbsp;
Chloe, she decides to take one pack of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.440
medicine in the medicine cabinet and looks at the&nbsp;
name of the medicine - "Trigoxin" is printed on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.600
the package and she is confused, because this&nbsp;
time she sees her name wrapped in the medicine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.800
She peels off a little sticker with her name,. and&nbsp;
sees Diane Sherman's name written on the back. 
&nbsp;

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.080
At nightfall, before Chloe goes to sleep, she&nbsp;
is given some of the same medicine as the night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.520
before. But this time, Chloe does not swallow&nbsp;
the green pill and takes it back to be examined.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.200
After her mother is asleep, Chloe&nbsp;
immediately goes downstairs to finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.400
information about trigoxin through her computer.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, the browser can't be accessed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.440
because there is an internet problem. While using&nbsp;
the computer, Chloe doesn't realize that someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.760
is watching her in the corner of the room. 
The next day, Chloe immediately calls random&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.520
people, and asks that person to use the&nbsp;
internet and check the trigoxin listed on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.800
the medicine package. It turns out that trigoxin&nbsp;
is indeed a medicine for the heart, but strangely,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.160
trigoxin is a red pill... not green! Chloe&nbsp;
begins to suspect her mother is up to something…
&nbsp;

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.520
Chloe is still very curious, so she asks her&nbsp;
mother to go to the cinema....as an excuse to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.080
find information there. 
While at the cinema,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.320
Chloe tells Diane that she wants to go&nbsp;
to the toilet. Chloe leaves the cinema,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.960
and goes straight to the nearest pharmacy. When&nbsp;
she arrives at the place, it turns out to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.360
a very long queue. Chloe immediately asks the&nbsp;
person in the queue to let her cut the queue.
&nbsp;

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.320
She questions the pharmacist about the green&nbsp;
medicine given by her mother; she asks what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.920
the use of "trigoxin". The pharmacist sees the&nbsp;
drug and is confused; the drug is not trigoxin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.600
it is Ridocaine! The drug is usually used for&nbsp;
dogs. Chloe is shocked to hear this revelation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.640
her world is thrown upside down – she then asks&nbsp;
what will happen if humans take the drug. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.360
pharmacist says, if people take this drug...&nbsp;
then the person will experience paralysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.080
Suddenly, Diane comes in panic, and&nbsp;
immediately injects an anesthetic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.040
into Chloe's leg – causing this revelation to come&nbsp;
to an abrupt end. Her mother takes her home. 
&nbsp;

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.280
Later at the house, Diane starts to panic; so&nbsp;
she locks Chloe in her room. And she goes out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.040
to buy a new paralytic prescription that&nbsp;
she has been looking for on the internet.
&nbsp;

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.240
Chloe wakes up and realizes that her mother&nbsp;
locks her in the room. Chloe is a smart teenager,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.960
so she has a few tricks to unlock the door.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, her mother had anticipated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.320
this and put the broom handle to bar the door.&nbsp;
But Chloe doesn't give up so easily. Chloe uses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.120
her scientific and technical skills, and takes&nbsp;
a solder, blanket and holds water in her mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.680
She then comes out of the window, and crawls on&nbsp;
the roof of her house to go to the next room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.880
As the suspense builds, she uses the heat from the&nbsp;
solder, and then the water to break the glass in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.680
the next room's window, the blanket is used as a&nbsp;
placemat so that Chloe's body is not exposed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.960
broken glass. After getting out of the window, she&nbsp;
feels her asthma flare-up, and unfortunately, she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.680
forgets to bring her inhaler. Chloe is then trying&nbsp;
to crawl with a shaky breath to reach her room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.120
Arriving in her room, she immediately uses&nbsp;
her inhaler to relieve her asthma on time.
&nbsp;

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.800
Chloe immediately gets into her wheelchair&nbsp;
and rushes to run away from her house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.320
However, the elevator that Chloe used to go&nbsp;
down the stairs has been damaged by her mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.720
She then desperately throws the wheelchair&nbsp;
and crawls down the stairs until suddenly...&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.080
she slips and rolls down. When she falls, Chloe&nbsp;
feels a miracle, she can feel and moves her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.600
toe because she has not taken the medicine&nbsp;
her mother had given her for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.760
She becomes increasingly convinced&nbsp;
that her mother is a psychopath.
&nbsp;

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.840
Chloe immediately gets into her wheelchair and&nbsp;
out of her house through the road used to go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.600
the city. Suddenly, Chloe hears the sound of a car&nbsp;
coming, Chloe is afraid it is her mother's car and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.320
immediately hides. It turns out that the vehicle&nbsp;
is the postman who used to deliver letters to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.360
Chloe's house. Chloe then immediately rushes out&nbsp;
of hiding..to block the postman's van until she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.880
almost hit. The postman gets out of his van and&nbsp;
asks what is wrong with Chloe. Chloe just says,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.760
"help me". When the postman is helping Chloe,&nbsp;
her mother's car suddenly passes and she sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.880
the two of them. Diane immediately approaches&nbsp;
the postman to asks what happens to Chloe. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.680
postman stops Diane who wants to take her child&nbsp;
home. The postman says that Chloe doesn't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.720
to go home and wants to go to the police station.&nbsp;
Diane persists in bringing her daughter back home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.040
even threatening to report the kidnapping&nbsp;
to the police. Because there is no signal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.920
Diane's efforts are in vain. She unwillingly&nbsp;
lets the postman take Chloe away....but on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.040
the condition that she comes too. When Chloe is&nbsp;
being taken into the postman’s van, Diane stabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.800
an anesthetic into the postman's neck until he&nbsp;
faints. Chloe is also sedated until she faints.
&nbsp;

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.440
When she wakes up, Chloe is already in the&nbsp;
basement of her house, and locked up in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.880
She sees a black liquid made by her mother, which&nbsp;
is probably a paralyzing drug for her. Chloe is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.840
unable to get away; the wheelchair can't move,&nbsp;
because her mother had chained it. She then looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.280
for a way to get out of there. Until she sees&nbsp;
that there is a pile of paper. It turns out to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.840
be a notification regarding Chloe's admission to&nbsp;
the university she had previously registered for.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.960
Chloe, who knows that her mother had hidden the paper from her, looks frustrated and annoyed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.320
The revelation continues. Chloe finds several&nbsp;
photos showing that she used to be healthy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.840
and not paralyzed. And even more surprising, she&nbsp;
sees a paper....containing a note of the death of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.280
a baby named Chloe, who died 2 hours after being&nbsp;
born....along with a newspaper containing news of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.040
a baby kidnapping at the same place; same time as&nbsp;
Chloe's death date. At that time, Chloe realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.840
that she is not Diane's biological child, and she&nbsp;
is the child who was stolen from her biological&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.880
parents. It is revealed that Dianne's baby shown&nbsp;
at the beginning of the film was not saved.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.440
And because of that, Dianne became so frustrated&nbsp;
that she kidnaped someone else's baby in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.160
the hospital to replace her dead baby.
When Chloe is stressed and confused, Diane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.720
arrives. She tells her that she is not really&nbsp;
her mother, and that she has also made Chloe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.840
sick and paralyzed all this time with medications.&nbsp;
Diane says she did this because she loves Chloe.
&nbsp;

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.560
She tells Chloe to forget all this and go back&nbsp;
to how it used to be, throwing away Chloe's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:54.400
medications.. Chloe, who is still afraid, refuses&nbsp;
her mother's words until her patience runs out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.960
Diane then takes the black liquid mixture&nbsp;
using a syringe to inject it into Chloe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.840
Chloe is getting more and more frightened; she&nbsp;
immediately runs behind a cupboard and locks it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.560
Chloe finds a poison, and when her mother manages&nbsp;
to open the door, Chloe immediately drinks the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.680
poison until she overdoses. Diane weeps very&nbsp;
loudly seeing her daughter dying from the poison.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.440
Here, it can be concluded that Diane loves Chloe&nbsp;
so much...that she wants to control every moves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:25.120
that Chloe makes since birth. But the question I&nbsp;
ask you, is this really love? Or a selfish love? 
&nbsp;

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.200
Now, Chloe who is poisoned, is immediately&nbsp;
taken to the hospital for medical treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.320
But fortunately, Chloe is successfully cured by&nbsp;
the doctors there. But she still finds it very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:41.040
difficult to move and talk. Chloe sees her mother&nbsp;
staring at her through the glass in Chloe's room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.831 --> 00:08:47.840
Chloe, who sees this,  immediately asks for help from the nurse in&nbsp;
her room.. by pressing the help button. Chloe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.960
can't speak yet, so she can only signal through&nbsp;
her eyes. The nurse gives Chloe a note and crayon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.840
so she can write something down. When Chloe&nbsp;
is forming a word, a sudden emergency alarm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.280
is sounded. It turns out... the emergency alarm&nbsp;
is a sabotage carried out by Diane to attract&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:09.200
the attention of the nurse. Not long after,&nbsp;
Diane enters Chloe's room and immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.516
pulls out all Chloe's medical equipments,&nbsp;
and takes her out. After the nurse returns to Chloe's room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.840
she is confused by Chloe's disappearance. The&nbsp;
nurse sees the note written by Chloe that reads,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.840
"MOM". The nurse immediately reports&nbsp;
this to security to find Chloe.
&nbsp;

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.240
Chloe is brought forcefully by her&nbsp;
mother; she can't ask for help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.200
When she is almost out of the hospital, on the&nbsp;
escalator, Chloe's mother can't move Chloe's wheelchair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:39.600
It turns out that Chloe uses her legs to hold&nbsp;
the wheelchair in place. Yes! Here, Chloe's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.480
legs can be moved a little. Before long, the&nbsp;
security guards come to stop them from leaving.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.880
Seeing this, Diane immediately points a&nbsp;
gun at the security officer saying that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.840
she just wants to go home with her child. One&nbsp;
of the security guards manages to shoot Diane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.960
and she falls down the stairs. Chloe is rescued&nbsp;
and Diane is safely secured by the authorities.
&nbsp;

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.160
The scene then moves seven years later In a&nbsp;
mental hospital. Chloe who is now an adult,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.360
is shown to be able to move her legs –&nbsp;
though it is still a struggle for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:13.840
There, Chloe is visiting someone who turns out to be Diane Sherman.&nbsp;
Chloe says that her life now with her real family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:19.120
is very pleasant, she has many friends, and she&nbsp;
has even graduated from her favorite university.
&nbsp;

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.280
Before Chloe says goodbye, she seems to take&nbsp;
something out of her mouth, which turns out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.880
to be the dog medicine that Diane had given her.&nbsp;
Chloe then says, "I love you Mom...Now open wide!
&nbsp;

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.080
That concludes the ending of the movie Run.
