00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.200
Hi, Movie Recaps here. Today I will show you&nbsp;
a horror, thriller, sci-fi film from 2015,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.880
titled The Rezort. Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.560
In a world recovering from a zombie pandemic&nbsp;
that led to two billion deaths, there is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.520
facility called the Rezort, which offers a luxury&nbsp;
vacation and a special park where guests can shoot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.800
the world's remaining zombies for sport. Its&nbsp;
CEO, Valerie Wilton, is the target of constant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.680
controversy and protests because of the potential&nbsp;
outbreak her resort could cause, especially since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.120
the place is right next to the camps run by Hope&nbsp;
4U, a charity organization. Our protagonist is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.120
Melanie Gibbs, a young woman who is currently&nbsp;
going to meetings with an outbreak survivor's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.960
support group to cope with her father's death.&nbsp;
Someone in this group shared their experience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.360
with the Rezort and vouched for it, so now Melanie&nbsp;
wants to visit it too. She shares this idea with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.760
her boyfriend and former soldier, Lewis Evans, who&nbsp;
is surprised at first but still agrees to go with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.080
her. A few days later, they arrive at the Rezort's&nbsp;
lounge, where we meet the rest of the guests.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.880
There is a group of middle-aged businessmen; Jack&nbsp;
and Alfie, two gamer teenagers; and Sadie, a young&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.640
woman whose fiancé didn't show up for the wedding.&nbsp;
While they wait for the boats to be ready,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.320
Melanie and Lewis see a little girl through&nbsp;
the window who belongs to the refugee camp.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.000
Melanie still can't believe they're such a&nbsp;
problem. They reach the island by boat, then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.160
they ride in jeeps to get to the resort itself.&nbsp;
Getting in the cars with them is the last guest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.040
Archer, a quiet veteran. After being shown around&nbsp;
the facilities, the group is taken to orientation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.960
which entails a shooting range. Alfie and&nbsp;
Jack shoot as if this was a videogame but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.720
Melanie has never shot a weapon before,&nbsp;
so Lewis teaches her. When night falls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.400
all guests are invited to a party by the swimming&nbsp;
pool, where Valerie shows up to give a welcome&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.560
speech while a chained zombie stands behind her.&nbsp;
Archer doesn't stay to hear her speech, though,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.640
because he notices Sadie sneaking out and decides&nbsp;
to follow her. He sees her breaking into a control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.280
room, where Sadie accesses the security system&nbsp;
and downloads some information on a USB stick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.120
The next morning, Melanie sees the zombie from&nbsp;
the party being dragged out of the main building,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.040
which starts affecting her opinion of them.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, the resort engineers find three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.640
corrupted files in the system but are afraid&nbsp;
to tell Valerie, so they decide to clean them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.560
themselves without raising alarm. The guests are&nbsp;
getting ready to finally go into the park. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.720
are taken back to the jeeps and assigned guides,&nbsp;
our group will be in the hands of Tom Nevins.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.320
On their way out, Melanie sees the&nbsp;
zombies kept in cages like animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.400
An alarm starts ringing in the building when one&nbsp;
of the corrupted files acts up, but the engineer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.240
quickly takes care of it. The guides show the&nbsp;
guests how the park is divided into different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.720
areas that are separated by fences that stop&nbsp;
the zombies from herding too much. They also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.520
remind the guests of the rules. Rule number one,&nbsp;
it is the zombie bite that transmits the virus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.640
not their blood. Rule number two, the fresher they&nbsp;
are the faster they are. And rule number three,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.800
only a shot to the head will kill them. The&nbsp;
businessmen are taken to a special building where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.280
zombies appear restrained in place on doors and&nbsp;
windows, so they shoot them face to face. Melanie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.520
and the others are taken to the top of a cliff,&nbsp;
where they can shoot them from a safe distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.840
Sadie decides not to participate for now, while&nbsp;
Jack and Alfie's shooting is erratic and mostly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.120
misses their targets. Lewis and Archer, as former&nbsp;
soldiers, hit the heads every time. When Melanie's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.680
turn comes, she doesn't dare to do it because she&nbsp;
is sure the zombie she is aiming at looks at her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.920
As darkness starts to fall, the group makes it to&nbsp;
the spot where they will be camping for the night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.840
tents have already been set up for them. Melanie&nbsp;
is starting to regret coming because she can not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.400
bring herself to kill a zombie, Lewis asks her to&nbsp;
give the place a chance. Sadie is first approached&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.360
by Archer, who wonders why she didn't participate,&nbsp;
she says this was more her ex-fiancé's kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.280
activity. Then she is approached by Jack and&nbsp;
Alfie, who keep hitting on her and try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.360
impress her with their gaming achievements,&nbsp;
but she ignores them by entering her tent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.320
At headquarters, the system issues haven't been&nbsp;
solved yet, so Valerie orders a full diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.560
The engineers find out there was an unauthorized&nbsp;
access of the system the previous night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.240
this stranger downloaded a lot of&nbsp;
data but also left something behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.480
Valerie is about to call security when the system&nbsp;
starts failing, the engineer manages to get it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.040
under control but only for a few seconds before&nbsp;
it fails again. Thanks to this computer failure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.880
zombies all over the resort are released from&nbsp;
their restraints and cages. They attack the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.280
at the hotel and swimming pool, they also get to&nbsp;
the businessmen and their guide. The system is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.760
unsalvageable so the engineer tries to escape the&nbsp;
control room, but the zombies quickly arrive there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.000
as well and attack all the employees, killing them&nbsp;
or infecting them. The zombie that had been at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.480
welcome party recognizes Valerie and goes after&nbsp;
her, so she runs into her office and seals the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.360
door behind her. The security system goes offline&nbsp;
after repeated failed attempts to reboot itself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.800
so the Brimstone Protocol is activated. This means&nbsp;
the place will be bombed in a few hours. At camp,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.960
Sadie and Melanie can't sleep, so they share a&nbsp;
drink and discuss the possible lack of ethics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.200
behind the Rezort. Their chat is interrupted by&nbsp;
the sudden presence of a zombie approaching them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.520
so Melanie goes to wake everyone up while Sadie&nbsp;
aims her gun at it. She doesn't dare to shoot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.240
but luckily Archer steps in and kills it for her.&nbsp;
Nevins is worried by this turn of events because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.400
the fences are supposed to keep the zombies from&nbsp;
coming too close, so he turns on the jeep lights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.240
to take a better look at their surroundings.&nbsp;
They discover a horde of zombies is coming, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.400
the girls run to hide behind a tent while the men&nbsp;
defend the camp. Nevins gets in the jeep and tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.560
to contact headquarters, but the only answer he&nbsp;
gets is a recording telling him of the activation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.200
of the Brimstone Protocol. As he tries to start&nbsp;
the car with no luck, Archer runs out of ammo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.000
Melanie runs into a tent to get him a magazine and&nbsp;
is jumped on by a zombie, but Sadie pushes it off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.240
and helps Melanie reach the jeep, tossing the&nbsp;
magazine to Archer on their way. Nevins is jumped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.320
on too when he gets out of the car, but he also&nbsp;
pushes the zombie off and climbs on top of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.040
jeep with the other guests. Only Alfie is missing,&nbsp;
but when he tries to join them, the zombies get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.840
to him and kill him. Archer tells everyone to hold&nbsp;
their fire when the final zombie is taken care of.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.600
The group spends the night on top of the&nbsp;
jeep. As soon as the sun starts to rise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.000
Archer does a recon of the area and decides it is&nbsp;
safe enough for them to come down. Lewis thinks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.680
they should wait there to get rescued, but Nevins&nbsp;
informs them that won't happen because the whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.080
park is down and the Brimstone Protocol has been&nbsp;
activated. Archer wants to leave to try to catch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.400
a boat and Nevins thinks it isn't possible for him&nbsp;
to make it on time, but when Melanie mentions the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.640
possibility of a quicker road, Nevins retrieves&nbsp;
a map of the park and finds a route that may help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.360
them save time. The group decides to follow Archer&nbsp;
to the docks and before leaving, a mourning Jack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.360
covers Alfie's face with his jacket and takes his&nbsp;
bracelet. While the group makes their way through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.040
the park, Melanie tries to comfort Lewis,&nbsp;
who feels unsettled because of the current&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.000
situation bringing back war memories. Sadie shows&nbsp;
sympathy for Jack, trying to befriend him to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.920
up for not getting off to the best start. As&nbsp;
Archer keeps on guiding their steps, Lewis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.400
wonders who made him the leader, to which Archer&nbsp;
replies they did when they decided to follow him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.800
They are finally getting close to the fenced area&nbsp;
when a zombie jumps on them. Nevins quickly kills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.720
it but gets upset when he discovers it was one&nbsp;
of his fellow guides. He wonders how this could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.800
be happening when the security is supposed to be&nbsp;
so watertight, Jack says it must be a hacker's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.520
fault. It could come from the internet but it most&nbsp;
likely is an inside job, which makes Sadie realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.840
this must be her fault. When they make it to the&nbsp;
fence, they find a jeep has crashed into it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.320
is blocking the door. To cross it, they must go in&nbsp;
one at a time and squeeze their bodies between the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.720
jeep and the fence. Another horde of zombies&nbsp;
suddenly appears, so Archer and Nevins stay a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.800
couple of steps behind to shoot them while the&nbsp;
rest of the group crosses the fence. There is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.440
zombie inside the wrecked jeep that suddenly wakes&nbsp;
up and tries to bite Melanie, but Sadie kills it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.280
giving Lewis the chance to take the gun that&nbsp;
was inside the car and help with the defense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.600
Archer and Nevins cross the fence after everyone&nbsp;
has made it safely, but a zombie also manages to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.880
sneak in and bites Nevins. As he despairs, Melanie&nbsp;
tells him it is going to be ok, but Lewis steps in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.360
and shoots him in the head, angering Melanie with&nbsp;
his actions. The group keeps going and eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.760
finds the building where the businessmen had their&nbsp;
fun at. Before getting inside, Archer makes Sadie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.920
confess what she has actually come to the park&nbsp;
for. She explains she has downloaded some files&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.000
to gather enough proof of unethical practices&nbsp;
to close down the park and that she is working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.960
for Living 2, a group of undead-rights activists.&nbsp;
She thinks she just used some codes and encrypted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.960
data to get into the system, but Jack says she&nbsp;
has been played and that whatever she used to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.840
download the data also uploaded something nasty&nbsp;
to destroy the resort. Both he and Lewis blame her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.400
for everything, but Melanie stays sympathetic and&nbsp;
promises her they won't leave her behind. While&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.320
looking for a safe way to enter the headquarters,&nbsp;
the group walks into the abandoned building and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.920
finds the bodies of the businessmen. They look&nbsp;
through the windows and notice the zombies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.480
coming towards them rather fast because they are&nbsp;
fresh victims. Melanie, Lewis, and Archie take a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.720
tunnel but Sadie and Jack are not able to cross&nbsp;
in time to join them before the zombies arrive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.880
so they take the opposite direction and agree&nbsp;
to meet at the exit. The trio comes out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.280
building without any trouble and Lewis is eager to&nbsp;
leave, but Melanie stops him and asks him to wait&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.440
for the other two. Sadie and Jack are being chased&nbsp;
by the zombies, so they try to cross an empty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.680
room, where one zombie is still restrained. They&nbsp;
believe it to be dead and walk in front of it, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.080
the zombie wakes up and bites Sadie. This makes&nbsp;
her decide to sacrifice herself as a distraction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.120
for Jack to escape, she gives him her USB stick&nbsp;
before he runs away and the zombies take her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.880
Jack re-joins the others while zombies chase&nbsp;
him, so they hurry and cross a fence into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.600
secure area, closing the doors behind them. When&nbsp;
Melanie asks about Sadie, Jack's only answer is to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.160
give her the USB stick. With an hour left for the&nbsp;
bombing to start, the four of them finally enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.480
the resort building and choose to go into a dark&nbsp;
room because it's the only door they can open.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.800
Inside, there are blood on the floor and railings&nbsp;
similar to a cattle run which start shaking when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.800
the presence of zombies comes near. The group runs&nbsp;
through the railings and makes it to an oven room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.280
with piping hot walls and a fence at the end of&nbsp;
it that Archer needs to force open. They leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.600
oven and enter a normal room, wondering what all&nbsp;
this means when a zombie jumps off the ceiling and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:01.040
attacks Jack. Archer kills it but it is too late,&nbsp;
Jack has been bitten. Upset and crying, Melanie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.120
has to look away while Archer kills him too.&nbsp;
They leave the room and walk into an infirmary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.680
surrounded by the Hope 4U tents. They realize&nbsp;
then that the Rezort has been using the refugees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.480
to make more zombies, keeping them slow by aging&nbsp;
them in the oven. There is sudden movement behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.120
a tent and the little girl Melanie saw when she&nbsp;
arrived shows herself, but she is now a zombie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.440
Another horde appears in front of them so they&nbsp;
run back inside as the chase begins. Archer and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.120
Melanie keep the door close with the weight of&nbsp;
their bodies, but Lewis escapes by climbing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.640
chain that fell from the hole that dropped a&nbsp;
zombie on them earlier. Melanie can't believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.560
he's left them, and Archer tells her to follow&nbsp;
him while he holds onto the door, she accepts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.800
after some hesitation. After climbing up she looks&nbsp;
through the hole and finds Archer telling her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.960
make sure to get Sadie's data exposed before&nbsp;
he opens the door and jumps into the fray.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.360
There are only fifteen minutes left before the&nbsp;
bombing. Melanie runs across many hallways and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.840
after retrieving a gun from a body on the floor,&nbsp;
makes it to one of the resort's many luxury rooms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.480
which is filled with bodies and zombies. Lewis&nbsp;
suddenly shows up and closes the door behind them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.720
then he apologizes to Melanie for leaving her&nbsp;
behind before showing her he's been bitten.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.480
Melanie aims her gun at him but can't bring&nbsp;
herself to shoot him, so she hands him the gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.080
and leaves him to do it himself. The horde&nbsp;
of zombies breaks into the room then, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.240
Melanie grabs another gun from a body and starts&nbsp;
running again until she finds the control room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.240
She's suddenly startled by a door opening and a&nbsp;
hand dragging her inside a different room, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.720
it's just Valerie bringing her into her office.&nbsp;
Melanie calls her a monster for what she does,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.080
Valerie reminds her that Melanie paid&nbsp;
for it before trying to take her gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.760
As the women fight for the weapon, the zombies&nbsp;
hear the noise and break into the office,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.520
some of them feed on Valerie while the others&nbsp;
chase Melanie as she runs out of the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.280
The countdown to the bombing reaches zero&nbsp;
right before Melanie makes it outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.000
She continues to run as zombies go after her and&nbsp;
planes arrive to drop bombs all over the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.760
Luckily, she is fast enough to reach the edge&nbsp;
of the cliff and jump into the ocean before the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.480
entire island is blown off. Three weeks later, we&nbsp;
learn investigators still don't know what caused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.440
the whole incident. Melanie has survived and now&nbsp;
appears on tv, revealing all the information Sadie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.240
gathered. It turns out she isn't the only survivor&nbsp;
though, Archer has also escaped and watches her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.720
proudly on the screen. As a news reporter comments&nbsp;
on the latest developments of the Rezort case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.320
a horde of zombies comes out of the sea at&nbsp;
the resort's beach, ending the transmission.
