00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.790
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.240
Today I will show you a mystery, drama film
from 2015, titled Circle.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.310
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.180
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.660
A soft light comes on revealing people standing
in a circle, unconscious.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.880
Suddenly, a young woman wakes up.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.330
She calls out, but no one answers.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.630
She tries to move in front of herself, but
a buzzer rings.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.289
She sees that she's standing on a red circle.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.470
She tries to move behind, but the buzzer rings
again.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.380
She tries to touch the soldier next to her,
but the buzzer rings for that too.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.110
There's a circle glowing on her hand.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.730
A man from the other side of the room tells
her to stop moving.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.430
He says "they" can see us.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.530
She asks questions he can only guess the answers
too.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.600
Another woman wakes up, panicked.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.530
He tries to calm her, but she moves and a
beam of electricity shooting from the middle

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.540
of the circle of people kills her.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.070
Suddenly, the lights come on and everyone
wakes, one man dies instantly.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.450
The first man tells everyone to stop moving,
while a cop is looking for his gun.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.480
He tells everyone to stand still and not to
touch anyone.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.249
A beeping sound can be heard and one of the
men that was killed gets dragged away, as

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:07.999
his hand glows as well.

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:12.469
The beeping continues and the electrical charge
starts building, it kills the first man before

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.399
he can speak again.

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.920
Everyone is panicking now, but as they are
calming down the guy in the hat figures out

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.189
that he's controlling the lights on the floor.

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.799
The light stops in front of a woman and the
electricity zaps her.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.390
As the others ask what's going on, the guy
in the hat tells them to see how they can

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.619
change the lights on the floor.

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.719
Everyone tries per his instruction and they
realize they can only see the light they are

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:34.719
controlling.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.329
The hat guy says that they are the ones that
choose who dies.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.090
The beeping starts and another person gets
zapped.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.409
The beeping starts again as the pregnant woman
looks around trying to figure out what is

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.520
happening.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.369
The electricity zaps again and she says that
they are actually voting.

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.679
She says that they're killing off whomever
gets the most votes and that they choose by

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.619
closing their hands.

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.240
Someone suggests they all vote for the dead
one and they all agree, as the beeping is

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.319
under way.

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.170
When it stops, someone gets zapped regardless.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.139
The next time it beeps, they all try not voting.

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:07.710
Suddenly all of the pointer lights come on
and someone still gets zapped.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.049
The guy in the blue hoodie tells everyone
to be quiet and suggests they develop a strategy,

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.030
so they are able to figure out their situation
and stop what's happening to them.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.110
His suggestion - to kill the older people
first.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.750
Hat guy agrees, but not everyone else.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.459
Blue hoodie says they should start with the
first one on his right and kill them off clockwise.

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.740
Pregnant lady disagrees, but no one has a
better idea.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.980
The beeping continues and the first old man
begs, but the zapper gets him.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.879
Since the majority agrees with blue hoodie's
strategy, they try to figure out what's happening

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:38.879
to them.

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.239
They ask the soldier, thinking he might know
what it is, like an alien invasion or something

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.010
similar, but he's just as confused as the
rest of them.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.670
A man in the back starts speaking about what
he remembers from before he woke up there.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.989
He is remembering being stuck in a traffic
jam, then running before everything went dark.

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.890
A few others say they remember the same thing.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.360
The beeping starts again and they vote, for
the second old person.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.860
The guy remembers being pulled up in a ship.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.070
He also remembers a red room with bodies piled
up, which he now thinks weren't dead, but

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.470
actually drugged.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.459
They all vote for the third old person, as
they continue their conversation.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.750
The fourth old person says he also remembers
something, maybe the aliens - how they spoke

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.439
and what they looked like.

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.030
Some of the people don't believe him, thinking
he's lying to save himself.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.520
But he gets zapped.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.430
Hat guy asks who'll be the next in line to
get zapped.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.719
They point to the hat lady, asking her how
old she is.

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:34.519
The fact that she's only 52, changes the minds
of the others.

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.510
She tells them that she had cancer, but she
beat it.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.069
Blue hoodie thinks that since she is more
likely to die than the rest of them, she should

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.069
be next.

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.939
A doctor interjects, saying that's not true.

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.670
To that blue hoodie says that since she's
over fifty she needs to go, but some of the

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.510
others disagree wondering how low the age
limit would get eventually.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.930
Blue hoodie tries to convince them of his
strategy to no avail.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.300
They kill him.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.650
Cancer lady suggests that they should start
figuring out why they were chosen for the

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.650
circle.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.670
Though some of the others think that it was
a random scenario.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.530
She says that they should try to learn more
about each other.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.390
Beth goes first and tells the others about
herself.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.840
As she speaks the beeping starts again and
she gets zapped.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.049
After that, most of the people think that
they should not share their names and they're

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.850
apprehensive about sharing anything else too.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.280
Craig goes next regardless, saying that the
woman on his left is his wife.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.300
Someone asks who else knows each other and
a man from the back speaks up, saying he knows

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.389
the doctor.

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.389
The two of them don't want to share how they
know each other though.

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.650
Craig continues, begging the people not to
kill his wife.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.560
The beeping continues and another zap happens.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.539
Next they asks the Hispanic man to speak,
but he doesn't understand English.

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.030
The woman behind him says she'll translate.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.680
She asks him about his family and he says
that he has 3 daughters down in Mexico.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.620
Red tie man starts the conversation about
illegal immigrants, but the man in the flannel

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.580
shirt asks him if he would need a green card
to get abducted by aliens.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.870
They tell the translator to ask him if he
was in the US legally and he says no.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.190
The beeping continues, but it zaps a young
girl in the front row, to the surprise of

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.190
some.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.889
The cop recognizes a guy from the front row
- Raul, because he beat up his own girlfriend.

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.150
Cancer lady asks if he's sure it was him.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.610
The exchange between the cop and Raul becomes
more about profiling and prejudice, than about

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.610
what he could've possibly done for the cop
to know him.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.340
When they start asking if he did beat up his
girlfriend, he says that she got what she

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.630
deserved.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.090
Next round, Raul gets zapped.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.449
After that, the blonde from the front row
says that maybe they're supposed to figure

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.420
out who's good and who's bad.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.460
She says there must be a reason why they're
there, but the man next to her doesn't agree,

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.319
saying that maybe the whole point is for them
to kill each other while the aliens watch.

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:46.370
However, the blonde guy behind her interprets
her question as figuring out who deserves

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.490
to live.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.040
So they wonder what they should base it on,
while the beeping continues.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.550
It zaps the Muslim woman from the front row.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.940
The African American man asks the racial question
and stirs the conversation.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.110
The white people, at first, say that in that
room nothing is fair and the other African

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.379
Americans tell him not to continue with the
conversation, because he will only make himself

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:07.470
a target.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.069
Hat guy agrees with them.

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:12.259
The question reveals how people actually feel
about race.

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:15.740
The cop is the next one to speak, revealing
his racism and prejudice.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.560
The beeper starts, the cop dies.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.370
The soldier thinks that they shouldn't talk
about their opinions and prejudices, but the

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.520
African American man disagrees, saying everything
should be on the table.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.220
The soldier and the translator say that they
shouldn't turn on each other and instead try

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.389
to figure out what is happening to them.

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:36.630
The next time they vote, they try voting for
themselves, but it doesn't work.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.419
So they try voting for the person next to
them.

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:42.449
Someone still gets zapped, because somebody
made a mistake.

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.460
They try the same thing again and the pregnant
woman helps the kid next to her.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.110
Suddenly, the pregnant girl and a man are
chosen, so everyone votes again.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.639
The man gets zapped.

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.409
The guy from the back says he voted for the
man, because he saw him voting for the pregnant

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:57.409
girl.

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:00.940
He says that the way the game was designed,
in the end it will get down to the pregnant

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.409
girl or the kid.

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:06.271
To that the blonde guy from the second row
replies that if they get rid of them, everyone

00:07:06.271 --> 00:07:07.940
will have a better chance.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.420
The guy in the flannel shirt says that it
should be one of them to walk out, but red

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.120
tie disagrees.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.250
Cancer lady says that the pregnant girl counts
as two people.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.520
The voting begins and it's another tie, between
an older woman and the kid.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.050
They vote for the lady.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.580
The guy from the back and the soldier think
that they should protect the two of them,

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.750
but the man with the glasses wants to know
what they're like first.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.729
He asks the kid questions when the voting
begins and it's another tie, between the pregnant

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:34.180
girl and the kid.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.090
The guy standing behind them says to kill
them both, but he gets zapped instead.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.740
Craig suggests they should ask for volunteers.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.790
They go around the circle, but no one steps
up, until a teenager says he'll volunteer.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.409
They argue if they should ask him why he would
do it.

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:52.280
Eventually he does answer, saying he doesn't
want to kill anyone.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.009
Flannel shirt says that he's a kid and that
it's not fair to let him do it.

00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:59.740
Red tie and glasses man disagree, so hey ask
if he's sure.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.539
An older gentleman from the back volunteers
in his stead and when the beeping starts,

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:05.560
he walks off from his circle.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.460
Red tie and glasses still insist they should
ask for volunteers, but they're not willing

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.310
to do it themselves.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.330
Flannel guy thinks that everyone except the
pregnant girl should step forward.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.310
Glasses asks the teenager if he still wants
to do it and after the beeping, he steps out

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.470
and dies.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.689
Next, everyone expects the soldier to volunteer.

00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:27.669
But he doesn't want to, because he thinks
he's sacrificed enough in his life.

00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:30.669
He wants to get back to his family and meet
his kid.

00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:33.200
Time is running out and they wait for a volunteer.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.419
A woman from the back does it, because she's
lost her son.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:39.030
The Deacon tells her that she will see him
again.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.560
She says goodbye and walks out of her circle.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.660
The man in the black suit antagonizes him,
when they find out he's a deacon.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.040
They finally reach the religion question.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.640
The man in the black suit, tells them that
they have only one god now and it's the zapper.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.940
He gets mad and tries to find the other atheists
in the circle.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.790
The beeping starts and he thinks they'll all
choose him.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.029
Both him and another girl are chosen.

00:09:01.029 --> 00:09:02.310
She gets zapped.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:07.440
He continues to antagonize everyone, by asking
the blond next to him if she's a porn star.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.670
She says no, but he keeps pushing her and
offending her.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.260
The next voting round comes up and he dies.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.910
While the blond is crying, glasses man says
that they should take into account if some

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.410
of them have children.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.180
Craig says that him and his wife have a daughter.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.100
Glasses thinks that the ones that don't have
children should sacrifice themselves.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.260
Red tie man asks a woman from the back if
she has any kids or a husband, but she throws

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.060
the question back at him.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.500
While he's answering another girl gets zapped.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.149
Then the woman tells them about her life and
they find out that she's gay.

00:09:37.149 --> 00:09:41.090
Red tie is clearly a homophobe and the others
take offense to what he's saying, so in the

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.680
next voting round, he dies.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.540
Blond guy asks what happens at the end when
only two are left.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.100
Would they tie?

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.450
So the guy in the back suggests that one of
the two wouldn't vote and would effectively

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.830
be sacrificing them self.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.830
Flannel guy says that he would sacrifice himself
and cancer lady implies that they should pick

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.390
someone they would trust to make the right
decision.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.350
The translator says that no one can be trusted.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.600
Blond guy says that they all should decide.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.180
The blond woman asks what happens if it comes
down to the two of them?

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.460
The doctor says they could decide for them.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.779
The voting is underway and her and the man
that knows her are tied.

00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:15.779
They die together.

00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:19.560
The blond guy is convinced that they should
decide who out of the two of them should die,

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.150
but the soldier thinks he's just manipulating
everybody to get rid of both the pregnant

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.630
girl and the kid.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.510
Craig asks who would they choose out of the
two, then glasses asks the pregnant girl what

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.020
she does for work.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.010
The others don't think it's a fair question,
as he continues explaining that it's important

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.000
to know who contributes more to society out
of them.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.529
The translator says that what's important
is that she's pregnant.

00:10:40.529 --> 00:10:44.300
Glasses antagonizes the pregnant girl, when
another voting round starts and kills hat

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.550
guy.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:49.490
Flannel asks glasses what he does and he answers
that he's a banker and a contributing member

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.100
to society.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.790
Glasses antagonizes all of them, but the translator
gets zapped.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:58.270
Most of the people think that the Hispanic
man should be next, when the man from the

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:02.080
back says that one side killed the translator
because she would never vote for the kid or

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.540
the pregnant girl.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.950
Now that the question of "sides" is raised
they start counting each other to see which

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.010
one stands where.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.250
Who will be the ones to vote for the girls
and who won't?

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.490
The vote begins and the kid and the Hispanic
man tie.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.230
He sees what's happening and he sacrifices
himself for the girl.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:23.029
Glasses antagonizes the soldier and he aligns
with the side that wants to kill the two girls.

00:11:23.029 --> 00:11:26.960
Him and the blond guy get the couple and the
African American man on their side.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.400
The voting starts.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.800
The kid is in a tie again, but this time with
glasses.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.200
The African American man and the blond man
say that they should let hem both die.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.459
But only glasses dies, because the wife changes
her vote.

00:11:39.459 --> 00:11:44.190
They find out it was her, but she says that
she didn't change it, she just didn't vote.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.400
Flannel guy says that they all know that they
will die and that it's better to go out with

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.680
some dignity.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.339
Craig thinks that he's implying that the kid
should die and the pregnant girl should remain

00:11:52.339 --> 00:11:53.339
last.

00:11:53.339 --> 00:11:57.120
The blond guy wants to get the blond woman
on his side, but when he can't he says that

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.490
they should vote for the flannel guy so that
they could even things out and have more time

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.180
to talk about everything.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.780
They vote for the flannel guy.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:08.519
Next, they try to find the majority for each
group, so the soldier suggests they vote for

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:10.740
the wife, to test the husband.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.389
At the last second Craig switches his vote
and the soldier says that they all vote for

00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:16.459
the African American man.

00:12:16.459 --> 00:12:21.070
After he dies, the blond guy gets angry at
Craig and says that they're probably not even

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.660
married, trying to turn everyone else against
them.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.279
They all start asking them questions, but
the wife caves when one of the women asks

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:28.660
for his name.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.150
She doesn't even remember when he said it
before.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.630
Craig caves and says it was her idea, but
they still kill him.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.610
The fake wife tells them that she didn't lie
about her kid.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.449
The blond guy keeps reminding everyone that
they are all killers, but he promises the

00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:44.640
wife that if she joins his side, he will keep
her alive.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.600
He asks the older man what side he's on, but
the man doesn't speak.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.970
Then he asks the woman next to him to join
him by playing on her feelings about her family.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:57.700
The voting begins and ends with a five way
tie between the blond guy, the soldier, cancer

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.730
lady, blond woman and the gay woman.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.360
Only the blond guy remains after the revote.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.610
The Deacon is crying and the blond guy continues
with his strategy, then asks the pregnant

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.139
woman for her vote.

00:13:09.139 --> 00:13:10.410
She says no.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.660
The guy in the back stays on his position
about the strategy.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:17.160
The Deacon apologizes to the pregnant girl
and steps off.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.260
The guy in the back and the blond guy realize
that they would need to change strategies,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.540
so the blond guy says to trade with him for
one of the girls and he'll give him the fake

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.540
wife.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.750
The voting begins and they all vote except
for the older man.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.050
The wife dies.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.920
The guy from the back says that the older
man never voted during the whole ordeal and

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.949
he made it all the way to where they are.

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:39.959
The guy in the back and the blond guy argue
about him, with the first one making the other

00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:42.250
one think they will all vote for the older
man.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:46.880
But, him and the pregnant girl have an understanding
about who they will be voting for.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.230
The zapper kills the blond guy.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.970
Only four of them remain.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:55.160
This time they will all vote for the older
man, because they don't have another choice.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.240
He dies.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.690
The guy is left with the two girls and they
talk about the reason why all of it is happening.

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:04.330
He says that maybe the aliens are conducting
an experiment to see what humans are like

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.019
and what matters to them.

00:14:06.019 --> 00:14:09.779
The pregnant girl asks why they would do that
by making them kill each other, so the guy

00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:13.460
answers that by choosing who dies they can
see the way people judge each other and how

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.509
they think.

00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:18.399
Next, he tell the two girls that the two of
them would have to decide which one of them

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:21.020
dies, he can't make that decision for them.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.449
The kid cries, because she's made her decision.

00:14:23.449 --> 00:14:26.149
She'll go, for the sake of the baby.

00:14:26.149 --> 00:14:29.640
He tells her that they'll go together, but
at the last minute when the kid steps out

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.520
of her circle, he votes for the pregnant girl.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.320
Both the girl and the pregnant woman fall
over, but nothing happens, he's still trapped

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.720
in the room.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.290
Another vote begins, he curses the aliens
thinking that they'll kill him regardless

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:41.899
and he doesn't vote.

00:14:41.899 --> 00:14:45.480
When the beeping stops, he sees that he's
tied with the baby and has to choose between

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.980
the baby and himself.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.720
He chooses the baby to die.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.420
He wakes up outside looking up at a spaceship.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.440
When he stands up, he sees that there are
more than one of them.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.290
He played everyone in the room to get to the
last round of the voting circle, knowing what

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.940
he would do if he got there.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.369
He saved himself.
