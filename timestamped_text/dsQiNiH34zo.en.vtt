Chase reveals that Alison is an unrighteous woman who only likes to drink and sleep with a lot of men.

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:27.565
Tyler who heard this could only be silent.

00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:31.490
Since dating,
Alison has never told her about her past.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.452
As a result Tyler is angry with Alison.

00:01:34.452 --> 00:01:40.649
that night they immediately had a big fight and in the end Alison immediately ended their relationship there.

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.967
Disappointed with Alison's behavior,
Tyler finally decided to leave the party.

00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:51.758
out there Tyler accidentally met a beautiful and super rich girl named Holly.

00:01:51.758 --> 00:01:56.175
Holly immediately took Tyler around in the luxury car he was carrying.

00:02:21.497 --> 00:02:23.879

00:02:24.704 --> 00:02:28.759
after telling a lot, Tyler also told a little about his life story.

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:32.944
Holly immediately invited Tyler to have fun in the very spacious mansion.

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:38.685
After a long time of having fun, it didn't feel like night had arrived and they had only met all day.

00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:42.020
Holly immediately ordered Tyler to make love with her.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:49.674
because Tyler was tempted by Holly's beauty, Tyler finally want to sleep with holly, they are making love together.

00:02:49.674 --> 00:02:55.836
After being satisfied, Tyler realized that he had to go home because his own sister is alone in his home.

00:02:55.836 --> 00:03:01.962
when he got home,
his mother actually called several times and also Alison who texted him several times.

00:03:01.962 --> 00:03:08.370
it can be seen from the message that Alison wants to invite Tyler to meet at Alison's house in the next morning

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.250
in morning,
Tyler immediately rush to Alison's house.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.096
in there Alison apologized for her behavior last night, as well as Tyler who immediately apologized.

00:03:18.096 --> 00:03:24.412
Alison also recounted when she lived in San Francisco where the association there tended to deviate and very bad.

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:29.580
because of the bad association of her friends in San Francisco, Alison also joined in.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.150
that's why Alison and her family moved here,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.002
hoping there would be no more such association.

00:03:35.002 --> 00:03:39.204
After forgiving,
they also promise not to hide secrets from each other.

00:03:39.204 --> 00:03:43.664
However, Tyler immediately remember that he had just had slept together with Holly.

00:03:43.664 --> 00:03:47.857
but here Tyler is scared and ends up hiding the secret from Alison.

00:03:47.857 --> 00:03:54.044
the next day,
at school there is a new student who enters Tyler's class, and it turns out to be Holly.

00:03:54.044 --> 00:03:57.914
Holly says that her stepmother will stay here forever to take care of Holly,

00:03:57.914 --> 00:04:03.501
Holly's stepmother tells Holly to go to school that's why Holly and Tyler meet in the same class.

00:04:03.501 --> 00:04:09.255
After class ended,
Tyler, Alison, Gil, and Lidya start to gather in the cafeteria,

00:04:09.255 --> 00:04:15.468
but suddenly Holly comes and introduces herself to the four of them.
Holly hopes to be their best friend too.

00:04:15.468 --> 00:04:21.638
After gathering,
Tyler immediately sends a message to Holly to meet on the stairs near the elevator after school.

00:04:21.638 --> 00:04:30.560
when Holly met Tyler, Tyler tried to break up with Holly and said it was just a mistake. But it seems Holly is already in love with Tyler.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.947
The next day,
Alison and Holly decide to go to Tyler's workplace.

00:04:34.947 --> 00:04:38.527
there Holly shows a photo of a man whose face is invisible.

00:04:38.527 --> 00:04:42.452
Tyler who saw this was afraid that Holly would talk about their relationship,

00:04:42.452 --> 00:04:45.240
but here Holly didn't want to tell who the man was.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.928
Holly and Alison are getting closer day by day,

00:04:47.928 --> 00:04:50.828
even Holly often goes to Alison's house to chat,

00:04:50.828 --> 00:04:53.601
Alison says that she has never slept with Tyler,

00:04:53.601 --> 00:04:57.861
wow, that's a pity because Holly was the one who slept with Tyler first.

00:04:57.861 --> 00:05:04.976
at that time,
Holly was staying at Alison's house,
via texting, Tyler wanted to tell her about his affair with Holly,

00:05:04.976 --> 00:05:08.044
but when he found out that Holly was staying at Alison's house.

00:05:08.044 --> 00:05:12.227
in the end, Tyler decided not to tell the secret

00:05:12.227 --> 00:05:19.006
While Alison is sleeping,
Holly secretly takes some of Alison's belongings and also a photo of Tyler with Alison,

00:05:19.006 --> 00:05:25.686
The next day,
Holly even came to Tyler's house,
Holly teases Tyler but Tyler seems to refuse.

00:05:25.686 --> 00:05:30.797
some time passed, Lidya began to be suspicious of Holly who did not have social media.

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:38.044
according to lidya,
In today's world, everyone must have a social media account,
but oddly,
Holly doesn't have one.

00:05:38.044 --> 00:05:45.154
Holly accidentally overheard the conversation
and because she felt threatened,
she finally planned to poison Lidya.

00:05:45.154 --> 00:05:52.302
On the other hand,
Tyler saw Holly's stepmother talking to one of the teachers and then Tyler introduced himself to Holly's mother.

00:05:52.302 --> 00:05:58.970
Holly's mother revealed that Holly had a mental disorder,
so Holly was required to take drugs and special therapy.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:05.087
After that,
Tyler thinks maybe Holly is a dangerous person who will destroy his relationship with Alison

00:06:05.087 --> 00:06:09.706
while Alison and Lydia were resting in the cafeteria,
Holly brought their favorite drink,

00:06:09.706 --> 00:06:16.723
but after lydia drank the drink suddenly Lidya had an extreme allergic reaction, so she had to be taken to the hospital.

00:06:16.723 --> 00:06:23.865
Alison goes straight to the hospital to accompany Lydia while Tyler suspects that the drink given by Holly has been mixed with poison.

00:06:23.865 --> 00:06:29.461
some time passed, as it was after school time,
Alison told Tyler that Holly was pregnant.

00:06:29.461 --> 00:06:35.605
Tyler who heard this did not believe it because he was afraid that the child was the result of their previous relationship.

00:06:35.605 --> 00:06:40.328
As a good friend,
Alison decided to accompany Holly through her difficult times.

00:06:40.328 --> 00:06:47.811
while at Holly's house,
Holly begins to share her frustration with the man who got her pregnant who has no sense of responsibility at all.

00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:51.111
Holly is also envious of Alison's smooth relationship.

00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:57.045
The next day,
Tyler was very surprised when Holly came to his house and played with his little sister.

00:06:57.045 --> 00:07:04.509
Tyler quickly took him out by force,
where Tyler start pushing Holly and telling Holly to get away from him.

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:08.271
that night,
Holly comes to her best friend Alison's house,

00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:16.160
then Holly begins to tell Alison everything that Holly actually has a relationship with Tyler
the photo seen from before is a photo of Tyler,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.091
because Holly is pregnant Tyler deliberately pushes himself to make her hurt.

00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:28.640
the same night,
tyler starts visiting lydia, Tyler says that he is suspicious of Holly because Holly may have put something in lydia's drink earlier.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:35.667
after saying that,
he immediately vented about himself having a relationship with Holly but Tyler promised to solve this problem.

00:07:35.667 --> 00:07:39.222
Tyler immediately text Alison to meet at the beach.

00:07:39.222 --> 00:07:42.238
The next day,
the two of them start to meet.

00:07:42.238 --> 00:07:48.367
it looks like Alison was very upset with Tyler because Tyler had a one-night stand with Holly but he kept it a secret.

00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:52.360
Tyler tries to explain everything to Alison but she just ignores him.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:58.084
Well,
because Alison was disappointed,
she finally told Tyler not to call her again.

00:07:58.084 --> 00:08:03.330
The next day,
when he entered the class, suddenly Tyler was called by the teacher.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:09.881
The teacher said that there was a student who accused Tyler of violence,
the student was named Elizabeth Holly Viola.

00:08:09.881 --> 00:08:14.167
Holly has shown evidence of her injuries that she was abused by Tyler.

00:08:14.167 --> 00:08:18.588
As a result,
Tyler was suspended from school for a few days.

00:08:18.588 --> 00:08:23.520
when Tyler found out the real name of the crazy girl, Elizabeth Holly Viola,

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.095
he immediately searched for it on google.

00:08:26.095 --> 00:08:31.905
Tyler was very surprised because he found an article that said that Holly or Elizabeth had attacked other students,

00:08:31.905 --> 00:08:35.389
as a result Elizabeth was put in a mental hospital for a while,

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:41.105
that's one of the reasons why when Lidya searched for Holly Viola's identity on the internet she didn't find it at all,

00:08:41.105 --> 00:08:44.001
because it turns out that Holly's real name is Elizabeth.

00:08:44.001 --> 00:08:48.056
Now,
Tyler knows that Elizabeth is very dangerous.

00:08:48.056 --> 00:08:51.827
at night,
Elizabeth secretly breaks into Alison's house,

00:08:51.827 --> 00:08:56.902
Elizabeth plans to steal Alison and lock her up in Elizabeth's mansion

00:08:56.902 --> 00:09:01.510
Elizabeth immediately sent a photo of the unconscious Alison to Tyler.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:05.222
then Tyler immediately rushed to Elizabeth's house to save Alison.

00:09:05.222 --> 00:09:10.903
But before that,
he messaged Gil to help him save Alison by sending Elizabeth's home address.

00:09:10.903 --> 00:09:15.581
after sending a message to Gil,
Tyler immediately went to Elizabeth's house.

00:09:15.581 --> 00:09:19.902
on the other hand,
Alison wakes up and sees herself tied to a chair.

00:09:19.902 --> 00:09:23.796
Elizabeth also starts telling Alison that she is not pregnant,

00:09:23.796 --> 00:09:27.752
she deliberately tricked Elison into feeling very disappointed with Tyler.

00:09:27.752 --> 00:09:32.683
Elison feels sorry that he didn't hear all that Tyler said that Holly was very dangerous.

00:09:32.683 --> 00:09:35.289
then Elizabeth's stepmother suddenly came,

00:09:35.289 --> 00:09:37.181
and saw Alison tied up.

00:09:37.181 --> 00:09:39.480
Elizabeth's stepmother tried to save her

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:45.283
but from behind,
Elizabeth immediately wrapped her in plastic so that it made her stepmother die.

00:09:45.283 --> 00:09:51.168
when Tyler arrived at Elizabeth's house,
Tyler immediately took a sharp weapon just in case.

00:09:51.168 --> 00:09:54.764
then Tyler accidentally saw Alison tied to the ceiling.

00:09:54.764 --> 00:09:58.886
quickly Tyler immediately saved Alison and ran away from that place.

00:09:58.886 --> 00:10:01.439
but Elizabeth doesn't seem to let them escape.

00:10:01.439 --> 00:10:04.481
Elizabeth immediately pointed a gun at them both.

00:10:04.481 --> 00:10:07.478
Tyler apologized to Elizabeth for his behavior.

00:10:07.478 --> 00:10:12.009
Suddenly Gil came and surprised Elizabeth so she immediately shot Tyler.

00:10:12.009 --> 00:10:16.955
Alison quickly took the sharp object that Tyler had brought and stabbed it into Elizabeth.

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:25.967
Tyler who was dying in his heart said, love is blind, love can destroy you, anything you can do because of love.

00:10:25.967 --> 00:10:30.317
I am lucky to be with Alison and survive this tragedy.

00:10:30.317 --> 00:10:35.847
After that,
it looks like a crazy Elizabeth managed to survive and seduce the officer.

00:10:35.847 --> 00:10:40.742
Then it all ended happily where Tyler and Alison were celebrating his sister's birthday

00:10:40.742 --> 00:10:41.939
And the movie is
