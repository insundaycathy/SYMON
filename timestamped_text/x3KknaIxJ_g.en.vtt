00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.890
Have you ever watched a movie about a zombie
apocalypse, and thought to yourself, if i

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.420
was in that position, is there anything I
could do to not get pulled apart by frothy

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.330
mouthed white eyed raging cannibals?

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.859
In this video on Nerd Explains, I'll tell
you how to survive Train To Busan.

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.579
Train to Busan is about a zombie outbreak
in South Korea where the survivors are lucky

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:28.069
enough to be on a departing train as the station
is overrun, but unlucky enough that a few

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.279
zombies managed to make it aboard, as well
as a few complete scumbags.

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.149
So you’re just chilling in your seat on
the train, when you look over and there’s

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.750
a rabid bloody person on top of another person
biting their neck and making unnatural sounds.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.030
Clearly this is a zombie, but nobody else
is freaking out.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.410
If you saw that, what should you do?

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.320
While everyone else is shocked and trying
to process the situation, you need to immediately,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.300
calmy, and quickly get up and move to the
next cattle car towards the engine.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.190
Close the door behind you, lock it, and throw
a blanket over the glass.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.500
It seemed there was an emergency lock on the
ceiling by the door, use it.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.020
Don’t just assume the zombies can’t somehow
open the door.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.960
Yes there are uninfected still in that car
you left, and you’re basically dooming them,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.960
but the problem is that if you panic, and
try to get everyone to the next car, nobody

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.160
will make it.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.221
Everyone will get stuck in the door, nobody
will have the chance to lock and cover the

00:01:24.221 --> 00:01:25.221
door, and you’ll all die.

00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:26.890
The car you left is fucked, you can deal with
the guilt later.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.060
Everyone in the next car would probably be
a bit shocked and freaked out with you closing,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.630
locking, and covering up the door with lots
of horrible sounds coming from that compartment,

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.880
but they aren’t in full panic yet.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.110
That’s good.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.330
Keep everyone quiet and calm.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.900
You don’t want to alert the zombies in the
car behind you.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.110
Move towards the front of the car towards
the next door, so if everyone freaks out or

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.610
does stupid shit you can escape quickly, then
establish control over the people in that

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.610
car.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.900
If you let everyone freak out and panic, it’s
game over.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.840
Check the next section for zombies, if it’s
clear, then calmly and quietly start moving

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.960
sections of that car into the next car.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.080
Once everyone is safe, lock that door as well
but don’t cover it so you can see if the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.810
zombies broke through.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.790
This gives the train a buffer car between
infected and non infected.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.150
So now you have an empty buffer car between
the uninfected and infected cars.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.300
What is the next contingency to plan for.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.070
What if the zombies break through that door,
or something happens where you will encounter

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.360
a zombie up close.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.670
Okay, you need armor and weapons.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.580
For armor, start wrapping and covering up
any exposed skin with extra clothes, taped

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.400
magazines around arms and legs.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.620
Wrap your hands up.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.220
Any scratch or bite and you’re a goner.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.600
For weapons, start dismantling anything that
looks like you could block, stab, or bash

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.550
the zombies with.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.645
The metal used to hold the overhead luggage
looks useful, but the more distance, the sharper,

00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:54.690
the heavier the object, the better.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.569
Anything that gives you the lethality edge,
using your fists is the most vulnerable and

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.569
dangerous option.

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.370
For a shield, if anyone has a backpack, luggage
bag, this could be used for blocking.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:15.470
Then, using a human train, load the buffer
car with all the luggage you can find.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.670
If the zombies break through into the buffer
car, all the luggage will block and slow them

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.670
down so the zombies have less room to generate
force against your car’s door.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.760
What I mean, is that they won’t be able
to get a running start and body slam the door

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.470
potentially breaking it.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.150
So now you have an empty buffer car full of
luggage between the uninfected and infected

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.490
cars, as well as makeshift armor and weapons
that give you a fighting chance.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.530
Now you find out people have loved ones stuck
in the other cars, with zombies between you

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.420
and them, as well as zombies in cars between
you and the engine.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.370
In the movie the protagonists fight through
3 train cars full of zombies, realistically

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.800
that is total suicide.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.480
You could stop the train, and since the zombies
can’t open doors they’d be isolated in

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.709
their cars.

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.530
The uninfected could simply exit their car
and walk over to your car.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.300
Then start the train up again.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.360
This has its dangers but is probably the best
solution.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.729
That said, it’s dependent on if you can
communicate with the conductor or not.

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.910
It’s also dependent on if your loved ones
are stuck in the bathroom with zombies in

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.229
the car with them.

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:33.650
If so, then with the train still moving, with
a buddy or two, I would open the train door

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.599
and get to the top of the train.

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:41.809
Sure, it’s really dangerous, and you need
to be careful not to touch the overhead lines,

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:47.370
but it’s better than fighting through hordes
of zombies in hand to hand combat.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.610
Then for each zombie car between you and the
uninfected, get on-top.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.430
Then with a weapon, break the train car window.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.210
The zombies will try to climb through the
window to get to you, and since they’re

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.809
uncoordinated and irrational, they will all
fall off the moving train while climbing out

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:04.809
the window.

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:09.419
You can effectively clear the train cars of
zombies using this technique.

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:10.620
If this doesn’t work.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.439
Then go to the uninfected cars, and break
their windows and help them up onto the top

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:16.900
of the train.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.050
Once they are on top of the train, you need
to ensure that they aren’t infected.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:28.729
Check them for any bites or scratches or signs
of infection.

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.860
Then you can all walk back to the safe part
of the train in front of your buffer car.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.120
Once that is done.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.710
Move to the engine room and let the conductor
know what is going on, and use his knowledge

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.509
to decouple the zombie train cars.

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:47.550
So now you have cleared the train of zombies
manually, as well as decoupled any other zombie

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.789
train cars.

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.819
Keep the train moving.

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:56.789
Do not get off or leave the train unless you
are 100% sure it is safe and that the military

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.569
has secured the area.

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:04.599
And I mean you visually can see the soldiers
securing the area with overwhelming firepower

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:05.919
and organization.

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:11.289
Don’t just wander into the next train station
on foot because you heard it was safe.

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.190
That’s how you die.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.319
The train's speed and structure is your biggest
advantage.

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:21.740
Zombies won’t be able to catch, swarm, or
otherwise get to you while the train is moving

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.020
at full speed.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:29.039
If you have to transfer to another train in
order to get to assured safety, run on top

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.569
of the trains for additional safety and better
awareness.

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:36.889
Avoid being on foot without visibility as
much as possible.

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:39.409
I would still highly avoid this decision.

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:45.199
I would stay on the train, and continue to
keep it moving either forward or in reverse.

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.779
Again speed is your ally, and staying in the
moving train until help comes is the best

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:51.779
decision.

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:56.409
If nobody comes to save you, it’s because
the world ended and you’re already fucked.

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:02.139
If you do go in reverse, do take care to not
accidentally ram into the zombie car you decoupled

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:03.399
from earlier.

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:08.490
In the context of this movie, that is how
I would attempt to survive a train to busan.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.349
If you have other ideas, or think I am wrong
or would get killed doing what I mentioned,

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:15.120
let me know in the comments.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:23.800
Thanks for watching, later.
