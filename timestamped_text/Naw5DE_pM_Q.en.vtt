00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.450
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.620
Today, I'm going to explain an action, crime,
drama, and sci-fi film called "Code 8."

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.910
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.150
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.710
Superpowered human beings became an essential
part of the workforce in the 20th century.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.030
The government has invited people with special
abilities to register their powers and help

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.170
build Lincoln City.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.020
However, the demand for powered workers has
waned since the Second Industrial Revolution

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.530
because businesses prefer to use automated
systems.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.260
Due to the lack of opportunities for powered
citizens, crime syndicates have begun exploiting

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.420
them in different ways.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.059
A criminal organization called the Trust has
been extracting the spinal fluid of powered

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.920
humans to create a highly addictive drug called
Psyke.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.510
As the problems continue to arise from the
drug, people have begun calling for new laws

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.609
to restrict the use of superpowers.

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:44.999
The police force has started using drones
and robots called Guardians to monitor and

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:47.719
apprehend powered humans who work without
a permit.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.699
A Class 5 Electric named Connor Reed tries
to earn a living by working as a temporary

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.769
laborer at construction sites while applying
for a more permanent job.

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.640
After a job interview, he heads straight to
a construction site to determine if the foreman

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.799
could use another Electric.

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.649
The foreman agrees to let him work half a
day, but the police soon arrive to inspect

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.329
the location to make sure powers are not being
used.

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:10.960
They order the workers to look at the sky,
so the drone can detect if they are powered.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.850
The cops tell the laborers with powers to
leave the site and get a permit if they want

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.100
to keep working.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.570
As the investigation goes on, authorities
learn that one of the workers has an arrest

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.570
warrant.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.570
While the cops are arresting the worker, he
emits fire from his hands and tries to escape.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.259
Guardians soon drop down from the drone and
shoot him until he's dead.

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.740
Elsewhere in Lincoln City, the police conduct
a drug raid on an apartment of a powered man.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.340
The Guardian breaks down the door, but the
robot is soon disabled when the suspect, a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.500
Class four Brawn, hurls a disk towards it,
hitting it on its neck.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.649
The suspect tries to escape through the window,
but Officer Park enters the room and threatens

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:43.729
to shoot him.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.460
As they search the place, an officer discovers
a room filled with superpowered individuals

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.450
being tapped for their spinal fluid.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.979
The police also found multiple bags of Psyke
in the apartment linked to a crime lord named

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.149
Marcus Sutcliffe.

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.939
Connor visits his mom at the grocery as she
is being scolded by her boss, Dave because

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.710
she accidentally froze the sauce and dropped
it on the ground.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.420
Mary Reed, a cryokinetic, has been having
problems controlling her abilities because

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.569
of a brain tumor.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.709
Connor becomes incensed by how Dave speaks
to his mother, confronting him and almost

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.069
using his powers.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.090
The boss, however, is undaunted and tells
them both to leave the store.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.379
Connor urges his mom to start chemo on the
way home, but Mary tells him that they can't

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:21.560
afford it.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.080
The following day, while Connor waits for
a side job at a street corner, he notices

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.760
a truck from Lincoln Power.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.319
His friend Travis warns him not to get involved
with them because they're part of Sutcliffe's

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.319
crew.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.099
The van approaches them, and the driver tells
them he's looking for an Electric, but only

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.840
Class 2 or above.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.049
Connor hesitates, but he eventually walks
toward the vehicle and tells the driver that

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.910
he wants 200 dollars upfront.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.620
The driver, Garrett, agrees and tells him
to get in the van.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.159
Inside the van, a mute Brawn named Freddie
tells him to put on a safety vest through

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.680
sign language.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.990
Garrett takes Connor to a chemical plant to
disable an electric fence.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.519
Connor tries to use a bolt cutter to cut the
wires, but he was taken aback by the electric

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.549
shock, so he decided to overload it.

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.310
A Pyro named Maddy melts the lock allowing
the van to enter the plant.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.299
As they load chemical barrels onto their truck,
a guard arrives and tries to call for backup.

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.160
Garret uses his telekinetic power to take
his radio, so the guard yields and tells them

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.810
he didn't see anything.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.610
As they leave the site, the police receive
an alert for a break-in at Jones Chemical.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.329
Patrol officers are told to look out for a
red cargo van.

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.860
Conner tells Garrett to pay him and let him
go, but Garrett says the job's not finished.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.019
Garrett parks the car under a bridge and asks
his crew to strip off the logo and the red

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.830
sheet covering the actual white paint job
of the vehicle.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.510
The drone spots their van, but the cops realize
that the color doesn't match the description,

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.680
so they continue searching elsewhere.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.450
Garrett drives the van into a garage and asks
a man named Rhino to take them to Sutcliffe,

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.409
who has the power to read minds.

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.530
Rhino leads them to a secret passageway to
Sutcillfe's club.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.450
Inside the club, Wesley Cumbo, a representative
of The Trust, grills Sutcliffe for his failure

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.359
to meet his payment obligations.

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.840
When Sutcliffe tries to explain the reason
for not paying, Cumbo tells Sutcliffe to read

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.049
the mind of his associate, Copperhead.

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.269
He tells Cumbo that Copperhead is thinking
of different ways to slit his throat.

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.390
Cumbo tells him that he has one week to pay
what he owes to The Trust.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.450
After Cumbo leaves the club, Garrett introduces
Connor to Sutcliffe.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.860
Sutcliffe reads Connor's mind and concludes
that he will be helpful to his crew.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.440
Sutcliffe tells a woman named Nia to show
Connor around.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.910
Nia offers him a drink, but Connor says he's
just passing through.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.420
Sutcliffe tells Garrett that he can't pay
for the chemicals at the moment because he

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.550
needs to pay Cumbo before he sends his thugs
after them.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.980
Sutcliffe asks Garrett about Connor's powers,
wondering if he can use the Electric for another

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.980
job.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.330
Garrett tells him that Connor is strong, but
he still needs to train him.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.760
Sutcliffe tells Garrett to prepare Connor
for the new stint quickly because it will

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.700
earn them a lot of money.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.920
Garrett drops Connor off and gives him another
300 dollars as a bonus.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.290
He tells him to wait at the same place again
the next day to earn more money.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.060
Before running off, Garrett advises him not
to waste his talent.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.530
At home, Mary tells Connor that he went back
to the grocery to get her job back.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.760
Connor tells her that her boss is a jerk,
but she says they don't have much choice because

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.210
they need the money.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.110
Back at the club, Nia approaches Sutcliffe
and tells him that she's out of Psyke.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.000
Sutcliffe shows her a vial of the drug, but
she has to do something for him before she

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.270
could get it.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.570
On the streets, Officers Park and Davis investigate
the robbery at Jones Chemicals.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.070
Park concludes that the suspects took 200
gallons of chemicals to water down Sutcliffe's

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.590
Psyke with Hydro.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.020
Davis tells Park that an Electric shorted
the fence and a Pyro broke the lock.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.640
Park tells Davis to come up with a list of
Electrics who has that kind of power.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.150
The next day, Travis advises Connor to be
careful when he does a job with Sutcliffe's

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.150
men.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.650
Soon, the foreman from their last job arrives
looking for two Electrics, but Connor sees

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.680
Garrett's car and decides to go with Garrett
instead.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.991
Garrett still doubts Connor's motivation,
so he asks him why he decided to work with

00:05:38.991 --> 00:05:41.280
them instead of finding a legitimate job.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.390
Connor reveals that he needs the money to
pay for his mom's treatment.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.650
Garrett decides to test his ability by asking
him to short a car's alarm outside the diner.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.380
Garrett activates the alarm by slamming his
fist on the hood.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.590
As the alarm blares, Connor asks Garret how
much he would get when he joins them on their

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:55.760
next heist.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.100
He deactivates the alarm after Garrett tells
him he'll receive 25,000 dollars.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.240
Garrett learns that Connor's dad, who's an
Electric like him, got shot while he's robbing

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.480
a liquor store.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.330
He concludes that his mother raised him without
powers so he won't end up like his father.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.840
Garrett soon starts training Connor by asking
him to light a bulb, but he breaks it on his

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.880
first try.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.220
While they prepare for the heist, Connor does
other menial tasks for Garrett, including

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.160
collecting payments from drug dealers.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.720
Soon, Connor can keep a bulb lit without blowing
it up.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.040
Garrett tests Connor's strength again by pitting
him against another Electric who refuses to

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.040
pay him.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.780
The man blasts Connor with electricity, but
it doesn't have much effect on him.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.450
Connor brings the man down with a stronger
jolt to his chest.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.620
Garrett trains him to use his powers and advises
him to be more ruthless when dealing with

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.420
other people in their circles.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.660
One night, Connor decides to visit Dave at
the grocery and threatens him.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.040
At home, Connor tells his mom that he was
accepted for a permanent job.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.210
Outside the house, Park and Davis are on a
stakeout observing Connor.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.170
They learn from his records that he has no
permanent work while he struggles to pay for

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.700
his mom's medical bills.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.020
Park tells Davis to include him on the list
of persons of interest.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.700
The following day, Connor and Garrett visit
a bank to observe their routine and find out

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.670
the location of the security cameras as well
as the vault.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.370
Connor tells them that there's no way to open
the vault without activating the alarm.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.410
Garrett says that the drone's best time is
seven minutes, so they have to be out in five.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.040
At the grocery, Mary is puzzled by Dave's
behavior because he is much nicer to her and

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.040
even goes out of his way to avoid assigning
her a task.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.800
That night, the gang enters the bank armed
with guns.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.580
Connor heads straight to the vault to short
the power, preventing the bank from locking

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.770
it remotely.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.560
As the alarm sounds off, they ask an employee
to open the vault manually.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.250
Garrett threatens her as she dials the combination,
but Connor tries to calm her down, telling

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.320
her to relax and take deep breaths.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.890
When the vault opens, Garrett becomes furious
as he finds out that most of the money is

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.890
gone.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.240
The employee tells them that the bank already
cleared the vault earlier that day.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.960
The gang decides to take what's left and leave
the bank.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.120
When they get outside, the drones are already
waiting for them.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.980
Connor hits the drones with a surge, sending
the aerial vehicles, loaded with Guardians,

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.610
crashing to the ground.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.980
They drive back to Sutcliffe's club to tell
him that they only managed to take 50,000

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:56.980
dollars.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.990
As Garrett and Sutcliffe argue about paying
off the Trust, Copperhead approaches them

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.580
and shoots Sutcliffe.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.170
Rhino blocks the projectiles with his bulletproof
body, so Copperhead decides to aim her gun

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.300
at Nia.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.140
Connor blasts the weapon out of her hand,
so Copperhead comes after him with a knife.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.280
Rhino shoots her down and walks towards her
to shoot her three more times, making sure

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.300
she's dead.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.970
Later, Connor walks in on Nia as she is getting
high on Psyke.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.120
Connor wonders why Cumbo's assassin went after
her, but she tells him that it wasn't the

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.890
first time someone pulled a gun on her.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.670
Nia notices Connor's injury on his arm and
heals it.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.110
Nia reveals that the assassin tried to kill
her because of her abilities.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.599
When Connor asks why Nia keeps healing Sutcliffe,
she discloses that she's indebted to him.

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:37.339
When Connor gets home, Mary confronts him
about the money he kept in his drawer.

00:08:37.339 --> 00:08:39.630
He tells her that he got it from working overtime.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.899
But Mary says she called the office where
Connor applied for a job, but they never heard

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:43.899
of him.

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:46.889
While he explains why he turned to crime to
earn money, his mother suddenly loses control

00:08:46.889 --> 00:08:49.209
of her ability and collapses to the ground.

00:08:49.209 --> 00:08:52.589
At the hospital, the doctor tells Connor that
the tumor is pressing her brain against the

00:08:52.589 --> 00:08:55.980
skull, and they need to operate on her right
away to prevent it from getting worse.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.449
He inquires about the cost of the surgery
and finds out that he can't afford it.

00:08:59.449 --> 00:09:03.480
Outside the hospital, Park and Davis wait
for Connor to invite him to the police station.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.939
Park asks him about the robbery at the chemical
plant and the bank, but Connor says he doesn't

00:09:06.939 --> 00:09:08.060
know anything.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.250
They warn Connor that he's working for the
most vicious criminal in Lincoln City, referring

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.500
to Sutcliffe.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.360
Park brags that they are about to burn up
4 million dollars worth of Psyke belonging

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.910
to Sutcliffe next week.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.110
He surmises that it won't be long before they
bring the crime lord down.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:23.589
Park mentions Connor's ailing mother and offers
to help him if he gives them information about

00:09:23.589 --> 00:09:24.589
Sutcliffe.

00:09:24.589 --> 00:09:27.680
Davis interrupts them and starts taunting
Connor by insulting his dad.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.721
Connor gets exasperated and tells them to
recheck the security footage because they

00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:32.490
have the wrong person.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.990
Park tells Davis to let Connor go, arguing
that they don't have enough evidence to hold

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.990
him.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.830
Davis recommends planting evidence on Conner
and reminds him that Powered individuals can

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.100
be dangerous.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.759
Park walks away, appalled at Davis' suggestion.

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:46.930
After getting out of the station, Garrett
picks Connor up on the street.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.810
Conner swears that he didn't say anything
to the police and tells Garret to take him

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.569
to Sutcliffe because he has an idea for a
job.

00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:55.769
When they arrive at the garage, Sutcliffe
reads Connor's mind and learns that he didn't

00:09:55.769 --> 00:09:57.170
reveal anything.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.889
After hearing Connor's idea, Garrett suggests
intercepting the police when they transport

00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:03.720
the 10 million dollars worth of Psyke to the
incineration site.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.779
Connor strikes a deal with Sutcliffe, telling
him to hand over Nia to him when he gets the

00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:07.980
Psyke.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.790
Sutcliffe figures out that Connor will use
Nia to cure his dying mom.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.410
Nia gets upset and leaves the room.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.630
Garrett strikes a deal of his own, asking
Sutcliffe to consider him a partner instead

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.389
of a part of his crew.

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:20.410
Sutcliffe agrees, saying Garrett earned it.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:24.370
As they plan the heist, Connor insists that
no law enforcement should get killed.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.499
Connor approaches Nia and promises to let
her go once she heals his mom.

00:10:27.499 --> 00:10:31.819
Nia snaps at him, telling him that she only
matters to him because she's a healer.

00:10:31.819 --> 00:10:35.060
On the day of the heist, the gang prepares
the roadblocks and watches out for the armored

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.200
van.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.019
Drones follow the van, but they'll have to
fall back once they reach the no-fly zone.

00:10:40.019 --> 00:10:43.620
Upon reaching the area, the driver sees the
roadblock and takes a detour.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.330
Maddy and Freddie follow the van in their
car as Garrett blocks it with a garbage truck.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.040
As the driver yells at him to move his vehicle,
Garrett tries to stall, allowing Connor to

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.279
build up his power to blast the van.

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:56.579
Moments after Garrett gets out of the truck,
Connor finally hits the van with a powerful

00:10:56.579 --> 00:10:58.680
surge, knocking out the Guardians.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.199
Garrett uses his telekinetic powers to keep
the Guardians incapacitated.

00:11:02.199 --> 00:11:04.949
Conner shorts the Guardians circuits near
Garrett while Freddie and Maddy disable the

00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:06.089
remaining robots.

00:11:06.089 --> 00:11:09.990
Maddy burns a hole through the armored van
big enough for Freddy to drop a tear gas inside.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.430
The cops soon exit the vehicle as they choke.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:16.100
After failing to receive any response from
the van, the drone decides to enter the no-fly

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.100
zone.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.230
Maddy takes the cases of Psyke from the guards
and hands them over to Rhino.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.910
The guards beg them to let them go, but Rhino's
men start shooting them.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.790
Rhino shoots Maddy in the back as she turns
to see what happened to the police officers.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.880
Garrett moves Freddie out of the way with
telekinesis to protect him as Rhino, and his

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.570
men shoot at them.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.110
Rhino takes off, leaving two of his men to
deal with Garrett and his crew.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.829
More Guardians arrive at the site, allowing
Garrett, Freddie, and Connor to run while

00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:41.760
Rhino's thugs are distracted.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.819
One of the thugs fires at Garret while the
other engages the Guardians.

00:11:44.819 --> 00:11:48.540
The unflinching robots kill the two thugs
while Garrett and his crew run to safety.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.790
As they flee, Freddie realizes a bullet hits
him, so Garrett carries him to a car.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.029
Rhino arrives at Sutcliffe's bar and shows
him the Psyke.

00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:58.930
Nia asks Sutcliffe where the others are, but
he ignores her question and gives her a vial

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.309
of Psyke.

00:12:00.309 --> 00:12:03.079
Sutcliffe hints that he can't let Nia leave
because her father still owes him a lot of

00:12:03.079 --> 00:12:04.220
money.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.370
Upon learning that Freddie had died, Connor
blames Garrett for the disastrous outcome

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:08.370
of the heist.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.480
He argues that Sutcliffe betrayed them because
of Garrett's demands.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.240
At the police station, Davis informs the police
chief that Connor is one of the main suspects

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.240
at the heist.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.639
Park, however, insists that Connor is just
a pawn because he is not the type to kill

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:21.449
police officers.

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:24.180
Connor visits his mom at the hospital and
promises her that he'll find a way to get

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.199
treatment for her.

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:28.759
Mary, however, asks him to stop what he's
doing and just let her go.

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:33.680
Meanwhile, Park visits his ex-wife's house
to spend time with his daughter Lina.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.540
She tells him that other kids are afraid of
her because she has been using her abilities

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.260
to move objects around.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.660
As they walk along the Park, Lina expresses
her fears that her parents will give her away

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.690
because she heard from the news that's what
happens to kids like her.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:48.890
As Park tries to comfort her, Travis approaches
him to give him a message from Connor.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.870
Park meets with Connor at a diner to find
out what he wants, but he insists that it's

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.510
too late for a deal.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.509
Connor assures him that he'll turn himself
into the authorities, but he wants to help

00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:58.459
them catch Sutcliffe first.

00:12:58.459 --> 00:13:01.920
At the police station, the cops prepare to
move out to take in Sutcliffe.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.139
At the bar, Sutcliffe starts coughing erratically,
so he calls Nia over to heal him.

00:13:06.139 --> 00:13:09.560
As Nia treats him, the police shut down the
power and start firing at them.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.410
During the shoot-out, Sutcliffe escapes with
Nia and Rhino through a passageway that leads

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.439
to the garage.

00:13:14.439 --> 00:13:17.959
When they arrive, Garrett shoots at them,
hitting Sutcliffe in the chest.

00:13:17.959 --> 00:13:21.430
Rhino tries to fire back, but Garrett uses
his telekinetic powers to knock the gun out

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.040
of his hand.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.259
Garrett fires multiple bullets into Rhino,
but he still manages to get up and charge

00:13:26.259 --> 00:13:27.279
him.

00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:31.339
Before Rhino could reach him, Garrett uses
his telekinetic ability to slow him down.

00:13:31.339 --> 00:13:33.769
Connor soon arrives to blast Rhino with electricity.

00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:37.589
Meanwhile, Sutcliffe tries to point his gun
at Nia as he asks her to save him.

00:13:37.589 --> 00:13:40.369
Rhino manages to grab Connor and slam him
on the table.

00:13:40.369 --> 00:13:43.569
Connor tries to break free by electrifying
Rhino, but the voltage wasn't strong enough

00:13:43.569 --> 00:13:44.800
to stop him.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.240
As Rhino strangles Connor, Garrett takes a
sharp metal tool and stabs Rhino in the eye.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.519
Connor finishes him off by shooting a jolt
of electricity through his head.

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:56.610
Nia approaches Sutcliffe, but instead of healing
him, she takes his gun.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:00.579
Garrett uses his telekinetic power to strangle
Sutcliffe and take the gun away from Nia.

00:14:00.579 --> 00:14:03.779
Connor tells Nia that she'll be free to go
once she heals his mom.

00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:06.730
Garrett gives Connor Sutcliffe's gun, advising
him to take what he needs.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:11.059
Nia, however, shows him the wound on his arm
as a result of healing him days ago.

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:13.720
She tells Connor that she could die if she
treats his mother.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.810
Despite her objection, Connor still takes
Nia to the hospital.

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.410
When they arrive, Nia touches Mary to heal
her, but Connor soon stops her after seeing

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:21.839
that she's struggling.

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:25.860
When Mary wakes up, Connor approaches her
and holds her hand as her life fades.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.899
Park and Davis soon find Sutcliffe's dead
body at the garage.

00:14:28.899 --> 00:14:32.610
Connor arrives at the police station with
Nia to turn himself over to the authorities.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:36.360
He tells her that the truck has a full tank
to take her wherever she needs to go.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.860
Soon after the tragic heist, Lawmakers have
proposed an outright ban on the use of powers

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.680
in Lincoln City due to the murder of four
police officers.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.550
Park and Davis receive an award for bravery
in pursuing criminals in the city.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:50.149
Garrett soon meets with Cumbo, paying him
twice the money that Sutcliffe owed them.

00:14:50.149 --> 00:14:53.709
Connor stops by his mom's grave, saying he
won't be able to visit her for a while.

00:14:53.709 --> 00:14:57.649
Nia pays a visit to her dad in prison, smiling
at him as she looks forward to a new life

00:14:57.649 --> 00:15:07.769
after being freed from Sutcliffe.
