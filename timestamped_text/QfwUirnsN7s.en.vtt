00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.120
Hi, Mystery Recaps here.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.779
Today, I'm going to explain an American drama
thriller film called “The thinning.”

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.160
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.469
Watch out and take care!

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.130
It is 2039, and the Earth has become overpopulated.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.420
The human race is on the verge of dying.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.120
The United Nations declares that all nations
must annually cut their populations by 5%.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.000
Following those orders, the United States
implements a rule called "The Thinning."

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.980
In the thinning, the students must attend
a standardized test every year.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.450
In the test, whoever fails is executed by
injecting them with a drug.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.630
The movie starts as Laina Michaels is tutoring
a high school kid named Simon.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.520
Simon seems to have a hard time solving the
equations, so he asks Laina for something.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.520
She takes out a box of lenses, and hands it
to him.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.280
As soon as Simon wears them, he is able to
solve all the math problems.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.920
Elsewhere, we are introduced to Edward Blake
Redding, the son of Texas governor, Dean Redding.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.580
He sneaks out of his house at night and meets
his girlfriend, Ellie Harper, in his car.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.340
Blake starts talking about the test they have
the next day.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.359
Ellie is very nervous about it... but Blake
assures her that she will pass.

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:14.950
Just then, Blake’s father’s guard finds
them, and brings Blake back to Dean’s office.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.389
Dean is disappointed in Blake for sneaking
out the night before such an important test.

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:22.450
He thinks that Ellie is a distraction for
Blake.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.279
The following day, it is the day of the test.

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:27.799
Many students lined up outside the school.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.990
They have to go through an intense security
check before entering.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.479
Blake asks Laina for one of her study lenses...but
she is out of them.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.920
Laina and her friend, Kellan Woods, stand
in the line to get inside.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.560
One of the students had cheats written in
his arms.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.939
When he is caught, he tries to run away.

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.560
The guards capture him.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.880
No one has ever been able to escape the exams
or cheat on it.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.270
Inside the school, Blake and Ellie hug for
the last time...before entering the exam hall,

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.450
and soon, the exam starts.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.899
They have 2 hours to complete the test.

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.759
Everyone starts solving the problems on their
tablets.

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.450
Laina solves all of them without any problem
and is the first to complete it.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.439
Her friend, Kellan, seems to be struggling.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.640
When the exam is over, they immediately get
the results.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.540
The teacher in the class is calling several
names who fail the exam.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.360
Students are anxious...hoping this will be
over soon.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.550
Those who fail are taken by the guards.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.480
They cry, resist the guards, and some even
try to run away.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.830
The guard would beat up those students who
resist.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.160
Luckily, Laina, Kellan, and Blake pass.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.000
However, at the last moment, Blake’s girlfriend,
Ellie, is called by the teacher, so the guards

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.420
take her away.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.440
He quickly calls his father, and asks him
to help Ellie.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.740
However, his father doesn’t agree... saying
that the law is the same for everyone.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.060
Frustrated, he runs to save her himself.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.832
He attacks the guards and asks Ellie to run
away...but to no avail.

00:02:49.832 --> 00:02:51.670
No one would be able to escape.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.670
Blake keeps trying to help Ellie, but there
is nothing else he could do.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.360
It is now a year later, and 24 hours before
the thinning test starts.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.200
It is Laina’s little sister Corrine’s
very first thinning test.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.810
The doorbell rings.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.990
It is Laina’s teacher, Ms. Birch, who has
been taking care of Laina and Corrine like

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.570
her own children since their mother's death.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.430
She tries to calm Laina down...because tomorrow
is Corrine's first test and Laina worries

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.170
about her sister; but she assures them that
everything will be fine.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.250
Meanwhile, Blake records a video in his room.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.620
He intends to write all wrong answers in the
test to teach his father a lesson.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.290
Cut to the day of the test...

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.570
Laina drops Corrine to her kindergarten.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.473
In Corrine's class, they are presented with
a video animation...showing the current state

00:03:34.473 --> 00:03:39.490
of the Earth, so all nations must annually
cut their populations by 5%.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.610
Some countries implemented rules like allowing
couples to have only one child.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.630
While others executed the older generation.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.660
In America, however, the government decided
to keep only the smartest ones and execute

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.090
the others
These children are no exception.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.260
The children’s test then starts.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.620
Their teacher is saddened because some of
the children are going to be executed.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.130
Thankfully, Corrine passes the test.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.200
Laina and Kellan enter the school for their
test as well.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.820
The test starts and finishes in no time.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.670
Meanwhile, governor Dean finds Blakes’s
recording and is agitated.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.079
He calls the test manager, Mason King, and
orders him to pass Blake regardless of his

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.289
score
Mason switches his score with Laina, making

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:21.629
Laina fail.

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:26.310
The test results are in..but to everyone’s
surprise, Laina’s name is called too.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.020
She has failed the test.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.060
Ms Birch stops the guard as they take her....claiming
that she is her best student and there must

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.960
be something wrong with the system.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.300
However, the results are final and cannot
be changed.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.810
She hands Laina a keycard so she can unlock
the doors and escape.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.080
Blake is surprised to not have failed.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.480
The students who pass, arrive at a school
party to celebrate their results.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.699
Elsewhere, Dean is giving a speech as the
governor...to declare his presidency for the

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.800
president of the United States.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.879
He boasts about their education system.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:01.309
As a result of their system, they manage to
be the best in education among 196 countries;

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:04.099
the crime rate is decreasing by 26%.

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.120
Blake listens to his father’s speech while
at the party...then sneaks out of it.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.969
He sneaks into the hallway and beats one of
the guards.

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:13.169
He then goes into the control room.

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.559
Meanwhile, Laina and the students who have
failed...are taken into a room and put against

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:20.279
a wall
They are forced to remove all of their clothing

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:21.610
for decontamination.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.800
Then, Laina and the others are taken to a
room where the guards are about to execute

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.449
them by lethal injection.

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.210
Suddenly, Blake cuts the electricity off...making
the whole school go dark.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.449
Taking this chance, the students who are about
to be executed, free themselves and try to

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:37.719
run away.

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:40.430
But none of them succeeds, except for Laina.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.530
She uses the keycard her teacher had given
her, and gets out of the room.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.050
Soon after, Mason comes to the room and asks
for a head count.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.699
They find out that Laina is missing ,and start
looking for her.

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.620
Blake finds Lana and helps her fighting one
of the guards.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.090
While talking, they realize that something
was done to Blake and Laina’s results.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.081
They both enter into a vent and hide; they
follow the network cables to go to the server

00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:05.630
room where they can look at the results through
the computer.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.490
Meanwhile, the school is still in complete
lockdown due to the power failure.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.979
The news gets outside and is being broadcasted
all over the state.

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.599
The parents outside are getting concerned.

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:19.069
Governor Dean calls Mason to ask him about
the situation.

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:24.969
Meanwhile, the vents below Blake breaks, making
him fall into the swimming pool below.

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:26.680
Laina jumps after him.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.699
She brings him out of the water, but he is
not breathing.

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.180
Laina gives him CPR and somehow manages to
save him.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.819
Blake and Laina change to some clothes they
find in the pool’s lockers.

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:40.740
They then continue to go through the vents
and reach the server room, but a guard stands

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.940
in front of the door.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.409
Moreover, Laina’s keycard falls down the
vent in front of the guard.

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:49.499
He doesn’t notice the card but now she has
to get it back somehow.

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:53.349
Her plan is to go to the science lab and join
a string with a magnet to fish the key through

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:57.029
the vent, so they head down to the lab to
retrieve the equipment needed.

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:01.650
However, in the lab, they make a slight noise
causing the guard to approach the lab.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.669
They quickly try to escape; Laina manages
to get back to the vents but Blake is stuck

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:07.259
hiding in the lab.

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:09.560
Laina moves through it to fish the keys.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.360
She successfully manages to get it up halfway,
when suddenly...a guard catches it.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.389
But it turns out that it is Blake disguising
as the guard.

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:19.860
He had beaten the guard and put his clothes
on.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:24.199
Shortly, the guard the two of them had attacked
earlier tells Mason about them.

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:26.439
He reveals that Laina had a keycard with her.

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:31.409
Mason gathers all the teachers together...suspecting
that someone has given it to their students.

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:35.340
When Ms Birch is in the room with other teachers,
she flirts with another teacher and manages

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.110
to take his key card.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.999
Mason continues checking the teachers for
their keycards and ID cards.

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:43.930
Birch saves herself by showing them the card.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.399
Since the other teacher doesn’t have his,
Mason threatens him to tell them where Laina

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:48.399
is.

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:51.960
However, he insists he doesn’t know anything
as Mason beats him.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.340
Laina finally gets to the Server room.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.990
She opens the computer using the key card
but Mason has it protected with a password.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.819
She then texts Kellan who is good at hacking
to provide her with the access.

00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:05.729
After some time, Kellan receives Laina’s
text.

00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:08.369
He helps her to get through Mason’s computer.

00:08:08.369 --> 00:08:13.289
Laina then searches for her results and finds
out she got 98% but still failed, while Blake

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:15.550
got 15% and passed.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.970
She does more research and finds out...that
Ellie too had gotten 88% and failed, while

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.349
others who had less marks than her passed.

00:08:22.349 --> 00:08:25.999
Laina realizes that the grading system is
rigged, and the governor has been failing

00:08:25.999 --> 00:08:28.119
whoever he wishes to.

00:08:28.119 --> 00:08:31.039
Laina sends a file with the rigged grades
to Kellan.

00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:35.690
But soon, the power is back on, and Mason
sees that she is in the server room.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.890
Laina realizes this and runs out.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.630
However, Mason catches her almost immediately.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.270
Blake, on the other hand, is still in disguise.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.400
He is with the students who have failed...

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.290
He orders the guard to take them to the recreational
hall with the other students.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.090
But the guard refuses, so they get into a
fight.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.770
The guards restrain him and find out his identity.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:00.210
Just then, Kellan receives Laina’s message
and is surprised to see the rigged results.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.630
Kellan is friends with a news anchor, so he
quickly emails it to the news channel.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:09.210
The reports broadcast the news showing the
receipts of the altercation in the results.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.630
After the photos are leaked, the governor
is called by his party head who threatens

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.200
to take his presidential candidacy back.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.690
Unwilling to let that happen, Dean Redding
throws all the accusations at Mason, and pretends

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.120
that he is innocent.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.890
He tries to prove this, so he has no choice
but to execute all of those who actually failed,

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.320
including his own son, Blake.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.490
At the school, Mason and the guards take Laina
to the thinning room to execute her and the

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.780
others
Blake is there too.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.700
Mason calls Dean to ask him if they should
proceed to execute the students.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.550
But Dean tells him to stop.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:45.440
He wants the students who have actually failed
to be executed, including his own son.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.350
The guards free Laina and other students who
have actually passed the test.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.080
Laina kisses Blake, but the guards take him
and the rest who have failed.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.060
They execute them by injecting them with a
drug.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:01.260
As the lockdown ends, Laina is reunited with
her younger sister, Corrine, and Ms. Birch.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.840
Cut to a few hours later, we see the bodies
of the executed students being taken underground

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.180
in an elevator.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.010
The students start to move...revealing that
the drug they were injected to be a sleeping

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.930
drug
They stop when they reach a factory-like place.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:18.850
It is filled with goods being produced by
the tech company Assuru Global.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.810
Many people work in the factory.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:25.890
Just then, Blake is surprised to notice that
one of them is actually Ellie, his girlfriend.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:30.020
This indicates that the students who are supposed
to be executed are actually brought underground

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.500
to work as slaves for a multi-million company.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.860
This was all planned by the government as
a strategy to get free labour.
