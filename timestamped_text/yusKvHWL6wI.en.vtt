from the wall ben uses carter's condoms as a chain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.040
and manages to grab the keys until augie shows&nbsp;
up and accidentally kicks them into a drainpipe&nbsp;&nbsp;

for the party so they can save kendall however&nbsp;
jeff gave carter the address to a sewage plant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.280
because it's full of [ __ ] augie tells carter now&nbsp;
he knows what it's like to be screwed over carter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.400

are too many zombies on the trampoline&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.120
and too many in the room ben prepares to jump&nbsp;
but nearly slips until he grabs hold of something&nbsp;&nbsp;

the scouts because they were afraid everyone&nbsp;
