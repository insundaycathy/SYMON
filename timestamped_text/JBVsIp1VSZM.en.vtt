00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.440
Welcome back to Movie Recapped.&nbsp;
Today I will show you a drama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.520
fantasy, horror film from 2016, titled A Cure for&nbsp;
Wellness. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.800
We find our protagonist, Lockhart, working&nbsp;
on his laptop on a train in Europe. He has a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.640
letter with him that he picks up to review its&nbsp;
contents. The letter comes from his company's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.240
CEO Roland Pembroke and is informing the&nbsp;
board of directors that he won't be coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.080
back because he's found "the truth" and "the&nbsp;
cure". While Lockhart rereads the letter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.800
he starts remembering how all this started.
A couple of days ago, in his New York office,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.360
a recently promoted Lockhart is summoned by the&nbsp;
board of directors. Once in their office, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.760
show him this letter, which makes everyone think&nbsp;
Pembroke has lost his mind during his holiday.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.760
The board is worried about the incoming merge,&nbsp;
needing Pembroke for legal matters - so they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.440
send Lockhart to retrieve him from that&nbsp;
sanatorium, a mission he can't refuse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.280
because he's threatened with jail thanks to some&nbsp;
irregularities found on his business transactions.&nbsp;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.720
Back in the present, Lockhart's train makes it to&nbsp;
its destination: a station near the Swiss Alps.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.320
He's picked up by a driver that works for&nbsp;
the sanatorium and points out Lockhart is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.160
younger than the usual clients - they're usually&nbsp;
elderly and rich, and they never want to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.240
When the driver asks Lockhart about&nbsp;
his family, we get another flashback:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.000
before getting his promotion, Lockhart&nbsp;
visited his mother at the retirement home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.800
where she was painting ballerina&nbsp;
dolls, and she gifted him one.&nbsp;

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.080
That ballerina is with him in the present, still&nbsp;
in the car. They pass through the local village,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.000
where they aren't well-received: the locals&nbsp;
have never liked the people from the mountain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.920
The driver tells him some history of the place&nbsp;
then: the foundations date back to the time of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.240
barons, these lands have always belonged to&nbsp;
the von Reichmerl family. The last baron was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.000
so obsessed with the purity of his lineage that&nbsp;
he decided only his sister was good enough to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.320
carry his child. When the church protested,&nbsp;
he renounced God and on the wedding night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.240
the villagers went up to the castle, dragged the&nbsp;
couple to the catacombs and made the baron watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.800
how they burned his sister alive. They burned the&nbsp;
whole place afterward, this was 200 years ago.&nbsp;

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.320
They make it to the residence soon after. As soon&nbsp;
as he gets inside, Lockhart asks the receptionist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.040
to see Pembroke, but she points out that visiting&nbsp;
hours are over. Since she won't make an exception&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.360
for him, he asks to see the manager before going&nbsp;
outside to make a phone call while waiting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.680
A trio of elderly patients that include Victoria&nbsp;
Watkins points out there's no signal up there as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.400
part of the treatment, but Lockhart keeps trying&nbsp;
anyway. Another old man asks him to pass him the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.320
ball he just threw and when Lockhart crouches&nbsp;
to grab it, he hears some weird noises coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.720
from a small building in the middle of the garden.
Moments later, he's received by one of the doctors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.720
in his office. While the doctor drinks some&nbsp;
drops from a little blue bottle that he claims&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.360
are vitamins, Lockhart asks for an exception to&nbsp;
be able to see Pembroke again. The doctor also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.200
turns him down as he explains it's part of the&nbsp;
treatment and tells Lockhart a little about it:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.280
the sanatorium is built on top of an ancient&nbsp;
aquifer with unique rejuvenating properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.840
Since Lockhart keeps insisting on the importance&nbsp;
of his visit, the doctor tells him to come after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.000
seven, when the treatments are over. Lockhart&nbsp;
drinks a glass of water before leaving.&nbsp;

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.440
The driver is waiting for him outside. As he&nbsp;
enters the car, Lockhart asks him to take him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.160
to a hotel so he can make a call. On their way&nbsp;
out, they see a mysterious girl standing on one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.840
of the walls of the building. They've barely&nbsp;
made it to the road when a moose comes out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.840
nowhere and hits the car, making it roll off the&nbsp;
road and knocking out Lockhart and the driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.960
We go through a series of visions then, including&nbsp;
a fire, the girl from the wall, the ballerina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.440
dolls, eels, blue bottles, and Lockhart's mother&nbsp;
passing away alone in the retirement home.&nbsp;

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.240
Sometime later, Lockhart wakes up in a bed&nbsp;
at the sanitarium where he finally meets the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.440
doctor in charge, Heinreich Volme. After he tells&nbsp;
Lockhart he's been there for three days, Lockhart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.840
takes the sheets off him only to find his leg&nbsp;
in a cast. Volmer tells him he's already called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.160
Lockhart's bosses to tell them about the accident,&nbsp;
and they said Lockhart's health is more important,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.080
which sounds very unlike them. He also tells&nbsp;
him that since they're on high altitudes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.760
he should drink plenty of water. Now&nbsp;
Lockhart is stuck there until he recovers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.240
When he drinks his glass of water, he can't&nbsp;
help noticing a tiny worm-like creature in it.&nbsp;

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.400
Lockhart leaves his room and explores&nbsp;
the sanitarium in search of Pembroke,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.200
he learns he's in the sauna after lying to a nurse&nbsp;
to get the information. When he gets to the sauna,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.520
Lockhart feels a bit at loss: there seems to be&nbsp;
room after room connected to each other, and at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.240
some point, he can't even find a door, thinking&nbsp;
he's trapped. A noise suddenly alerts him of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.280
door reappearing and when he turns around, he sees&nbsp;
a moose passing by. When he enters that room, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.560
finally finds Pembroke. Lockhart tries to convince&nbsp;
him to return to New York, but Pembroke refuses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.520
saying he's not well, even if he doesn't look like&nbsp;
it. While Lockhart continues to talk business,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.520
Pembroke changes rooms to get into a swimming&nbsp;
pool - after being underwater for a moment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.240
he resurfaces and accepts to&nbsp;
go back to work for a few days.&nbsp;

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.040
Hours later, Lockhart approaches the receptionist&nbsp;
and tells her to call for a car that will take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.960
him to the station. He leaves for the gardens&nbsp;
afterward, and he can't help staring at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.280
small garden building. Victoria notices this and&nbsp;
approaches him to tell him about the history of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.600
the place by showing him a book: that's the former&nbsp;
church where the baron hanged the priest. Lockhart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.840
tells her about the incest situation, which&nbsp;
she didn't know about. After she leaves for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.920
her treatment, Lockhart starts hearing a female&nbsp;
voice singing and decides to follow the sound.&nbsp;

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.120
Near a well behind the building, he finds the&nbsp;
girl he saw on the wall the day he arrived. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.360
he asks her if there's something in the water,&nbsp;
she says there is, but he doesn't see anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.160
The girl explains she is a patient here, much&nbsp;
younger than average because she's a special case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.560
When he says he isn't a patient and he was&nbsp;
just leaving, she mentions nobody ever leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.400
After she notices she's being watched from&nbsp;
a window, the girl leaves, but not without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.040
introducing herself: her name is Hannah.
Lockhart returns to the sanitarium,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.640
but there's nobody at the reception desk&nbsp;
and Pembroke isn't in his room either.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.400
He goes to the dining room next, where&nbsp;
doctors and patients alike are having diner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.600
to confront Volmer. Apparently, Pembroke relapsed&nbsp;
so he can't leave, but Lockhart doesn't buy it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.480
he thinks the doctors are keeping the&nbsp;
patients sick for the sake of the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.160
He starts to threaten with legal action&nbsp;
when suddenly his nose starts bleeding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.880
and his mind gets dizzy before he passes out.
He wakes up in Volmer's office, who is giving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.000
him an examination. After that's done, Lockhart&nbsp;
notices a picture of Hannah on the doctor's desk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.160
Volmer tells him she's a special case because she&nbsp;
went through severe trauma as a child and she has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.800
development problems, she didn't speak until she&nbsp;
was eleven, and that she's like a daughter to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.640
He changes the subject then and tells&nbsp;
Lockhart he ran some tests after the accident,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.120
the results aren't good, he thinks Lockhart&nbsp;
is a very advanced case for such a young age.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.720
So he offers him to go through the purification&nbsp;
treatment while waiting for Pembroke to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.200
better, Lockhart accepts to play along. When&nbsp;
Volmer leaves the office to find a nurse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.680
Lockhart opens a cabinet and steals Pembroke's&nbsp;
file; he also finds another of those blue bottles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.240
When the doctor returns, Lockhart distracts&nbsp;
him by asking about a locket that was hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.400
nearby as he hides the stolen files in his&nbsp;
clothes. Volmer tells him the locket was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.880
found during the rebuilding and used to belong&nbsp;
to the baroness, a very sick woman. It was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.040
baron that found out about the healing properties&nbsp;
of the water when trying to find a cure for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.920
A nurse comes to pick him up to take&nbsp;
him to the isolation chamber then.&nbsp;

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.640
Before the treatment, Lockhart must urinate in a&nbsp;
cup and when he leaves it next to other samples,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.840
he notices the other patient's cups&nbsp;
have something weird floating in them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.280
He's put in a huge metal chamber&nbsp;
afterward, which is filled with water.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.120
He's told not to be surprised if he has some&nbsp;
visions, which is a common side-effect, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.440
that he should knock on the chamber window if he&nbsp;
needs anything. The visions start pretty quickly:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.680
first he sees some memories of his father, but&nbsp;
then he sees Hannah, which makes him open his eyes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.000
and notice the eels that are now with him in the&nbsp;
tank. Panicking, Lockhart knocks on the window to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.880
no avail, since the doctor is busy being intimate&nbsp;
with a nurse and sharing more "vitamin" drops.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.680
Lockhart tries to swim up and open the chamber&nbsp;
door, but it's sealed, so he ends up passing out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.000
After remembering the day his father jumped off&nbsp;
a bridge, Lockhart wakes up and finds himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.160
on the bridge next to the chamber, the doctor&nbsp;
and the nurse next to him. He tells him there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.360
something in the water, but when they look&nbsp;
at it with the torch, there's nothing there.&nbsp;

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.200
Back in his room, he retrieves Pembrose's file&nbsp;
from his hidden spot in his cast. Lockhart doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.600
understand the words, but he does find some x-rays&nbsp;
that tell him Pembrose was losing his teeth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.520
His reading is interrupted by a sound coming&nbsp;
from the bathroom so he goes to investigate:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.560
the toilet lever is shaking. Touching it is enough&nbsp;
to stop it, and now he's near the window, Lockhart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.720
notices something strange: a bald man is taking&nbsp;
a body on a stretcher into the church building.&nbsp;

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.040
The next morning, Lockhart goes to ask&nbsp;
Victoria what the church building is being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.520
used for nowadays. She says she doesn't&nbsp;
know, but she's found out something else:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.880
the villagers didn't burn the sanitarium&nbsp;
down because of the siblings' marriage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.440
they did it because of the experiments.&nbsp;
Peasants had been disappearing and in 1814,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.000
farmers found their disfigured bodies, similar&nbsp;
to mummies. Before leaving for her treatment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.640
she tells Lockhart that there's a&nbsp;
terrible darkness in this place.&nbsp;

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.880
Lockhart goes to the church building&nbsp;
to try to get in, but it's locked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.040
He sees the bald man from last night and asks&nbsp;
him about it, but he doesn't speak English.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.520
It's then that he sees Hannah passing by on a&nbsp;
bike in the distance, so he follows her. When he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.840
catches up with her, he offers his ballerina doll&nbsp;
in exchange for Hannah giving him a ride to town.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.040
She accepts even if she isn't allowed to.
Once in town, they enter a bar where they get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.680
many weird looks. Lockhart asks for two pints&nbsp;
of beers and the closest thing to a doctor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.320
he's told to go see Pieter. He takes the beer to a&nbsp;
table to share with Hannah and she tells her more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.320
about her life: she's been in the clinic for as&nbsp;
long as she remembers, her mother passed away when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.640
she was a baby, and her father is supposed to come&nbsp;
when she feels better. She's also drinking the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.200
blue bottle vitamins, which she shares with him.&nbsp;
Lockhart tells her to wait for him for a moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.160
while he goes to see Pieter, who is a vet but will&nbsp;
still read Pembrose's files in exchange for money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.640
He informs Lockhart that the people from the spa&nbsp;
are dying from dehydration, which makes no sense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.040
considering all the water they drink. Lockhart&nbsp;
suspects they're experiments like the baron used&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.600
to do, and Pieter tells him the baroness wasn't&nbsp;
sick, she was infertile. After that he goes back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.240
to work, he needs to put a cow that drank black&nbsp;
water out of her misery. When he cuts her stomach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.040
open, a calf and a bunch of eels come out.
Meanwhile, at the bar, one of the locals lends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.840
Hannah a coin so she can choose a song at the&nbsp;
jukebox, which she starts dancing to. Lockhart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.080
returns then and asks the barman for a phone&nbsp;
to call New York. When his boss picks up he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.920
very angry, turns out nobody actually called&nbsp;
the company to tell them about the accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.560
Lockhart drops the phone when he notices a guy&nbsp;
getting too close to Hannah and he tries to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.280
her away to interrogate her about the "vitamins",&nbsp;
making the other guy angry. They get into a fight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.880
and Lockhart is threatened with a knife when&nbsp;
Volmer makes his appearance at the bar, making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.440
everyone back way since they're afraid of him.&nbsp;
After scolding Lockhart for taking Hannah to town,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.680
both of them are taken back to the clinic.
After seeing a vision of Hannah in a tub full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.000
of eels, Lockhart wakes up in his room and once&nbsp;
again, sees the bald man with a stretcher near&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.480
the church building. The bathroom noises happen&nbsp;
again too and when he goes there to stop them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.040
he looks at himself in the mirror to notice a&nbsp;
tooth getting loose, so he easily pulls it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.120
Lockhart runs to see a nurse and he gives&nbsp;
her his tooth to put in milk. While she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.120
doing that, he checks the treatment list to find&nbsp;
Pembrose and leaves before the nurse returns.&nbsp;

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.600
It takes him a lot of walking into the deepest&nbsp;
areas of the sanitarium and avoiding many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.160
doctors to find the transfusion wing. There are&nbsp;
some weird metal chambers, hot to the touch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.880
that confirm some weird experiments are going&nbsp;
on. On a stretcher nearby, she finds Victoria,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.480
who adds more bits to the story: the baroness&nbsp;
was pregnant the night of the wedding,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.960
and the fetus was cut out before they burned her.&nbsp;
The baby was thrown in the aquifer and survived,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.280
but she doesn't know it. When stepping back&nbsp;
from Virginia's creepy touch, Lockhart pushes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.200
some trays to the floor and must leave the&nbsp;
room before the noises alerted the doctors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.200
He makes it to another room and when he turns&nbsp;
on the lights, he finds a terrifying sight:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.880
many bodies floating in water, including Pembrose.&nbsp;
Scared, he runs away, and Volmer finds him - he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.720
pretends to have gotten lost while trying to&nbsp;
find someone to check his tooth. They take him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.800
to see the clinic's dentist, where he's tied&nbsp;
to a chair because they don't use anesthetics.&nbsp;

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.880
The dentist is in the process of drilling one of&nbsp;
Lockhart's good teeth when we cut the sanitarium's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.360
entrance, where a new patient is arriving in&nbsp;
the usual car. The driver is about to take off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.600
when suddenly, a bleeding Lockhart enters the&nbsp;
back seat and asks him to get him out of there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.680
When they reach town, Lockhart goes to see a&nbsp;
police officer and tells him everything that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.720
happened. The cop is skeptical, and asks him for a&nbsp;
way to check his identity - Lockhart gives him his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.720
company's phone number because he doesn't have his&nbsp;
wallet with him. The officer leaves to make the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.040
call and Lockhart notices a blue bottle on the&nbsp;
shelves. He doesn't have time to react because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.680
when the cop returns, Volmer is with him and says&nbsp;
Lockhart has been hallucinating. To prove it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.600
he makes Pembrose come in, who says Lockhart&nbsp;
was going to take him way away against his will.&nbsp;

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.320
Lockhart is taken back to the sanitarium,&nbsp;
where he's going through all the treatments.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.720
He starts writing a letter very similar to the one&nbsp;
Pembrose had written, and when he reaches the part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.360
of finding out the truth, he has a realization.&nbsp;
He grabs the glass from his desk and breaks it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.280
and with a shard, he cuts his cast open: turns&nbsp;
out his leg had been fine the whole time.&nbsp;

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.160
Determined to get to the bottom of this, Lockhart&nbsp;
leaves for the church building, which he forces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.880
open with a shovel. Inside he finds a huge&nbsp;
laboratory with eel drawings, baby fetuses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.160
in jars and faces floating on dishes. There's also&nbsp;
a portrait of the baroness surrounded by candles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.000
He moves deeper into the cave and finds the bald&nbsp;
man throwing bodies into the river for the eels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.400
to eat. At the same time in the main building,&nbsp;
Hannah gets into a swimming pool and is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.720
approached by eels, who at first swim closer but&nbsp;
suddenly form a circle around her as she starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:37.680
bleeding between her legs. Back in the cave,&nbsp;
the bald man notices Lockhart and attacks him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.760
but after some struggling, Lockhart manages to&nbsp;
shake him off and ends him with a hit to the head.&nbsp;

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.400
Both Hannah and Lockhart run away from their&nbsp;
locations and meet in the clinic hallways,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.440
but Hannah pushes him away to go&nbsp;
find Volmer in the dining room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.880
Lockhart follows her inside and starts&nbsp;
telling everyone that the doctor is making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.960
them sick on purpose so they should stand&nbsp;
up against him. The patients start doing so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.240
but they're in a zombie-like state, so&nbsp;
they surround Lockhart and capture him.&nbsp;

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.520
Later on, Lockhart's taken to the transfusion&nbsp;
wing. While Volmer connects puts him in one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.920
special chambers, he explains how the experiments&nbsp;
work: the water from the aquifer is toxic to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.320
humans, but with life-restoring properties for&nbsp;
the eels. The baron discovered how to distill the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.880
water to create an elixir apt for humans and they&nbsp;
use patients for it. They're put in the chambers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.080
forced eels down their throats, and the&nbsp;
filtered watered leaves their bodies into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.560
those little blue bottles. Volmer puts Lockhart&nbsp;
through that exact procedure before leaving.&nbsp;

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.280
The next day, Hannah is told by Volmer&nbsp;
that she's a woman now and she's ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.920
Before joining the doctor for the next step, she&nbsp;
visits Lockhart, who looks completely brainwashed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.920
and says he doesn't want to leave. Hannah gifts&nbsp;
him back the doll before leaving to get ready.&nbsp;

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.040
Later at night, Volmer together with doctors and&nbsp;
nurses all dress up rather fancily for a special&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.880
occasion: Volmer gets married to Hannah, putting&nbsp;
the baroness' locket around her neck during the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.680
ceremony. They celebrate with a dance, and while&nbsp;
the other doctors stay at the party, Volmer takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.440
Hannah to the underground cave, where he shows&nbsp;
her the baroness' portrait and a hidden bed as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.160
he tells her this is where all began for her.
Back in his room, Lockhart snaps out of it thanks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.760
to the doll and starts looking more closely at&nbsp;
the pictures of the rebuilding of the clinic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.080
After re-checking Victoria's notes and taking&nbsp;
a second look at the photograph in the doctor's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.400
office, he comes to a realization: Volmer&nbsp;
IS Baron von Reichmerl, and Hannah is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:19.280
fetus the villagers cut off the baroness. They've&nbsp;
stayed young and alive thanks to the eel water.&nbsp;

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.200
We cut back to the cave then, where Volmer is&nbsp;
telling Hannah that story while tying her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.520
a bed and touching her against her will. When&nbsp;
he's about to possess her, Lockhart interrupts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.920
them by dropping an oil can on the floor. When&nbsp;
he's confronted with the truth, Volmer tears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.680
off the skin of his face to reveal the burns&nbsp;
under it before pushing Lockhart to the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.800
Lockhart wastes no time and turns on a lighter&nbsp;
that he drops on the oil, catching Volmer on fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.960
The fire spreads to the main building through&nbsp;
the ventilation shaft while Lockhart tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.880
rescue Hannah, but Volmer -who managed to turn&nbsp;
off the flames on his body- grabs him and throws&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.120
him against some shelves. They take the fight&nbsp;
downstairs and Volmer grabs Lockhart again by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.840
the neck. He's about to throw him to the eels when&nbsp;
Hannah, who managed to free herself from the bed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.320
shows up behind him, distracts him by calling&nbsp;
him "dad" then finishes him off with a shovel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.080
Volmer falls into the water and becomes eel&nbsp;
food, Hannah throws the locket after him.&nbsp;

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.280
They run outside and find the main building on&nbsp;
fire. Doctors and nurses are screaming and running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.800
away or trying to help put off the flames,&nbsp;
but the patients are dancing in the garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.600
Lockhart stares at the craziness of it at all but&nbsp;
is brought back to reality by Hannah, who's found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.000
her bicycle. They leave the place together on the&nbsp;
bike, and halfway through the road, a car hits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.080
them: the people driving are Lockhart's company's&nbsp;
board of directors, who have come to check on him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.800
and Pembrose after not getting any news for days.&nbsp;
After telling them Pembrose is gone, Lockhart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.600
refuses to get in the car. The directors ask him&nbsp;
if he's lost his mind, and he replies he actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.280
feels much better before driving away with&nbsp;
Hannah on the bike and a big smile on his face.
