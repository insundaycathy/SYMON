00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.160
Welcome back to Movie Recapped. Today&nbsp;
I will show you an action, drama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.600
horror film from 2016, titled The Thinning.&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.400
In the near future, the U.N. requires countries&nbsp;
to cut their population by 5% every year in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.520
order to combat overpopulation. America gives&nbsp;
its students a standardized test every year,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.360
and executes the students with the lowest scores.&nbsp;
The test is called the 10-241 or The Thinning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.760
In Austin Texas, students prepare for the&nbsp;
Thinning, which takes place in 18 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.440
Simon and his older sister, Laina, sit at a&nbsp;
desk in his room as Laina tries to mentor him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.720
Their younger siblings, Corrine and&nbsp;
Joey sit on the bed playing games.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.520
Even with Laina’s help, Simon gets frustrated&nbsp;
and says he can’t learn enough before the test.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.160
He asks Laina for something and gives her money&nbsp;
in exchange for a contact lens that he can use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.800
to cheat. When he tries it on, it displays the&nbsp;
answers to the math problems in his notebook.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.080
She reminds him that he has to destroy it after&nbsp;
the test. Laina then receives a call from Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.160
Perkash, who tells her that her mom had been&nbsp;
trying to get discharged from the hospital against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.640
medical advice. She asks the doctor to stall her&nbsp;
mom and tells her siblings that they have to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.160
At the hospital, Laina intercepts her mom signing&nbsp;
herself out. The doctor pulls Laina aside and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.320
reveals that her mom is only getting worse. Even&nbsp;
though they can’t treat her if she goes home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.480
he explains that making her comfortable might be&nbsp;
the most they can do for her. At the Governor’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.680
mansion, just 12 hours until the Thinning, Blake&nbsp;
passes a few bodyguards in the hallway. He offers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.400
to get them something from the kitchen, but they&nbsp;
decline. Instead, Blake sneaks out of the house to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.440
his car where he finds his girlfriend, Ellie. She&nbsp;
startles him, and jokes that the same trick always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.080
works on him. When Blake insists that this time&nbsp;
would be the last, they sober, remembering the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.040
next day’s test. Ellie refuses to talk about it&nbsp;
and instead decides to show him something that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.840
insists is secret. She leads him to the Bilski’s&nbsp;
mansion, where they strip and swim in the pool.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.160
Afterwards, they kiss in the car until Ellie&nbsp;
admits that she’s scared about the test.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.920
Then Vince, one of the bodyguards, catches them&nbsp;
and brings Blake back to his dad. Blake’s dad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.160
Governor Redding, lectures his son and tells him&nbsp;
that while it’s okay to have fun, that he has to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.720
pick better moments. He insists that Ellie is a&nbsp;
distraction that Blake can’t afford until he gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.440
through tomorrow’s test, and his final test next&nbsp;
year. After that, Blake can be distracted for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.720
rest of his life. Governor Redding gives Blake a&nbsp;
hug before he leaves the room. Three hours before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.960
the Thinning, guards patrol a militaristic&nbsp;
school surrounded in chain-link fences,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.040
barbed wire, and cameras. Students approach the&nbsp;
facility, watched by guards in black masks. Simon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.160
bumps into another student, drops his contact&nbsp;
lens, and is unable to find it. The guard orders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.200
him to keep moving. Blake approaches Laina as she&nbsp;
watches students saying goodbye to their parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.240
He asks for a study guide but she explains that&nbsp;
she gave the last one away. Kellan, her friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.120
asks about Blake, but she insists that she barely&nbsp;
knows him. The guards check students for cheating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.920
devices, and when one guilty student is discovered&nbsp;
they chase him down and catch him with a net.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.920
Kellan uses his dad’s security access to&nbsp;
view the security footage and sends it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.480
a reporter he claims to know, named Wendy&nbsp;
Banks. He explains that he has her email,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.200
though she doesn’t seem to respond to his tips.&nbsp;
Inside the school, Blake tries to comfort Ellie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.640
Fifteen minutes before the test begins, the guards&nbsp;
lock down the school. The students gather in their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.280
classrooms and teachers review the rules. Miss&nbsp;
Birch tells her students that she’s proud of them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.360
and that the questions are tough but not meant to&nbsp;
trick them. She also insists that there’s always a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.800
chance. A second teacher, Mr. Glass also goes over&nbsp;
the rules and reminds the students that the test&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.440
is an accurate aptitude assessment. He then orders&nbsp;
them to begin and the lights in the classroom dim.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.320
Each student picks up a tablet and begins to take&nbsp;
the test with the tablets lighting up their faces.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.000
The teachers warn the students when they have a&nbsp;
minute remaining, then announce the end of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.680
test. As the students wait for their results, some&nbsp;
show signs of stress. They squirm in their seats,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.240
cry, or look uncomfortable. Kellan is&nbsp;
amongst them. Eventually, names of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.440
students who failed are read out. With each name&nbsp;
called, a student is removed. Some cooperate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.480
some beg, others require force. Kellan is&nbsp;
relieved that he passed, but Ellie fails.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.000
The remaining students are congratulated&nbsp;
for passing and released to the rec room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.800
Laina sees Simon being led away with the failed&nbsp;
students and Blake calls his dad to beg for him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.000
do something to save Ellie. But, his dad insists&nbsp;
that he has to obey the law. Blake gets angry and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.120
slams the locker. He runs after them and attacks&nbsp;
a guard with a fire extinguisher. He tells Ellie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.840
to run as the guards are distracted, but she is&nbsp;
stopped by the crowd and caught. One year later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.880
the next test is 24 hours away. Laina sits at&nbsp;
a table with her two younger siblings, they’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.640
surrounded by boxes and one holds a pamphlet&nbsp;
that shows that her mother has passed away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.360
Miss Birch visits to bring the family some extra&nbsp;
casserole and tries to comfort Laina about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.240
fact that Corrine would be taking her first&nbsp;
test. Meanwhile, Blake works out in his room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.120
He still has a picture of Ellie pinned to his&nbsp;
wall. He begins to record a video on a tablet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.760
saying that if someone was watching it, he would&nbsp;
already be dead. Three hours before the test,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.400
Laina quizzes Corrine as they approach the school&nbsp;
and hugs her before sending her inside. Governor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.040
Redding discusses plans for an announcement with&nbsp;
Vince, checking that everything is ready. Then, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.520
checks in with Blake. He tries to convince Blake&nbsp;
that nothing could be done about Ellie, but Blake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.400
dismisses him. Blake leaves for school and Vince&nbsp;
sees him put a package in a mailbox along the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.280
Laina and Kellan meet up at the school and talk&nbsp;
about the fact that this is their last test.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.840
Kellan admits that he is nervous but recognizes&nbsp;
that Laina probably isn’t because of how smart she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.160
is. Instead, she’s more nervous about Corrine than&nbsp;
herself. On the way inside, Kellan runs into Wade,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.720
a quarterback that goes on to bully another kid.&nbsp;
They wonder if he’s actually smart enough to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.600
survived this long. Fifteen minutes before&nbsp;
the test, the school is locked down again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.000
At the mansion, Vince approaches Governor Redding&nbsp;
about his son and shows him the package Blake had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.240
tried to deliver. Inside is Blake’s tablet&nbsp;
where he recorded a video explaining his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.640
plan to intentionally fail the test. In the&nbsp;
video he explains that if his dad wants to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.360
stand by this system, he’d have to stand by the&nbsp;
system that killed his son. The Governor demands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.000
for his son to be brought home, but the school is&nbsp;
locked down and he throws a chair in frustration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.760
Then he tells the other bodyguard to&nbsp;
leave the room. Back at the facility,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.600
Blake waits to take his test and a dark-haired&nbsp;
girl named Sarah looks at Mr. Glass.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.320
She’d slept with him to try to get a&nbsp;
passing score. He doesn’t meet her gaze.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.640
In a classroom of younger kids, Miss Cole shows&nbsp;
her students a video before their first test.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.080
The video is created by a company called Assuru&nbsp;
Global and consists of a cartoon Earth explaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.960
why the test had been implemented, as a way to&nbsp;
deal with overpopulation. It lists how some other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.120
countries killed their elderly or restricted the&nbsp;
amount of children a couple could have, but that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.680
America only lets the smart kids live there,&nbsp;
allowing it to become the best country again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.080
The video portrays the kids that fail the test&nbsp;
as merely helping the planet to feel better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.000
Miss Cole steps outside to take a minute for&nbsp;
herself, a guard tells her that someone else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.240
can give the test if she’s not up for it,&nbsp;
but she declines the offer. She returns to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.880
the classroom as the kids finish the video and&nbsp;
clap. She directs them to take the exciting test&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.160
they’d been practicing for. The older students&nbsp;
also start the test. From the control room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.360
Mason King watches over them and receives a call,&nbsp;
which he answers. Blake finishes his test early in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.640
the classroom and Mr. Glass notices. Amongst the&nbsp;
smaller kids, Nathan raises his hand for help on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.520
a question but Miss Cole isn’t allowed to help him&nbsp;
so she tells him to do his best. Once the test is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.080
finished, Miss Cole tells the students to stand&nbsp;
up and follow the leader if their name is called.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.320
The teachers read out the names of the&nbsp;
failed students. Among them are Nathan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.520
Sarah, and Laina, but not Blake. Mason calls the&nbsp;
Mayor to confirm that the transfer was successful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.320
and that Blake is safe. The mayor then approves&nbsp;
the commencement of the Thinning. Blake watches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.960
as the failed kids are sent down the hall. Miss&nbsp;
Birch runs to intercept a guard and insists that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.120
Laina is the best student she’s had and that&nbsp;
she can’t believe that Laina could’ve failed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.120
The guard checks with his superiors, but they&nbsp;
insist that there’s no problem and he’s told to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.320
send Laina off. The teacher holds onto Laina for a&nbsp;
moment and slips her a keycard, reminding her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.120
there’s always a chance and telling her to get&nbsp;
away. In the rec room, students are congratulated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.320
for making it. They eat and dance to music.&nbsp;
Miss Birch spots Mr. Glass flirting with another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.360
dark-haired student. Elsewhere, Governor Redding&nbsp;
takes steps on stage for a big announcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.280
He starts by talking about all the ways he’s&nbsp;
improved things during his time as Governor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.680
He talks about the difficult but necessary&nbsp;
decisions that had to be made. At the school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.960
his speech plays on a TV at the party. Blake&nbsp;
sees it and leaves. As the Governor continues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.440
to discuss how the Thinning is not a barbaric&nbsp;
practice, but is instead leading in innovation and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.600
an effort to make the population the best it can&nbsp;
be, the failed kids are being led down a hallway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.640
They are instructed to take off their clothes&nbsp;
and to prepare for decontamination. Laina slips&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.960
the keycard into her mouth to hide it. As Blake&nbsp;
begins to make his way through the hallways of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:42.000
the school, his dad announces his candidacy for&nbsp;
president. The failed kids are given new clothes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.800
then led to a room with a few rows of chairs. They&nbsp;
are each cuffed to a chair and the surrounding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.320
guards draw syringes. Some of the kids begin to&nbsp;
panic. In the hallway, Blake acts hurt to lure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.880
a guard towards him then knocks him out. Then,&nbsp;
he makes his way to the control room and sneaks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.160
inside after Mason leaves it. He tries to use the&nbsp;
computer but it requires a login, so instead he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.920
shuts off the power to the school right as&nbsp;
Mason has discovered the unconscious guard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.480
Some of the failed kids are freed from their&nbsp;
restraints and the guards try to regain control.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.480
Laina escapes during the chaos, opening&nbsp;
the door with Miss Birch’s keycard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.680
Mason calls for Kellan’s dad, Victor Wood, to be&nbsp;
sent to the control room to fix the downed system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.920
The guards fetch him from the party, insisting&nbsp;
that it is just a minor power outage to the rest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.480
of the guests. Mason then checks on the failed&nbsp;
kids, who are back under the guards’ control.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.000
He asks if they’d done a headcount, and discovers&nbsp;
they hadn’t. They discover that Laina is missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.160
A guard notices Laina trying to get out a&nbsp;
door, but she introduces herself as Miss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.080
Birch and tells him that she’d called him when&nbsp;
she’d seen a student run down the stairwell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.880
Once he turns his back to her, she attacks. Blake&nbsp;
shows up and the two of them take the guard down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.160
Laina and Blake talk and Laina insists that she&nbsp;
couldn’t have failed the test. Blake amidst that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.640
he failed on purpose, but that his dad got him&nbsp;
out. Laina realizes that something is off and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.680
when Blake sets off an alarm they climb into a&nbsp;
vent to escape. Mason decides that the school will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.240
stay in lockdown until the situation is resolved,&nbsp;
even as they surpass the time where parents were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.640
expecting to see their children. He hears about&nbsp;
another guard who’d been attacked by someone who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.400
claimed to be a teacher, so he calls for all&nbsp;
the teachers to be brought to a holding room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.960
Laina and Blake talk about Laina selling&nbsp;
cheats to desperate kids for the test.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.960
Blake judges her for taking advantage of them&nbsp;
until she reveals that it was a desperate attempt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:28.080
to pay for her mom’s treatments, which still&nbsp;
wasn’t enough. Blake apologizes for judging her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.160
They start heading towards the server room&nbsp;
through the vents. Governor Redding’s interview is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.640
interrupted by news of the prolonged shutdown at&nbsp;
the school and the news anchor asks him about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.800
The governor stumbles without any information,&nbsp;
but insists that things will be resolved soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.320
Mason addresses the teachers and tells them to&nbsp;
present their IDs and keycards. The governor calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.960
him to get details about the situation and angrily&nbsp;
tells them to figure it out quickly. Blake and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.920
Laina continue through the vents until Blake falls&nbsp;
through one and into a pool below. Laina jumps in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.840
after him to save him and gets him to the edge&nbsp;
of the pool where she resuscitates him with CPR.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.960
They get dry clothes from the lockers and change,&nbsp;
turning their backs to each other for privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.000
Laina finds another vent and they climb back in.&nbsp;
In the rec room, the students who passed begin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.320
to get impatient with the guards and one of the&nbsp;
guards beats up a student. Kellan records it on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.640
his phone and sends it to Wendy. Laina and&nbsp;
Blake reach the outside of the server room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.440
but the keycard falls out of Laina’s pocket. With&nbsp;
the keycard on the ground below the vent, they get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.000
to a science classroom where Laina gets a magnet&nbsp;
to fish for the key. They make too much noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.880
and as a guard approaches, Laina is able to get&nbsp;
back into the vent while Blake stays in the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.440
He tries to hide, but the guard catches&nbsp;
him. When Laina tries fishing for the key,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.640
a guard notices and grabs it. But the guard turns&nbsp;
out to be Blake in a guard’s uniform. He tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.200
her that he’ll head towards the Thinning. In the&nbsp;
holding room, Miss Birch suggest to Mr. Glass that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.000
they get a drink together and as they flirt she&nbsp;
steals his keycard. Miss Birch then shows Mason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.520
her ID and Mr. Glass’s keycard to take suspicion&nbsp;
off of herself. When Mr. Glass doesn’t have his,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.320
Mason thinks that he’s the traitor. Laina arrives&nbsp;
in the server room and finds a computer. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.520
tries to use her keycard, but it requires Mason’s&nbsp;
password. She messages Kellan to get his help only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.640
to find out he’s offline. Kellan receives Laina’s&nbsp;
message right as his dad returns the power.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.880
He sends her a video of Mason typing in his&nbsp;
password, allowing her to copy it and get in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.440
She checks Corinne’s test score first and is&nbsp;
relieved to see that she passed with an 86%.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:28.640
Next, she checks hers, to find that she got a 98%&nbsp;
but still failed. Meanwhile, Wade had passed with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:34.480
a 42%, and Blake passed with a 15%. She also&nbsp;
checks Ellie’s score and finds that she failed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.440
but got a score of 88%. She sees news coverage&nbsp;
of Governor Redding claiming that Laina,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:44.000
after failing her test, had attacked several&nbsp;
guards, killing two of them, and escaped.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.720
He places the blame for the shutdown on her.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Wendy sees the video that Kellan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.640
sent of the guard beating up a passing student&nbsp;
and she realises that what is happening doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:58.160
match the official story. She responds to Kellan&nbsp;
and broadcasts the footage. When Laina realises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.680
that Kellan sent out footage from within the&nbsp;
school she sends him images of the score.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:07.040
Then, Mason and Victor spot her on the cameras and&nbsp;
she runs. Blake finds the Thinning and tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.040
trick the guards into bringing the failed students&nbsp;
to the recreation hall, but they won’t accept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.000
orders from anyone besides Mason so he tries&nbsp;
to fight the guards. Laina is caught by Mason,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.680
insisting she has proof that she passed but he&nbsp;
sends her to the Thinning where she finds that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.400
Blake has been subdued. Kellan receives Laina’s&nbsp;
proof of the test scores, both hers and Ellie’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.040
so he sends the images to Wendy. Wendy reports&nbsp;
on the documentation she’d received about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.680
falsified test scores. She reveals that Laina&nbsp;
failed despite having the highest score in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.080
school while Blake, son of the Governor, had&nbsp;
passed despite receiving the lowest score.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.000
At the mansion, Vince insists that Governor&nbsp;
Redding has to shut this down and let Laina go,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.640
but Redding insists there’s one more move. Mason&nbsp;
calls to ask for his approval to commence the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:51.760
thinning, which he denies, saying that the list&nbsp;
needs to be revised. Once changes are made,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.680
Laina is freed and told that she had&nbsp;
passed, she goes to Blake and kisses him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.240
She is then forced from the room and Blake is&nbsp;
forced into her chair. Wade is also taken to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:05.520
thinning. With varying levels of panic from the&nbsp;
kids, the guards approach and inject them. Blake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.320
loses consciousness, and the school is taken out&nbsp;
of lockdown. Laina reunites with her little sister&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:16.160
outside, hugging her with tears in her eyes. She's&nbsp;
also joined by Miss Birch. Kellan hugs his dad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.480
both smiling and relieved. The parents whose&nbsp;
kids don’t return to them begin to mourn as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.560
Wendy reports that Mason King has been taken in&nbsp;
for questioning regarding his involvement with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.880
altered test scores. Wendy’s report continues&nbsp;
that suspicions of Redding’s involvement were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.240
discounted once it was discovered that his&nbsp;
son had been amongst the failed students.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.120
Redding announces that he will help to investigate&nbsp;
the occurrences and continues by using Blake’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.320
failure to appeal to voters that he was just like&nbsp;
them. A large truck approaches a new facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.280
The failed students, including Blake, are lowered&nbsp;
into the building by elevator. They find a factory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.600
that builds the tablets the tests are taken on,&nbsp;
where previous failed students are put to work.
