Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:06.380
Today, I'm going to explain a comedy, horror,
sci-fi film called "The Stepford Wives."

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.660
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.400
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.879
At the E.B.S. affiliate conference, reality
television executive producer Joanna Eberhart

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.020
announces the network's latest reality T.V.
shows that pits men and women against each

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.020
other.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.230
One of the shows features a husband and wife
spending a tropical vacation separately to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.320
challenge their marriage.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.650
It ends with the wife choosing to leave her
husband for her sensual tropical paradise.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.119
Hank, the husband from the show, appears at
the conference, and the audience cheers for

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.410
the disgruntled man.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.180
Heartbroken over his wife leaving him, Hank
blames the reality show for ruining his life.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.960
Gun in hand, he attacks Joanna on stage until
security tackles him down.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.100
After the event, Joanna is unharmed and ecstatic,
strolling back into the office with a beaming

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.100
smile.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.629
However, Joanna was not Hank's only target.

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.750
Before he went to the conference, Hank shot
his wife and her new boyfriends from the reality

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.750
show.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.219
Given the situation, the network's shareholders
and affiliates refuse to be involved with

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:58.989
Joanna and her programs.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.239
The gravity of the situation dawns on Joanna
slowly; her eyes widened and red in tears.

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.870
Not wanting to lose face, she shakes off her
emotions and takes her termination with controlled

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.870
grace.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.290
As she walks down the halls, her facade shrivels.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.800
Hidden behind the elevator doors, Joanna finally
lets out a shriek.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.580
Days later, Joanna's husband, Walter, visits
her in the hospital.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.450
It turns out Joanna has suffered from a nervous
breakdown.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.380
After her episode, Walter quits the network
in protest for how she was treated.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.860
Feeling that her life and mind are falling
apart, Joanna decides to move away to start

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.880
over.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.240
With their children, Pete and Kimberly, they
move to Stepford, a suburb in Connecticut.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.640
The place is a stark contrast from their life
in Manhattan and is full of clean-cut lawns

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.740
and trees.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.330
The family arrives at their new home, welcomed
by the sunny realtor, Mrs. Claire Wellington.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.590
Claire assists a dazed Joanna and the family
into the house, giving them a tour of the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.640
luxurious space and technology.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.320
The house is installed with an electronic
system that secures the house, manages the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.350
supplies, and even checks their health condition.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.310
The house also includes a robot dog that attempts
to climb down the stairs but fails.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.650
During their first night at the house, Walter
watches his wife sleep, worried if their new

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.560
home would do her well.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.060
One morning, Joanna wakes up alone, bewildered
as she walks around the house.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.450
Claire gives Joanna a tour around the suburb,
pointing at the Stepford Men's Association

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.840
where the male residents meet and the Simply
Stepford Day Spa where the female residents

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.730
enjoy quality time for themselves.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.140
Inside, the day spa is disorientingly idyllic,
where the women all wear sundresses and speak

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.570
in near unison.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.760
Claire gathers the women for a workout, to
which Joanna questions how they could do so

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.950
in sundresses.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.140
The ladies whisper at the thought of allowing
their husbands to see them in dark sweat clothes

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.560
as Joana wears.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.550
The women perform exercises based on household
chores which Joanna finds ridiculous.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.730
Meanwhile, Walter heads to the Stepford Men's
Association, where numerous luxury sports

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.310
cars and motorcycles are parked outside.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.510
Walter is then welcomed inside.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.760
On the Fourth of July town picnic, Walter
and the kids relish the new experience while

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.990
Joanna is uncomfortable with the suburban
lifestyle.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.140
A group of women approach the couple and give
suggestive compliments on Walter.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.880
Their conversation is interrupted when Joanna
finds a familiar face, writer Bobbie Markowitz

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.790
and her husband, Dave.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.260
They also meet a renowned architect, Roger
Bannister, and his partner Jerry Harmon.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.940
Claire gathers everyone for square dancing,
in which Joanna and Bobbie are forced to participate.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.480
Despite their initial apprehension, Joanna
starts having fun until a woman named Sarah

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.370
spins uncontrollably while repeating the song
over and over.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.070
Her spin goes faster and faster until she
abruptly stops and collapses.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.950
Joanna squeezes through the crowd to assist
while the rest watch, dumbfounded at the incident.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.200
Within the crowd emerges Mike Wellington,
who asks Walter to pull his wife away from

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.200
the scene.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.040
The men shuffle in front of Joanna, blocking
her view.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.170
She takes a peek between the men's feet and
sees Mike press something that causes a spark

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.540
on Sarah's head.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.160
Mike orders the men to assist Sarah out and
into his vehicle, ignoring Joanna's insistence

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.290
that she needs to be taken to the hospital.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.540
The party continues as if nothing happened
while Joanna continues to argue that Sarah

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.820
needs more help.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.830
The Wellingtons assure her that Sarah will
get all the help she'll need before turning

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:56.830
away.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.650
That evening, Joanna continues to argue about
Sarah, despite Walter receiving news from

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.480
her husband that she's okay.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.790
Joanna raises her other suspicions against
Mike and the townspeople, but Walter has had

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.870
enough.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.190
Tired of her snide attitude and obsession
with control, Walter threatens to divorce

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.190
her.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.950
Defeated, Joanna apologizes and admits her
faults.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.730
The couple reminisces of old times and how
their jobs at the network drove a gap between

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.730
them.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.730
Their stories rekindle their bond.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.970
As they put their past behind them, Joanna
and Walter agree to embrace the country life

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.200
in the suburbs.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.000
As part of this new lifestyle, Joanna changes
her dark clothes to sundresses as she embraces

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.750
the life of a housewife.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.560
Bobbie and Roger aren't on board with her
new style, however.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.910
As the two talk about the other women, Joanna
gets the idea of visiting Sarah to see if

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.100
she's okay.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.070
The three head to Sarah's house, but no one
answers.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.320
Finding the door unlocked, they go inside
and listen to Sarah's loud moans and piercing

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.680
shrieks of pleasure.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.780
The three hide behind a wall as Sarah heads
down to the kitchen.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.490
Roger finds a smooth gadget with Sarah's name
engraved on it.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.210
He presses buttons randomly, not noticing
Sarah pausing abruptly and her chest inflating

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.540
as he does.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.630
Bobbie and Joanna finally convince him to
leave, and they run outside, laughing.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.880
The three retreat to Bobbie's house, where
Joanna and Roger gasp at its chaotic state.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.550
Roger opens up about his unstable relationship
with Jerry, leading all three of them to admit

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.450
how they've moved to Stepford to fix their
family problems.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.120
Inspired by her talk with Walter, Joanna suggests
that they all embrace the suburban life in

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.440
Stepford.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.050
At the Men's Association club, the men battle
with remote-controlled cars.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.290
After winning the game, Walter smokes a cigar
as he shares his thoughts on the peaceful

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.790
life in Stepford and the other men's lovely
wives.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.250
Meanwhile, Joanna, Bobbie, and Roger attend
the Stepford Book Club, where the other wives

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.850
beam at them, making the three uncomfortable.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.480
Adamant on changing her life, Joanna breaks
the silence and brings up the biography she

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.480
just finished of former president Lyndon Johnson,
earning no reaction from the club.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.530
Instead, Claire introduces a Christmas craft
book that the crowd applauds at, including

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.530
Roger.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.800
When the club focuses on her Jewish religion,
Bobbie becomes defensive and sarcastically

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.580
mimics their enthusiasm, silencing the others.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.910
Claire brushes it off, but Bobbie continues
to joke at their expense.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.360
At the men's club, Walter shares how Joanna
agreed to change and make their home at Stepford

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.540
more peaceful.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.430
The other men, however, are unconvinced.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.660
Upon Mike's insistence, Ted calls upon his
wife to pay Walter the winning money for their

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:05.890
game earlier.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.699
Ted's wife places his A.T.M. card in her mouth
and withdraws cash from her mouth.

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.979
All the other men approach Walter expectantly
as the truth dawns on him.

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.600
The lovely Stepford wives are cyborgs.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.030
One evening, Joanna bakes dozens of cupcakes
for Kimberly's day camp.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.590
Dave and Bobbie visit, but Dave quickly leaves
with Walter for the Men's Association.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.410
Suspicious, Bobbie tells Joanna to get a babysitter
so they can follow.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.880
At the club, Jerry brings Roger, who makes
sarcastic comments about the association.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.790
Mike sways the comments, assuring them that
they welcome their relationship.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.480
Outside, Joanna and Bobbie see the curtains
closed, raising Bobbie's suspicions further.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.750
Upon Bobbie's insistence, they climb into
an open window, alerting the men downstairs.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.380
Bobbie turns on the light and finds various
family portraits of the Stepford residents.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.850
Hearing footsteps, they shut the lights and
hide.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.840
A figure in the dark approaches, shutting
his flashlight off.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.520
To their surprise, it's Roger playing tricks
on them.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.300
He allows them to escape as the other men
walk up the stairs.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.130
With the girls gone, Roger lies to Mike and
the rest, claiming that no one was there.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.940
Jerry directs Roger to enter one of the rooms
where he finds something that worries him.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.810
Two days later, Bobbie knocks on Roger's house,
searching for him as he hadn't contacted them

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.940
since the night at the Men's Association.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.240
They check the garbage cans, finding some
of Roger's valuable clothing and collections.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.790
At the town assembly, Joanna and Bobbie finally
see Roger, who's announced to be running for

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.120
State Senate.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.750
Joanna and Bobbie's jaws gape upon seeing
a clean-cut Roger wearing a suit, in contrast

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.830
to his usual flamboyant style.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.990
Bobbie asks Roger if his relationship is happy,
to which Roger says yes, now that he understands

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.450
he doesn't need to be flamboyant and sensitive.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.150
As the crowd cheers for Roger, Joanna realizes
that Bobbie is right: something is wrong in

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.150
Stepford.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.160
Afraid, Joanna insists on leaving Stepford
at once, arguing that the idyllic life in

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.520
Stepford is not normal.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.580
When Walter refuses, she threatens to leave
with their children with or without him.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.039
She tries to leave the house, but the automated
system has the door locked.

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:53.070
Walter unlocks the door for her but stops
her by promising that they will leave together

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.070
tomorrow.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.250
That evening, Joanna wakes up to the robot
dog whimpering.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.820
The dog hands her a remote control with her
name engraved on the handle.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.820
Frightened, Joanna researches the other women
in Stepford and discovers that they were all

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.050
successful women in high positions before
moving to the suburbs.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.470
She also reads an article on a missing champion
terrier, whose features are similar to the

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:11.900
robot dog.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.530
Walter discovers her in the office, and Joanna
waves his worries away, claiming to be researching

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.350
an apple pie recipe.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.430
With the revelation, Joanna heads to Bobbie's
house the next day.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.370
The once chaotic house has turned into a spotless
and cozy home.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:27.680
Bobbie, now blonde and in a Sunday dress,
welcomes Joanna to her home.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.050
Bobbie hands her sons their customized lunch,
filled with their requests.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.490
When one boy is disappointed about a missing
action figure, Bobbie happily gives him five

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.399
hundred dollars as compensation.

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:39.740
With the boys gone, Joanna explodes with her
worry over Bobbie and her discovery about

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.740
the other women.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.219
Bobbie, however, focuses on tidying up the
place in bliss.

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:47.309
Joanna freaks out over Bobbie's new look in
life and insistence that Joanna should change

00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:48.480
the same way.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.439
Tears of fear in her eyes, Joanna watches
Bobbie's hand touch open flames on the stove,

00:08:52.439 --> 00:08:54.269
but Bobbie doesn't even flinch.

00:08:54.269 --> 00:08:57.240
Joanna rushes away and drives to pick up her
children from camp but learns that Walter

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.959
had taken them already.

00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:01.680
Joanna checks back home and finds that no
one is there.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.920
She heads to the Men's Association, determined
to retrieve her children.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.480
The club is dark and quiet, alerting Joanna
to be cautious.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.209
A portrait of her family sits near the entrance,
but she's replaced with a blonde version of

00:09:11.209 --> 00:09:12.360
herself.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.389
With thunder rumbling outside, Joanna searches
for the men, unwilling to be taken down.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:18.999
The men gather around her, cornering her.

00:09:18.999 --> 00:09:22.929
Walter emerges, listing down all the insecurities
he's felt since meeting Joanna.

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:27.110
Much like the other men of Stepford, Walter
is tired of being undermined by his wife.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:30.459
Joanna accuses the men of killing their wives
over their selfish jealousies, but Mike corrects

00:09:30.459 --> 00:09:32.389
her that they're merely perfecting them.

00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:35.829
Mike presents a promotional video explaining
the Female Improvement System.

00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:39.129
The system inserts nanochips into the women's
brains and enhances their appearance to their

00:09:39.129 --> 00:09:40.899
husbands' ideal women.

00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:43.639
Joanna points out how the women are turned
into slaves, but they agree that it's what

00:09:43.639 --> 00:09:44.740
they want.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.740
Joanna wonders if these robotic wives can
truly love their husbands, making Walter think.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.209
Mike presents a robot body, the prototype
for Joanna's replacement.

00:09:52.209 --> 00:09:56.069
Hoping to change her husband's mind, Joanna
kisses him, reminding him of their love.

00:09:56.069 --> 00:09:58.180
But Walter moves forward with the process.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.939
Tearfully, Joanna relents and joins Walter
as the platform descends, accepting her fate

00:10:01.939 --> 00:10:04.420
to be changed into Walter's ideal wife.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.980
The next day, the Stepford wives shop for
groceries in beautiful dresses, greeting each

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.629
other in delightful harmony.

00:10:09.629 --> 00:10:14.300
Among them is Joanna, now with long blonde
hair, blending in with the rest of the wives.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.920
One evening, the Wellingtons host a formal
ball, crowning Joanna and Walter as the guests

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.920
of honor.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.490
Clad in a white suit and a pristine silver
dress, the couple enters the ballroom surrounded

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.139
by the applause of their neighbors.

00:10:24.139 --> 00:10:27.680
The Stepford men and wives dance to the Midsummer
Night's waltz, appearing like a ball in a

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.680
fairytale.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.240
A girlish Joanna changes partners and dances
with Mike while Walter asks Claire for champagne.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.059
As Claire fetches the drinks, however, Walter
sneaks into the laboratory.

00:10:37.059 --> 00:10:41.009
The system warns as Walter steps into a restricted
area, not meant for the Stepford husbands.

00:10:41.009 --> 00:10:45.300
In a large room, countless glass models of
feminine figures surround Walter.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.589
When he approaches one, the system activates,
reacting to him.

00:10:48.589 --> 00:10:52.350
He presses all the buttons, activating the
microchips of one of the Stepford wives.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.959
Walter continuously presses buttons, effectively
overloading the system and deactivating the

00:10:55.959 --> 00:10:57.319
Stepford programming.

00:10:57.319 --> 00:10:59.259
He does the same for the other systems.

00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:03.069
Upstairs, while Joanna leads Mike into the
garden, the woman linked to the system Walter

00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:05.180
deactivates snaps out of control.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.639
She faces her husband, fury in her eyes.

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:11.730
As Walter overloads the system, more and more
wives break free from mind control, including

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.170
Bobbie and Roger.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.480
Claire walks back to the ballroom, witnessing
the chaos of the awakened wives unleashing

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.319
their fury over their husbands.

00:11:18.319 --> 00:11:21.779
Hysterically, Claire fetches Mike from the
garden and back into the ballroom.

00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:25.301
The husbands beg Mike for help, and he instructs
them to use their remote controls, but it

00:11:25.301 --> 00:11:26.649
doesn't work.

00:11:26.649 --> 00:11:30.249
Joanna approaches Mike in her fake sing-song
voice, only to drop the act.

00:11:30.249 --> 00:11:32.319
Walter never implanted her with the nanochips.

00:11:32.319 --> 00:11:34.749
The revelation quiets the arguing couples.

00:11:34.749 --> 00:11:38.759
Walter refused to turn his wife into a science
project, earning Joanna's full respect.

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:41.370
Mike and the other men rage over Walter's
decision.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.819
Mike grabs a candlestick to attack Walter,
but Joanna swings another candlestick against

00:11:44.819 --> 00:11:45.819
his head.

00:11:45.819 --> 00:11:49.230
The whole crowd quiets as Mike's robotic head
snaps off his neck.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:53.209
Claire falls to her knees, mourning over the
Stepford husband she's worked so hard for.

00:11:53.209 --> 00:11:56.630
She attempts to place the head back on her
husband as she mourns for her project.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.720
Claire orchestrated everything in Stepford
in the hopes of creating the perfect community

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.319
where men are men and women are lovely and
cherished.

00:12:02.319 --> 00:12:04.319
A world of romance and beauty.

00:12:04.319 --> 00:12:08.110
Before Stepford, Claire was just like Joanna
and the rest of the wives: overworked successful

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.709
women who were underloved.

00:12:09.709 --> 00:12:13.389
She was a renowned brain surgeon and genetic
engineer, leading a busy life until she found

00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:17.119
her husband, the real Mike, cheating on her
with her research assistant.

00:12:17.119 --> 00:12:20.679
After eliminating them, she created the robot
Mike, her perfect husband whom other men will

00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:21.679
respect.

00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:24.410
Then, she created Stepford, a world in her
perfect image.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.279
She changed the wives, and her next step was
to change the husbands as well.

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:32.839
Delirious with her lost love, Claire kisses
robot Mike's severed head, only to be electrocuted.

00:12:32.839 --> 00:12:36.480
The town gasps as Claire falls on the floor,
weak yet still alive.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.889
She crawls back to her robot husband's head,
cradling it next to her face as she accepts

00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:41.230
her fate.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.679
Six months later, Joanna, Bobbie, and Roger
are interviewed by Larry King, discussing

00:12:45.679 --> 00:12:47.700
their success after Stepford.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.209
Joanna made a documentary about Stepford that
won six Emmys, Bobbie published a best-selling

00:12:51.209 --> 00:12:54.199
poetry book, and Roger won a seat at the State
Senate.

00:12:54.199 --> 00:12:57.739
Joanna and Walter's marriage have taken a
positive turn, finally accepting that perfection

00:12:57.739 --> 00:12:58.910
was not ideal.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:02.259
Meanwhile, the Stepford husbands are still
in Stepford under house arrest.

00:13:02.259 --> 00:13:12.480
Now, they do the household chores while the
women are in control of the community.
