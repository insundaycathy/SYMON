00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.640
Story Recapped here. Today, I’m going to explain&nbsp;
a drama, sci-fi, thriller film called, “Primer.”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.840
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.000
It all starts with a voice recorder&nbsp;
narration by a man coming from the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.000
He tells a story of two meticulous, methodical,&nbsp;
educated yet ambiguous friends who accidentally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.480
discover a scientific breakthrough that is still&nbsp;
unknown — or perhaps not yet revealed to man.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.520
It begins with an argument among four science&nbsp;
engineers who are planning on a side project&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.960
for an attempt to create a device to counter the&nbsp;
effects of gravity. The plan is complicated. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.560
of them work day jobs. They work 50 hours a week&nbsp;
with an average salary grade they can depend on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.960
They argue on how much time each should devote,&nbsp;
not to mention the funds to proceed with the plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.000
As the tension grows, they are less likely&nbsp;
to come up with a solution. After spending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.240
considerable time squabbling, only Abe and&nbsp;
Aaron are left determined to take the challenge.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.440
Abe, with a cautious and controlling personality,&nbsp;
and Aaron, a meddlesome and impulsive kind of guy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.560
begin to plan out their counter measurements&nbsp;
in dealing with the adversities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.120
Despite difficulties, they begin their&nbsp;
research and experiment in Aaron’s garage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.240
After identifying the necessary components&nbsp;
for the project, due to financial inadequacy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.320
they chop off parts from existing appliances&nbsp;
and take anything that is needed from their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.880
surroundings — thus creating a legitimate&nbsp;
particle accelerator device, a device that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.760
uses electromagnetic fields to propel charged&nbsp;
particles at very high speeds and energies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.880
smashing the charged particles into its subatomic&nbsp;
state. The only thing left now is to acquire a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.440
palladium element. It is necessary for their&nbsp;
main approach to discard the coolant bath for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.440
the superconductors because the palladium element&nbsp;
can withstand heat up to 2,830 degrees Fahrenheit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.080
without altering its chemical property and form.&nbsp;
Due to this reason, they take the catalytic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.640
converter from Abe’s car which contains a small&nbsp;
amount of palladium necessary for their invention.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.680
Then, they take it to a machine shop to&nbsp;
fabricate a palladium steel sheet covering.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.000
After several weeks of meticulously placing&nbsp;
all the parts together, they successfully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.920
create the prototype and are finally ready&nbsp;
to put the particle accelerator to the test.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.240
During the test, they place a&nbsp;
nesting egg doll inside the machine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.560
set up the necessary scale, load&nbsp;
0.5 liters of Argon to the intake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.520
and switch the device on. At first, the&nbsp;
machine seems stable; however, as they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.000
increase the electromagnetic field’s power, the&nbsp;
machine judders irregularly and short-circuits.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.440
They realize that they blew the batteries. After&nbsp;
a failed attempt, they decide to call it a day.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.960
The next day, Abe wakes up in a particularly&nbsp;
odd manner, seemingly confused about the present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.640
time. Aaron calls to meet up with him, still&nbsp;
disoriented, Abe answers his call. After a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.160
few seconds, Aaron picks him up to bring him back&nbsp;
to his garage for a surprise. Inside the garage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.520
Aaron tells Abe that he finally figured out how to&nbsp;
stabilize the machine. Aaron installs a regulator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.240
to control the intensity of the electromagnetic&nbsp;
field as he shows Abe how to operate the machine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.760
by gradually feeding power until it reaches its&nbsp;
maximum amplitude. As Abe shows his astonishment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.160
Aaron further explains that by the time the&nbsp;
machine reaches its equilibrium, it creates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.880
enough source of energy to sustain its power on&nbsp;
its own just as he pulls out all the batteries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.640
The discovery leads to another scientific dilemma.&nbsp;
They discuss each of their hypotheses. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.080
several hours of discourse, both seem unable to&nbsp;
agree on a certain conclusion. However, what they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.920
both agree on is to keep it to themselves&nbsp;
first until further evidence is gathered.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.680
In one event, Thomas Granger, father&nbsp;
of Abe’s girlfriend, shows up as their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.200
last best hope of funding. Abe takes the task of&nbsp;
quantifying and explaining the device to Granger.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.240
As weeks become months, their enthusiasm becomes&nbsp;
a slower realization that they are deep in debts.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.600
Then one significant and fateful encounter, Abe&nbsp;
approaches Aaron who is sitting on a bench at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.880
park, taking notes in his notebook. Aaron is&nbsp;
suspiciously wearing an unobtrusive earpiece.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.360
He asks Abe about his whereabouts because&nbsp;
he wasn’t able to reach him all morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.560
Abe strangely answers that he isn’t around. Aaron&nbsp;
doesn’t seem to mind his suspicious response.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.840
Then Abe suddenly gets emotional and starts to&nbsp;
talk about their long relationship as a friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.200
Acting suspicious, he then&nbsp;
presented a proposition to Aaron,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.840
telling him to follow everything exactly as he&nbsp;
says all throughout the day, then in return,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.600
he will show him the most important thing&nbsp;
that any living organism has ever witnessed.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.400
Back in the garage, Abe shows Aaron the nesting&nbsp;
egg doll, enveloped with protein buildup secreted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.440
by an Aspergillus Ticor fungus, that he made&nbsp;
several experiments with the device. Then he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.080
brings Aaron to a Biologist to explain how they&nbsp;
speed up the buildup processes of proteins in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.800
laboratories. The Biologist illustrates how&nbsp;
they use a centrifuge to spin the fungus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.880
around for a couple of thousand rotations&nbsp;
in a day as the Biologist explains that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.280
takes about a month to finally see a small&nbsp;
buildup. Then Abe further explains that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.000
nesting doll that has accumulated the amount&nbsp;
of buildup for five days inside their machine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.960
tantamounts to the amount of buildup for six years&nbsp;
given normal conditions. Seeing Aaron’s confusion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.960
Abe decides to bring him back to the garage&nbsp;
and shows him the actual experiment instead.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.600
First, he sets a mechanical watch at 6 P.M, then&nbsp;
he places it in the machine. After 6 minutes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:14.320
they take the watch out, and as they calculate,&nbsp;
the watch’s time advances by 1,347 minutes. Abe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.520
does the same experiment for a digital watch, and&nbsp;
it shows identical results. Then Abe explains the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.640
A-to-B causal loop side-effect: The vertices are&nbsp;
where the lines begin and end. The vertices are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.760
being represented by Line A and Line B. While&nbsp;
inside the device where both lines meet, two or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.160
more particles that happen to be at the same point&nbsp;
in space at the same time are allowed to go both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.600
forward and backward in time. To further explain,&nbsp;
if a subject is placed inside Line A’s active&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.440
magnetic field, it exits to Line B as the magnetic&nbsp;
field in Line B deactivates. Subsequently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.960
as Line B’s magnetic field activates, the subject&nbsp;
immediately exits to Line A as it deactivates its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.600
magnetic field, overlapping the present time&nbsp;
in Line B — thus creating a Time Machine.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.720
Feeling excited about their discovery, they&nbsp;
think of registering for copyright and publish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.200
their device. However, Aaron thinks of a&nbsp;
better plan but it needs a bigger model&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.440
that could fit a person in. His plan is to&nbsp;
determine the flow of the stock market in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.000
the present time and use the invention to go&nbsp;
back in the past, invest in winning stocks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.440
and earn big in the stock market as they&nbsp;
converge back into their own timeline.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.200
Indulged by the idea, Abe begins to refine his&nbsp;
proof-of-concept as he builds a larger model for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.040
the both of them as they address each issue they&nbsp;
could possibly encounter during the timewarp.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.720
After days of modification, they finally move&nbsp;
their base operation into a self-storage unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.080
After checking all the preparations&nbsp;
ready, they begin their first attempt.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.560
After traveling six hours into the&nbsp;
past, though the attempt was successful,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.920
they sit to contemplate on their&nbsp;
experience. Then they devise an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.440
intricate plan for their big break&nbsp;
as Abe explains the proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.400
On the day, they first secure both of their cars,&nbsp;
one at the facility for their doubles to use,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.480
and the other, parked outside from their&nbsp;
double’s line of sight for them, the originals,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.320
to use when they return. They then step inside the&nbsp;
device and travel another six hours into the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.720
As they get themselves into the warp, they set&nbsp;
their timers to determine the exact time for them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.640
to intervene. They stay isolated in a hotel for a&nbsp;
few hours, so as not to interact or interfere with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.840
the outside world while their doubles are doing&nbsp;
their usual routine. As the time finally arrives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.000
they start buying stocks from the highest margin&nbsp;
and they are able to succeed on their first day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.760
Then Abe and Aaron repeat the six-hour time warp&nbsp;
multiple times over multiple days, earning big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.920
profits in stock trades with the help of their&nbsp;
future foresight of the market's performance.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.640
After multiple attempts, the time travel is&nbsp;
already taxing on Abe and Aaron's bodies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.680
as the two of them begin to notice&nbsp;
alarming side effects that take the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.800
form of progressive worsening of penmanship&nbsp;
and ear bleeding. Then one day, as a result of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.040
their inability to cope with the power of the&nbsp;
technological advancement they have in hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.840
they question each other about the odds of their&nbsp;
sense of morality. The idea has been spoken,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.560
and the words wouldn’t go back after they utter&nbsp;
it aloud. Realizing that there is no real need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.280
for it and no possible real-world application,&nbsp;
they confirm that there is no real advantage to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.480
gain from it — so the idea of immorality stays,&nbsp;
breaking down Abe and Aaron's close relationship.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.840
As days pass, their suspicions grow against&nbsp;
each other, whether or not one of them might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.400
have leaked their biggest secret to someone. The&nbsp;
tension between the two men comes to a head when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.240
Abe decides to pick a losing investment in&nbsp;
the stock market without Aaron’s knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.120
Abe explains that they need to fail to avoid&nbsp;
suspicions, but Aaron is seemingly overly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.000
frustrated to understand Abe’s better judgment.&nbsp;
Later that night, their dispute is reinforced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.560
after an encounter with Thomas Granger, who&nbsp;
appears inexplicably two to three days unshaven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.520
that is in overlap with his original self. Aaron&nbsp;
then tells Abe that he saw Granger earlier in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:47.120
the day, clean-shaven, getting ready to attend a&nbsp;
function with his wife. Aaron theorizes that, at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.760
some unknown point in the future, Granger entered&nbsp;
the device with timeline-altering consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.120
The permutations are endless. From this,&nbsp;
they deduce that the problem is recursive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.120
but beyond that, they find themselves&nbsp;
admitting, defying against the course of nature.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.360
Guilty of the alterations of the&nbsp;
events, Abe goes to the storage room;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.840
but somehow advances two more rooms from where&nbsp;
their time machine is stored and opens another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.480
storage room containing another device that he&nbsp;
calls “The Fail-Safe Device.” Then he travels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.640
into the past, going back four days before&nbsp;
the invention of their time-traveling machine.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.480
Cumulative competing interference&nbsp;
wreaks havoc upon the timeline.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.840
Future-Abe sedates Original-Abe so he will never&nbsp;
conduct the initial time travel experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.000
Then Future-Abe goes back to where he approaches&nbsp;
Original-Aaron who is sitting on a bench at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.960
park as he takes notes in his notebook. This&nbsp;
time, he intends to dissuade Original-Aaron,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.720
but instead, he finds Future-Aaron&nbsp;
who has arrived in the scene first,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.200
listening to the pre-recordings of their past&nbsp;
conversations on his unobtrusive earpiece.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.240
As Future-Aaron expresses his intent to stop him&nbsp;
about his plans to sabotage the first creation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.120
of the time-travel device, Future-Abe faints at&nbsp;
his revelation, overcome by shock and fatigue.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.560
Future-Abe wakes up. The two men briefly and&nbsp;
tentatively reconcile while they jointly travel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.960
back in time, experiencing and reshaping an&nbsp;
event where Abe's girlfriend Rachel Garner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.000
was nearly killed by a gun-wielding party&nbsp;
crasher. After many repetitions, now ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.480
sufficient with knowledge of the party's events,&nbsp;
Aaron stops the gunman and becomes a local hero.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.520
After the successful alteration, Aaron&nbsp;
considers a new life in foreign countries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.880
where he can tamper more broadly&nbsp;
on the timelines for personal gain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.880
while Abe states his intent to remain in&nbsp;
town and try to sabotage their original&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:32.160
experiment — Abe and Aaron ultimately part ways.
As Future-Abe watches over Original-Abe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.800
going to painstaking extremes to keep him unaware&nbsp;
of the future, Future-Aaron on the other hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.720
shares his knowledge with Original-Aaron&nbsp;
by telling the story of two meticulous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.600
methodical, educated yet ambiguous friends who&nbsp;
accidentally discover a scientific breakthrough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.920
that is still unknown — or perhaps not&nbsp;
yet revealed to man, on a voice recorder.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.880
In conclusion, As both Abe and Aaron are&nbsp;
scientifically accomplished engineers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:00.400
they are equally morally and ethically a failure&nbsp;
as men. When humanity’s greed takes over, even by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.440
benefiting the greatest gift one can receive, they&nbsp;
nonetheless become blindsided by it. — Thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.680
only for one’s personal gain, neglecting&nbsp;
the morality of altering one’s former self.
