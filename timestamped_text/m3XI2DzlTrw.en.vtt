00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.430
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen
and get ready to log some flight hours, as

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.820
one maverick pilot feels the need for speed
as he flies to become the cream of the crop.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.570
And that's all the flight puns I have today so

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.010
Strap in and get ready for the danger zone
because this is Top Gun

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.239
In the “Present Day” an unknown aircraft
is flying up in the clouds as Pilots: Maverick

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.079
and Goose &amp; Cougar are up in their fighter
jets, on the intercept for a bogey with a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.150
red star.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.220
It’s a mystery that is quickly revealed
to be MiGs: Russian jet fighters in Indian

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.409
Ocean airspace.

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:02.280
A tense game of chicken commences as the American
jets scare off the Russian but one of the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.710
Rooskies is on Cougar’s tail.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.990
So Goose and Maverick scare off the Rooskies
with some fancy flying, Cougar has a mental

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.600
breakdown in the cockpit and when all the
flyboys land back on the carrier, Cougar is

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.720
called in talk to his commanding 
and officer turns in his wings.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.900
He’s out. But on the other hand

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.830
Goose and Maverick (a very apt name for a pilot) head
into the office and are sent to Topgun, Naval

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.400
Fighter Weapons School in Miramar, California.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.820
It’s here where the pilots are taught dogfighting
and where we’re introduced to Commander

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.020
Mike who entices the pilots with dreams of
being the best at Topgun

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.200
And to say that Maverick wants to be top dog
at Topgun is an understatement.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.090
Something that Ice Man is amused by.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.260
Goose and Maverick go to a bar that night 
where we learn more about Ice Man

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.370
He's an ice cold pilot, whose never

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.500
nervous and he's the best of the best.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.360
After some unresolved tension with Iceman,
Maverick finds a chick he takes an interest

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.360
in.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.460
Charlotte Blackwood or 'Charlie' and he tries to charm
her but she shoots him down hard.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.700
But the next day at the academy, Charlie arrives
at Topgun to talk about American and Russian

00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:15.430
jets more specifically how American jets
can’t do a negative G Push maneuver, something

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.920
that Maverick argues can be done since he
did it earlier.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.730
In the first training exercise, Maverick &amp; Goose
train with Jester, an instructor in a fast

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.510
plane, and after pulling a daring maneuver
Maverick gets missile lock on Jester (succeeding

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.940
the exercise albeit with a little bit of cheating).

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.020
On their way back to the hard deck, 
Maverick decides to have a little fun

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.800
and buzzes the tower and he gets chewed 
out for it by their commander.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.320
The next day, Charlie runs into Maverick and
sets up a date.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.390
Next thing you know: Shirtless volleyball,
not a lady in sight.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.820
Reminds me of what Tarantino once said about
Topgun.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.540
It is a story about a man's struggle with his own
homosexuality, it is! That's what Topgun is about man

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.450
Uhhhh more on that later in the comments

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.421
Anyways! Maverick heads to Charlie’s house and
they talk about Maverick’s history and his

00:03:05.421 --> 00:03:08.500
experience against MiG fighters.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.140
On their next training exercise, Goose and
Maverick are backed up by their wingman Hollywood.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.459
Up against Viper and Jester.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.470
Maverick spots Viper and chases after him
to engage, no longer backing up Hollywood.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.650
Which ends with Maverick getting ‘tagged’
in the exercise – failing it.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.620
After a shower, Viper tells Maverick that
he was impressed by his flying, but Maverick

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.900
shouldn’t have abandoned his wingman lest
he get screwed over.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.310
Something that Ice Man makes a point to emphasize.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.960
The next exercise that Maverick is in has
him flying against Ice Man, in a competition

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.849
to prove they are top dogs: chasing after
jets and trying to shoot them down though

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:52.099
while in pursuit, Ice Man pulls away and Maverick
gets stuck in a jet wash causing his plane

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.959
to go out of control and he has
to eject along with Goose.

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:04.280
But this ends tragically as Goose dies on
accident and Maverick is traumatized.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.830
His guilt is made worse when at a board of
inquiry, Maverick is cleared of any wrongdoing

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.569
and at his next training exercise he chokes
in the cockpit and decides to quit.

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.019
After a talk with Charlie and Commander Viper,
Maverick has renewed confidence in himself

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.850
and goes to the Topgun graduation ceremony
where he and all of the other pilots are given

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.850
their assignments.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.540
A high stakes emergency: a live fire engagement
with MiG hostiles in oceanic waters serving

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.580
as air support. For this assignment

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.870
Maverick is partnered with Merlin serving
as support to Ice Man &amp; Hollywood who are

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.229
up in the air ready to engage the 2 enemy
MiG’s except: there aren’t 2 planes, but

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.970
4 enemy bogies but as soon as the American
pilots realize this, Hollywood spots a 5th

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:50.970
plane.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.020
What happens next is this intense cat and
mouse game with Hollywood getting blasted

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.600
out of the sky by a MiG.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.919
And after some fancy flying and good chemistry
between Maverick and Ice Man, they manage

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.130
to take down 4 of the MIGs causing the Russians
to run away.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.550
Maverick and Ice Man are heroes on their return
and congratulate each other with the immortal line

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.640
You're dangerous. You can be my wingman any time"

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:22.660
"Bullsh**. You can be mine!
*Kissy noises and laughter*

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.000
and after the assignment, Maverick decides to
become an instructor at Topgun

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.750
Fastforward sometime later and Maverick reunites
with Charlie and the film ends with 2 jets

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.949
doing some sickass maneuvers.

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.270
MURICA.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.889
That was Topgun ladies and gentlemen, I hope
that prepped you for Topgun Maverick coming

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:39.949
out in October.

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.830
I hope to see it in theaters and I hope ya’ll
have a fantastic day because with that being

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.690
