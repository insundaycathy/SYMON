00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.760
Mystery Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain a science&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.640
fiction film called "The Mandela Effect".&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.880
That day, a game maker named Brendan, his wife,&nbsp;
Claire and their daughter named Sam, are on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.120
vacation to a beach. The three of them enjoy being&nbsp;
together, full of happiness, jokes, and laughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.920
While they are relaxing, Sam intends to look for&nbsp;
snails around the beach, and she promises not to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.960
play in the water. Claire agrees on the condition&nbsp;
that Sam doesn't go too far from their sight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.520
When Sam is busy looking for snails, she doesn't&nbsp;
realize that the waves drag her curious George.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.240
Sam tries to take the doll, but unfortunately,&nbsp;
she is dragged along by the waves. 
&nbsp;

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.240
Sam's death makes Brendan and claire feel very&nbsp;
sad. Claire tries to move on, but Brendan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.880
who loves his daughter very much couldn't just&nbsp;
let her go. While they are packing Sam's things,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.280
Brendan accidentally sees a book titled "the&nbsp;
berenstain bear," he feels odd because he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.440
clearly remembers that the book was previously&nbsp;
titled "the berenstein bear" with an "e",&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.160
instead of an "a." When they are sleeping,&nbsp;
suddenly a strange sound comes from the kitchen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.960
and it turns out to be matt, his brother-in-law,&nbsp;
who comes to look for food in the refrigerator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.200
Brendan then gives him some pizza, and he also&nbsp;
asks Matt about the book "the berenstain bear."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.920
Matt replies that the book is titled "the&nbsp;
berenstein bear," with the letter "e".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.320
But Brendan shows matt that the correct writing&nbsp;
is "the berenstain bear" with the letter a.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.520
Out of curiosity, Brendan tries&nbsp;
to find it on the internet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.800
and it turns out that there are many people&nbsp;
who think that the writing in the book is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.280
"the berenstein bear," with an e. Brendan&nbsp;
continues to look for information about it-&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.680
until he finally finds a theory that explains the&nbsp;
incident, namely the "mandela effect" theory. 
&nbsp;

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.040
The next day, Brendan is confused by the&nbsp;
photo of his family on the refrigerator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.200
He asks his wife where the photo was taken and&nbsp;
claire replies that it was taken in front of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.840
the Griffith observatory, but Brendan is very&nbsp;
sure that they didn't take photos in that place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.120
instead, they took pictures at the pacific science&nbsp;
center in Seattle. His wife doesn't respond and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.760
tells him to leave because she is busy cooking.&nbsp;
Brendan then goes to see matt and talks about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.960
the Mandela effect theory. Brendan feels that he&nbsp;
is experiencing the Mandela effect phenomenon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.080
but matt denies and says that the phenomenon is&nbsp;
just false memory. But Brendan still believes in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.800
his theory and believes that he now lives in a&nbsp;
parallel universe. Brendan continues to explore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.520
these theories, and then he sees on the forum that&nbsp;
the Mandela effect is caused by an experiment with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.960
a large hadron collider created by CERN. The&nbsp;
experiment is conducted in 2008 in Russia, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.680
at the same time, many people experienced strange&nbsp;
phenomena, one of which is the Mandela effect. 
&nbsp;

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.720
Brendan then tries to go to a priest named&nbsp;
Isaac, to find out about the existence of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.680
But after listening to Isaac's words, Brendan&nbsp;
doesn't believe that God has created this world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.120
Seeing Brendan's strange behavior, Claire tries&nbsp;
to remind Brendan not to stick with past memories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.560
with Sam. She wants Brendan to forget the past&nbsp;
and live a new life. He then asks his wife about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.280
the picture of the guy in the monopoly. Claire&nbsp;
firmly believes that the guy's image in monopoly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.840
is wearing a monocle on one side of his eye.&nbsp;
When she checks it, it turns out that the guy's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.200
image is not using a monocle. Furthermore, Brendan&nbsp;
also points out that the monkey character "curious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.680
George" doesn't actually have a tail. But the&nbsp;
Curious George doll that Sam had has a tail. 
&nbsp;

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.520
Brendan tries to explain that all of these relate&nbsp;
to the theory of the Mandela effect. Brendan feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.760
that Sam's death at that time is just another&nbsp;
parallel universe version that enters the current&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.880
world and then shifted the actual events. 
But Claire is angry and disappointed with Brendan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.880
who only cares about himself with strange&nbsp;
theories, making them unable to move on. 
&nbsp;

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.680
Even so, Brendan remains convinced&nbsp;
that the Mandela effect exists.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.240
Brendan then studies the theory deeper. He&nbsp;
discovers that the Mandela effect could occur&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.000
due to other parallel universes being mix&nbsp;
into the world he is currently living in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.280
Parallel universes themselves are numerous, and&nbsp;
each parallel universe contains another version&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.320
of the current life story. He feels most likely&nbsp;
Sam is still alive in another parallel universe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.000
In the end, he finds the name of a scientist named&nbsp;
dr Roland Fuchs, who also believes that this world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.040
is just a simulation. Brendan then tries to see&nbsp;
doctor Roland, but he is too busy at the time. 
&nbsp;

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.800
The next day, Brendan tries to see him again.&nbsp;
There the two of them have a chat about Roland's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.080
research. The doctor explains that his research&nbsp;
shows that the universe is a computer simulation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.880
designed for an unknown purpose. The simulation&nbsp;
then creates new simulations with a different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.160
version of the story every second. The Mandela&nbsp;
effect experienced by Brendan is a form of bug,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.800
or a mix between the current simulation and&nbsp;
other simulations. That's what causes life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.640
to go wrong. From Roland's explanation, Brendan&nbsp;
also concludes that if a program forms this world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.720
he could change the program by using script&nbsp;
coding, so that the world runs properly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.440
without any bugs. But it looks like he can't&nbsp;
do that if he only uses an ordinary computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.240
Doctor Roland also agrees that they can't change&nbsp;
the world with just an ordinary computer with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.040
very low specifications. Roland then shows Brendan&nbsp;
that he and his team have made the first quantum&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.840
computer stored in one university. Doctor Roland&nbsp;
then explains that there's a possibility that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.720
Brendan's program could be run using the quantum&nbsp;
computer. Brendan then decides to look for books&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.680
on quantum computer programming and start coding&nbsp;
scripts based on them. He also combines some of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.160
his game programming code with quantum code&nbsp;
so that he manages to create a new script.
&nbsp;

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.000
The next day, Brendan is surprised by the presence&nbsp;
of Sam, who is already at their house. At first,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.320
he thinks that it is just his imagination, but&nbsp;
in the end, he believes that he is the one who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.440
brings Sam back from the parallel world. Without&nbsp;
wasting time, Brendan then takes advantage of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.080
it by having fun with his daughter. Brendan is&nbsp;
happy because he manages to shift the story of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.960
Sam's death with another parallel version. But&nbsp;
at that time, Brendan begins to feel strange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.720
about claire's behavior. He realizes that in the&nbsp;
parallel version he sees now, Sam is still alive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.320
but claire becomes a very stressed woman.&nbsp;
Suddenly, Brendan goes straight to Doctor Rolland,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.640
but he is shocked when he hears the news that&nbsp;
Rolland committed suicide two months ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.000
He feels that the script he entered&nbsp;
cause an extraordinary Mandela effect.
&nbsp;

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.280
Realizing a bug in the script, Brendan immediately&nbsp;
decides to make a coding script to run the command&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.160
to reinstall the universe. The re-installation&nbsp;
aims to make the universe runs normally without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.120
any bugs like the Mandela effect. Brendan doubts&nbsp;
the script; he is worried that the universe would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.440
be destroyed and could not be re-created.&nbsp;
But for the sake of his daughter and wife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.760
Brendan decides to go to the facility where the&nbsp;
quantum computer is and then start entering his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.480
coding script. Brendan manages to run his script,&nbsp;
and the quantum computer then shows signs of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.680
reaction. Brendan immediately rushes away, but he&nbsp;
sees all the cars in the parking lot are missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.360
On the bus, he sees that everyone is starting&nbsp;
to glitch. He sees the buildings also glitch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.640
Brendan then goes to see his family, and he sees&nbsp;
that the situation has gone awry. He sees his wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.000
glitches, and the building turns dark. In the&nbsp;
end, he sees two moons colliding, and finally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.040
the whole universe disappears into the darkness.
A moment later, Brendan's script suddenly runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:59.840
again, and the world began to re-form. Planets,&nbsp;
microbes, viruses, sea animals, humans,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.280
and entire cities are now back to normal without&nbsp;
any other glitches, including the Mandela Effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.400
Then the scene returns when Brendan, Claire, and&nbsp;
also Sam are at the beach. When Sam goes looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.120
for snails, Brendan calls Sam and tells her to&nbsp;
leave the Curious George doll, which looks like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.560
it doesn't have a tail anymore. Finally, as Sam&nbsp;
goes looking for snails, Brendan keeps an eye on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.720
his daughter. And the movie ends.
