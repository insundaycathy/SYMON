00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.859
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:08.170
Today I will show you a Drama, Horror, Sci-fi,
Thriller film from 2011, titled The Divide.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.630
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.370
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.500
Explosions devastate New York City.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.211
the residents of the apartment block rush
down the stairs to flee the building, only

00:00:17.211 --> 00:00:20.440
to be forced into the basement by further
explosions.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.010
Only eight of the residents manage to force
their way into the building's bunker before

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.670
the janitor, Mickey, locks the door.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.029
He turns on the generator and the lights.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.130
The group gets used to the cramped conditions
while Mickey enforces his rule over the bunker,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.020
declaring that they must not open the door
under any circumstances until the radiation

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.020
has subsided.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.309
A little girl (Wendi) comes to Mickey and
tells him she does not want to stay here.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.960
Well sweetie, if you leave, your face will
melt away.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.950
Her mother (Marilyn) takes her in stride.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.149
Sam inquires if that was a nuke.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.290
Mickey says definitely and blames other ethnicities.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.280
Delvin asks what Mickey's plan is for getting
out of this situation.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.280
“You want to survive?

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.350
Listen to me.”

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.970
Eva asks if anyone has a signal, Adrien already
tried, no luck.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.640
Mickey tosses the radio to Delvin to try.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.100
Mickey shows everyone the basement, storage
cells, his room and bathroom.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.060
When asked why he has so many mattresses,
he says he's the supervisor of the apartment

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.060
building.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.560
Bobby remarks that the toilet is disgusting,
Mickey says it's called saving water.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.080
Mickey shares with his stash of canned beans
to feed everyone.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.200
Delvin is still trying the radio, but there's
only static.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.920
The group feels trapped and after asking how
much longer they have to stay here and get

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.010
the same answer - as long as Mickey says - Josh
and Bobby decide to leave on their own.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.110
Mickey yells to get away from the door, grabs
an axe and swings it at Josh, no one leaves.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.880
Bobby and Josh have major tension with Mickey.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.660
Sam sees that Eva still has his card and starts
telling her that they will get through this

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.579
because they love each other.

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.439
Eva has not known Adrien long and looks disinterested.

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.430
While Mickey is heating up the beans, Josh
complains that he eats the same crap every

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.430
day.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.040
When Mickey puts him in his place and says
he's feeding them his supplies, Sam flies

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.399
into rage and starts throwing a tantrum, how
can he talk about beans when everyone is probably

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.030
dead outside.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.019
Tensions escalate and Mickey stands up and
slaps him across the face.

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.659
Mickey calms Wendy down by showing her a magic
trick with his finger.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.469
Suddenly a noise at the door startles everyone.

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:20.790
Mickey shouts to turn off the lights.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.109
Something is wrong.

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.870
Someone from outside is burning a hole in
the door.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.400
Some get hopeful, thinking it's a rescue and
they'll finally get out.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.730
Delvin pulls back.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.110
The door opens and four unknown men in hazmat
suits come in with radiation detectors and

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.110
rifles.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.739
They incapacitate Marilyn and kidnap young
Wendi, carrying her out of the bunker.

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.010
They do not answer any of the group's questions,
the group scrambles and the intruders start

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.500
shooting at them.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.019
One intruder grabs their water supply.

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.569
Eva is discovered in the shower, but Delvin
repeatedly beats him with a sledgehammer.

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.930
Mickey stabs one of the intruders, grabs his
gun and shoots another from behind.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.169
He turns on the lights and locks the door
with a chain.

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.909
Adrien is shot in the arm and bleeding profusely.

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.189
Eva treats Adrien's wound, but he can barely
use his arm (it's clear they are attracted

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:08.189
to each other).

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.079
Eva later finds Sam, who is traumatized.

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.049
Mickey tapes the door shut again.

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.780
They speculate who the attacker might be.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.120
Delvin says he heard them say something about
finishing the sweep and they had an American

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.500
accent.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.949
Marilyn has woken up and is trying to get
out of the bunker to get her daughter.

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:28.809
As everyone tries to calm her down, she goes
crazy and gets locked in one of the rooms.

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:33.370
As Delvin fiddles with the radio, he notices
something in Mickey's pocket, a sausage, he

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.260
is holding out food on them.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.299
Sam is completely freaked out.

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.299
Ava seems to be the only one sympathetic to
Marilyn.

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.370
She brings her food and Marilyn says Wendi
was all she had left.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.819
The group decides to go in search of Wendi.

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.519
Josh agrees to put on one of the hazmat suits.

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.519
They open the bunker and find that the area
is completely sealed off by material tunnels

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.099
connected to some sort of lab, where he sees
other intruders.

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.849
They do not seem to suspect that he's not
one of them.

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.879
They have bottled up body parts and baskets
of hair.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.559
In the next room, children are being incubated
and he finds Wendi with her eyes taped.

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:09.909
At that moment, the intruder comes and checks
his ID.

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.450
He cuts off Josh’s oxygen supply.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.090
He manages to escape the lab and shoots a
few of them, losing his gun in the process.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.859
He heads back to the bunker.

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.680
Josh is in distress and explains what he saw.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.569
He apologizes to Marilyn, breaking her heart.

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.819
Sounds come from the door.

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.560
Intruders are welding them in.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.090
Some time passes before they get used to their
life underground.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.699
Two bodies of intruders begin to decay.

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.150
Josh begins to suffer the effects of radiation
exposure.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.569
Ava visits Adrian's room and talks about their
lives before the disaster, how they were neighbors

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:44.360
and how much she liked him.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.569
They go for a kiss, but Sam arrives and interrupts
them.

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:51.409
The group decides to chop up the bodies and
throw them into the sewer.

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.050
Mickey grabs the axe and hands it to Bobby.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.319
After chopping for a while, Bobby comes to
the group, declaring in a nonchalant way that

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:02.460
the axe is blunt, but he still managed to
get the job done.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.689
Marilyn finds emotional support by forming
an intimate relationship with Bobby.

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.650
When Delvin passes Mickey's room, it is empty.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.050
As he begins to relieve himself, he hears
a lock noise.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.610
Upon further inspection, he finds Mickey in
his room and starts pestering him with questions

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.689
about how he got there or what he has in his
pockets.

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:23.129
Mickey throws him out and sends him packing.

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.449
Delvin tells everyone what he experienced.

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.509
The group searches Mickey's room.

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.740
When he comes back, he wants to know what's
going on.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.259
Delvin says that his room is now their room.

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:35.870
Mickey sullenly says that they will regret
this.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.770
They find out that Mickey used to steal stuff
from their apartments, Delvin found his ball

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.990
and Josh found his utensils.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.750
After such a long time in isolation underground,
they have found some kind of happiness in

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.250
Mickey's room - the TV.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.830
Marilyn and Bobby find their own little way
to cope with their situation.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.340
Eva finds them and offers to listen to Marilyn's
problems.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.110
Marilyn tries to convince Eva to sleep with
Josh, warning her that in time men will want

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.249
her body.

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:04.669
The group becomes more and more angry with
Mickey as resources become scarce.

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.039
Mickey punches Josh.

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:11.569
Bobby, Josh and Adrian want to overthrow authority,
as they are sure Mickey is hiding something.

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:14.370
Delvin grabs a taser and goes to confront
Mickey.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.710
Eva spots him.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.189
In Mickey's room, Delvn discovers his locked
safe room and demands Mickey open it.

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:22.319
Eva witnesses all of this happening.

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:26.400
When they enter the locked room, a scuffle
ensues and Mickey shoots Devlin.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.990
The group does not believe Mickey's argument
of self-defence, they knock him out and tie

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.580
him to a chair.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.020
Eva tosses the machine gun into the toilet's
septic tank to prevent Josh from using it.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.759
The increasingly sick Josh and the deranged
Bobby torture him to learn the code to the

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:40.939
locked door.

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:45.720
A huge commotion ensues between all the members,
but no one can stop Josh and Bobby.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.689
They cut off his finger and he gives them
the code.

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:50.009
Marilyn has gone crazy.

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:52.240
The locked room is full of supplies.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.259
So far the group has only eaten canned beans,
they are relieved to see so much food and

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:57.259
water.

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:01.129
Bobby leads Mickey into a room and shows him
a magic trick he performed for Wendy with

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.270
his finger.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.939
He takes a crap right in front of him and
whispers softly in his ear, "now you're not

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:07.029
alone."

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:09.090
before locking him in isolation.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.270
After a while, Josh is seen getting sicker
and sicker.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.409
Bobby and Josh have seized the authority and
both are physically and emotionally abusing

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:17.409
Marilyn.

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:21.160
When Marilyn tries to get some affection from
Bobby, he knocks her down and tells her to

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.990
stay, like a dog.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.400
Josh makes it clear that he wants Eva, and
Sam is unable to stand up for her.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.680
Eva and Sam try to protect Marilyn from Josh
and Bobby, but they can not.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.659
Eva has an emotional breakdown.

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:37.279
At first Sam tries to comfort her, but then
he rather begs her to sleep with him and then

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:39.120
tries to force it.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.960
Marilyn applies excessive makeup to get the
boys to pay her some attention.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.330
Eva witnesses a gruesome scene involving Marilyn,
Bobby, and Josh.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.650
Marilyn comes growling to Eva and Sam.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.900
There are no more words to describe her mental
state, she is like an empty shell.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.069
She is dragged back and when Eva tries to
run after her, Adrien stops her.

00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:00.740
They give each other a look and Sam sees it.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.580
Josh calls Eva to talk.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.830
He gives her their own food to ration.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:09.330
When she asks if that's for all three of them,
he replies no, Mickey is fasting.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.380
Josh says he's open to barter if she wants
more, implying if she's willing to sell her

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.380
body.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.779
While Eva is assigned to watch Mickey, Mickey
reveals that there is a gun hidden in his

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:19.120
safe room.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.960
When Eva asks Sam to help her get the gun,
Sam berates her.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.590
Later Sam barks for Bobby and Josh and gets
a treat thrown at him.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.059
When Eva arrives, she sees that Marilyn has
been beaten up.

00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:33.620
They invite Eva to a game of truth or dare
for rations.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.699
She accepts and chooses truth.

00:08:35.699 --> 00:08:38.360
When asked if she loves Sam, she answers yes.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.349
The situation at the table tightens and when
Sam tries to resolve it, he is yelled at by

00:08:42.349 --> 00:08:46.660
Josh to play along too and he should do a
dare, "go chop up Delvin's body."

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.000
And smashes the axe on the table.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.640
Sam fought back, but he still is emotionally
forced to do it.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.620
Even after bracing himself he fails to cut
Delvin.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.889
Josh and Bobby force Eva to do it, leaving
her distraught.

00:08:58.889 --> 00:09:02.639
Josh and Bobby, both losing their hair due
to illness, shave their heads.

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:04.449
Bobby is crying.

00:09:04.449 --> 00:09:08.440
He wears a woman's robe and puts on makeup;
Josh also affects him.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.980
Mickey informs Eva that there is another way
out of the bunker: through the septic tank.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.620
Eva tries to get the gun, but can not get
past the two of them.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.480
She finds Marilyn's body.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.829
The two of them have beaten her to death.

00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:25.140
Eva notices that her hair is falling out and
realizes that she is also sick.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.399
The shelter does not protect her from the
outside world because the door is broken.

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:33.240
Eva sends Sam to retrieve the gun while she
cuts the power to distract Bobby and lures

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.709
Josh away with the promise of her body.

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:39.120
Sam tries to open the locked room, but they
have changed the code.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.680
Bobby startles him.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.830
He wants to use Sam to satisfy his pent-up
desire.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.180
Josh gets suspicious and hits Ava.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:51.010
Bobby opens the door and Sam finds the gun,
but drops it and Bobby tries to take it.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:54.410
Sam kicks Bobby, grabs the gun and tells him
to march.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:59.050
Josh tries to force himself on Eva, but she
escapes with Adrian's help.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.330
Everyone yells instructions to Sam, he realises
Eva is yelling for him to give Adrian the

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:09.020
gun, he already had his suspicions, but with
that it was clear, Sam shoots Adrian.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.970
Josh brutally beats Sam up.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:15.389
Bobby turns on Josh and is about to shoot
him when Eva slits his throat with a can lid.

00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:18.130
Eva frees Mickey, who shoots Josh.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:22.040
Mickey has been wheelchair bound for so long
he can barely stand on his feet.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.149
Josh smashes an oil lamp and lights himself
on fire, causing a fire in the shelter.

00:10:27.149 --> 00:10:29.980
While Sam and Mickey attempt to put the fire
out.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.780
Eva decides to escape.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.279
She retrieves the hazmat suit and locks herself
in the safe room.

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:36.980
They can not open the door.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.529
Josh and Bobby changed the combination and
they do not know it.

00:10:40.529 --> 00:10:44.440
She breaks through the toilet into the septic
tank below, while Mickey and Sam are trapped

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.810
and fall victim to the growing flames.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.200
Eva emerges from the septic tank into the
remains of the city.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.889
She stares blankly at the devastation of what
once was New York City.

00:10:53.889 --> 00:10:54.889
The end.

00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:56.440
Thank you for watching!
