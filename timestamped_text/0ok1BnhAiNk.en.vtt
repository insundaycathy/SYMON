00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.340
In Oro Valley, Arizona, troubled high school
student Sean Boswell and athlete Clay race

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:22.020
their cars, a 1971 Chevrolet Monte Carlo,
and a 2003 Dodge Viper, to win the affections

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.060
of Clay's girlfriend Cindy.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.960
When Sean cuts through a structure and catches
up to Clay, Clay, desperate to win, hits Sean's

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.970
car repeatedly until they reach a high-speed
turn, which causes both cars to crash.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.640
Clay and Cindy's wealthy families help them
escape punishment, but because Sean is a repeat

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.470
offender, he is sent to live in Tokyo, Japan
with his father, a U.S. Navy officer stationed

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.720
in Tokyo, in order to avoid juvenile detention
or jail.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.210
While in Tokyo, Sean befriends Twinkie, a
military brat who introduces him to the world

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.280
of drift racing in Japan.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.370
Sean has a confrontation with Takashiâ€”the
Drift King (aka DK)â€”over Sean talking to

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.900
Takashi's girlfriend, Neela.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.479
Though barred from driving, Sean decides to
race against Takashi, who has ties to the

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:19.020
Yakuza and drives a 2003 Nissan 350Z, Sean
in a 2001 Nissan Silvia S15 Spec-S loaned

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.320
by a racer named Han, but loses his first
race with Takashi due to his unfamiliarity

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.570
with drifting.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.860
To repay his debt for the car he destroyed,
Sean agrees to work for Han, who drives a

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.420
1997 Mazda RX-7.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.229
This leads to the duo becoming friends, with
Han agreeing to teach Sean how to drift, explaining

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.900
that he is helping him because Sean is the
only person willing to stand up to Takashi.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.869
Sean moves in with Han and soon masters drifting
by practicing in a 2006 Mitsubishi Evo, gaining

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.049
respect after defeating DK's right-hand man,
Morimoto.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.939
Sean soon asks Neela out on a date, and learns
that after her mother died, she moved in with

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.759
Takashi's grandmother, which resulted in their
relationship.

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.110
An enraged Takashi beats Sean up the next
day, telling him to stay away from Neela;

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.690
Neela subsequently leaves Takashi and moves
in with Sean and Han.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.530
Takashi's uncle Kamata, the head of the Yakuza,
reprimands Takashi for allowing Han to steal

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.570
from him.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.050
Takashi and Morimoto confront Han, Sean, and
Neela about the thefts.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.470
Twinkie causes a distraction, allowing Han,
Sean, and Neela to flee, who are then pursued

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.370
by Takashi and Morimoto.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.140
During the chase, Morimoto is killed in a
crash, leaving Takashi to pursue the trio

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.190
on his own.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.670
Han allows Sean to overtake him in order to
hold Takashi off, but the chase ends when

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.470
Sean and Neela crash.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.160
Meanwhile, moments after escaping from Takashi,
Han's car is t-boned, and the car explodes

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.400
before Sean has a chance to save Han.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.690
Takashi, Sean, and his father become involved
in an armed standoff which is resolved by

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.080
Neela agreeing to leave with Takashi.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.220
Sean's father prepares to send him back but
Sean pleads him to let him fix his own mess.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.640
His father then agrees and makes amends with
him.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.940
Twinkie gives his money to Sean to replace
the money that Han stole from Takashi, which

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.030
Sean then returns to Kamata.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.880
Sean proposes a race against Takashi, with
the loser having to leave Tokyo.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.560
Kamata agrees to the challenge, but on the
condition that the race take place on a mountain,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.370
revealed to be the mountain where Takashi
himself is the only person to make it down

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.630
successfully.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:36.750
Sean and Han's crew restore Sean's father's
1967 Ford Mustang Fastback to drift specification,

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.270
using several components of the previously
wrecked Silvia, including the engine.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.140
That night, on the mountain, crowds gather
to see the race; Takashi takes the lead initially,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.620
but Sean's training allows him to catch up.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.680
Determined to win, Takashi resorts to ramming
Sean's car, eventually missing and driving

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.330
off the mountain while Sean crosses the finish
line, with Takashi's car almost falling on

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.910
him in the process.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.590
Kamata keeps his word, and lets Sean remain
in Tokyo and is now christened the new Drift

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.640
King.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.500
Some time later, Neela, Twinkie, and Sean
are enjoying themselves in their newfound

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.320
homeplace and freedom.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.269
Dominic Toretto shows up to challenge Sean,
and he accepts after the American proclaims

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.749
himself as Han's family.
