00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.000
Welcome to the breakdown where we breakdown&nbsp;all the messed-up movies! We have Hostel!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.600
I did Hostel a while ago but deleted it probably&nbsp;300,000 subscribers ago! The title refers to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.720
hostel in Slovakia that is filled with the sexiest&nbsp;
of Slovakian women. When American grad students&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.080
Paxton and Josh along with their Icelandic&nbsp;
friend Oli here find out about this hostel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.400
they make their way right there! Turns out though&nbsp;
that this Hostel is just a trap to capture fresh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:41.920
game for bloody torture and eventual murder!&nbsp;
How will it fair out for these idiots? Before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.840
we get into it make sure you head down into the&nbsp;

stuff stay tuned for the breakdown cue the Gohan!
&nbsp;

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.360
Quentin Tarentino presents . Hostel! The movie&nbsp;
begins with someone cleaning up a murder dungeon!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.040
Blood and teeth seep through the drains after&nbsp;
a dastardly day! Immediately after the events&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.840
of Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay,&nbsp;
two other American tourists named Paxton and Josh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.030
are vacationing! I think they are grad students&nbsp;
who are both going through some relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.600
issues prior to the vacation and they got this&nbsp;
Icelandic homeboy named Oli with them! So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.720
this might sound stupid, but the way people&nbsp;
talk about Amsterdam makes it sound like it s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.760
a country of its own. Everybody wants to get&nbsp;
stoned and stroke it with stoned people. 
&nbsp;

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.640
Paxton and Josh are in the club trying to score,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.720
but Amsterdam ladies don t like grandma walk&nbsp;
around the grocery store fanny packs. Josh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.040
messes up a girl s shirt and gets the anger of&nbsp;
her boyfriend, before yeeting him into Hostel 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.400
The three friends get kicked out to go about&nbsp;
their merry way. Things get crazy at a brothel. 
&nbsp;

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.840
The three return to their hostel, but curfew locks&nbsp;
them out! Since they are so loud and drunk, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.240
entire block throws bottles at them! Some skinny&nbsp;
dude brings them right inside. His name is Alex,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.480
and he has got the hot tip on where to hook&nbsp;
up with women. Slovakia! Amsterdam is cool but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.040
this Hostel in Slovakia is litty. Plus, they&nbsp;
love Americans! You can guess who are on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.600
first train to Slovakia the next morning. On the&nbsp;
ride there, a businessman sits next to the three.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.640
They talk about how Slovakia is basically Babe&nbsp;
Country, but then the guy touches Josh s leg!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.880
This scene seems perfectly acted&nbsp;
because of how Paxton and Oli react. 
&nbsp;

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.880
Anyway here is the rougher side of Slovakia. I&nbsp;
feel like we are gonna see Lilya 4 Ever walking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.240
around here. This place is beautiful&nbsp;
though, a hub of all kinds of tourists.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.120
Each room seems to have beautiful ladies inside.&nbsp;
This is Natalya and she is Svetlana. They almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.560
are like hostesses in a way, even though&nbsp;
they are supposedly guests too. Josh feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.440
a little uncomfortable around these ladies and&nbsp;
gets some fresh air. He almost gets jumped by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.760
some gang of kids, but the businessman from the&nbsp;
train pays them off! Josh buys him a drink and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.840
apologizes for reacting so angry during the train&nbsp;
ride. I m getting the notion that Josh might be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.520
little confused about his interest in women, but&nbsp;
he still has sex with one of the guests later.
&nbsp;

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.120
The next morning, Josh and Pax learn that their&nbsp;
fried Oli has just checked out and left. Without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.920
saying a word at all. Nobody just does that. And&nbsp;
get this, he left with some random Japanese girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.320
She was friends with Kana here, they came together&nbsp;
so she s probably more worried than Pax and Josh.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.720
Well they try to figure out where he went.&nbsp;
Paxton tells a story about when he was a kid, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.480
witnessed a girl drown to death. He tried to help&nbsp;
by going to the lifeguard, but she wasn t paying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.880
attention. By the time he went back to the little&nbsp;
girl, she had died. Why does this story matter?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.040
Well 2018 Spooky let it slip right by. We will&nbsp;
get to why that story is important but of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.400
he blames himself for that little girl s death.
After getting past that gang of kids, they see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.560
Oli! Seems more like he s escaping them! They&nbsp;
chase him, but that ain t no damn Oli! Speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.800
of, they get a text from him saying he went home!&nbsp;
He went home and left his whole body behind. Of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.200
course, someone has brutally killed Oli, and the&nbsp;
Japanese girl in the picture is next. He crushes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.760
her toe right off! Kana is worried sick and the&nbsp;
three tourists all decide to leave together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.920
but Svetlana and Natalya are hoping for one&nbsp;
last party! It s not like they really knew Oli&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.640
like that, so they just hope to party one&nbsp;
more night before heading to Barcelona! 
&nbsp;

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.040
At the disco, both Josh and Pax get drinks right&nbsp;
down into their system. Josh downed it quick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.400
and when you down something quick it hits you&nbsp;
quicker Just like the buzz I got from two glasses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.160
of wine...Josh has been drugged and falls right&nbsp;
asleep in his room, before getting kidnapped.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.560
Paxton didn t just down his drink and he feels the&nbsp;
effects slowly. He walks away to the bathroom, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:29.040
accidently gets locked in a pantry on accident.&nbsp;
This accident saved his life, and he falls asleep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.440
unable to be kidnapped. While Pax is sleeping,&nbsp;
Josh wakes up in a torture dungeon. His fear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.000
intensifies seeing that he probably will not make&nbsp;
it out to finish his thesis. Josh reacts as scared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.040
as anybody, before getting drilled repeatedly.&nbsp;
Meat still on the drill. The torturer is revealed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.680
to be the businessman from the train all along!
Practically a supervillain, a failed surgeon who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:00.000
realizes the power he has in his hands.&nbsp;
The businessman slashes Josh s tendons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.840
letting him attempt escape and make us cringe&nbsp;
seeing him fold over As he crawls away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:13.120
He slashes his throat and kills him! This is&nbsp;
basically the Suck it witch moment of the film,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.200
if you remember that moment from I Spit&nbsp;
on Your Grave. Josh didn t deserve that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:24.000
at all. Paxton wakes up finally able to exit&nbsp;
and safe. He finds out that Kana checked out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.840
but without him and Josh. Pax gets another&nbsp;
room since they say he already checked out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:36.160
and lookie here! It s two new sexy girls inviting&nbsp;
him to the sauna just like when they got here the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:43.200
first time. With nothing else to do, he tries&nbsp;
to find Josh. He pieces together where Josh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.720
or Oli could be with that picture, but his&nbsp;
phone gets grabbed by those meddling kids!
&nbsp;

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.720
Pax almost choked one out. He s angry as&nbsp;
hell at this situation, and he stops because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.280
nobody wants to hurt a kid And maybe he doesn&nbsp;
t want to cause another suffocation in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.560
life even if the first wasn t his fault. Just&nbsp;
shows how scary it is to be away from home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.800
Even the police can t help. They just tell him to&nbsp;
stay at the hostel. While walking around he sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.480
that girl Natalya and follows her into a bar!&nbsp;
Now he tells her fine ass that he wants to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:21.120
where Josh and Oli is right now! She says they re&nbsp;
at an art show. Natalya takes him to the place, a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:27.600
scary warehouse looking building protected by&nbsp;
henchmen! Paxton asks the first person he sees:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.640
Takashi Miike, what exactly it s like in there!&nbsp;
Takashi tells him you ll go broke being in there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.400
so I guess when he s not making movies about&nbsp;
strange Yakuza visitors or an extreme episode&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.520
for a horror anthology series, he gets&nbsp;
inspiration from whatever is in there!
&nbsp;

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:51.040
Natalya leads him further into the warehouse and&nbsp;
laughs at the serious American going right into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:58.400
his unknown fate. He walks by his friend Josh&nbsp;
being dissected by the businessman! Shocked, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:05.360
gets angry at Natalya who laughs in the language&nbsp;
of money while Pax is dragged away by goons!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:12.640
He sees brutal and bloody torture at every turn,&nbsp;
before being tied up for his eventual death! Soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:19.360
Dr. Chainsaw comes in! He specifically&nbsp;
purchased Paxton because he s American.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:25.360
He looks like a whole Lizard Man, leftovers&nbsp;
from one of the Lizard s sick experiments!
&nbsp;

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:32.240
Pax gets clawed by this sewer creature, and even&nbsp;
speaks in his native tongue to plead him to stop!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:42.160
Pax is a pretty smart guy! He has Pax gagged for&nbsp;
trying to reach his heart! Lucky for Paxton, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:49.120
torturer is indecisive! Soon he figures a chainsaw&nbsp;
will work fine and Paxton throws up in fear!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.680
Please stop Paxton. I cant do vomiting, it s the&nbsp;
only thing that remotely disturbing me so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.720
Pax gets his fingers slashed right off,&nbsp;
but then the torturer slips on that gag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.400
and gets his leg cut off from the chainsaw!&nbsp;
Pax hurries to get out of his confines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:12.480
and shoots the villain right in the head. 
Now I eff with Paxton heavy. Paxton calls for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.200
the security guard in another voice! The guards&nbsp;
like boss what happened?!? Paxton: Oh I ll tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:25.360
you what happened blam blam! Good work Pax! He&nbsp;
dresses up in torture garb but hides as goons fill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:32.080
the halls! In this backroom, he sees plenty of&nbsp;
guts and hides without question among the bodies!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:38.640
Good survival strats Pax! He s shocked to see&nbsp;
his friend is next to be cut up, and sadly he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:44.960
loses his two fingers! He carried them all the&nbsp;
way from his torture room. Soon he gets up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:56.240
murders the furnace guy before escaping on an&nbsp;
elevator! Close call after close call! He sneaks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:04.880
into a client room where the torturers dress up!&nbsp;
Cops! These cops work for the Elite Hunting Club,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:11.360
so beware Paxton! They re not on your side!
Pax cleans up and looks the part of a client,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:17.200
but the guards know they have an escaped prisoner!&nbsp;
In the pockets of the jacket he got, he sees a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:24.240
business card for the Elite Hunting Club! An&nbsp;
organization that allows rich people to kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:31.920
and torture tourists! Then, this goofy ass client&nbsp;
pops up. It s his first time but he s so excited.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:40.240
He wants something beyond the mundane hedonistic&nbsp;
adventures. Just from pure universal coincidence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:46.480
Paxton gets away from showing a tattoo that all&nbsp;
clients are supposed to have and the goofy guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:52.800
leaves to torture his tourist. The idiot left the&nbsp;
gun behind though and Pax grabs it as he Splinter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:59.600
Cell Pandora Tomorrow s out of the building.
No actually he Hitman 2: Silent Assassins out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:07.040
and luckily finds a car with keys in it! He&nbsp;
hears screams though! Horrific screams. Last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:13.120
time he heard screams like that, a little girl was&nbsp;
drowning, but this time he isn t letting someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.480
die again, even though I wouldn t be mad if he&nbsp;
left. This is where that story really matters!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.480
He chases back inside the building finding&nbsp;
out Kana is being tortured by that goof&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.840
ball..Pax kills him with haste. He&nbsp;
was using a blowtorch on Kana s eye,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:39.200
and Pax is left to clean up by using&nbsp;
scissors to cut off the dangling eyeball!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.800
I don t know what the hell that stuff is!
So this dude Paxton sneaks out of the warehouse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:51.280
again with an injured Kana and didn t get caught&nbsp;
until he started driving one of the cars! Still,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:57.200
the two rush through the streets. The only way&nbsp;
to safety is to leave this town by train. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:03.920
a truck is moved, Pax sees his temptress Natalya,&nbsp;
along with Alex the guy who told him to come here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:12.000
after all! Pax runs them all over killing all but&nbsp;
Natalya! Who is then immediately destroyed by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.720
incoming goons! Soon the kids stop Pax asking&nbsp;
for candy, but luckily he just so happens to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.360
have an entire bag of gum in the car. 
When the goons get stopped by the same kids,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.880
they get attacked instead! Literally the&nbsp;
kids brutally murder the goons with rocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:36.480
To live all them years to go out like that is just&nbsp;
plain irony! Soon Pax comes upon a police stop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:42.800
but remember The police are more angry back alley&nbsp;
than friendly neighborhood. He sneaks out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:48.640
side and runs through the woods all the way to&nbsp;
the train station. Still, they gotta hide from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:55.280
goons. While walking by a mirror, Kana sees&nbsp;
her disfigured face! She loses all hope seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:01.520
her face that way, and kills herself by jumping&nbsp;
right into a train, spraying blood everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.480
I remember I asked what would y all do when I&nbsp;
first made a video about this movie! Well now I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:12.240
ll tell you straight up, don t do what Kana did. 
Paxton uses the diversion to get on the train&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:20.560
and ride away to safety! Clap it up for Paxton.&nbsp;
Yes, his escape from a heavily guarded torture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:28.560
compound was very lucky, he still managed. But he&nbsp;
s got a vengeance! The train stops in Austria, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:36.080
on the train ride Paxton hears a familiar voice,&nbsp;
the businessman! The same man who murdered Josh!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:43.280
The businessman s daughter is waiting outside this&nbsp;
stop! Just look at the Malice on Paxton s face!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.560
SpookyRice feeds on that kind of malice! He look&nbsp;
like he walking around with this music playing!
&nbsp;

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:52.400
I m more scared of Paxton than I was of the Elite&nbsp;
Hunting Club. Paxton follows the businessman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.920
closely behind, both him and his daughter go into&nbsp;
the loo rooms. Pax leaves his scalpel behind for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:01.920
the businessman to find. As soon as he comes out,&nbsp;
he waits on his daughter but she doesn t come out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.680
He discovers that his daughter is completely&nbsp;
missing! He chases and shouts for her but we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:15.600
see Paxton has kidnapped her. The movie ends as&nbsp;
Paxton kidnaps his daughter and the businessman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:24.320
screams in horror and fear! The end. But that&nbsp;
s not canon. No terrible decision Paxton. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:32.240
had me until then. See guys this is the directors&nbsp;
cut ending! In this ending, somehow Paxton kidnaps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:40.960
a little girl in a crowded train station&nbsp;
and takes her away on the train. That s not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:46.320
logical. Even if she was scared out of her mind,&nbsp;
Paxton doesn t have that in him to do this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.440
and somebody is going to notice she s not with&nbsp;
him and is fighting to get out of his grasp.
&nbsp;

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:58.400
The canon true ending is that Paxton murders the&nbsp;
businessman. Paxton tricks him into reaching for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:06.720
the ground and slices his fingers off. Then Paxton&nbsp;
breaks into the stall with 2007 Michael Myers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:15.280
strength, and drowns him in his own poop water.&nbsp;
Then, here is the Suck it, witch moment! Paxton&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:21.600
murders the businessman by slicing his neck&nbsp;
in an identical way that the same businessman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:28.800
murders Josh. So you cannot tell me, that Paxton&nbsp;
was guided by the universe to commit this act!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:35.520
Paxton was not meant to die today and I for the&nbsp;
most part really enjoyed this movie. One of my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:41.280
favorites honestly. So, now that we ve visited the&nbsp;
hostel lets talk about the most disturbed moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.800
and most enjoyed moment in that&nbsp;
SPOOKY Stuff Cue the Gohan!
&nbsp;

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:56.320
Hostel was a nice watch. Very tolerable to see,&nbsp;
much more than some of these low budget Japanese&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:03.680
movies. Eli Roth not only directed Hostel and&nbsp;
it s sequel, but also The Green Inferno. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:12.960
was probably one of my first horror movies since&nbsp;
I remember that eye seen clear as day! It scarred&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:18.080
me when I was a kid. Most disturbed moment&nbsp;
is the eye thing for me. When I was young,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:24.400
that scene effed me up! It probably lowkey started&nbsp;
this channel because I wanted to get effedup more
&nbsp;

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:29.120
Most Enjoyed moment is Paxton.&nbsp;
Paxton is a platinum character now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.640
Yes, he was very lucky, but this&nbsp;
dude Paxton took care of business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:46.640
He was very bold and wasn t hesitant to do&nbsp;
what he needed to do. When he was in Austria,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.760
his power level was off the charts. It s&nbsp;
a shame what happens to him in Hostel 2. 
&nbsp;

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.676
And that s it. I just created an Instagram&nbsp;
so make sure you guys follow the official&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.920
enjoyed and subscribe if you wanna see some more&nbsp;
messed-up stuff! On the left is A Serbian Film,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:05.680
sorta reminds me of Hostel in a way with the rich&nbsp;
people organization that does messed-up things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:11.680
On the right is the Green Inferno! Also directed&nbsp;
by Eli Roth! A tribute to films like Cannibal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:17.600
Ferox and Cannibal Holocaust! Thank you guys&nbsp;
for watching, hope you enjoyed, SPOOKY OUT!!
