00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.240
Welcome back to Movie Recaps. Today&nbsp;
I will show you an action, adventure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.120
fantasy film from 2011, titled Priest.
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.720
The priests can be seen closing in on the Sola&nbsp;
Mira Hive. Once they manage their way inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.160
Black Hat observes that there is something&nbsp;
wrong, but Priest is adamant about their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.040
orders to find the Queen, so they press on. They&nbsp;
hear some noises up front and ready their weapons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.320
when they suddenly realizes that it's a&nbsp;
trap, as there people get pulled under&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.320
ground. Some of them get taken and others&nbsp;
escape toward the daylight. Though when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.320
they reach the last tunnel Priest doesn't&nbsp;
succeed in helping Black Hat avoid capture.&nbsp;

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.080
The world of the priests is a world that had&nbsp;
always had vampires. A bloody war between the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.120
humans and the vampires had been fought for ages,&nbsp;
destroying each other and the world itself. Facing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.440
extinction, the humans retreated into walled&nbsp;
cities under the protection of the church.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.040
Then they created the ultimate weapon&nbsp;
against the vampires - the priests.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.920
They were powerful warriors, trained in the art of&nbsp;
vampire combat, who singlehandedly decimated the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.720
vampire threat. The remaining vampires were put&nbsp;
into reservations, so the church disbanded the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.680
priests. Only a few of them remain, integrated&nbsp;
into a society that no longer needed them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.320
falling into obscurity along with the vampires.
Many years later, Owen bores into the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.400
checking the levels of radiation. He tells his&nbsp;
wife Shannon that according to his findings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.200
they might be able to start planting. Lucy arrives&nbsp;
home and immediately makes a sly remark about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.760
food she can smell. Owen asks her where she has&nbsp;
been and when she says that she was in town,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.640
he gets angry because she disobeyed his word. She&nbsp;
says that she's old enough, but he tells her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.160
rule doesn't apply to where they live. Sacrifices&nbsp;
need to be made there. Lucy gets angry because she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.560
feels like a prisoner in the outpost they live&nbsp;
in. Shannon interrupts their argument and makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.160
them say grace, effectively calming them both.&nbsp;
Suddenly, the ground shakes and Lucy gets scared.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.880
Owen checks outside and sees a pack of vampires&nbsp;
approaching the house. He tells the women to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.600
down bellow. Shannon opens their hiding place&nbsp;
and gets Lucy inside, telling her not to scream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.120
whatever she hears. She remains in the house to&nbsp;
help Owen. Lucy hears gunshots and her parent s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.640
screaming, being ripped apart by the vampires. The&nbsp;
hatch opens and someone walks in, terrifying Lucy.&nbsp;

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.720
Cathedral City's skyline can be seen. It is still&nbsp;
under the protection of the church. Its denizens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.120
are constantly under the eye of the ruling clergy.&nbsp;
As Priest can be seen walking among the people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.520
the church bells toll and everyone stops to pay&nbsp;
homage, with an disembodied voice saying that to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.000
go against the church is to go against god. Priest&nbsp;
goes to a confessional and enters the automated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.440
booth. He begs to be forgiven for his sins and his&nbsp;
voice is recognized by the machine. An automated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.920
Monsignor Orelas appears on screen and the&nbsp;
priest immediately moves to his confession.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.320
He had dreams about the war with the vampires and&nbsp;
the time when he couldn't save one of his men.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.960
The priest has begun to question and doubt his&nbsp;
faith. The automated Monsignor replies that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.200
the devil has many shapes and that one can&nbsp;
combat him by personal sacrifice and labor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.440
then gives him his prayers of contrition.&nbsp;
Later, the priest is going back to his home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.160
and is in an elevator with a boy and his mom.&nbsp;
The boy asks about his tattoo, but his mom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.080
tells him that he mustn't talk to priests.&nbsp;
Just as he is about to enter his apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.320
he knock over a man that has been following him.&nbsp;
Hicks tells him that he is the sheriff where his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.800
brother Owen lives and that he's been hurt,&nbsp;
Lucy taken by the vampires and Shannon killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.120
The man follows the priest inside and tells him&nbsp;
that Lucy has talked about him as a war hero,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.160
the best at killing vampires. He says that he will&nbsp;
go after her and he could use him by his side.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.800
The priest can't just accept. He goes to see the&nbsp;
ruling clergy to ask them for the reinstatement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.400
of his authority as a Priest. Monsignor Orelas was&nbsp;
informed by Monsignor Chamberlain of his troubles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.040
The priest tells them that his family was attacked&nbsp;
by vampires, to which the Monsignor laughs, saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.760
that no vampire has escaped the reservations. He&nbsp;
thinks that it was the work of wasteland bandits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.960
and that the sheriff was mistaken. The Monsignor&nbsp;
says that there is no vampire threat anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.720
Chamberlain tries to aid the Priest in his&nbsp;
quest, but he shuts him down and orders the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.880
Priest not to shake the faith of the citizens.&nbsp;
The priest continues to question him and he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.440
reminded by the Monsignor that questioning the&nbsp;
authority of the clergy is absolutely forbidden.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.960
If he disobeys them, he would be stripped&nbsp;
from the order and excommunicated.&nbsp;

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.800
Meanwhile, in a fast moving train, Lucy is kept&nbsp;
in a cage by the vampires. She's taunted by one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.120
of them, until Black Hat arrives. He tells her&nbsp;
that she's in a cage for her own protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.920
She tells him that her uncle the Priest will come&nbsp;
after her and him. What she doesn't know is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.240
Black Hat is counting on that fact precisely.
Monsignor Chamberlain tells the Priest that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.080
judgment is final, but he is disappointed that&nbsp;
after all that he has sacrificed they wouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.720
listen to him. Chamberlain says that the war&nbsp;
has long been won and the priest disagrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.120
He tells the priest not to commit sacrilege&nbsp;
just to hunt down a small band of scavengers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.360
The priest says that he has too and police storm&nbsp;
the bar that they are in. Chamberlain says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.520
he needs to think of the greater good and not&nbsp;
stir up something that might cause more damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.760
The priest is disappointed, even though&nbsp;
Chamberlain wants to help him not make a mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.840
He is ready to break his vow and takes down&nbsp;
the officers one by one in a matter of seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.040
Later, he is seen preparing himself and his&nbsp;
weapons to go after the girl. He uncovers his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.680
vessel and rides out of Cathedral City. The priest&nbsp;
leaves the final vestiges of the human world and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.560
enters the desolate and cruel landscape of the&nbsp;
wasteland. With incredible speed, he reaches his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.840
brother's outpost. The priest enters the trashed&nbsp;
homestead and finds a photo of Owen's family. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.600
sheriff thinks he's looting, but when he realizes&nbsp;
it's the priest he's glad to see him come.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.880
They ride to town together. Once they arrive,&nbsp;
the sheriff gets a salesmen out of his town for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.280
trying to sell his people fake weapons against&nbsp;
the vampires. The townspeople protest and say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.920
they do need the weapons, but Hicks tells them&nbsp;
that there are no more vampires. Later, him and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.920
the priest talk while waiting for the doctor&nbsp;
to let them see Owen. The priest walks in and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.120
sits next to him. Owen asks him why he never came&nbsp;
back, to which he says that he no longer could.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.400
When Owen laments that he could not save&nbsp;
Shannon because he didn't have his gift,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.120
the priest comforts him saying that he gave her a&nbsp;
life that he couldn’t. She never forgot about him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.080
Owen begs him to promise that he will find Lucy&nbsp;
and kill all of the vampires. Later, the sheriff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.240
tells the priest that the clergy is looking for&nbsp;
him and that they don't allow the rescue of Lucy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.280
He says that he wants to join the priest's rescue&nbsp;
party, but he tests him by refusing. Hicks grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.840
a bullet and cuts it in half mid air with a knife.&nbsp;
The priest asks if he's any good with a gun and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.480
tells him that he's even better than with a knife.&nbsp;
Before he leaves the room, he asks the priest why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.560
he's preparing the bullets since they don't&nbsp;
use guns and he replies that they are for him.&nbsp;

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.120
Back in Cathedral city a squadron of priests has&nbsp;
been called in to the Monsignors. Their orders are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.640
to bring Priest in, dead or alive. Priestess&nbsp;
doesn't like that order. But they still ride.&nbsp;

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.560
Priest attends his brothers funeral,&nbsp;
who's been laid to rest next to Shannon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.960
Hicks joins him at Owen's outpost and asks what&nbsp;
he's found. The priest has found footsteps that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.800
don't match to either the vampires or their&nbsp;
familiars. They will begin the search in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.000
direction where those came from. The two of them&nbsp;
ride out to the closest vampire reservation. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.400
sheriff says that they are a fallen tribe. They&nbsp;
won't have much time since the Sun is coming down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.720
Once they enter, they see that there are no&nbsp;
guards there and that the place is crawling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.680
with illegal familiars. The sheriff explains that&nbsp;
most of those people are voluntary familiars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.080
wanting to get infected eventually. They approach&nbsp;
a familiar and he tells them that the priest isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.240
welcome there because their lands are protected.&nbsp;
The sheriff tells him what their looking for and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.400
the familiar says that no one has passed through&nbsp;
their reservation. They open the main gate and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.040
walk inside, finding the place in a terrible state&nbsp;
and the guards bodies scattered on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.040
The priest walks into a cell and interrogates&nbsp;
a familiar, threatening him that he will open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.920
his master's coffin if he doesn't tell him where&nbsp;
Lucy is. Suddenly a group of familiars appears,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.080
ready to fight. They attack the sheriff&nbsp;
who runs outside, just to be attacked by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.040
the other familiar. The priest appears just&nbsp;
in time and kills the familiars, except one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.680
He interrogates him, but he defends the vampires&nbsp;
and makes the priest out to be the monster.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.680
The sun begins to go down and he tells him that&nbsp;
he's too late, because the night is their time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.160
Once the sun has set, the vampires come out&nbsp;
of their coffins and instantly surround the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.760
priest and the sheriff. The priest&nbsp;
takes out a bible and begins to read,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.640
but instantly pulls out weapons from between the&nbsp;
pages and uses them to kill two of the vampires.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.640
He battles another, while Hicks tries to shoot&nbsp;
one, but when he gets overpowered the priest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.600
kills that one too. Suddenly, one of the&nbsp;
vampires lets out a scream and runs away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.000
The priest returns to the familiar and asks&nbsp;
him again. He says that they took her West,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.640
but that he doesn't even know what is coming.&nbsp;
The vampire comes back and attacks the priest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.120
They battle and fall inside the confines of the&nbsp;
reservation. Hicks waits with his gun out, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.440
the priest is the one to get out alive. The two of&nbsp;
them talk about what they should do and the priest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.080
says that the Sola Mira Hive is out West. Hicks&nbsp;
has thought that all of the hives were destroyed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.760
but he says that they should still check and&nbsp;
perhaps if they find the missing vampires from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.880
the reservation, they will also find Lucy. Then he&nbsp;
gives Hicks a few pointers on how to kill vampires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.080
because they don't move like humans. If he wants&nbsp;
to kill one, he needs to anticipate their moves.&nbsp;

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.320
In the meantime, the salesman from the town pays&nbsp;
a visit to Black Hat to give him some information.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.720
He asks for some compensation, but&nbsp;
Black Hat threatens to drink his blood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.560
so he gives him the information regardless.&nbsp;
The salesman tells him that the priest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.920
showed up in the town after they took&nbsp;
Lucy and that he was with the sheriff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.840
Black Hat tells him that he's done well, but still&nbsp;
drinks his blood and makes him into a familiar.&nbsp;

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.960
Simultaneously, Priestess has arrived to&nbsp;
the outpost and she is on their trail.&nbsp;

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.680
The Priest and the sheriff ride out West. While&nbsp;
having a break, the priest asks him if his brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.320
knew that Hicks was together with Lucy, to which&nbsp;
he replies no. And to his question if he loved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.280
her, he replies yes. The priest tells him that&nbsp;
if she's infected he'll kill her. The sheriff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.720
says that he won't allow him to do that. Finally,&nbsp;
they arrive at he hive and climb its walls. Once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.680
they step inside, the priest has flashbacks of the&nbsp;
time he was there during the war. He lights up the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.080
hive and tells the sheriff to shoot anything that&nbsp;
comes up and isn't him. The priest drops down in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:33.200
the shaft. Hicks finds a toy buried under the dirt&nbsp;
and explores the level of the hive that he's on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.080
A creature appears behind him. In the meantime,&nbsp;
Priest investigates the tunnels of the hive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.400
He sees someone run past him and follows them.&nbsp;
When he sees a light at the end of a tunnel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.480
he gets jumped by Priestess. Priest asks her&nbsp;
what she's doing there and she tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.200
she was sent by the clergy. She and the others&nbsp;
split up at the reservation. He tells her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.240
he had no choice but to brake his vow. They hear&nbsp;
shots in the distance. When they find Hicks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.480
Priest tells him that the creature is a hive&nbsp;
guardian, that's too big to get down there. Priest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.360
and Priestess jump out to fight it. The creature&nbsp;
knocks Priest out and then runs after Priestess.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.840
It circles them from above waiting to strike. They&nbsp;
work together to get to the creature and Priest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.320
is the one to strike the last blow. Suddenly,&nbsp;
the creature awakes and Hicks shoots it dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.520
Later, the priests talk, while Hicks guards the&nbsp;
entrance. Priestess asks why would there be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.440
guardian in an abandoned hive. Then she tells&nbsp;
him that the sheriff will try to stop him from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.320
killing Lucy if she's infected. Priest thinks he&nbsp;
wouldn't be able to. They talk about what they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.320
did after the war and share their hardships.&nbsp;
She tells him that she won't take him in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.680
but that she came there to warn him. She, much&nbsp;
like him, is suffering from PTSD from the war.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.240
In the good moments though, she thinks about&nbsp;
him. The three of them continue exploring the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.040
hive and get to a new, rebuilt section.&nbsp;
They go in, only to find a massive hive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.920
made for a new army. The only problem is that&nbsp;
there is no one there. As they continue to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.400
investigate, Priestess tells Hicks that Priest was&nbsp;
taken much later by the clergy and his sacrifice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.400
was greater than for most of them. He walks&nbsp;
up to them saying that the air is changing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.160
they find a huge exit looking to the town of&nbsp;
Jericho, where the other priests were headed.&nbsp;

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.600
Simultaneously, the vampire train arrives at the&nbsp;
Jericho station, to the disbelief of the man who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.880
works there. It stops right in front of him, but&nbsp;
no one gets out. When he goes to check the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.680
a vampire kills him. Then Black Hat walks&nbsp;
out, calling the others to begin (the hunt).&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.160
A family is listening to music, when a vampire&nbsp;
crashes into their home and kills the father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.640
The entire town is under attack of the vampire&nbsp;
army, as Black Hat conducts it like an opera.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.200
Suddenly the three priests that were after&nbsp;
Priest arrive and face him. He takes down the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.000
first one with no problem. Black Hat asks the&nbsp;
two remaining ones if they want to join him.&nbsp;

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.720
The following morning, the group arrives at&nbsp;
the town, to find it desolate. They separate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:48.080
to search through the buildings. Priestess finds&nbsp;
dynamite. And Priest walks into an empty house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.480
Hicks and Priestess meet up and he tells her that&nbsp;
there is no one left. She says there were too many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.560
mouth to feed. They find Priest in the middle&nbsp;
of town, praying in front of the bodies of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.520
other priests. She joins him on the ground. Hicks&nbsp;
asks what kind of vampire could have killed three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.400
of them. Priest replies that it is something&nbsp;
they haven't seen before. Then he realizes how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.880
the vampires could have vanished from the city&nbsp;
before sun rise. They go to the train station,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.640
where Hicks tells them that the rail goes up&nbsp;
to the cities and Jericho is the last stop in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.360
the wasteland. Priestess and Priest realize that&nbsp;
the entire thing was a systematic plan to get the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.840
priests outside of the cities, so that the entire&nbsp;
vampire army can take down the defenseless cities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.240
She shows them the dynamite and makes a plan&nbsp;
in which she will take down the railway and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.240
the two of them will get Lucy from the&nbsp;
train. Priest heads to fuel the bikes.&nbsp;

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.920
Meanwhile, Black Hat offers food&nbsp;
to a very tired and battered Lucy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.240
He tells her that he wants what everyone wants,&nbsp;
to be free to live without the penalty of sin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.880
Lucy grabs a knife and hides&nbsp;
it, then asks him what he is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.040
He explains that he thinks that the vampires&nbsp;
are more pure than the humans and that he is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.840
one that will wash clean the unclean world. Black&nbsp;
Hat adds that her and Priest will help him do it.&nbsp;

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.720
Back in Jericho, Hicks asks Priestess how can&nbsp;
Priest kill Lucy if she's infected when she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.120
he's own flesh and blood. She tells him that&nbsp;
becoming a familiar means that she is no ones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.080
flesh and blood anymore. Before they leave town,&nbsp;
they burn the bodies of the other three priests.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.480
Priestess tells Priest to remember that their&nbsp;
power doesn't come from the church, but from god.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.400
She loves him and tells him that a part of her&nbsp;
hoped that Shannon's death would free him at last,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.880
then leaves him with a special weapon. They ride&nbsp;
together toward the train and stop to oversee it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.120
when Hicks threatens to kill them if he doesn't&nbsp;
promise that he won't kill Lucy if she's turned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.440
He's confused as to why he would even care.&nbsp;
Priestess says that Lucy is his daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.840
who was just a baby when the clergy took him.&nbsp;
He gave her to Owen and that was his sacrifice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.920
Priest tells him that if he kills him,&nbsp;
he won't be able to save her by himself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.400
but the can only do it together. As they approach&nbsp;
the train Priest tells Priestess to blow up the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.120
rails regardless if they are still on it. Hicks&nbsp;
enters the train from the back. She rides out in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:50.320
front and familiar riders go after her. Priestess&nbsp;
engages her nitro drive and escapes them. Hicks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.360
walks into a vampire layer and Priest gets on top&nbsp;
of the train, where Black Hat is waiting for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.600
Black Hat explains to the bewildered priest that&nbsp;
the vampire queen turned him into a human vampire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.160
and asks him to join him so they can return to the&nbsp;
city as brothers. Priest asks about his daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.640
and he tells him that she's waiting for his&nbsp;
decision. He attacks him, but Black Hat deflects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.360
his attack and tells him that he's stronger than&nbsp;
him now so he can't win. Meanwhile, Priestess sets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.920
up the explosives on the tracks and arms them,&nbsp;
as she sees the riders incoming. She prepares&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.720
to fight them and engages with them instantly. She&nbsp;
kills them all in an incredible feat of power and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.680
technique. Suddenly, she notices that one of the&nbsp;
familiars has taken apart the detonator and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.400
comes up with a new plan. Priest and Black Hat are&nbsp;
fighting on the train, almost matching in skill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.680
and strength. But the vampire always finds the&nbsp;
upper hand. He asks the priest to join him again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.680
but he refuses and flings his fist toward&nbsp;
him, with Black Hat dodging his every move.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.160
He knocks priest over and thinks he's pushed him&nbsp;
under the tracks, but he latches on to the rain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:51.520
Simultaneously, Hicks is navigating through the&nbsp;
train and escapes a hive of vampires awakening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.400
then he runs into Lucy, being taken away by&nbsp;
a familiar. He wants to blow up the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.520
when the priest punches his way into the train.&nbsp;
All of a sudden, the vampires enter the train car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.040
Hicks shoots at them first, then blows holes&nbsp;
in the celling for the sunlight to come in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.680
They go after Lucy through the train and when they&nbsp;
eventually reach her, Black Hat stops them from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.720
getting to her, throwing Hicks off the train.&nbsp;
Hicks finds a familiar’s motorcycle. Priest is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:19.680
getting trashed by Black Hat, but Lucy manages to&nbsp;
get out of her captors grip and light him on fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.160
Then she goes after the vampire, who tells her&nbsp;
that the priest is her father. They fight again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.800
and he stabs the priest to a wall. Black Hat takes&nbsp;
Lucy out of the train and leave priest to burn.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.920
At the same time, Priestess has mounted the&nbsp;
explosives on her bike and rides toward the train.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:38.080
Priest wakes up and gets himself off the&nbsp;
wall. Black Hat is ready to turn Lucy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.560
when he suddenly appears and strikes&nbsp;
him. She falls, but he grabs her in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.560
They dangle of the side of the train and Black&nbsp;
Hat gets ready to push them off, when they see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.200
Priestess approaching. She jumps of the bike as&nbsp;
it hits the train and Priest jumps off of it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.480
holding Lucy, at the same time. The train gets&nbsp;
decimated along with all the vampires in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.520
Hicks sees the explosion and rushes toward it.&nbsp;
He arrives and finds Priest and Lucy alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:06.560
The girl jumps in his arms. Priestess walks toward&nbsp;
them and Black Hat's hat falls on the ground.&nbsp;

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.360
Later, Priest enters a mass held by Monsignor&nbsp;
Orelas. He approaches him as he belittles him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.520
for coming back. Priest throws a vampire head&nbsp;
in front of his legs and tells him to check the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.560
burning train outside of the city. He says that&nbsp;
the vampire queen was not among them. Orelas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.800
calls him a charlatan and a menace. Priest&nbsp;
says that the war with the vampires is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.200
beginning as he walks out. He meets Priestess in&nbsp;
the wasteland who informs him that she has told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.520
the others who will meet them at the rendezvous&nbsp;
in another city. He rides away into the sunset.
