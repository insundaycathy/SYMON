and after re-watching the series i think
 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.709 align:start position:0%
and after re-watching the series i think
it<00:00:44.879><c> becomes</c><00:00:45.440><c> more</c><00:00:45.760><c> and</c><00:00:45.840><c> more</c><00:00:46.079><c> obvious</c>

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 align:start position:0%
it becomes more and more obvious
 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.950 align:start position:0%
it becomes more and more obvious
