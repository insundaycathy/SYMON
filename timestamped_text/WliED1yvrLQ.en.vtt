00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.080
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain an action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.440
horror, sci-fi film called “Cloverfield.”&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.960
Jason and Lily, a young couple, are busy&nbsp;
walking through the streets of New York,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.360
preparing a surprise party for Jason’s brother&nbsp;
whose leaving for Japan on a new career venture.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.720
They document their day with a camera, planning&nbsp;
to give it to Jason’s brother as a souvenir.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.400
At Jason’s apartment, Jason tasks his brother’s&nbsp;
best friend, Hudson, or Hud, to take the camera&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.680
and record the party. Jason asks Hud to go around&nbsp;
the party recording messages for Jason’s brother.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.920
Jason has his farewell message recorded&nbsp;
first, wishing his brother a safe journey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.720
and more success in Japan. Hud goes around the&nbsp;
apartment, recording messages from everyone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.200
and Lily sees him operating the camera. Lily&nbsp;
is a little bothered with Hud doing it since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.560
she asked Jason, but she lightens up and has her&nbsp;
message recorded. As Hud records Lily's message,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.320
he focuses on Marlena, a girl he has a crush on.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.680
Hud goes to Marlena to get her to&nbsp;
leave a message for Jason’s brother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.400
but Marlena looks uncomfortable and tries&nbsp;
avoiding it. She reasons that she and Jason’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.080
brother aren’t close enough and thinks it would&nbsp;
be weird for her to leave him a parting message.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.840
She says she’s only there for&nbsp;
Lily and would be leaving soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.440
Hud doesn’t take no for an answer, and Marena&nbsp;
reluctantly agrees. Marlena excuses herself after.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.600
Rob, Jason’s brother, finally arrives and&nbsp;
is surprised to see a party thrown for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.520
He gives a short speech thanking&nbsp;
them. Rob later asks if Beth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.640
a girl he likes, would come. Hud tells him he&nbsp;
doesn’t see why Beth wouldn’t come, as they’ve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.840
been friends for a long time. The party continues,&nbsp;
and Rob goes around, talking to everyone.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.600
Beth finally arrives, and Rob greets her, but&nbsp;
he’s surprised to see she came with a date.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.000
Hud later sees Rob sulking while watching&nbsp;
Beth, and Hud asks Rob if there’s a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.640
Rob is reluctant to share his thoughts and&nbsp;
says nothing is wrong. Hud then goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.000
Beth and asks to get her message. Beth agrees, and&nbsp;
she leaves a noticeably heartfelt message for Rob.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.440
Rob then interrupts them and asks&nbsp;
to speak with Beth in private.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.800
Hud tells Jason he’s noticing something strange&nbsp;
about how Beth and Rob are acting, but Jason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.680
tells him it’s probably nothing. Hud then sneaks&nbsp;
into the hallway, trying to get Rob and Beth’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.600
argument on camera. Rob is mad that Beth brought&nbsp;
a guy to his party, but Beth is also angry at Rob,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.720
saying he hasn’t contacted her in weeks.&nbsp;
Rob sees Hud, and Lily drags Rob back in.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.680
Hud tells Jason that Lily may know what Rob&nbsp;
and Beth were fighting about and tells Jason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.040
to convince Lily to tell them. Lily gives in and&nbsp;
reveals that Beth and Rob have slept together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.920
Hud then goes around, telling&nbsp;
everyone about Rob and Beth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.200
Beth steps back in, taking her date and leaving.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.480
Lily sees Rob is upset and tries to&nbsp;
get Jason and Hud to talk to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.000
Jason and Hud then go into Rob’s&nbsp;
room and try to cheer him up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.600
Rob tells them that the night he and Beth shared&nbsp;
was spur-of-the-moment. Hud tells Rob that Beth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.640
is upset because Rob didn’t call her, leaving her&nbsp;
feeling like she got blown off. Rob reasons that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.680
he shouldn’t have called her anyway since he was&nbsp;
leaving for Japan soon. Jason gets frank with Rob&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.320
and tells him that he should have pursued Beth and&nbsp;
tells him Beth is out of his league. Jason adds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.640
that Rob should think about what he wants since he&nbsp;
knows Rob’s had feelings for Beth for a long time.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.840
A loud boom disrupts them, and the power&nbsp;
goes out. The ground shakes, and people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.040
inside are terrified. The power is restored,&nbsp;
and a news report informs them of an earthquake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.560
The report also talks of an oil tanker capsized&nbsp;
in the harbor near the Statue of Liberty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.040
Hud and Jason decide to go up to the roof to see&nbsp;
if they could get a better look at the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.640
Everybody heads up to the roof, and a&nbsp;
massive explosion lights up the sky.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.160
Everyone rushes back in and heads downstairs.&nbsp;
Fireballs rain on pedestrians running on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.000
streets, and another loud boom&nbsp;
is heard. More explosions occur,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.880
and a massive object falls from the sky. Hud&nbsp;
sees that it’s the Statue of Liberty’s head.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.240
The rumbling continues, and Hud sees an&nbsp;
enormous creature moving through the buildings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.520
A skyscraper collapses, and they seek shelter&nbsp;
inside a building. The rumbling intensifies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.320
and the massive creature passes by. Things&nbsp;
calm down, and Jason steps out with Hud.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.000
Hud shows them what he captured on video, and&nbsp;
Jason suggests they leave the city immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.480
They start walking, heading to the Brooklyn&nbsp;
bridge. They get to the bridge and join crowds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.880
of people also planning to leave the city. Hud&nbsp;
sees the creature's wreckage in different parts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.760
of the city, and Rob gets a phone call from Beth.&nbsp;
Rob, Lily, Marlena, and Hud stop and wait for Rob,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.400
but Jason gets separated. Rob hears Beth&nbsp;
saying she can't move and asks for his help.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.360
Panic starts on the bridge, and Lily&nbsp;
calls to Jason, a fair distance away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.360
Suddenly, a massive appendage lifts out&nbsp;
of the water and crashes into the bridge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.240
falling directly on Jason’s location, crushing&nbsp;
him. The bridge starts collapsing, and people fall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.160
into the bay. Lily, Hud, Marlena, and Rob all make&nbsp;
it back to the streets, but Lily and Rob are in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.840
state of shock. Hud talks to Rob, but he stares&nbsp;
blankly. Rob notices his battery has run out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.920
and he runs to a ransacked store to get&nbsp;
batteries. Hud sees what happened at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.520
bridge and gets a clearer look at the creature&nbsp;
attacking the city from the news footage.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.880
Military trucks roll in, and the report&nbsp;
shows soldiers battling the giant creature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.040
The reports detail small creatures falling&nbsp;
off of the monster, lunging and attacking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.840
the soldiers. Rob finally gets through to Beth.&nbsp;
Beth tells him that her apartment has fallen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.240
and she’s pinned down, unable to escape,&nbsp;
pleading for Rob to come and help her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.840
Rob decides to head to Beth’s location,&nbsp;
and the rest try to talk him out of it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.720
but Lily decides to accompany him. Hud&nbsp;
and Marlena have no choice but to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.040
The behemoth suddenly appears, and they’re&nbsp;
caught in a crossfire. Bullets and missiles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.520
fly. The group then decides to run into&nbsp;
the subway, seeking shelter underground.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.240
They reach the subway station and regroup,&nbsp;
rethinking how they will rescue Beth and leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.840
the city. Rob’s mother calls, and he breaks&nbsp;
the unfortunate news that Jason has died.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.600
They then decide to walk the tunnels to Beth's&nbsp;
apartment, thinking that it would be safer to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.560
travel underground. They walk in darkness but&nbsp;
hear strange noises coming from the tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.440
They see rats scurrying away, seemingly running&nbsp;
away from something. They start running too and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.240
decide to resurface at the next station. Hud turns&nbsp;
on the camera's night vision and sees creatures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.880
on the tunnel ceiling, the same creature that&nbsp;
fell off the monster and attacked soldiers. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.480
tells everyone to run as fast as they can, but the&nbsp;
creatures attack. Lily gets pinned, and Rob helps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.840
her. Hud trips and holds a creature back with his&nbsp;
legs, and Marlena helps him, beating the beast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.360
with a metal pipe. Another beast comes and tackles&nbsp;
her down, and she gets bit. Hud and Rob kick the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.600
creature off Marlena, and they all head into&nbsp;
a maintenance room, locking the creatures out.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.160
Marlena gets a deep gash on her back,&nbsp;
and Rob opens a vending machine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.440
getting several water bottles for Marlena to wash&nbsp;
her wounds. They then decide to head above ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.960
making their way through hallways and&nbsp;
finding bright lights at a distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.200
They approach the lights, and Marlena says&nbsp;
she’s feeling dizzy. They’re soon greeted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.880
by soldiers and are taken to their base. They&nbsp;
enter an infirmary and see dozens of casualties.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.840
Rob informs them about Beth, but the soldiers&nbsp;
tell them they can’t do anything to help. Rob&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.520
starts begging, but Marlena suddenly&nbsp;
starts bleeding from her nose and eyes.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.600
The soldiers and medical personnel spring into&nbsp;
action, dragging Marlena away to quarantine her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.720
They rush her out, and the rest of the group are&nbsp;
in panic, not knowing what’s happening to Marlena.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.640
Hud sees Marlena’s body inflate and&nbsp;
explode, her blood spraying all over.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.240
The rest of the group are dragged outside, and a&nbsp;
soldier is willing to let them go to save Beth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.520
He warns them that an airstrike would&nbsp;
be coming in soon, and the last of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.120
evacuation helicopters would also be&nbsp;
leaving soon. They have to save Beth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.920
and make it to the evacuation&nbsp;
area before the bombing starts.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.920
They finally get to Beth’s apartment&nbsp;
and see her building barely standing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.000
leaning on another building. They decide to&nbsp;
climb the standing building, making their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
way up and crossing over to Beth’s building.&nbsp;
They make their way to the 39th floor of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.440
adjacent building before crossing over. They find&nbsp;
Beth impaled by a steel bar, pinned to the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.080
They get her up and start making their&nbsp;
way down. They cross over to the adjacent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.280
building again and see the creature&nbsp;
getting bombarded by fighter jets.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.120
They make it back to the streets and start&nbsp;
running for the evacuation helicopters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.720
Hud gets a good view of the monster as&nbsp;
the military battles it, the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.720
seemingly unaffected by whatever the soldiers&nbsp;
throw at it. They reach the helicopters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.440
but only Lily gets loaded in, and they have&nbsp;
to get into a different chopper. They fly out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.080
and Hud gets a clear bird’s eye view of the fight.&nbsp;
They finally see the monster in its entirety.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.760
The airstrike arrives, and the bombs hit the&nbsp;
monster. It falls, and dust fills their view.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.200
Hud cheers, but the monster pops out of the smoke&nbsp;
and hits their chopper, making them spin out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.800
control. The helicopter crashlands on Central&nbsp;
Park, and Beth wakes Hud. They pull Rob out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.920
and start helping him walk away, but the monster&nbsp;
suddenly appears behind them. It looms over Hud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.880
before it leans down and eats him. The camera&nbsp;
falls back down, focusing on a lifeless Hud.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.840
Rob and Beth hide under a small bridge&nbsp;
and hear bombers approaching. Beth cries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.000
saying she’s terrified, feeling helpless knowing&nbsp;
all of their friends are dead or missing.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.720
Rob tries recording a message, stating his&nbsp;
name and his accounts of what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.160
Rob points the camera at Beth, but fire engulfs&nbsp;
them, and the bridge collapses on top of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.840
Rob finally tells Beth he loves&nbsp;
him, and Beth tells him the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.120
More bombs drop, and the&nbsp;
camera recording cuts off.
