00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:16.100
On a deserted highway, a heist crew driving three modified black 5th-generation Honda Civic coupes assault

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.790
a truck carrying electronic goods, steal its
cargo, and escape into the night.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:28.600
The following day, a joint Los Angeles Police
Department and FBI task force sends LAPD officer

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.770
Brian O'Conner undercover to locate the crew.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.560
He begins his investigation at Toretto's Market,
ordering his regular tuna on white, no crust,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.770
and flirting with its owner Mia, sister of
the infamous street racer Dominic Toretto,

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.960
while Dominic sits in the back office reading
a newspaper.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:55.199
Dominic's crew, Vince, in a 1999 Nissan Maxima;
Leon, in a 1995 Nissan Skyline GT-R R33; Jesse,

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.720
in a 1995 Volkswagen Jetta GLS; and his girlfriend
Letty, arrives.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.200
Vince, who has a crush on Mia, starts a fight
with Brian until Dominic intervenes.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.130
That night, Brian brings a modified 1995 Mitsubishi
Eclipse to an illegal street race, hoping

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.360
to find a lead on the heist crew.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.640
Dominic arrives in his 1993 Mazda RX-7 and
initiates a drag race between himself, Brian

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.460
and two other drivers.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.990
Lacking money, Brian is forced to wager his
car.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.210
Dominic wins the race after Brian's car malfunctions,
but the LAPD arrive before he can hand over

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.210
his vehicle.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.909
Brian, in his car, helps Dominic escape, but
they accidentally venture into the territory

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.890
of Dominic's old racing rival, gang leader
Johnny Tran and his cousin Lance, who destroy

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.369
Brian's vehicle.

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.719
Later, Dominic reiterates that Brian still
owes him a "10-second car".

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.039
The two then walk back to Dominic's house
together, where an altercation between Vince,

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.310
who is upset that Brian is at the house, and
Dominic breaks out.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.119
Brian brings a damaged 1994 Toyota Supra to
Dominic's garage as a replacement.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.560
Dominic and his crew begin the long process
of restoring the vehicle, and Brian starts

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.590
dating Mia.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.040
He also begins investigating Tran, convinced
that he is the mastermind behind the truck

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.260
hijackings.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.069
While investigating one of the garages at
night, having driven a 1999 Ford F150 SVT

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.090
Lightning Brian is discovered by Dominic and
Vince who demand an explanation.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.319
Brian convinces them that he is researching
his opponents vehicles' for the upcoming desert

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.349
Race Wars.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.190
Together, the trio investigate Tran's garage,
discovering a large quantity of electronic

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.190
goods.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.950
Brian reports the discovery to his superiors
and Tran and Lance are arrested while the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.340
Toyota Supra is restored and built.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.180
The raid fails, however, when the electronics
are proved to have been purchased legally.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.450
Brian is forced to confront his suspicion
that Dominic is the true mastermind.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.849
Brian is given 36 hours to find the heist
crew, as the truckers are now arming themselves

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.870
to defend against the hijackings.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.150
The following day, Dominic and Brian attend
Race Wars after test driving the newly built

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.550
Supra, off U.S. Route 101.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.890
At Race Wars, Jesse wagers his father's MK3
Volkswagen Jetta GLS against Tran in his Honda

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.430
S2000, but flees with the car after he loses.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.340
Tran demands Dominic recover the vehicle,
and accuses him of reporting him to the police.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.490
Enraged, Dominic beats up Tran.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.450
Later that night, Brian witnesses Dominic
and his crew leaving and realizes that they

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.470
are the hijackers.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.290
He reveals his true identity to Mia and convinces
her to help him find the crew.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.360
Dominic, Letty, Vince, and Leon attack a semi-trailer
truck, intending it to be their final heist.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.049
The armed driver shoots Vince and runs Letty
off the road.

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.459
Brian arrives with Mia and rescues Vince.

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.120
He is forced to reveal his identity to call
in emergency medical care to save Vince.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.430
Dominic, Mia and the rest of the crew leave
before the authorities can arrive.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.120
Some time later, Brian arrives at Dominic's
house to apprehend him as he is getting his

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.360
father's 1970 Dodge Charger R/T out of the
garage.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.200
He demands Brian leave, since he is not running,
but is going to rescue Jesse who has no one

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.629
else to look after him.

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.980
Instead, Jesse arrives at his house and pleads
for protection.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.300
Tran and Lance ride by on motorbikes and shoot
Jesse dead for reneging on their bet, hitting

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.360
the Volkswagen in the process.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.420
Brian and Dominic give chase in their separate
vehicles, finding and killing Tran and injuring

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.420
Lance.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.410
Brian then pursues Dominic, with them both
eventually acquiescing to a quarter-mile drag

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.410
race.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.570
The pair barely cross a railroad before an
oncoming freight train passes, which ends

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.090
the race in a draw, but Dominic crashes his
car into a truck, injuring him.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.590
Instead of arresting him, Brian gives the
keys to his own car to Dominic, asserting

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.480
that he still owes him a 10-second car from
their first race.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.640
Dominic escapes in the Supra as Brian walks
away.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.390
In a post-credits scene, Dominic is seen driving
through Baja California, Mexico, in a 1970

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.800
Chevrolet Chevelle SS.
