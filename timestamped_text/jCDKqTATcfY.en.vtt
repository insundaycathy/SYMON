00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.480
Story Recapped here. Today I'm going to&nbsp;
explain a science fiction action film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.560
called The Darkest Hour. Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.560
American software designers, Ben and Sean,&nbsp;
are on a plane that's about to land in Moscow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.360
Russia. Sean gets reprimanded by a flight&nbsp;
attendant for using his mobile phone, whose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.560
signals can interfere with the plane's navigation&nbsp;
system. Sean dares the attendant if she genuinely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.800
believes in this, pointing out how mobile phones&nbsp;
should be banned from airplanes if it were true.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.920
Just as the flight attendant gives up on getting&nbsp;
him to stop, the plane experiences turbulence, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.840
the lights go out. The electrical storm outside&nbsp;
causes the plane to short circuit. The passengers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.960
including Ben and Sean, brace themselves for the&nbsp;
worst, but the plane regains power moments later.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.080
At the airport, an announcement states that all&nbsp;
flights are cancelled due to the electrical storm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.400
Sean wears an old suit as they head to&nbsp;
their meeting, one that has holes on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.920
He disguises the hole using&nbsp;
a sharpie that Ben lends him.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.240
On their way to their business meeting, Ben&nbsp;
practices his speech to sell their software,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.800
The Globe Trot -- a social networking platform&nbsp;
that directs travellers to the hottest parties and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.320
bars near them. However, Sean is more interested&nbsp;
in getting drunk and partying in Moscow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.640
The two are excited, knowing that the software&nbsp;
they worked so hard on will earn them millions.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.840
As soon as they arrive at the conference&nbsp;
room, their million-dollar deal turns to dust.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.320
Their Swedish business partner, Skyler,&nbsp;
has created a knock-off application of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.080
their software and is already making the deal.&nbsp;
Unlike Skyler, Ben and Sean do not speak Russian,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.080
so they have trouble arguing their case in&nbsp;
front of their potential clients. Without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.880
signing an NDA with Skyler, Ben and Sean are&nbsp;
at a loss on how they can claim their software.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.720
In front of St. Basil's&nbsp;
Cathedral, American tourists,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.360
Natalie and Anne, take photos while looking&nbsp;
for a club they found on Ben and Sean's blog.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.960
Down on their luck, Ben and&nbsp;
Sean head to the same club.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.160
Ben is worried about their situation, but Sean&nbsp;
stays optimistic that they can turn things around.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.080
Their night gets worse when they&nbsp;
see Skyler. Skyler confidently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.520
tells them that what he did is merely a&nbsp;
business move that the two need to learn.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.360
Their night improves when Ben spots Natalie,&nbsp;
recognizing her from their The Glob Trot app.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.680
They introduce themselves to Natalie and&nbsp;
Anne. Natalie gets a message from her mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.480
who disapproves of her leaving for Moscow. Just&nbsp;
as they are having fun, the power goes out in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.200
the whole club. Everyone leaves the club to see&nbsp;
strange wispy lights descending from the sky.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.560
The crowd is in awe of the celestial event. One&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.840
of the lights lands in the middle&nbsp;
of the crowd before disappearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.240
A police officer steps into the area, and&nbsp;
the light appears again, going in and out.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.560
Panic ensues when the officer touches the&nbsp;
light and instantly disintegrates. More&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.000
of the balls of alien light start&nbsp;
hunting down and killing people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.280
A group of people hides back into the club, with&nbsp;
Sean and another man barricading the door. But an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.680
alien releases a pulse of energy that destroys&nbsp;
the door and windows, allowing it to enter.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.760
The almost invisible alien&nbsp;
nears a group of partygoers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.920
The bartender lights a molotov cocktail&nbsp;
and throws it towards the ball of light.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.480
The attack is successful in&nbsp;
stopping it on its tracks.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.880
Skyler and his date attempt to escape to&nbsp;
an alleyway at the back of the building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.600
but stops when one of the aliens blocks&nbsp;
their way. Skyler quickly closes the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.160
leaving his date behind, who is attacked&nbsp;
and gets disintegrated in front of him.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.960
Back at the bar, the burning alien strikes back at&nbsp;
the people, hitting the bartender and destroying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.400
the wall behind them. Sean finds the storeroom&nbsp;
door and directs Natalie to it. He shouts for Ben&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.360
and Anne to get in and even carries the wounded&nbsp;
bartender into the storeroom with them. They hide,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.720
listening to the chaos happening outside. Someone&nbsp;
bangs on the door, and they let Skyler in. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.080
lights flicker wildly until the power goes out.&nbsp;
The group is confused, horrified and devastated.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.040
Days later, the group is running out of&nbsp;
food in the storeroom. The bartender that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.160
Sean tried to save is dead. Natalie tries to&nbsp;
get a signal on her phone again but fails.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.720
With the place going quiet for hours, the group&nbsp;
decide to go out and head to the American Embassy.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.960
Once outside of the storeroom,&nbsp;
they see that the club is empty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.640
They gather supplies from the bar and head&nbsp;
out to see the torn city filled with ash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.760
and abandoned carsâ€”no other signs of life in&nbsp;
sight. The group hurries across the streets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.480
staying together and keeping&nbsp;
an eye out for signs of danger.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.400
Finally, they find a Russian&nbsp;
woman barricading her window,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.120
who helps them with the directions&nbsp;
but warns them that they will die.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.680
The group finds a bridge, but it's been&nbsp;
destroyed, forcing them to find another way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.880
They reach the Red Square, where Ben and Sean&nbsp;
search for supplies in an abandoned police car.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.240
A dog passes by them, barking at something unseen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.800
Sean watches as the dog disintegrates,&nbsp;
having found one of the invisible entities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.520
He warns the others to hide inside the building&nbsp;
while he and Ben hide behind the police car.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.440
The alien goes to the car. As it gets nearer,&nbsp;
the lights and siren turn on, reacting to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.640
the alien's electric pulses. Sean tells Ben to&nbsp;
hide under the car until the alien passes them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.360
Sean's plan is successful. The alien&nbsp;
doesn't see them, and it goes away.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.680
The two goes inside the shopping&nbsp;
mall and reunites with the others.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.840
Frazzled after seeing the dog die, Skyler&nbsp;
jumps at a gust of wind from a distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.080
Sean yells for him to keep his cool&nbsp;
and avoid scaring the others even more.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.120
Inside the mall, they find an airplane has crashed&nbsp;
into the building. This sends Skyler over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.320
edge, believing that everyone is dead. The aliens&nbsp;
are invisible, so they have no way to fight them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.640
However, Sean points out that the&nbsp;
aliens disrupt electrical items,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.080
much like how the police car&nbsp;
lights and streetlamps react to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.920
They deduce that going out at night is safer,&nbsp;
as they would see the warning signs of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.840
entities getting close better. The group&nbsp;
takes shelter inside one of the stores.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.560
When Anne brings up what Skyler did to&nbsp;
his date in the club, he feels remorse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.280
believing he was brave until that moment when he&nbsp;
needed to react. Those seconds when he closed the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.080
door on his date, causing her to get caught&nbsp;
by one of the aliens, has haunted him since.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.480
The group decides to find a change of clothes,&nbsp;
something more appropriate for their journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.520
While Sean and Natalie find clothes, Natalie&nbsp;
gasps and runs away. The light bulbs across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.160
the store have begun to light up -- an&nbsp;
alien is near. As the entity passes by,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.960
Sean remains still behind the windows. The&nbsp;
entity doesn't see him, giving him an idea.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.680
The entity heads for Natalie, and Sean pulls&nbsp;
her back to hide behind panes of glass.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.840
The entity ignores them; this confirms&nbsp;
to Sean that the entities see them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.600
through their electrical pulse, and&nbsp;
insulators, such as glass, block them.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.680
The group continue their journey to the American&nbsp;
Embassy but finds it abandoned as well. Inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.880
Skyler picks up a gun for protection. Debris falls&nbsp;
from the upper floors, causing everyone to panic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.560
Skyler begins blindly shooting until Ben shouts&nbsp;
for him to stop. Sean suggests heading to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.720
top of the building to get a better view of&nbsp;
the city, but Skyler refuses to go with them.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.880
Natalie finds a logbook detailing how other cities&nbsp;
experienced the same attacks. The logbook also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.680
suggests there are survivors in other cities.&nbsp;
Ben and Sean find a radio and listens to an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.400
emergency message in Russian, but none of them&nbsp;
understands what it means. Natalie takes her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.720
phone near the radio, thinking that it will help&nbsp;
her get a signal, but this predictably fails.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.040
Opening a window, they watch as the aliens destroy&nbsp;
parts of the city. The sound of gunfire alerts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.560
them. Ben and Sean see Skyler moving away from&nbsp;
the building. They head out to get Skyler back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.560
hoping that he'll translate the Russian&nbsp;
message on the radio. The girls stay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.440
with Natalie watching them from the window. She&nbsp;
sees the cars light up ahead of where Skyler,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.840
Ben, and Sean are heading. She tries to warn&nbsp;
them, but they're too far for them to hear.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.880
Ben and Sean catch up to Skyler, who claims&nbsp;
to have seen something worth investigating in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.600
the distance. Skyler gets cornered and sees&nbsp;
another alien closing in on Ben and Sean.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.760
Gathering up courage, he tells them to&nbsp;
run and starts shooting at the entity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.160
knowing that it will divert its attention to him.&nbsp;
The two aliens attack Skyler, letting the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.440
two escape. Skyler's legs get shredded before&nbsp;
the second alien finishes the job, killing him.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.240
Back in the embassy, Sean spots a light from&nbsp;
an apartment building with a silhouette of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.760
a person moving. This must be what Skyler saw&nbsp;
earlier. The others disagree about going out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.640
but Sean insists that whoever&nbsp;
is inside that building knows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.360
how to survive the aliens and&nbsp;
translate the radio message.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.880
With the sun coming up, the group hurries to&nbsp;
the apartment building. There, they meet a young&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:21.360
woman named Vika and an electrical engineer named&nbsp;
Sergei. Sergei turned his entire apartment into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.080
giant Faraday cage to block out the electrical&nbsp;
pulses, hiding them completely from the aliens.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.480
Vika translates the radio broadcast. It's from the&nbsp;
Russian navy, announcing a nuclear submarine in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.520
the Moscow river bound to leave the following day.&nbsp;
The group plans to head to the river by nightfall.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.240
While Vika, Natalie, and Anne leave&nbsp;
Sergei's apartment to gather supplies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.640
Sergei shows the two men his homemade&nbsp;
microwave gun. The high-density microwave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.960
would break the alien's energy field that, in&nbsp;
theory, will allow them to kill the aliens.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.160
The girls see an alien heading&nbsp;
to the building and run.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.360
Vika tells them to follow her, but Anne&nbsp;
insists on heading back to Sergei's apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.240
Natalie wants to trust Vika but follows Anne&nbsp;
instead. The two get inside Sergei's apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:09.440
but fails to lock the door, letting the alien&nbsp;
inside. Sergei shoots it with his microwave gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.480
and celebrates when it damages the alien's shield.&nbsp;
But the alien recuperates and kills Sergei.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.280
Sean and Ben head to the fire escape.&nbsp;
Natalie breaks open a window to follow them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.840
but Anne freezes in fear. Natalie sets&nbsp;
the apartment on fire to stop the alien,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.560
and Anne finally runs to her but is caught and&nbsp;
killed by the alien. Natalie is shocked at her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.440
friend's death. She's frozen in place until Sean&nbsp;
grabs her and helps her down the fire escape.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.560
Natalie, Sean, and Ben reunites with&nbsp;
Vika and meets up with armored Russian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.320
police officers led by Matvei. The police&nbsp;
successfully kill an alien using firearms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.480
Sean collects a fragment of the dead alien&nbsp;
before they head to the police's base.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.160
Sean tells them about the submarine in the river.&nbsp;
Matvei insists that it's impossible to get to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.240
river since the aliens overrun the shortest route&nbsp;
while the other way will take them a few days.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.760
Matvei's group are adamant about&nbsp;
staying to fight for their home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.440
but Natalie points out that it's not their&nbsp;
home, so they have to try to get back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.000
America. Vika decides to join Sean's&nbsp;
group, and Matvei offers to help them.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.520
As they pass through a subway, an alien blocks&nbsp;
their way. The others head to the tracks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:21.120
but Vika is trapped behind a pillar. Ben goes to&nbsp;
save her, helping her climb down to the tracks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.200
But before he escapes with Vika, the&nbsp;
alien catches his leg and pulls him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.040
Sean attempts to rush to his aid while&nbsp;
Ben tries to get ahold of something.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.280
But it's too late. Sean watches as his&nbsp;
best friend gets shredded by the alien.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.200
Sean is frozen in despair. Natalie grabs him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.000
pushing him to move on before&nbsp;
the alien finds the rest of them.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.680
Outside the subway, they find a patrol boat. The&nbsp;
group ride on the boat as it heads downstream to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.480
wait for the submarine. Natalie finds a flare&nbsp;
gun in the boat and sees that Vika is troubled.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.040
Vika feels guilty over Ben's death, and&nbsp;
Natalie assures her that it wasn't her fault.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.880
Sean, on the other hand, quietly&nbsp;
sits on a corner by himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.640
Natalie comforts Sean as he reminisces&nbsp;
about Ben and their friendship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.160
Not having a chance to say goodbye to Ben, Sean&nbsp;
suggests saying goodbye to Natalie, just in case.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.040
The boat crashes, and they find light&nbsp;
columns coming from destroyed buildings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.440
Materials from the buildings fly&nbsp;
upward. Seeing this, Matvei theorizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.760
that the aliens are mining their world for&nbsp;
conductive minerals like nickel and copper.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.320
Vika spots the submarine, but a building&nbsp;
collapses onto their boat, causing it to capsize.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.600
Sean, Vika, and the police reach the&nbsp;
submarine, but Natalie is missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.480
They spot a flare from afar, and Sean insists for&nbsp;
the submarine crew to wait while he rescues her.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.520
The group plots out how to rescue Natalie,&nbsp;
building another microwave gun like Sergei's,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.800
this time with stronger batteries. At the railway,&nbsp;
Sean finds Natalie's bag and calls for her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.680
but there's no answer. Sean's microwave gun&nbsp;
malfunctions just as an alien gets closer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.880
Sean is finally able to shoot the alien with the&nbsp;
microwave gun, seeing what the alien looks like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.280
beyond its force field. The commotion alerts&nbsp;
Natalie whose hiding in one of the busses.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.000
A group of aliens arrive, and Sean&nbsp;
gets an idea to use water to increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.760
the charge of the microwave gun. He&nbsp;
spreads water from a nearby truck to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.000
the ground. Matvei and his team wait for&nbsp;
the aliens while Sean retrieves Natalie.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.280
Sean searches for the bus where Natalie&nbsp;
is, seeing a bus' windshield wipers move.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.160
An alien is around, so he&nbsp;
has to be quick and quiet.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.280
Matvei's team waits for the aliens to&nbsp;
get closer. Vika hides on the sidelines,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.560
throwing Molotov cocktails at the aliens to help.&nbsp;
As soon as the three aliens reach the water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.200
Matvei shoots the microwave&nbsp;
gun at the middle one and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.680
as Sean theorized, the water conducts the&nbsp;
energy, spreading it to the other two aliens.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.920
The aliens' shield breaks, and the team&nbsp;
shoots at them until they all explode.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.800
Natalie and Sean reunite, but another&nbsp;
alien traps Natalie and Sean on the bus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:55.040
It emits electricity, causing the bus to move.&nbsp;
Sean struggles with his microwave gun, and Natalie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.920
nearly gets killed by the alien. He fires the&nbsp;
gun at the alien, allowing Natalie to escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.160
She goes to the driver's seat to stop&nbsp;
the bus, but the brakes aren't working.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.800
She takes the wheel and struggles&nbsp;
to keep the bus from crashing.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.200
After firing a few times, the&nbsp;
microwave gun's battery runs out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.240
Sean searches his bag to find another weapon and&nbsp;
finds the alien fragment he retrieved earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.240
He hurls it at the alien, destroying it.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.560
The bus finally slows down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.400
and the two reunites with the others.&nbsp;
They all head back to the submarine.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.080
Sean offers Matvei and his team to join them in&nbsp;
the submarine, but they refuse. Now that they know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.480
how to fight the aliens, they want to defend their&nbsp;
home and urges Sean to teach others how to fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.960
Natalie finally gets a signal on her phone&nbsp;
and receives a message from her mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.720
saying that she is alive and with&nbsp;
other survivors. This comforts Natalie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.640
Sean, Natalie, and Vika ride&nbsp;
the submarine out of Moscow.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.160
Days later, Sean and Natalie receive information&nbsp;
that other cities have begun fighting back, with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:57.360
Paris destroying an alien mining tower. The humans&nbsp;
now have a fighting chance against the invaders.
