dr phillips entering the room and introducing

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.190
himself to them doctor tells them that they
will be paid 250 and they might have to stay

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.130
till eight hours then he asks them to take
out all their belongings from mobile phone

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.030
to bazookas and put it in the bag assuring
them they will get it back before leaving

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.760
then he goes to emily and tells her each member
will be eliminated in four phases and it starts

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.820
now shooting her brains to the floor everyone
is shocked and scared hiding near the table

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.080
once doctor leaves tony gets up and tells
them it was a nice prank for youtube but now

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.240
he wants to go home and they can end it here
crawford pulls tony and pushes him towards

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.120
the dead body of carrie showing that it's
not a prank and they're in serious trouble

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.530
tony is extremely raged along with other volunteers
and then they start trying to find ways to

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.891
escape the room in control room we see emily
being upset about the whole incident dr phillip

00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:59.100
tells her it's for a bigger cause later in
room we see small window opening and someone

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.450
throwing something out of it it turns out
to be a gun paul points it towards tony crawford

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.680
calms hims down and asks him to check the
magazine of gun and they see it empty with

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.660
only one bullet in the chamber with only one
bullet in gun they talk about the elimination

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.500
phase and they see a paper thrown out of the
window the question says what number do american

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.360
citizens choose frequently from 1-33 as they
read the question we see the doctor asking

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.470
emily to start the timer for two hours as
the timer continues we see the question stats

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.790
person guessing number farthest from from
the answer will be the one to get eliminated

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.550
the question strangely has grammatical mistake
saying best luck instead of best of luck to

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.390
make the volunteers think the person behind
the whole project is not american tony continues

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.070
to find a way to escape the room and we hear
a noise in the background both of them lean

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.660
towards the vent and try to listen to it tony
stupidly says it's muslim language and crawford

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.599
corrects him that muslim is not a language
and it might be arabic emily in the control

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.110
rooms knows the reason behind playing arabic
conversation in the room then we see paul

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.320
finding out some cravings on the wall as all
of them tries to read what's written on the

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.709
wall we see tony going back to the dead body
of carrie and dipping his hands in her blood

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.470
he comes back and then he rubs his hands on
the wall making the texts readable shockingly

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.400
they see pray for us written on the wall tony
continues to decipher the texts then we see

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.810
doctor telling emily that their team wrote
the text to fool the volunteers the timer

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.160
changes suddenly and now they have one hour
left paul rages out and tries to shoot the

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.300
glass knowing it is bulletproof glass and
it will be waste of bullet they push him down

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.080
back in the control room doctor tells emily
to continue the next step we see crawford

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.610
passing gun to tony saying he does not want
to keep the gun with him the small window

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.020
opens suddenly they go towards it but they
can't see anyone so they hide under the table

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.070
to make a plan they plan to shoot the person
in window but tony stupidly goes and puts

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.340
his hands in the window getting it locked
onto it they all help him and finally his

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.400
hand is free only to see it severely injured
crawford wraps his shirt on tony's hand paul

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.660
notices the timer being changed again emily
sees all this from the control room she tells

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.680
doctor that she wants to use the washroom
at this point we can see that emily is highly

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.220
disturbed from what she saw and she breaks
down she fixes herself and comes back to control

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.850
room later we see tony sitting in the chair
with shirt around his neck showing his rocket

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.460
to people in control room crawford makes a
plan and asks both the volunteers to say the

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.940
same answer this way they will be a tie and
none of them will lose few minutes before

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.590
the timer runs out tony says that he is going
to miss his mom and wishes his daughter will

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.250
take care of his mom paul says he will miss
his family crawford says he never got to meet

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.650
his daughter and whoever survives the exam
he wants them to tell his daughter he loves

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.330
her and makes a prayer then we see timer getting
to zero the voice tells them to submit the

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.510
answer tony says the number seven is agreed
but paul betrays them and says 17 instead

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.080
crawford is left with no choice and he says
the answer 7 is agreed then we hear the announcement

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.930
saying the volunteer for elimination is chosen
within seconds the room is filled with sleeping

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:25.240
gas they find it hard to breath and it knocks
them down then we see some doctors entering

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.620
the room they put tony on the stretcher back
in the control room we see doctor giving a

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.900
jacket to emily telling her to come with him
to the testing room as they walk towards the

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.200
room the doctor gives her face mask and tells
her this is just the first phase and tells

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:48.680
her to just observe upon entering the room
emily sees carrie the first volunteer at this

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.600
point in her conscience she feels that she
has just witnessed death of innocent people

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.330
she walks around the room observing everything
while the doctor checks volunteers then the

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:04.430
doctors grabs the gun from the briefcase and
shoots tony in front of emily she tries to

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.690
stay calm then they leave the room and lock
the door with an access card the doctor tells

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.750
her that she should not worry about them since
many people go missing in america every single

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:20.290
day continuing they play loud music in the
room due to the too loud noise crawford wakes

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:26.259
up in pain from the sleeping gas he looks
and finds tony lying in a bloodbath he blames

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:31.729
it on paul since paul decided to betray them
in the last moment paul begs him to shoot

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:38.330
accusing that crawford is imposter we see
another question being thrown out of the window

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:44.479
the question stats where does america stand
in iq level of average citizen crawford finds

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:49.800
a note saying hint in the footer the note
says the answer is not in top ten he cuts

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.509
the note out and then reads the rule saying
they all will die if they choose same answer

00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:59.240
and c's best luck in the end upon being tired
from everything crawford puts his head on

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:05.180
the table back in the office dr philip tells
teen to play a recording they start playing

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:11.320
a prayer of muslims making volunteers believe
that they're trapped by a terrorist organization

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.520
crawford rages out and tries to bring the
light down he fails by taking the light down

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.270
he then tries to make his way through the
hole paul helps him instantly while paul is

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:25.370
helping him the team of doctors enter the
room they start recording it while crawford

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:31.120
escapes then they take down paul with a taser
as crawford crawls in the vent doctor tells

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.860
emily that it is human nature to sacrifice
themselves in order to protect the other being

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.839
after enough contact crawford reaches the
end event and we see doctors making notes

00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:45.880
at another vent this means they have different
groups having similar escape patterns and

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.829
then they knock him down and bring him back
to the room unconscious paul is awake now

00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:56.779
sitting in the corner scared from everything
in the next scene we see emily walking towards

00:08:56.779 --> 00:09:02.230
the experimental room and opening the door
she then helps both of the volunteers in escaping

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:09.899
the facility however only to find this was
imagination in her mind somehow doctor knows

00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:13.959
what she's been thinking and tells her to
stop there then he tells her that if she will

00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:18.720
stop observing then her interview will be
over and she will be of no use to them back

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.800
in the room paul walks towards crawford and
we see that he's alive then crawford thanks

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.790
him for helping him he is having remorse and
tell him that he tore the hint from the paper

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:32.730
thinking paul as impostor continuing he makes
a plan and he covers himself with blood of

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:38.660
tony making himself slippery so the guards
can't get a hold of him continuing he says

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:43.059
that he will stop the guards and paul can
escape since he wants this raccoons to be

00:09:43.059 --> 00:09:48.709
exposed to world however paul decides to kill
himself instead to save crawford but we see

00:09:48.709 --> 00:09:54.670
gunshots and crawford is shot by the guards
they put the dead body of crawford on stretcher

00:09:54.670 --> 00:10:00.899
and we see doctors taking away paul he is
in extreme pain from the death of crawford

00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:06.149
back in the office doctor reveals to emily
that when a cell is attacked by outer force

00:10:06.149 --> 00:10:12.269
human body reacts the same way by sacrificing
itself for a superior good and at the whole

00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:17.950
project nk ultra is based on creating american
suicide bombers to fight other countries and

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:23.689
organizations then the doctor goes to meet
paul but he is in extreme pain and scared

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:29.679
as well so he pushes them away and he makes
his run to find an exit we see paul making

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:36.329
his way to the control room he sees emily
she is standing at the door however surprisingly

00:10:36.329 --> 00:10:41.860
emily closes door on his face paul screams
and begs for help to her but emily decided

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:47.660
to walk away and we see her looking at the
room while the team is cleaning everything

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.470
the doctor tells her that she has done the
right thing and her interview is over and

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:57.190
that she is hired back in the hallway we see
paul still running to find a and exit he enters

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:04.740
a room with more volunteers in it and the
announcement says phase 2 has started

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.230
