00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.280
if you were trapped inside a crocodile-infested&nbsp;
cave what would you do in this video we follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.520
a bunch of young adults on their way&nbsp;
to a cave in the australian rainforest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.000
the reason why we already know that they will&nbsp;
probably be killed by a dangerous animal is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.440
because they are in australia but we start out&nbsp;
with two japanese tourists instead that have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.120
seemingly lost their way inside the same jungle in&nbsp;
which our characters will soon be trapped as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.200
rest assured apart from being lost i have to admit&nbsp;
they don't look too underprepared they have a gps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.360
device wear good shoes and long pants and they&nbsp;
also have a map i have no idea how they got lost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.120
but they somehow did it jesus christ as if&nbsp;
being lost is not enough the man has to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.800
a bit pissy and walks away as if he was the woman&nbsp;
in this relationship his wife on the other hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.840
doesn't seem to notice that's bad because if&nbsp;
you're lost together then your big advantage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.400
is being together however if you lose&nbsp;
each other then hysterically running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.840
around trying to find your boo is not a&nbsp;
good idea because you could fall and trip

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.640
if you injure yourself deep in a rainforest&nbsp;
and you have no way to contact anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.080
you are done for i once hiked through the jungle&nbsp;
in asia wearing flip-flops and short pants that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.440
was the most idiotic thing i have ever done but&nbsp;
since i have started writing these videos i know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.000
what's up you see i see people die every day&nbsp;
in my job so watch and learn so two are gone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.480
but it doesn't matter because we got five more&nbsp;
characters to follow and see what mistakes they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.480
do our five heroes are these people right here&nbsp;
two couples and one fresh dude they're old friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.320
and catch up with each other over beers&nbsp;
and drinks while talking about stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.080
that you would talk about in australia they plan&nbsp;
on exploring a cave system in a jungle nearby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.280
when they drive over the next day yolanda this&nbsp;
girl right here points out the massive crocodile&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.320
sunbathing on the shore on a nearby canal no [ __&nbsp;
] that alone would convince me to turn around and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.640
leave after all exploring an unexplored cave in&nbsp;
the australian rainforest in a crocodile-infested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.800
area without crocodile dundee is not inviting&nbsp;
but cash this guy pulls out a sweet gun to calm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.640
her down and me too we can all agree that this is&nbsp;
a quintessential asset when going on a dumb trip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.080
like that when they arrive at the cave we have&nbsp;
to admit that they seem to be quite okay prepared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.280
we have seen worse on this channel for sure&nbsp;
however i would opt for long sleeve upper body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.240
wear instead of a t-shirt especially for entering&nbsp;
a dark moist and probably cold cave there are many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.560
deadly things in australia not just crocodiles&nbsp;
to australia you might accidentally get killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.960
i would be just as worried about snakes frogs&nbsp;
and spiders hence i would prepare my clothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.200
in a way that there is as little skin exposed&nbsp;
as possible but for now let us enter the cave

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.680
okay so first of all let me point out that&nbsp;
arbitrarily entering any unexplored cave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.280
without sufficient level of expertise is not&nbsp;
a smart idea if you do that in the very least&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.520
let somebody else know if you don't make it&nbsp;
back you can be sure somebody will come and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.600
look for you in the next 24 hours and if we're&nbsp;
honest there is always something that can happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.000
safety first now one thing that i'd like to&nbsp;
point out is how these people are touching the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.040
cave walls when making their way through that's&nbsp;
a bad idea unless you are sure that there isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.760
anything dangerous lurking you shouldn't touch&nbsp;
these walls without wearing protective wear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.640
and this isn't just the case in australia although&nbsp;
i would argue especially there you should be extra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.960
cautious one bite of the wrong thing and it's over&nbsp;
but perhaps that would have been better than what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:04.640
is lying up ahead we got lost down here and no&nbsp;
one knows we're down here right i don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.120
yep that is a signal to turn around and leave my&nbsp;
friends that's like my friends inviting me to just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.800
one drink okay it won't work plus this dude is&nbsp;
so confident even though he has never been here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:24.160
before that's fishy okay go home as our characters&nbsp;
make their way through they find a skeleton of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.000
goat that's a pretty big animal but considering&nbsp;
it could have fallen into the pit before it could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.760
make sense but then it would have died a long time&nbsp;
ago if i were any of these people i would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.520
taken a better look at the bones if this animal&nbsp;
was killed or eaten up by a carnivore we should be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.920
able to see any signs of that and then obviously&nbsp;
make a decision if it's okay to continue or not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.040
none of them consider the possibility of facing a&nbsp;
crocodile in here and none of them have considered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.560
what to do in case of a cave in neither as&nbsp;
we heard from victor before nobody knows that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.920
they are in here if you were concerned about&nbsp;
dead after having entered just 20 minutes ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.600
how about returning and contact someone as soon&nbsp;
as you got mobile connection be your own agent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.200
okay don't follow the crowd as of now i can attest&nbsp;
that these people did not think stuff through but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.640
it gets even better before they arrive at their&nbsp;
destination they come by a tiny water cascade&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.120
that isn't something unusual in caves usually&nbsp;
it's just rain water collected by the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.840
that sinks through and reemerges just like&nbsp;
that however if it was dry for a prolonged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.800
period this wouldn't be here therefore it could&nbsp;
mean that it is currently raining which of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.360
should alarm you both characters though are&nbsp;
curious but eventually just brush it off as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.480
nothing to worry about meanwhile it started to&nbsp;
truly pour down in rain up above hence the small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:51.840
cascade our heroes don't know any of that of&nbsp;
course and march forward until they arrive here

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.360
that's a beautiful place not gonna lie&nbsp;
get a few shots and then turn around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.720
and leave but jokes aside this is a stunning&nbsp;
underground lake for the small inconvenience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.560
of getting here this is totally worth&nbsp;
it what do you think but remembering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.680
the golem like creatures from harry potter 6 i&nbsp;
would not touch this water with a 10 foot pole

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.880
and let me know again

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.280
oh okay well that wouldn't be me uh and if i were&nbsp;
any of the friends i would swiftly point out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.800
we are still in crocodile territory and this&nbsp;
lake looks like a pretty sweet home to me it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.640
the perfect place for crocodiles the water too is&nbsp;
very cloudy making it difficult to see anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.160
and if all of that wasn't enough crocodiles are&nbsp;
primarily nocturnal hunters meaning their eyes are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.680
very well developed for such environments as the&nbsp;
men crossed the lake for no apparent reason the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.240
other three characters are being more reasonable&nbsp;
and explore the side where they have entered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.080
once our two characters arrive on the other side&nbsp;
they once again find another water cascade pouring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.640
down again this is a sign but doesn't necessarily&nbsp;
have to be one at the same time jennifer observes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.240
the water that would be me in fact i don't think&nbsp;
i would have let any of my friends enter the water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.680
before pointing out the dangers and precautions&nbsp;
one should have taken before going in at the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.880
time the floodlight runs out of battery of course&nbsp;
now that shouldn't happen if you were preparing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.280
for a cave exploration days ago also why just&nbsp;
carry one that's just stupid and the headlamps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.280
they wear look more like stuff you would order&nbsp;
from china with an estimated shipping time of 6&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.640
months and 24 days the quality of those and the&nbsp;
children flashlights they use definitely don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:43.840
justify coming in here with one floodlight and no&nbsp;
extra batteries that's a big l i do not approve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.960
as if that wasn't enough though jennifer points&nbsp;
out that there seems to be something in the water

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.840
hey hey i think there's something in the water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.360
if i heard this i would move my ass out of this&nbsp;
lake faster than the laws of physics would allow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.760
but the men in this video are obviously&nbsp;
not in a rush because instead of moving out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.360
they stare at the wall while listening&nbsp;
to the menacing rush behind it

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.280
looks like poseidon himself has funneled a&nbsp;
generous amount of water from a different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:21.040
dimension into this lake who knows maybe we're&nbsp;
actually watching a cleverly disguised science&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.560
fiction movie rather than in survival flick&nbsp;
point being this river came out of nowhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.520
but if you have an idea let me know in your&nbsp;
creative comment i'm burning to know our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.720
characters are swept away and can just barely&nbsp;
save themselves ashore however one of the guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:42.720
backpacks got lost in the stream of water and&nbsp;
another guy plans now to find it justification&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.800
the keys of the car are in there now&nbsp;
that's a bucket full of horseshit okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.680
you just barely survived an underground flooding&nbsp;
and you have no idea to which extent yet finding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.720
the keys to your car above ground is nowhere&nbsp;
near as important as getting out of here asap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.240
instead of looking for the backpack&nbsp;
you should assess the situation first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:06.160
is anyone injured where is the exit is the&nbsp;
exit flooded as well is the water rising all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:11.680
very important question to answer first i would&nbsp;
straight up strip off my clothes quickly everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:17.120
who has been to a cave before knows how cold it&nbsp;
gets down there combine this with so close and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.440
are ready for hypothermia bring your clothes put&nbsp;
them aside and make a plan with everyone involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.800
right now the water keeps rising they decided it's&nbsp;
best to get over to where they came from and dive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.760
underneath section by section until they get to&nbsp;
the point where they have entered the cave the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:39.040
only problem is that jennifer has seen something&nbsp;
in the water before she isn't a child if someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.640
points out something potentially deadly you should&nbsp;
maybe listen expecting the worst is rarely a bad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:50.480
starting point be the what-if person not the sorry&nbsp;
afterwards person but it goes without saying that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.600
regardless of having crocos in here if the water&nbsp;
keeps rising we would either drown or get eaten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.800
up regardless so leaving the cave as soon as&nbsp;
you can has the highest priority just keep an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.360
eye on what's happening around you stay close&nbsp;
to each other and don't be stupid if you can

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:17.920
victor well there is always someone like this and&nbsp;
i being the honest guy that i am have no sympathy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.480
for that in the very least he could have alarmed&nbsp;
everyone else that he has found the backpack with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:28.080
the keys in it victor vanishes and the group looks&nbsp;
out for him screaming his name but he isn't there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.360
anymore like a real kamikaze he disappeared not&nbsp;
for long though he suddenly reappears screaming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:39.280
for his life as he is fighting a huge saltwater&nbsp;
crocodile they are just barely able to save him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.920
in the process they even fished out a torso&nbsp;
from an obvious dead person that has obviously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.920
seen better days as well and if we look closely&nbsp;
we see it's a japanese guy from the beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:56.160
hey how's it going my friend victor survives but&nbsp;
is heavily damaged by the attack no wonder here's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:02.240
a brief croco 101 as mentioned crocos have good&nbsp;
night vision and are nocturnal beings they also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.760
have a very good sense of smell and are primarily&nbsp;
ambush hunters that means they patiently wait and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.360
then strike lightning fast if that isn't enough&nbsp;
saltwater crocodiles have the strongest bite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:20.960
that has ever been measured we are talking 3 700&nbsp;
pounds per square inch or over a ton per square&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:27.280
centimeter for comparison that is roughly four&nbsp;
times stronger than the bite of a tiger or lion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:33.520
let that sink in for a second oh and male salt&nbsp;
water crocodiles grow to a length of 20 feet or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:39.600
6 meters happy birthday victory is one lucky dude&nbsp;
but he doesn't seem very well the bigger problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:45.120
apart from dying victor is how the hell do we&nbsp;
get out of here one big disadvantage is that now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.800
the group is split up into two each group being on&nbsp;
one respective side of the lake the water is still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.880
rising and dead inevitably calls for action eric&nbsp;
the main guy insists of diving out in tag team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:03.200
fashion including him and his buddy the fresh dude&nbsp;
the plan is to get out of there call for help pick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.800
up the gun re-enter and save the remaining three&nbsp;
characters but hold up why would you bring a gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.920
if you just leave it in the car that's not just&nbsp;
dumb that's downright reckless with a gun this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:19.200
situation could have been a lot more comfortable&nbsp;
leaving the pistol in the car a fatal mistake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:25.520
ladies and gentlemen another big l for the team&nbsp;
but eric has brought his magic survival toothpick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:32.320
okay so no worries everything is under control on&nbsp;
a more serious side though this knife is pathetic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.120
this may be a good fit for meat carvings before&nbsp;
a grill session but not fighting off predators&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:43.680
three times the size of you but we can't be choosy&nbsp;
so i prefer this over my bare hands the plan as of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.880
now use the torso from before as a distraction&nbsp;
and then swim quickly to the tunnel and get out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.760
of there to pick up the items i have mentioned&nbsp;
but how do you successfully fight a crocodile&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.760 --> 00:13:00.720
well naturally you should avoid this as much as&nbsp;
you possibly can these animals are not a joke but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:06.000
in case of our characters here i have researched a&nbsp;
few tips first it is good to know that the jaw for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.760
crocodile is more sensitive than the fingertips of&nbsp;
humans meaning albeit a very short knife that eric&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.120
has if you use it right you may be able to fight&nbsp;
off a croco aim at the eyes they are the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:22.480
vulnerable parts of these animals usually on land&nbsp;
you have a better chance than in water but in our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:28.080
case this is not possible making our way through&nbsp;
the flooded cave and attack team is essential&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.200
and lastly fight like crazy no joke when a&nbsp;
croco attacks you it will most likely pull&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:39.200
you underwater and roll itself you got one chance&nbsp;
okay make your punches count additionally if your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.560
team member is attacked instead of you fight the&nbsp;
croco as well aim at the eyes successfully gouging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.840
them beat with your own fingers has a high chance&nbsp;
to scare away the predator good luck while they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.720
dive relentlessly and get ahead well eric's leg&nbsp;
gets stuck in between a rock he can barely free&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:00.560
himself and almost drowns only with a great deal&nbsp;
of luck he is able to release his leg the bigger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.760
problem however is that now they have lost each&nbsp;
other that's fatal if one should get attacked by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:12.400
a crocodile now the chances of survival are very&nbsp;
slim it was also eric who carries a small knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:17.040
not the dude therefore it should have been him&nbsp;
to lead if it was a dude who would have gotten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.920
stuck it would have been safer for eric to dive&nbsp;
backwards and look for him as he has the means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.760
to defend himself but now being apart from each&nbsp;
other each somewhere unknown in this cloudy water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:33.120
it's very difficult to find each other again but&nbsp;
is there a way to avoid being lost underwater with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:39.920
low visibility yes there is divers call this item&nbsp;
a guideline a line which guides you back if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:45.920
should become lost now our heroes don't have that&nbsp;
of course that much is sure but they do have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:51.680
gear to improvise remember at the start of this&nbsp;
movie they climbed down into the cave well they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:57.120
used climbing ropes back then meaning they do have&nbsp;
enough rope for quite a distance now naturally the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.800
ropes aren't long enough to connect both ends of&nbsp;
the tunnel but they are enough per each overhead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:08.240
section so what i mean is for each section they&nbsp;
could have fixated the rope at the starting point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:13.520
of the section while the front diver is laying&nbsp;
out the rope until the overhead section finishes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:18.080
that way the second diver behind could never lose&nbsp;
a diver in the front because he could always just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.280
follow the guiding rope but in the movie this&nbsp;
doesn't happen right causing the characters to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:30.000
separated and the dude unfortunately be attacked&nbsp;
by another crocodile the game is over for this guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.600
as well before we see how eric responds to that&nbsp;
we cut back to the two women and the injured guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:41.360
back in the cave victor the guy with the injury&nbsp;
suffers an asthma attack his inhaler though is in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:47.280
the backpack on the other side even worse yolanda&nbsp;
the girl with the inhaler throws it pretty badly

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.760
what was that that's how my girlfriend throws&nbsp;
snowballs and she has never seen snow before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.400
i'm talking about that level of badness&nbsp;
okay but anyway the only way for her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.360
rescue her boyfriend now is to deliver&nbsp;
it herself and she does so by the way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:14.560
if you for whatever reason ever need to cross&nbsp;
crocodile infested waters move very very calmly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:21.840
and don't splash okay if you can't do that then&nbsp;
dive in would probably be the best option you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:29.680
dad was close glad this was me but she makes it&nbsp;
over and can save her boyfriend for now at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:35.120
same time jennifer feels an airflow allowing her&nbsp;
to discover another corridor leading further into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:41.440
the cave but before she can act eric returns he&nbsp;
didn't make it and gave up after the dude has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:46.640
killed as we all know now while jennifer stays&nbsp;
back to take care of victor you'll land on eric&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:52.320
go to explore the new park to see if there was a&nbsp;
way out now that should have been the plan before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.960
trying to dive half an hour through the&nbsp;
crocodile-infested waters but before they go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:02.080
though yolanda tells her dying boyfriend that she&nbsp;
is pregnant she also adds that she tried waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.880
for the best moment to share the happy news now&nbsp;
i don't think she was able to achieve that but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:12.400
uh i'll leave the judgment to you so when both of&nbsp;
them tried to find the exit jennifer and victor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:18.800
noticed that the water keeps rising they agreed to&nbsp;
make their way further up to avoid any new attacks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:24.800
good choice in great pain they make it up having&nbsp;
arrived in safety jennifer goes through the photos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:31.840
of the crew from the night before she smiles&nbsp;
and enjoys what she sees until she doesn't

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:41.840
at first i wondered why she gets so upset looking&nbsp;
at a photo of her boyfriend and her female friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:48.400
they all get along but hey she's a woman okay so&nbsp;
she probably got that sixth sense well i guess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:54.560
we will see jennifer then spots the backpack with&nbsp;
the car keys in it again for some odd reason she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.360
decides to risk her life to recover it i have&nbsp;
shared my opinion on that when victor tried the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:05.040
same thing before ending up as a burden for the&nbsp;
whole group well it seems like now it's her turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:10.720
right whatever you might think about this though&nbsp;
this move i don't think it's a good idea remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:16.560
we are in a crocodile-infested area what's so&nbsp;
hard to understand about that i don't really know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:22.160
screw the car key okay you have bigger problems to&nbsp;
solve than recovering a key of a vehicle that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.440
can't reach but she does it anyway she enters the&nbsp;
lake even picks up the backpack rushes out because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:33.920
the croco is about to attack and of course she&nbsp;
slips and hits her head at the same time the poor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:39.200
injured victor comes down to rescue her he heaves&nbsp;
her up but hears a strange sound from the back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:44.800
hmm what could that be i better turn around&nbsp;
and keep staring at the water for no reason

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:57.600
and the next one completely avoidable but tell&nbsp;
me what you think three people left a short while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:03.200
later yolanda and eric joined back the next drama&nbsp;
is already cooking up as we know as they cross a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.320
small section of the lake jennifer is probably&nbsp;
already plotting her case against him and sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:13.520
enough as they arrive back and receive the sad&nbsp;
news about victory's death they're also confronted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:19.520
with the cheating allegation jennifer has cooked&nbsp;
up boom well what's your answer to that cowboy

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:30.640
it wasn't an affair it wasn't an affair it was&nbsp;
only a mistake oh well i'm sorry for accusing you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:36.560
i didn't know it was only a mistake please excuse&nbsp;
me okay looking at jennifer at this moment she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:42.240
was probably considering to push them backwards&nbsp;
into the lake i wouldn't blame her but there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:47.360
a better way believe me you see we want to get&nbsp;
out of here therefore we need a better strategy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:51.920
if we take on the shoes of jenny for a second&nbsp;
we're actually in a pretty good spot now because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:57.920
now we don't have to worry about anybody else but&nbsp;
ourselves we can safely sacrifice any of these too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:03.040
without overthinking too much and that's a&nbsp;
huge advantage after all our boyfriend has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:09.600
impregnated our friend that's right her child is&nbsp;
not victors but eric's what a nice extra twist i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:16.240
really like this part for some reason don't ask&nbsp;
me why but it's a nice twist now what i would do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:21.760
is carefully use those two to shield off any croco&nbsp;
attack i would do that in plain the manipulative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.080
victim while remaining cooperative without&nbsp;
doing anything that could lead to my own death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:31.040
here's what i would do i would request a knife&nbsp;
from eric he would naturally respond that he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:37.200
the most capable person having it and that is true&nbsp;
therefore he should lead the way perfect then i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.840
would go into the middle blaming yolanda at the&nbsp;
same time for the whole thing because it's easy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:47.760
to blame her now and at this point have her take&nbsp;
the spot at the rear boom we're safe but where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.240
are we heading well during the discussion about&nbsp;
the cheating eric spots an area on the surface of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.280
the lake where sun rays appear to come through&nbsp;
now that's a bit odd but let's roll with it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:02.000
so with my strategy from before i would make&nbsp;
my way over comfortably in the middle of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.800
two now that doesn't eliminate the risk but it&nbsp;
does minimize it however if you don't want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.440
use your cheating friends as bait because you&nbsp;
are a better person than i am then there is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:17.040
second choice bait the crocodile while being on&nbsp;
the shore and try to kill it off we don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:22.560
how many crocodiles are in the water but if we can&nbsp;
kill one we could bait the others with the carcass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:29.840
of it repeating the process in any way each croco&nbsp;
less equals a better chance for us to survive

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.280
when the trio swims to the sun beaming area&nbsp;
the predator attacks eric and death rolls him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:47.520
um to death uh yeah it's game over for him as&nbsp;
well two left will those two make it alive or not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:52.960
well we will see they are just barely able to swim&nbsp;
through and arrive at the weird intersection that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.840
in my opinion looks like a crocodile nest just&nbsp;
when you thought things couldn't get worse however&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.640
through a tiny slippage on the side they're&nbsp;
able to enter jungle pond and are back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:09.360
under the blue sky of australia congratulations&nbsp;
but it's not over yet nope the last part is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:14.480
little mundane but since we got this far we should&nbsp;
finish it off so you know exactly what happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:21.600
in the end so both girls get to the car at this&nbsp;
point i take it back okay good one for jenny to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:27.680
have retrieved the car keys although it cost life&nbsp;
so we could argue about that anyway as they enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:32.720
the car and start to drive the awkward silence&nbsp;
is even more uncomfortable than being stuck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.200
with giant water dragons not five minutes&nbsp;
later they crash into the very same lake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:43.200
where they have just escaped from because of&nbsp;
a tree obstructing the passage how about that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.840
now i don't want to go into details here but&nbsp;
driving as fast as here on this very off-road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:53.200
street takes the cake for me jesus that was&nbsp;
the silliest move so far they crash into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.400
water and are firmly stuck it takes a while but&nbsp;
they remember the gun inside the car compartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:03.520
but instead of shooting at the window and escaped&nbsp;
like james bond would they don't okay they wait&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:09.040
for the crocodile to open the door for them i&nbsp;
mean why not both escape to the shore but are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:14.560
attacked one last time jenny is able to shoot&nbsp;
more or less successfully and saves them both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:22.160
wow yeah that was the movie pretty decent and&nbsp;
i learned a lot more about crocodiles than i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:27.200
had expected now let me know what you think about&nbsp;
this video and about the movie if you have enjoyed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:33.280
it binge another one how about that and leave a&nbsp;
like thank you appreciate you being here peace
