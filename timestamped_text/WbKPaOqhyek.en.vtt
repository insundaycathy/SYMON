onto jax sonia's research has led her to find out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.400
about an ancient tournament known as mortal kombat&nbsp;

until kano states that he knows she is trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.160
make it the temple of raiden and he knows where&nbsp;
it is sonja lies to kano and offers him three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.760
million dollars to help guide her and call to the&nbsp;
location they head off into the desert where they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.160
are met by one of raiden's champions liu kang who&nbsp;
has fire abilities he explains to them the urgency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.520
of defending earth realm since they have lost nine&nbsp;
of the mortal combat tournaments and one more loss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.880
means shang tsung can arrive to conquer it liu&nbsp;
kang shows that he has rounded up the remaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.200
champions that he could including jax who is still&nbsp;
unconscious from his fight with sub-zero liu kang&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.880
assures sonia that the other people working in&nbsp;
the temple will do what they can do heal jax liu&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.840
kang brings cole sonia and kano to meet raiden who&nbsp;
is unimpressed by them before they begin training&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.440
sheng's son arrives at the temple with sub-zero&nbsp;
and his demonic henchwoman molina as sub-zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

lao shang tsung prepares his own attack but raiden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.680
steps out to remind him that it is forbidden to&nbsp;
claim victory before the tournament has begun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.560
he then creates a force field around the temple&nbsp;
to prevent the outworld villains from continuing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.080
their attack forcing them to leave liu begins to&nbsp;
train the champions by helping them unlock their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.640
inner power or arcana which is why he has fire&nbsp;
powers and raiden has lightning powers sonia is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:25.040
not allowed to join the others because she is not&nbsp;
one of the chosen champions she goes to jax's side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.960
where he is awake and discovers he has mechanical&nbsp;
arms although he attempts to make use of them he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.880
feels useless and weaker with them colin kano&nbsp;
get their asses beat by liu kang and kung lao&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.000
liu kang tries to help coal achieve his arcana&nbsp;
by figuring out what it is that drives him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.720
the fighters have dinner where kano runs his mouth&nbsp;
too much and liu kang and kung lao antagonize him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.200
by stating he is impulsive and powerless making&nbsp;
him an unworthy fighter kano snaps which actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.280
activates his arcana and causes him to fire a&nbsp;
laser beam from his right eye cole later talks to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.040
raiden about the dragon marking raiden explains to&nbsp;
call that he is descended from hanzo's bloodline&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.400
specifically from the baby that raiden rescued in&nbsp;
the beginning he also tells cold at the vision he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.760
sees as hanzo wandering through hell waiting&nbsp;
for the day he can get his revenge on sub-zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.800
when cole feels that he is not a worthy champion&nbsp;
raiden opens the portal to send him back to earth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.160
realm to be with ali and emily shung sun&nbsp;
gathers more fighters for his next attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.080
including the demon natara the monstrous prince&nbsp;
scorrow the brutish riako and the mercenary cable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.280
who has a personal grudge with kano since they&nbsp;
used to work together with the black dragon clan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.520
and kano left cable for dead forcing him to wear&nbsp;
his special new suit cable does also feel the kano&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.800
would be a good ally for shang tsung's army&nbsp;
cable meets kano at the temple and convinces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.640
him to defect and join forces with shang tsung&nbsp;
he uses his laser to destroy the force field&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.800
shang tsung and his minions attack the temple&nbsp;
while goro goes after cole and his family in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:09.200
attack sonia fights molina but the latter chooses&nbsp;
not to kill sonya because she is not a chosen one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:16.000
and feels her death would be a waste cable fights&nbsp;
liu kang and overpowers him jax fights ryko but is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.200
overpowered and the brute knocks him and sanyo out&nbsp;
before attempting to crush them under a boulder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.280
jax tries to lift the boulder off sonja which&nbsp;
helps him find his arcana and causes the arms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.640
to grow in size and strength natara swoops&nbsp;
down for an attack but kung lao fights her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:38.560
and performs a fatality by using his metal hat as&nbsp;
a buzzsaw slicing natara in half down the middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.400
flawless victory meanwhile goro is laying coal&nbsp;
into the dirt until he starts to make his way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.560
toward ali and emily feeling the need to protect&nbsp;
his family cole's arcana is unlocked with his body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.360
being covered in golden armor and allowing&nbsp;
him to create blades to help him fight goro&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.960
first slicing off one of his forearms and then&nbsp;
impaling him through the eyes to kill him raiden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:07.120
senses this and summons call back to the temple&nbsp;
revealing his bloodline to shang sun and sub-zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.720
raiden prepares to bring the champions to the void&nbsp;
for protection but shang xiangtsung grabs kung lao&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:19.200
and sucks his soul out killing him and forcing liu&nbsp;
kang to watch liu kang mourns his cousin while the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:25.280
rest of the heroes try to figure out a strategy&nbsp;
for fighting shang tsung's forces raiden presents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.040
cole with hanzo's kunai that was recovered after&nbsp;
his death and he encourages cole to use it cole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.920

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:48.000
although riaco tries to bring jax down with his&nbsp;
warhammer jax disarms him and uses his arms to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.080
turn ryako's head into paste sonia is sent back&nbsp;
to her trailer to fight kano which ends with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.760
impaling him through his eye and his marking is&nbsp;
passed down to her as cole is fighting molina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.280
sonia comes to help and uses her newfound arcana&nbsp;
powers to fire a plasma beam from her arms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:11.280
to blast a hole through molina's stomach liu&nbsp;
kang faces cable again and uses his own fatality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.040
a fire dragon move that consumes cable and&nbsp;
burns him to a crisp sub-zero goes to earth&nbsp;&nbsp;

realm and finds sally and emily where he freezes&nbsp;
them alive cole is summoned to fight sub-zero&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.320
but the villain proves to overpower him when&nbsp;
cole's blood touches the kunai this brings hanzo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:34.160
back from hell where he is revived as scorpion&nbsp;
he returns to battle his nemesis with cole's help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.560
scorpion uses his heat to revive ali and emily&nbsp;
before managing to trap sub-zero and use his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:46.880
own fire powers to burn sub-zero to death before&nbsp;
going back scorpion thanks cole for freeing him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.320
and asks him to keep his bloodline alive shang&nbsp;
tsung appears once more to retrieve the bodies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.920
of his fighters meaning they may be brought back&nbsp;
to life but raiden banishes him back to outworld&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.480
raiden then tells his champions that they are&nbsp;
victorious but they must gather more fighters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:08.320
for when shang tsung plans his next attack cola&nbsp;
