00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.440
Welcome back to Mrs Rundown, in todayâ€™s video I&nbsp;
am going to be recapping the events of Karate Kid,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.360
a 2010 Drama/Romance film. Spoilers ahead!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.520

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.000
12-year-old Dre Parker and his mother, Sherry,&nbsp;
arrive in Beijing from West Detroit to start a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.680
life. Dre develops a crush on a young violinist,&nbsp;
Mei Ying, who reciprocates his attention,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.720
but Cheng, a kung fu prodigy whose family is close&nbsp;
to Mei Ying's, attempts to keep them apart by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.920
beating Dre, and later harassing and humiliating&nbsp;
him in and around school. During a particularly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.480
brutal beating by Cheng and his friends, the&nbsp;
maintenance man of Dre's building, Mr. Han,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.680
comes to Dre's aid, revealing himself as a kung&nbsp;
fu master who adeptly dispatches Dre's tormentors.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.520
After Han mends Dre's injuries using&nbsp;
fire cupping, they go to Cheng's teacher,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.160
Master Li, to attempt to make peace, but the&nbsp;
brutal Li, who teaches his students to show no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.920
mercy to their enemies, challenges Dre to a fight&nbsp;
with Cheng. When Han declines, Li threatens him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.000
saying that they will not be allowed to leave his&nbsp;
school unless either Dre or Han himself fights.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.320
Han acquiesces, but insists the fight&nbsp;
take place at an upcoming tournament,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.480
and that Li's students leave Dre alone&nbsp;
until the tournament. The amused Li agrees.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.560
Han begins training Dre, but Dre is frustrated&nbsp;
that Han merely has Dre spend hours taking off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.920
his jacket, hanging it up, dropping it, and then&nbsp;
putting it back on again. After days of this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.560
Dre refuses to continue, until Han demonstrates&nbsp;
to him that the repetitive arm movements&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.720
in question were Han's method of teaching&nbsp;
Dre defensive block and strike techniques,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.880
which Dre is now able to display instinctively&nbsp;
when prompted by Han's mock attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.080
Han emphasizes that the movements Dre is learning&nbsp;
apply to life in general, and that serenity and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.560
maturity, not punches and power, are the&nbsp;
true keys to mastering the martial arts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.680
During one lesson in the Wudang Mountains, Dre&nbsp;
notices a female kung fu practitioner apparently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.080
copying the movements of a cobra before her, but&nbsp;
Han informs him that it was the cobra that was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.040
imitating the woman, as in a mirror reflection.&nbsp;
Dre wants Han to teach him this technique, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.000
includes linking Han's hand and feet to Dre's via&nbsp;
bamboo shafts while practicing their forms, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.160
Dre's subsequent attempt to use this reflection&nbsp;
technique on his mother is unsuccessful.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.840
As Dre's friendship with Mei Ying continues, she&nbsp;
agrees to attend Dre's tournament, as does Dre&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.880
her upcoming recital. Dre persuades Mei Ying&nbsp;
to cut school for a day of fun, but when she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.600
is nearly late for her violin recital, which has&nbsp;
been rescheduled for that day, she tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.840
her parents have deemed him a bad influence, and&nbsp;
forbid her from spending any more time with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.880
Later, when Dre finds Mr. Han despondent,&nbsp;
he learns that it is the anniversary of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.280
wife and son's deaths, which occurred years ago&nbsp;
when he lost control of his car while arguing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.080
with his wife. Dre reminds Han that one of his&nbsp;
lessons was in perseverance, and that Han needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.520
to heal from his loss, and tries to help him&nbsp;
do so. Han then assists Dre in reading a note,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.600
in Chinese, of apology to Mei Ying's father, who,&nbsp;
impressed, allows Mei to attend the tournament.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.840
At the tournament, the under-confident Dre&nbsp;
is slow to achieve parity with his opponents,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.720
but soon begins to beat them, and advances to&nbsp;
the semifinals, as does Cheng, who violently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.240
finishes off his opponents. Dre eventually comes&nbsp;
up against Liang, another of Master Li's students,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.440
who is instructed by Master Li to break Dre's&nbsp;
leg. When Liang insists that he can beat Dre,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.800
Master Li sternly tells him that he&nbsp;
doesn't want him beaten, but broken.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.800
During the match, Liang delivers&nbsp;
a devastating kick to Dre's leg,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.200
along with a series of brutal follow-up&nbsp;
punches. Although Liang is disqualified for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.680
his illegal strikes, Dre is incapacitated,&nbsp;
which would allow Cheng to win by default.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.600
Despite Han's insistence that he has earned&nbsp;
respect for his performance in the tournament,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.680
Dre convinces Han to use his fire cupping&nbsp;
technique to mend his leg, in order to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.200
the tournament to the end. Dre returns to the&nbsp;
arena, where he confronts Cheng. Dre delivers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.080
impressive blows, but Cheng counters with a&nbsp;
debilitating strike to Dre's already injured leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.000
Dre struggles to get up, and adopts the&nbsp;
one-legged form he first learned from the woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.160
on the mountain, attempting to use the reflection&nbsp;
technique to manipulate Cheng's movements.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.120
Cheng charges Dre, but Dre flips, and catches&nbsp;
Cheng with a kick to his head, winning the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.840
tournament, along with the respect of Cheng and&nbsp;
his classmates, both for himself and Mr. Han.
