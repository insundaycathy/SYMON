00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.510
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.080
Today, I'm going to explain a horror film
called "Anything for Jackson."

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.080
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.310
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.790
One morning, married couple Henry and Audrey
begin their day as usual in the kitchen.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.270
They're alerted by a sound outside and head
out to meet their guest eagerly.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.730
Moments later, the old couple drags a pregnant
woman inside.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.800
Despite her cries and kicks, the woman is
forced into the house's lift with the strange

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.560
couple as her captors.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.300
The pregnant woman, Shannon, wakes up to a
young boy caressing her face.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.120
He greets her "Aloha," unfazed by the bound
and gagged woman in his room.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.370
Sitting next to the bed is Audrey, who calls
to her husband before nervously reading a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.940
prepared script to inform her of their plans.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.170
After apologizing for kidnapping her, she
assures Shannon that they will not hurt her

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.620
or her unborn child but insists that there's
no hope for her to bargain or plead her way

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.390
out of the situation.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.760
As part of their preparations, Henry walks
out of the house and waits as Audrey removes

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.739
the gag on Shannon's mouth.

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.610
Shannon screams to the top of her lungs, but
outside, Henry doesn't hear anything.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.329
Their sound-proofing works.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.260
Audrey calmly explains that they intend to
bring their grandson, Jackson, back.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.650
Since Shannon can see the boy in the room,
Audrey hopes it's a good sign, meaning that

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.760
Jackson knows they're about to save him.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.770
When Jackson turns his head away, a large
wound on his head terrifies Shannon.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.640
Jackson died in an accident, and she sees
his ghost.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.040
Confused and horrified, Shannon yells for
help again after Audrey leaves, but her screams

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.030
reach no one's ears.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.500
Audrey heads downstairs to inform Henry that
Shannon can see Jackson's spirit.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.180
It gives the grandparents full of hope.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.910
But they need to keep up appearances and continue
with their lives normally to avoid raising

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.280
suspicions.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.970
Heading to his car, Henry finds their neighbor,
Rory, who offers to shovel the snow on their

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.310
front lawn.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.810
Henry refuses, excusing that his wife is sick
and shouldn't be disturbed.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.270
But this is only to keep Rory away from their
house, just in case.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.610
Back in the room, Shannon tries to pry herself
off the cuffs when Audrey returns with some

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.420
water and vitamins.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.880
Understandably, Shannon refuses to take them.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.840
Audrey checks Shannon's coat pocket, taking
her phone and a bottle of her own medicine.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.420
Shannon attempts to call on her cellphone,
but Audrey pries it off her hands.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.869
Seeing the nanny cam over the bed, she realizes
that it was just a ruse to get Shannon's pin

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.700
code to unlock her phone.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.059
Using Shannon's phone, Audrey signs in to
a dating app and posts on her social media

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:12.760
to avoid her friends and family from looking
for her.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.879
At the clinic, Henry's secretary, Talia, insists
that Shannon, who is his patient, rescheduled

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.650
her appointment with him that day.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.830
On the spot, he lies that he met Shannon that
morning, and she told him that she wouldn't

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.739
make her appointment today.

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.040
Weeks before, Audrey tests her theory on a
resurrection spell with Henry as her witness.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.489
Finding a dead crow in the snow, she drops
her blood on its body and reads from an ancient

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.489
book.

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.290
Upon finishing the spell, the crow wakes up
and caws.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.440
Audrey reveals that she's been bringing dead
animals back to life, giving them a way to

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.139
get their grandson back.

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.400
In the present day, Audrey and Henry meet
up at the community center as part of their

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.760
weekly routine.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.430
They meet a young man named Ian, whom Henry
asked to find a book before.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.340
Audrey is displeased that Henry mentioned
the book to Ian, whom she thinks may tattle

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.239
on them if things go south.

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.390
Audrey, Henry, and Ian join a group cloaked
in black.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.579
The group's leader, Yolanda, regards Ian with
distaste.

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.879
Together, they light black candles and pray
to the devil.

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.620
Months before, when Shannon first learns of
her pregnancy from Henry, the news frightens

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.620
her.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.389
The child was conceived in a one-night fling
with a stranger, and she isn't open to getting

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.389
rid of it.

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.449
But she isn't ready to raise a child either,
fearing that her mother will call her a failure.

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.680
Henry encourages her to take the next step
in her life, but in reality, he's set his

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.319
eyes on her as their target.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.389
He takes her photo, which now is framed in
the bedroom where Shannon is cuffed.

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.989
Shannon sleeps quietly in the dim, candlelit
room until she coughs up blood.

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.730
At the foot of the bed, a sigil is drawn on
the floor.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.199
At the center of the sigil are a heart and
one of Jackson's toys beside it.

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:41.209
Henry calms Shannon down as Audrey draws an
upside-down cross on Shannon's forehead.

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.449
The couple prays and drips their blood on
the heart.

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:48.199
The light flickers, and Shannon abruptly stops,
arching her back as she struggles to breathe.

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:52.180
Audrey prays, and the room becomes alive;
the heart on the sigil begins to steam.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.589
At the corner of the room, they see Jackson's
spirit pointing at something.

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:59.119
But the couple doesn't notice this, as they're
excited to see their grandson.

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:02.519
One of the boards from the window flies open,
and Jackson disappears.

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.290
Henry goes to pick it up then sees something
behind Audrey.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.229
Audrey turns and finds a tall demonic creature
standing behind her.

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.269
She screams, backing away in fear.

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.620
The creature hovers over Shannon, who continues
to convulse in bed.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.139
Her framed picture now bears a mark on the
forehead.

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.459
The creatures disappear, and Shannon falls
unconscious.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.590
Henry checks on the baby's heartbeat, unconcerned
about the mother.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.639
Audrey is convinced that Jackson has successfully
possessed the unborn child.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.830
On the following day, Henry wakes up alone
in bed, dazed by last night's events.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.560
He finds his wife in the bathroom, brushing
her teeth.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.069
His phone rings, and it's Audrey on the other
line.

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.889
Confused, he looks to the woman in the bathroom,
who slowly faces him, teeth falling on the

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:39.919
floor.

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.120
Henry screams as the woman with a bloodied
mouth stares at him expectantly.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.120
He covers his face when the woman nears him.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.479
Audrey finds him, shaking in fear, and the
bloodied woman has disappeared.

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.889
That evening, Henry meets Detective Bellows
in his clinic, who's investigating Shannon's

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.259
disappearance.

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.439
Henry tells the detective that Shannon canceled
her appointment on the day she went missing,

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:01.580
and Talia adds that Henry claimed to have
talked to Shannon that day.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.740
Without time to think much further, Henry
tells Detective Bellows that Shannon passed

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.639
by his house that day.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.830
Henry calls Audrey to tell her what happened.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.009
Audrey panics as the notion of Shannon walking
by their house that day was not part of their

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:13.050
plan.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.710
Audrey drops the call when someone knocks
on the door.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.500
Expecting that it's the detective, she finds
a girl in a ghost costume instead, asking,

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.000
"trick or treat."

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.590
Audrey is offended and shuts the door, only
for someone to knock on the back door.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.569
Slowly, she heads to open it and finds the
same child.

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.979
After closing the door, the girl appears in
the bathroom, and Audrey rushes upstairs to

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.270
call for help.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.979
She watches the girl run around the house
while waiting for Henry to answer his phone.

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.580
Henry finally picks up, and Audrey tells him
that "she's" trying to get her.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.270
In an ominous tone, Henry suggests that Audrey
offers her soul.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.160
He repeats "trick or treat" on the phone,
clearly not her real husband.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.389
Audrey calls the lift, only to find a tall
figure wearing a ghost costume come out and

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:50.629
chase her.

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:53.710
Audrey collapses on the steps, frightened
as the figure approaches.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.009
But instead, the costume falls on her.

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.759
She clutches to the fabric, weeping in fear.

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.479
Later that evening, Audrey explains to Shannon
that her daughter came by to see her.

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.999
Her daughter used to dress up as a ghost for
Halloween every year, despite Audrey offering

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:07.409
other costumes.

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.690
When asked where her daughter is now, Audrey
changes the topic and leaves to bake cookies

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.230
for Jackson.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.340
While alone, Shannon rocks the bed back and
forth until the teddy bear with the nanny

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.370
cam drops from the shelf above.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.139
She tries to pry her hand off the cuff but
stops when she hears the floor creak.

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.840
Seeing no one, she uses her teeth to undo
the belt binding the cuff to the bed.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.639
She tries the other side and yelps when a
man with a plastic bag over his head appears.

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.349
The man crawls to the other side of the room,
then scrambles back towards her.

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:35.129
Shannon screams for help, but Audrey cannot
open the door.

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:38.699
The man bites Shannon's pregnant stomach just
as Audrey finally opens the door.

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:40.940
Seeing her, the man marches towards Audrey.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.249
When Henry finds them, the man disappears.

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:46.319
After stitching up Shannon's wound, Henry
joins his wife in bed.

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:50.919
Audrey, who's been confident up until this
point, is now worried that they made a mistake.

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:55.590
Weeks ago, Henry met Shannon in front of his
house as she power walks as part of her exercise.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.460
Despite her fears upon learning of the pregnancy,
Shannon was finally excited to raise the child.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.560
At present, the couple finds crows gathering
around their house, wondering if it's because

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.879
of their spell.

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:08.560
Henry hurries back inside upon seeing Rory's
van pulling up their driveway.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.340
Audrey heads to Shannon to sedate her while
Henry deals with the persistent neighbor.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.139
Taking Rory outside, Henry learns that Rory's
life is falling apart, which is why he insists

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:18.750
on clearing their driveway to keep himself
busy.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.610
Feeling guilty about unloading on the doctor,
Rory offers to do it for free.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.900
While the couple argues inside, Rory plows
the snow outside.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.300
With everything they planned falling apart,
Audrey doubts that Jackson succeeded in possessing

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.470
the baby.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.909
Henry encourages her, promising her that once
they have Jackson back, he'll burn down the

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:35.849
house along with the ghosts in it.

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:39.669
Rory calls to the couple, smiling as he tells
them that they did it right and that Jackson

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:40.669
is inside.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.460
Possessed, Rory drives his head into the snowplow,
spraying blood on the driveway.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.410
That evening, Audrey tends to Shannon despite
the woman's refusal.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.759
Seeing the wounds around her wrist, Audrey
removes the cuffs, much to Shannon's surprise.

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:55.710
Audrey covers the cuffs in knitted fabric
to make them more comfortable before placing

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.130
them back on.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.009
Shannon asks her if they'll kill her once
they have the baby back.

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:02.249
Audrey promises that they will not hurt her.

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:06.229
As Audrey talks about her daughter again,
the door opens, and a man peeks inside, unnoticed

00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:07.569
by the two women.

00:08:07.569 --> 00:08:11.880
When Shannon asks if they tried to bring their
daughter back, Audrey answers that she cannot.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.469
Audrey's daughter was also in the accident
that killed Jackson.

00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:16.520
She survived but was left paralyzed.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.860
The couple tried their best to help their
daughter, but it was beyond their control.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.460
Their daughter ended her life, unable to cope
with the death of her son.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.439
Looking to the positive side, Audrey believes
that her daughter would be happy that at least

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:28.300
they're bringing Jackson back.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:33.219
The next day, Henry buries Rory's body in
the snow, struggling due to his weakened condition.

00:08:33.219 --> 00:08:36.130
Detective Bellows calls him, insisting on
meeting in his house to discuss Shannon's

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.130
disappearance.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.909
Backed to a corner, Henry screams into the
wilderness in frustration.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:44.390
Back at the house, Shannon offers to be Jackson's
mother once he's born.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.500
Audrey thinks it's a trick, but Shannon insists
that she understands how a mother would do

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.800
anything for their child.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.839
She points out that they need help caring
for the child, as Audrey and Henry are old.

00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:56.449
Audrey considers this, but her thoughts are
interrupted by a knock on the front door.

00:08:56.449 --> 00:09:00.079
She heads out of the room, confused that the
bedroom door is ajar, before locking Shannon

00:09:00.079 --> 00:09:01.079
inside.

00:09:01.079 --> 00:09:03.209
The door opens again after she leaves.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:06.850
Outside, Henry hurries back into the house
and sees that the detective's car is already

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.139
parked inside.

00:09:08.139 --> 00:09:11.570
He rushes to the bedroom, finding Bellows
already there, with Audrey cuffed and on the

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:12.570
floor.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.750
While Bellows has Henry at gunpoint, Shannon
begs for her to free her.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.800
The detective tries to calm her down before
pointing the gun under her chin and pulling

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.220
the trigger.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.440
Shannon cries, watching her hope perish.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.300
With the detective gone, Henry frees his wife
and asks if Bellows called for backup.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.120
Assuring him that she didn't, they drag the
woman's body out of the room.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.600
After getting rid of the body, Henry becomes
agitated at the turn of events.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.250
Audrey raises her conversation with Shannon,
but someone knocks on the door.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.350
It's Ian who asks if they have the book.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.839
The couple shows Ian the spellbook, recounting
how Henry got it from a man in Jerusalem who

00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:46.079
was eager to give it to him at the cost of
their entire retirement fund.

00:09:46.079 --> 00:09:49.730
Ian tries to translate it, hoping to confirm
if the spell they did is correct.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.269
Ian reads the page where they got the spell,
asking them the specific details of their

00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:54.269
summoning.

00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:57.029
He tells them that when they summoned the
demon to bring their grandson back, they also

00:09:57.029 --> 00:10:00.829
opened the door allowing all souls from Purgatory
to enter and find a host.

00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:03.920
They introduce Ian to Shannon, the host that
they used for the summoning.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.009
Ian looks around the bedroom, searching every
corner for signs.

00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:10.161
He reveals that they did the right spell,
but it's only half the ceremony, and they

00:10:10.161 --> 00:10:12.149
need to finish it by trading a life.

00:10:12.149 --> 00:10:15.390
Ian offers to help but in exchange for the
book and ten thousand dollars.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.170
In the meantime, he advises them to use salt
to prevent the ghosts from approaching them.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.149
That evening, Henry stays in the bedroom to
guard Shannon, having laid down a salt line

00:10:23.149 --> 00:10:25.170
before the door as a precaution.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.480
Shannon asks how many lives are needed to
sacrifice to bring their son back.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.470
But Henry doesn't falter, having already sold
his soul.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.990
Henry confesses that Audrey was driving the
day of the accident and hadn't recovered from

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.990
it.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.420
Loving his wife deeply, he is willing to go
down in flames with her if he cannot help

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.420
her recover.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.959
Bellows' ghost approaches Henry and pulls
the trigger on herself again, shocking him

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:44.630
and waking up Audrey.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.360
Shannon is unfazed, hoping that the couple
will be haunted for the rest of their lives.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.230
Ian prepares for the ritual at his mother's
basement but gets angered when his mother

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.290
calls him.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.699
Tired of her yelling, Ian packs up.

00:10:54.699 --> 00:10:58.480
On the next day, Ian returns to the Walsh's
house, but nobody answers the door.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.370
He heads up the bedroom with Bellow's ghost
following him behind.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:05.000
The spirit shoots herself again, but the couple
isn't surprised anymore, as the ghost has

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.540
been repeating this all night.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.450
Ian adds blood to the salt line they laid
down, saying that it would stop the ghosts.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.949
This is proven effective, as Bellows walks
by again, but she doesn't enter the room for

00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:16.209
the first time and instead walks away.

00:11:16.209 --> 00:11:19.839
Ian shows Audrey the book's page to copy the
sigil and takes Henry outside to set up the

00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:20.839
house.

00:11:20.839 --> 00:11:23.880
Ian warns Henry not to hesitate when it's
time to end Shannon, warning him not to doubt

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.190
the demon.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.470
In the bedroom, Audrey draws the sigil in
blood and lies to Shannon that they intend

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.170
to keep her as the baby's mother.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.839
Shannon, however, is not convinced.

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:36.820
She asks Audrey for some food, and as soon
as she's gone, Shannon gnaws herself free.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:40.430
She frees one hand and spills water on herself
before breaking the glass.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.399
When Audrey comes back, Shannon tells her
that her water broke, causing the woman to

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:45.399
panic.

00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:48.400
Outside, Ian rants about the disrespect he
gets in their church, which Henry agrees to

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.560
appease him.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.389
Henry receives a message from Yolanda just
before they're called back to the bedroom

00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:53.819
by Audrey.

00:11:53.819 --> 00:11:57.540
Back in the bedroom, Shannon pretends to be
in labor, making everyone on edge.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.740
Ian accidentally breaks the salt line before
starting the spell.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.839
Henry receives a message from Yolanda again,
but given the events, he ignores her.

00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:07.860
Ian continues the spell, causing the floor
to creak.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.120
Henry finally answers Yolanda's call, who's
hysterically telling him that Ian killed his

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.009
mother last night and drew symbols on the
wall of his house.

00:12:14.009 --> 00:12:16.889
With this information, Henry grows suspicious
of Ian.

00:12:16.889 --> 00:12:19.610
He quietly warns Audrey while Ian carves on
his feet.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:24.069
With his blood, Ian leaves a trail of upside-down
crosses before continuing the spell.

00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:26.850
Shannon slips out of her broken cuffs with
everyone distracted and takes the shard of

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.810
glass she hid under the pillow.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.500
Shannon grabs Audrey and holds the glass to
her neck, ordering Henry to free her.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.020
Audrey and Ian tell him not to free Shannon,
but seeing his wife in danger, Henry starts

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.639
undoing Shannon's bindings.

00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:41.399
Angered, Ian takes the keys from Henry's hands
and tosses them away.

00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:44.500
Shannon grabs the keys, but Ian pries them
off her hands.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.580
Knowing that things aren't going according
to plan, Audrey begs Ian to help them return

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:52.270
their grandson, but he stabs her in the stomach,
using her as the sacrifice instead of Shannon.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.230
Henry cradles Audrey in his arms as she passes
out from blood loss.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.490
Ian sprinkles them with his blood, revealing
that his true intention is to give the demon

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.769
a home.

00:12:59.769 --> 00:13:03.709
With his wife in his arms, Henry whispers
to her, unable to accept her fate.

00:13:03.709 --> 00:13:07.090
Audrey mumbles, trying to hold onto life while
Shannon continues to free herself from the

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.090
bed.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:11.610
Finally, Audrey succumbs to her wound, and
Henry whispers, "I love you" to her.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:15.029
The sigil on the floor burns, and Ian is excited
to meet the demon.

00:13:15.029 --> 00:13:18.710
But Shannon, having freed both hands from
the bed, stabs him on the leg, distracting

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:19.710
him.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.079
A ghost with no eyes grabs Ian and kisses
him before taking him away.

00:13:23.079 --> 00:13:26.579
Shannon stretches her arms out desperately
to reach for the keys to free her other leg.

00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:29.620
The ghost with a bag on his face comes out
from under the bed again, hovering over the

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.980
pregnant woman.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.269
She hears her chains clatter on the floor,
finally free from the bed after Henry helps

00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:35.389
her.

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:39.620
Upon losing his wife, Henry chooses to free
Shannon and finish the nightmare he started.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:43.000
Shannon tries to get him to run with her,
but Henry vomits blood and backs away.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.089
Terrified, Shannon leaves the room as a creature
comes out of Henry's body.

00:13:47.089 --> 00:13:51.160
Shaking in fear, Shannon heads down the stairs,
chased by the ghost that took Ian away.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.530
In the bathroom, she sees the child with the
Halloween costume and the woman with falling

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:55.530
teeth.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.740
She tries to head out from the backdoor but
is blocked by the tall ghost.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.090
Upstairs, the room is soaked in blood.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:05.100
The old couple lies on the floor while a horned,
pregnant woman walks around.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.800
In the kitchen, Shannon finds Bellows' ghost
and car keys on the breakfast table.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.129
She reaches out to grab it, but the detective's
ghost wakes up, telling her that she can help

00:14:12.129 --> 00:14:14.399
before shooting herself again.

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:18.009
Making her way outside, Shannon sees Rory's
body using the snowplow.

00:14:18.009 --> 00:14:19.959
She ignores him and heads for the car.

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:23.879
Looking back to the house, she spots Jackson's
ghost in the bedroom window.

00:14:23.879 --> 00:14:26.769
Finally free, Shannon drives down the road,
heaving.

00:14:26.769 --> 00:14:30.279
After a few minutes of driving, her eyes widen,
and she stops the car.

00:14:30.279 --> 00:14:33.589
Down the road, she sees the horned, pregnant
woman blocking her way.

00:14:33.589 --> 00:14:36.160
The creature slowly turns away as if letting
her leave.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.319
But Shannon feels something in her belly.

00:14:38.319 --> 00:14:48.290
Looking down on her pregnant body, she wonders
about the child she's carrying.
