00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.440
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.740
Everyone’s has fantasies,

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.620
it's when they come to light that they get us in trouble

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.100
This is Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.580
So the movie begins with Dr. Bill Harford and
Alice Harford getting ready

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.560
for a Christmas party hosted by the bill’s client: Victor Ziegler

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.380
As they leave, they check in with their daughter
and the babysitter

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.900
and then head to the fancy Christmas party

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.260
with live music, drinks and dances

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.380
yet the Hartford's know nobody there except

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.560
for a Mr. Ziegler, Bill’s client, who invites
them every year.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.180
As they dance, Bill recognizes the pianist
as Nick, an old friend who dropped out from

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.329
med school and goes to talk to him as Alice
goes to the ‘bathroom’,

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:42.460
downing a drink as she does so.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.620
Bill’s conversation with Nick reveals that
Nick now works at the Sonata Cafe, and tells him

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.120
to drop by when he has time.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.600
All the while, Alice stands aloof and away
from the crowd

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.980
drinking her champagne and the thing about aloof women?

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.020
Some guys see them as a challenge much like this man,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.120
Sander Szavost:

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.720
a well-read, charming Hungarian whose
interest in Alice is very apparent

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.600
and although he can’t take her out, he can ask for a dance.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.380
As they dance, Alice sees Bill chatting it
up with some broads in the reflection of a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.570
mirror and Sander can’t help but ask Alice
why she would settle for someone like Bill

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.280
when she could have any man in the world?

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.479
Meanwhile, Bill walks arm-in-arm being lead
away by the women who coil around him like

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.799
two snakes but before anything can happen
he is asked to meet Mr. Ziegler.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.800
Mr. Ziegler wanted Bill’s help since his
lady friend, Mandy has a problem.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.530
She had a bad reaction after shooting up with
heroin and coke and since Bill’s a doctor,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.870
he can give her a checkup.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.100
and when we see her lying there, she’s lying
in the same way as the painting behind Ziegler.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.660
As Bill examines her, Sander and Alice are
still dancing, Alice in a drunken stupor getting

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.600
closer and closer to Sander

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.820
until Sander invites her upstairs
to see a collection of bronze sculptures.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.720
She leans in, and makes her decision:

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.440
Not tonight

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.340
but leaves with a flirty goodbye.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.780
Bill concludes that Mandy’s condition is
stable and she’ll be okay after an hour

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.149
or so but she needs to lay off the drugs;
Ziegler’s extremely grateful and asks Bill

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.939
to keep this a secret between them although
he shouldn’t have to since they’re friends.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.740
So in case you missed that, Ziegler is a man
who cannot be trusted.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.800
He had Bill come up ‘to talk’ to him when in actuality he needed someone

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.460
to give Mandy a checkup.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.240
Ziegler than makes Bill keep this a secret from everyone else

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.600
because  it would have made him (Ziegler) look bad.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.620
He has many such secrets soon to be revealed.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.420
Back home, Bill passionately kisses Alice,

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.960
both of them nude and ready for love,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.250
But Alice looks at her reflection, and you can
tell she’s either unhappy or frustrated

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.430
about something and she is clearly hiding
it from Bill.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.360
The next day, Bill goes to work as Alice stays
at home and we see the difference of their

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.099
lives: the dull, domestic life of Alice in
contrast with the lively, professional life

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.099
of Bill.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.659
That evening they smoke a joint, and chill
in their room.

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.530
Under the influence of marijuana, Alice has
the courage to ask Bill if he slept with those

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.580
two girls he was hitting on at the party.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.780
Bill denies that he was hitting on anyone:
he was busy helping Ziegler to do anything,

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.460
which brings up the question:

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.880
Who was she dancing with?

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.660
Well, just a guy who wanted sex

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.620
Bill admits that ‘it’s understandable
since Alice is so beautiful’.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.700
And Alice flabbergasted, asks him if he meant
to say that men only want to approach her

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.640
because she’s beautiful and Bill kind of
admits it.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.700
It’s not black and white but you know how
men are.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.860
From here, the conversation devolves into an
argument with Alice trying to get Bill to

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.600
admit that he does feel sexual attraction
for women;

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.100
that somewhere inside him is a desire to cheat.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.519
Finally, Alice asks the question: Why doesn’t
Bill feel jealous of other men that hit on

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.240
Alice?

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.080
Because I- I believe in you Alice! You're faithful.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.900
and she breaks down laughing,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.879
"Are you kidding me, Bill?" leaving Bill confused

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.920
And then sh explains why she' laughing

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.480
last summer at Cape Codd, she saw a young stud

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.940
of a naval officer and although Bill and Alice
made love that summer,

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.060
she couldn’t stop thinking about the naval officer.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.280
She admits that she was ready to break up
their marriage, and leave everything she has

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.380
if that naval officer asked her to do so.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.940
It’s a revelation that shatters Bill’s
faith

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.780
but their conversation is interrupted as Bill answers the phone.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.000
(By the way, throughout this movie, in high stress situations for Bill, something

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.320
interrupts him usually a phone or a doorbell
ringing)

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.849
It's about his patient, Lou Nathanson who has died and

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.280
Bill has to go over.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.890
As he rides in the taxi, he can’t help but
think about the sailor and Alice.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.760
It’s a haunting obsession that he can’t
shake off.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.710
Bill arrives to find Nathan dead in bed and
his daughter, Marion, waiting for him.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.640
Her father’s death was a surprise and as
Marion rambles on, the death of her father

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.760
not quite hitting her yet,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.030
she talks about her boyfriend, Carl: they’re going to get

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.390
married soon, and leave for Michigan and out
of nowhere she starts kissing him, telling

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.050
Bill, she loves him. "I love you! I love you!" All the while
Bill tries to convince Marion that she’s

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.540
making the wrong choice, in fact they barely
know each other but she doesn’t care.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.500
Until the doorbell rings (and you see now this time it's a doorbell)

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.160
This time it's Carl, Marion's boyfriend.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.350
who enters and gives his condolences and Bill takes that

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.360
as an excuse to leave as Marion stays haunted
by her lust.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.760
So in case you hadn't noticed

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.760
Bill and Alice's relationship is mirrored by that of Carl and Marion's

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.000
Where Bill is Marion's 'version', of Alice's naval officer fantasy

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.580
Marion's sexual attraction to Bill is her secret that only Bill and her know

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.880
As Bill walks, he can’t stop thinking about
what Alice told him:

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.420
her sexual fantasy echoing in his head

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.560
but as he walks he’s approached by a prostitute
named Domino.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.460
Who persuades him to come into her apartment.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.070
Where they ‘negotiate the price’ for sex,
meanwhile Alice is stuck at home unaware of

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.640
what’s going on and calls Bill just before
they start. (There it is again)

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.320
She wants to know when he’s coming back
from visiting Marion and her dead dad and

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.730
he lies to her, telling her he’s unsure
when it will end and that he’s waiting for

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.200
more relatives to arrive.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.440
After the call ends, Bill has second thoughts
and leaves Domino with 150 bucks without having

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.650
any sex.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.370
His walk from the apartment takes him to the
Sonata Café where Nick the Pianist plays

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.370
and they chat.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.730
We learn that Nick’s family lives in Seattle
while he’s here working some interesting

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.840
music gigs.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.840
Interesting since he plays at a new place
every time never knowing until the last moment

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.230
where he’s supposed to play and with a blindfold
on.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.230
Strange right?

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.570
Even stranger since at the last gig he played
at, the blindfold came loose and he saw some

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.340
dropdead gorgeous gals and Bill's like

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.060
"Wait, what are you talking about? Dude, I NEED to come to that 'party'."

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.371
As he talks, Nick writes down ‘Fidelio’,
the password for his next gig, and gives him (Bill)

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.860
The address and tells him to get a costume and mask since everyone is wearing one at the party.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.280
Bill goes to a costume rental outlet where
an old friend runs the Rainbow Costume Rental

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.270
Service, only to find out from the current
owner, Mr. Milich, that his ‘old friend’

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.040
moved out and no longer owns it.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.620
After bribing Millich to get in, Milich searches
for the outfit Bill wants, but both of them

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.040
hear something.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.790
Milich walks into another room to find his
daughter and 2 elderly men half-naked and

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.840
he locks the men inside the room (threatening
to call the police) as his daughter runs out.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.320
As Milich searches for the outfit, his daughter
whispers into Bill’s ear “You should have

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.000
a cloak lined with ermine” and coyly walks
away, with a knowing smile.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.960
That's girl talk for "I think you need a nice outfit"

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.990
With his costume ready, Bill takes a taxi

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.000
to the address of Nick’s next gig, still
haunted by what Alice told him.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.580
He arrives to find 2 men waiting outside a
gate, and gives them the password "Fidelio"

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.860
when he is taken inside the mansion; where inside masked men wait

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.890
and welcome guests and Bill finds himself
walking in on a group of cloaked figures,

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.180
standing around an inner circle of equally
cloaked figures with a person in red

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.010
chanting and swinging a smoking censure
in the middle.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:30.200
The person chants eerily as Nick plays blindfolded
and Bill can only watch as the inner ring

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.680
of figures undress revealing themselves to be women.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.600
As this is going on, 2 people turn to stare
down at Bill, nodding their heads.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.790
Before focusing on the ritual, which has changed:
every time the crimson figure stamps their

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:47.060
staff, one of the masked women stand up and
choose someone from amongst the group and

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.730
one of them choose Bill.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.401
The Masked Woman can tell he’s never done
this before and warns him to leave, because

00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:55.090
he’s in danger and there might not be another
chance to get away.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.960
Only for the woman to be taken away by another
masked man who is part of the staff.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.320
Alone, Bill walks deeper into mansion watching
partyguests engaging in all kinds of wild

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.600
sex and as he stares dumbfounded

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.820
the masked woman from earlier leads him away

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.650
and tells him he needs to get out now!

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:15.010
He has to leave alone because if she comes
with him it could cost her: her life and maybe

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.680
his and she leaves before he can unmask her.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.600
Just in time for a masked butler to come and
tell Bill that his taxi cab wants a word

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.180
with him.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:26.280
Except Bill is taken back to the room from
earlier, the crimson cloaked figure, speaks

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.410
in a man’s voice, inviting him ‘to come
forward’.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:34.810
Everyone stares at him as he walks, closing
off any exits, and now the interrogation begins.

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:38.960
The crimson man asks him for the password
and Bill says it “Fidelio” but then the

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.539
crimson man asks Bill for the password ‘for
the house’ and Bill can only lie saying

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:47.700
“I’ve forgotten it”, there’s an audible
gasp when the partygoers hear this.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.700
He’s asked to unmask and undress.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:54.160
Yes, that’s right, get naked in front of
everyone here but Bill is saved at the last

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.930
moment when the Masked Woman comes to his rescue.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.630
She offers herself up in his place, in their
words to ‘redeem’ him, sacrificing herself,

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:07.720
so they set Bill free with a warning: Don’t
tell anyone about this, because there will

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.450
be consequences for Bill and his family.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.990
The woman is led away and Bill can’t help
but ask what’s going to happen to her.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.920
Nothing that concerns you, now go.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.780
Interestingly enough, this whole orgy party thing is very reminiscent of the stories about secret societies

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.280
Where the rich and powerful get together and hangout, throwing wild sex parties

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.660
or indulge in occult rituals

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.700
Back home,

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:34.340
As Bill, lays down in bed, Alice is sleep-laughing
when she’s woken up by Bill and tells him

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:35.350
about her dream.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:39.950
In her dream, they were in a deserted city,
naked and afraid, and she was angry at Bill

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:43.710
thinking it was his fault that they were here
who in the dream ran away to find their clothes.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:48.120
But as soon as Bill ran away, the nightmare
changed with Alice laying naked in the middle

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.710
of the woods visited by the naval officer
who only came to laugh and look at her.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.830
She stops herself; But Bill knows that’s
not the end of the dream and asks her how

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.710
it ended and she doesn’t want to do it.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.790
In her words it was awful; its only after
hugging him that she tells Bill that the officer

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.570
made love to her and then suddenly there was
a crowd of people around them, all of them

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.040
having an orgy, and having sex with Alice,
laughing at Bill.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.040
In her dream.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.650
But was it only a dream?

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.100
Alice’s dream is eerily similar to what happened at the party.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.000
But what exactly does this mean?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.010
Is Alice just guilty over her confessed sexual desires?

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.150
Was she at the party?

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:26.580
Or is this coincidence, karma striking back at Bill through Alice's dream?

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.500
Keep this in mind, this will come into play later

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.630
Back to the movie.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.290
The next day Bill manages to find out where
Nick is staying.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:37.481
But when he gets there, Bill is told Nick
checked out at 5 and didn’t even leave a

00:10:37.481 --> 00:10:38.830
forwarding address.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.340
That’s strange, was Nick acting weird when
he checked out?

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:46.260
and the receptionist confides with Bill that
Nick came in at 4:30 with 2 burly dudes, and

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.640
Nick had a bruised cheek and he was terrified.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.980
Nick went up to his room with one of the guys
while the other guy stayed downstairs and paid the bill.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.220
But when Nick came down he tried to pass the
receptionist an envelope except it was taken

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.500
by the men and together they drove off without
a trace.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.960
Bill goes back to the costume shop and returns
everything but the mask.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.010
Huh, must've lost it, just put it on the bill
and just as Milich calculates the bill, his

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.820
daughter comes in and the two guys from the
night before are also there.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.220
Mr. Milich, weren’t you going to call the
police on these men?

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:18.690
Well, we’ve come to a different agreement
and if you ever need anything Mr. Doctor–

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.680
anything at all – come back again.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.230
at work can’t help but reflect
on Alice and the sailor.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.790
As well as the party, he needs to know what
happened last night, and cancels all appointments

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.430
for the afternoon as he heads back to the
mansion.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.780
As he approaches the gates, the security camera
watches him, and a car drives up and its driver

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:36.780
comes out.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.250
Handing Bill an envelope with a letter that
warns him to back off from trying to find

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.910
out about last night and the orgy-cult.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.480
May this be the last warning, Bill needs.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.260
Bill decides to visit the prostitute from
earlier, Domino but when he rings her doorbell,

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:52.240
she’s gone and only her roommate, Sally, is there.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.420
Who invites him in.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.980
Inside, he asks Sally the roommate when Domi
no will be back and her answer is:

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.260
she might not be back.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:04.560
Sally reveals that Domino tested positive
for HIV+. and after a moment, Bill takes that

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.560
as his cue to leave.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.420
As he’s walking, a suspicious man follows
him, and Bill checks several times to see

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.480
if this guy’s following him, stopping to
buy a newspaper and keep his eye on his stalker.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.680
The guy following is particular to stop below
a lamppost, staring directly at Bill before

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.040
finally walking away without a word.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.910
Thoroughly spooked, Bill walks into a coffee
shop where he reads the newspaper to find

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:29.080
a shocking headline: ex-beauty queen hospitalized.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.450
The beauty queen in question?

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:35.710
Amanda Curran, a.k.a. Mandy from the Christmas
Party who almost overdosed to death.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.560
Bill goes to the hospital where’s she’s
hospitalized only to find out that Amanda

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.860
died earlier.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.740
He can’t believe it and goes to the morgue
to see her body and he remembers what the

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.300
masked woman told him at the orgy:

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.080
It would cost me, my life and maybe yours.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.810
In case it wasn’t clear: Bill believes that
the Masked Woman at the Mansion party is Amanda

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:54.810
Curran.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:58.100
This would explain why the Masked Woman saved Bill's Life

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.650
Amanda felt indebted to Bill

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.560
after he saved her life at the Christmas
Party.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.460
But they are not identical in body, so who is she?

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.100
We're gonna find out who she is real son

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.720
As Bill leaves the hospital, he's called over to visit Ziegler for a little chat

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.080
Because Ziegler's not happy with Bill: he was there at the mansion 'that night'

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.120
and since then, Bill has gotten a lot of people in trouble with his investigation into NIck

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.960
So you might be wondering how does Ziegler know this? Ziegler had Bill followed

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.120
Then Ziegler starts answering Bill's questions

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.320
Where did Nick go?

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.900
He's probably on a plane back to Seattle to go to his family

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.300
What about the bruises on his face?
It was a light punishment

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.160
Who were those people at the party?
Powerful people that could get Bill into a lot of trouble

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.900
How did they know Bill was there?

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.000
For 1, they tricked Bill into believing that there was a second password

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.280
Secondly, he arrived in a taxi cab when everyone else rode in limos

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.060
Well what about the woman who saved Bill?

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.220
Ziegler then suggests that maybe that "sacrifice-redemption thing"

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.860
Was all a charade to scare Bill into silence and to stop him talking about the cult

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.380
That's when Bill asks about Amanda. He asks Ziegler if Amanda was the Masked Woman at the party

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.860
Yes, Bill. She was

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.740
In that case, if it's all 'fake', how does someone die from a 'fake party'?

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.820
And Ziegler is very frank with him:

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.520
She was a hooker. She was used by a bunch of guys that night,

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.000
and when she got home, she overdosed

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.920
It was a matter of time!

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.440
You know how hookers are!

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.400
Ziegler tries to reassure Bill, telling him that no one killed anyone

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.380
Someone just died. Life goes on!

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.280
But Bill isn't comforted by his words but he accepts them

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.760
An exhausted Bill returns home to find his mask that he lost at the party

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.020
laying on his pillow with Alice asleep next to it

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.460
and Bill breaks down.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.650
Waking Alice up and repeating to her “He’ll
tell her everything”.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:38.670
We then see Alice smoking, her eyes bloodshot
from crying, and Bill sitting on the couch

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.150
equally distraught.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.220
Having talked the whole night through, and
in the early hours of morning, Alice tells

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.340
Bill that they have to go Christmas shopping
with their daughter.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:49.700
While shopping, Bill asks Alice what they
should do and the only thing she can think

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.930
of is to be grateful!

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.080
That they’ve been through so much, surviving
both their dreams and the real world.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.660
And although Alice isn’t sure but she knows this:

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.650
sometimes the only thing that’s real is the small

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.660
part of the big picture that you see: Your
life;

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.820
and that’s okay, they’re both ‘awake'

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.200
able to talk about their feelings,
still in love, and able to move on.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.990
But Bill isn't sure. Was it really only a dream?

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.839
So you’re probably really confused right?

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.580
First off: That’s kind of the point

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:19.160
This movie uses masks, secrets, lies, and general surreality.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.880
The heart of this movie is all about how hiding secrets can have ugly consequences

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.880
At the end of the movie, Alice and Bill finally come clean

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.780
and it's only then that their relationship improves

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:34.280
Because they're perfectly honest with each other; because they wake up from their dream

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.180
So a lot of strange things happen to Bill, that night, while he is walking

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:41.760
Like he's approached by a prostitute. That's totally possible right? But super unlikely.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:48.300
But the same night he goes to an orgy? Totally possible, again. But also super unlikely

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:53.700
It's like this movie has no cuts between the 'dream' and the 'reality'

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.620
It's like when you wake up and you think to yourself

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.500
"Wait, was I dreaming or was that real?"

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.360
and this movie captures this feeling perfectly

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.280
So if you remember: Alice has a dream about an orgy

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.840
and it's unclear, at this point, if Alice was at the sex party

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.300
But my understanding is that she was having a dream and her dream was merely coincidental

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:18.000
It was out of this guilt over her confessed sexual desires, and her sexual frustration

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:18.900
With Bill

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.600
And that brings me to my next point: Ziegler

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.500
I believe he's lying since he cares too much about his own social standing

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.540
Rather than the truth

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.460
So I believe that Nick was killed

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.140
Why?

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:33.040
Because he revealed the existence of the group to an outsider, Bill.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.940
And he was punished by being killed

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.980
Which brings me to my next point: Amanda

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.080
This movie tries to trick you into believing that Amanda was the Masked Woman

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.600
But she's not. It's obvious, physically speaking, it's different.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.360
and I know for a fact that the actress for the Masked Woman and Amanda is different

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.440
So it was just an attempt to confuse you

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.140
and the identity of the Masked Woman, stays a mystery

00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:00.160
So one last thing: There is no evidence, officially, that 20 minutes was removed from this film

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:05.100
Even Katharine Kubrick, Stanley Kubrick's daughter, says the movie was finished

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.060
So from my research, from what I found:

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.360
Is that there is no evidence that 20 minutes was cut from the movie

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.980
That's what I found. That's what I think.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.160
But what do you think? What do you think is happening in this movie?

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.020

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.820
