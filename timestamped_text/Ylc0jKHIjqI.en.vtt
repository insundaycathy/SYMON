00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.410
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.910
Today, I'm going to explain an American found
footage horror film called “The Visit”.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.370
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.119
Watch out and take care!

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.170
Two siblings from Philadelphia, 15-year-old
Becca and 13-year-old Tyler, prepare for a

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.980
five-day visit with their grandparents while
their divorced mother Loretta goes on a cruise

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.599
with her new boyfriend.

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.589
Loretta reveals that she has not spoken to
her parents in 15 years after marrying her

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.270
high-school teacher, of whom her parents disapproved.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.360
Having never met their grandparents, the teens
plan to record a documentary film about their

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.340
visit using a camcorder.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.470
At the train station, Becca and Tyler meet
their grandparents for the first time, whom

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.150
Becca refers to as "Nana" and "Pop Pop".

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.920
The kids are very happy seeing their grandparents
for the first time.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.280
Arriving at the house, Becca is busy recording
all activities with Tyler using her camera.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.770
Nana is also very happy with the presence
of her grandchildren.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.270
Tyler and Becca get settled into their room
upstairs, which used to be their mother’s.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.960
So far, everything seems very normal.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.690
Things start out very well.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.430
Tyler and Becca are both given the freedom
to explore.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.300
They are having a fun day together exploring
the surroundings.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.110
At night, Grandpa comes into their room to
give them some information.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.860
In this house, they have to obey some rules.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.170
Becca and Tyler are instructed to never go
into the basement because it contains toxic

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.890
mold, and that bedtime is at 9:30pm, after
which they shouldn't leave their room.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.060
However, that night, Becca and Tyler couldn't
sleep.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.530
An hour past curfew, Becca is hungry, so she
ventures downstairs for something to eat.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.540
She intends to take a cake from the kitchen.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.549
However, to her surprise, she sees Nana walking
aimlessly and vomiting all over the house,

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.780
which frightens her.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.672
Becca immediately runs into her room, feeling
anxious.

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:52.760
The next day, she questions her grandfather

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.390
about the event that happened last night.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.780
Pop-pop insists that Nana had a stomach bug
and wasn't feeling well.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.270
He then reminds her not to leave their bedroom
after 9:30pm.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.920
During the day, the kids continue to explore.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.229
They play hide and seek in a crawl space underneath
the house.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.560
Tyler hides; Becca seeks Tyler out with her
camera, making her own way into the dimly

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.950
lit maze columns.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.610
However, Becca is surprised when she turns
and is confronted by the lunging, animalistic

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.560
form of Nanna, bounding towards her in an
unnaturally fast gait.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.120
She immediately flees, trying to escape.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.290
Before Nana can reach her, Becca retreats,
sprawling out of the crawl space into the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.650
safety of sunlight.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.099
Nanna emerges, laughing at what she sees as
a joke.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.680
A few moments later, a doctor named Dr. Sam
comes to their door and asks to talk to their

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.680
grandparents.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.320
But their grandparents are not home at the
moment as they had just gone for a walk.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.709
He claims that he is from Maple Shade, the
hospital the grandparents volunteer at.

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.340
He stops by to check on them and wonders why
they haven't been coming in for the scheduled shifts

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.680
Then, while their grandparents are still away,
Tyler decides to investigate what’s in the shed

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.910
While vlogging, he sneaks inside and finds
in the corner: a pile.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.230
He gets closer to see what it is and discovers
it’s used adult diapers.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.810
After their grandparents return home, Pop-Pop
takes Becca and Tyler through the town.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.641
He shows the school their mother used to study
at.

00:03:13.641 --> 00:03:19.010
A moment later, however, Pop-Pop tells them
to leave because they’re being followed.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.510
The kids see a man across the street.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.930
Pop-Pop runs over and begins to accost the
man, yelling at him.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.200
Becca and Tyler convince him to leave the
man alone, and Pop-Pop, realising he's just

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.819
being paranoid, apologizes to them.

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.180
That night, at 10:47 PM, they hear a scary
sound coming outside their locked door.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.239
The two want to film what’s on the other
side, so Tyler tells Becca to open the door.

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:49.110
When the door is opened, they see a naked
Nana clawing at the door opposite them, scratching

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.700
like a frantic dog.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.810
They immediately shut the door.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.050
The next morning, Pop-Pop and Nana are outside
with breakfast on the table.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.680
Nana apologizes because she’s got hot oil
over Becca’s computer webcam.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.300
As a result, when they are talking to their
mother on Skype, they aren’t able to show

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.690
their faces.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.680
Tyler and Becca immediately tells their mother
that their grandparents have been acting strange

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.520
these past few days.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.440
She reassures them their grandparents are
"weird", but they're also old, and old people

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.430
are sometimes cranky, sometimes paranoid;
that’s just how old people act.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.840
In the afternoon, Becca approaches her grandmother,
asking her to be interviewed.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.090
Becca interviews Nana by asking her warm-up
questions.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.211
She asks Nana what happened 15 years ago to
cause her not to speak to her daughter.

00:04:33.302 --> 00:04:36.875
However, Nana starts going berserk, shaking
violently.

00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:42.860
That night, at 10:16 PM, they hear a horrible
commotion outside the door.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.530
They want to know what Nana is doing this
time.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.415
When they open the door...

00:04:53.632 --> 00:04:57.260
they see Nana running
past, with both arms behind her back, rushing

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.630
past them, in both directions.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.010
Just as she’s about to crawl towards the
camera, they shut and lock the door.

00:05:03.594 --> 00:05:07.940
On the fourth day, another strange thing happens
when Becca and Tyler see their grandmother

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.650
staring into a well.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.750
Tyler and Becca approach the well to try to
figure out what is hidden inside.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.440
But all they pull up is water.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.250
Later that day, a neighbour named Stacey comes
over, telling them their grandparents volunteered

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.320
at the hospital when she was in rehab, and
she baked treats to thank them.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.490
Later that evening, Becca is in the living
room and hears Nana laughing hysterically.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.350
She decides to show what kind of television
show makes her Nana laugh, hoping it’s the

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.949
same one her mom loves.

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.520
But she finds Nana rocking in a chair, facing
the wall.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.340
Suddenly the grandmother covered her own face
with a shawl.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.360
Becca also goes into the shed and finds Pop-Pop
with a rifle in his mouth.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.410
Due to strange occurrences that keep happening,
they decide to set up a hidden camera in the

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.250
living room to see exactly what goes on at
night.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.620
Time passes, and they fall asleep.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.780
In the living area, the camera records Nana
opening and slamming the basement door several times

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.870
She picks up the camera and then films herself
going into the kitchen where she grabs a butcher knife

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.570
She makes her way up to the kids’ bedroom
and begins pounding at their door.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.660
Becca and Tyler wake up, startled.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.110
They can hear Nana trying to get in but just
stay still.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.070
The next morning, they watch the footage and
see that Nana was trying to kill them.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.090
Becca tells Tyler that their mom is back from
her vacation that day, so they just have to

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.800
avoid their grandparents all day by going
out and pretending to play.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.910
Becca uses that moment to scrub the oil off
of her webcam.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.060
They wait until the grandparents are out front.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.060
And they immediately get on Skype.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.509
The oil has been scrubbed off of the webcam
so their mom can see them now.

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:47.690
They quickly tell her that she needs to come
and pick them up right now as their grandparents

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:48.919
are scaring them.

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:52.158
Tyler films the grandparents from the window
so his mom can see them.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.810
The mom is now white-faced and reveals to
both of them that they are not her parents;

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.630
which means they have been living with strangers
all week.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.670
Their mom immediately tries to call the local
police.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.370
She tells them to get somewhere safe… but
just then the grandparents return.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:13.030
A few hours later, outside the window, they
see Nana and Pop-Pop in a heated argument

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.150
with their neighbour, Stacey.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.070
They wonder what they are fighting about.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.100
Later that night, the grandparents suggest
having a board game night, but the kids say

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.940
they want to record something outside while
the grandparents figure out the teams.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.160
They head for the yard only to see STACEY
HANGING DEAD FROM A TREE.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.300
Pop-pop appears and tells them they already
have the teams – old versus young.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.400
The kids are forced to play Yahtzee with the
fake grandparents.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.050
Becca excuses herself from the game saying
she’s got to film something real quick.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.920
Tyler who is now left alone begins to feel
strange things.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.825
Pop-pop suddenly walks away from the table
and Nana is seen eating cake unnaturally.

00:07:48.825 --> 00:07:52.522
The old man returns to the table and approaches
his wife who suddenly freezes.

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:58.350
Becca goes down to the basement, explaining
to the viewer that she thinks her real grandparents

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.319
have been trapped down there, and that’s
why Pop-Pop told them to stay away.

00:08:02.063 --> 00:08:06.610
Becca begins calling out for the real Nana
and Pop-Pop but doesn’t hear a response.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.800
In the corner, she sees a dumpster and hurries
over to it.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:15.099
Inside, she sees something from MAPLE Shade
which she now learns is a PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL.

00:08:15.099 --> 00:08:18.350
She also finds a family photo of her real
grandparents.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:23.380
She digs some more and to her surprise, she
finds THE CORPSES OF HER REAL GRANDPARENTS!

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.960
Immediately behind her, Pop-Pop has appeared.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.050
This is where he reveals everything.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.960
He and the woman Becca knows as Nana were
patients at a nearby mental hospital where

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.449
the real Nana and Pop Pop were regular volunteers.

00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:39.339
When they told them about their upcoming visit
with their grandchildren, the two imposters

00:08:39.339 --> 00:08:42.539
decided it would be fun to experience in their
place.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.889
So they murdered their real grandparents and
took their place.

00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:49.139
It is also revealed that Fake Nana once had
children of her own.

00:08:49.139 --> 00:08:53.850
Therefore, a few days ago, the grandmother
was seen staring into a well because she remembered

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.929
that 35 years ago, she deliberately threw
her child into the well.

00:08:57.929 --> 00:09:02.279
Furthermore, it is also revealed that Nana
experiences something called sundowning, which

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:05.369
is a form of dementia that happens when the
sun sets.

00:09:05.369 --> 00:09:10.290
That explains why fake Nana is often increasingly
confused at nights, and prone to erratic behavior

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.009
in low lighting

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:15.509
Throughout the movie, other folks from the
hospital have been stopping by the house to

00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:19.870
check up on their grandparents, but fake grandparents
have conspired to be “out for a walk”

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.430
during these visits.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:26.259
After the revelation, Pop Pop grabs Becca
and imprisons her in his bedroom with Nana.

00:09:26.259 --> 00:09:30.639
Meanwhile, he then starts to psychologically
torment Tyler by smearing his face with his

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:32.579
dirty diaper.

00:09:32.579 --> 00:09:36.579
Simultaneously, Becca continues to be chased
by Nana.

00:09:36.579 --> 00:09:41.050
Nana smashes Becca’s face into the mirror
and pieces of glass shatter all around them.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:45.160
Becca picks up a shard of glass as Nana jumps
on top of her, clawing at her.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.570
Becca fatally stabs Nana with the glass shard,
killing her.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.269
She runs into the kitchen and tackles Pop
Pop.

00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:55.699
As Pop Pop starts to get the upper hand, Tyler
attacks him and knocks him to the floor and

00:09:55.699 --> 00:09:59.300
repeatedly slams the refrigerator door onto
his head; killing him.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.839
Soon after, they hear police sirens; they
immediately run outside to find their mom

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:05.749
and police cars out front.

00:10:05.749 --> 00:10:08.699
They hug each other and grateful that they
are now safe.

00:10:08.699 --> 00:10:10.790
That's the ending of the movie "The Visit".
