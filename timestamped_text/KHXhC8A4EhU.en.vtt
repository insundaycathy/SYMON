down but the workers assure him that nothing is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.440
wrong and that the area is just being sanitized as&nbsp;
there was a small leak at a nearby nuclear plant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.800
video of swan's singing aloha away at a school&nbsp;
recital which he couldn't attend due to work&nbsp;&nbsp;

ambulances and police cars as sakwu ponders what&nbsp;
could be going on swan reaches out the car window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.320
and catches an ember in her hand prompting sakwu&nbsp;
to notice the burning building in the distance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.360
he remarks that there's something bad going on&nbsp;

who seems to be aware of the zombie situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.160
as the train prepares to leave a spasming young&nbsp;
woman boards the train with an enormous bite wound&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.320
on her leg outside the train station manager then&nbsp;
signals the ktx to leave only to notice a group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.520
of people on top of the stairs of the station&nbsp;
screaming at something unseen swan watches through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.200
the window as the manager is quickly ambushed by&nbsp;
a rabid human which only she witnesses frightened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.480
swan gets up to go to the bathroom in the lower&nbsp;
numbered cars a train attendant comes across the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.360
infected woman and she attempts to resuscitate her&nbsp;
only for the woman to complete her transformation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.200
the zombie then latches onto the attendant's neck&nbsp;
who runs into the baseball team's car in a panic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.400
the two then fall to the floor now both zombies&nbsp;
the two proceed to attack most of the baseball&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.120
team and creates a horde of zombies in the&nbsp;
process only four students escape baseball&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.880
player yong [ __ ] is crushed jian hee and two&nbsp;
unnamed boys the zombies race towards the upper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.080
compartments and infect everyone in their path&nbsp;
swan unwittingly walks towards the lower ones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.440
looking for a bathroom sockwu awakens and&nbsp;
notices that swan is missing from her seat he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.400
then receives a call from a co-worker who informs&nbsp;
him that violent riots have erupted around korea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.680
soon enough a group of panicked passengers from&nbsp;
the lower compartments rushed through past his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.960
seat screaming and running now realizing&nbsp;
that swan may be in danger sakwu runs in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.200
the opposite direction and sees swan standing&nbsp;
right in front of an oncoming horde of zombies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.720
he grabs her and they are chased by the horde&nbsp;
but saku successfully reaches his compartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.880
and attempts to barricade it nearly locking&nbsp;
sang-hwa and song kyung out in the process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.680
the survivor struggled to barricade the door&nbsp;
then realized that the zombies do not know how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.040
to open it and merely charge at the sight of&nbsp;
humans soon kyung uses water and newspapers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.160
cover the windows which remedies the situation by&nbsp;
causing the zombies to think they are not there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.560
the conductor reassures the survivors over the&nbsp;
intercom that the train will not go to busan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.040
but stop at daegu station as he has been informed&nbsp;
that the military has been dispatched there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.240
yan suk calls his company friends and asks&nbsp;
about the situation at daegu which saku&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.440
overhears and deduces from it that all arriving&nbsp;
passengers at daegu will be forcibly quarantined&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.120
he makes a private call to a co-worker&nbsp;
and convinces him to pick him and swung up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.320
separately so they won't be quarantined the train&nbsp;
then arrives at the abandoned degu station and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.640
sakwu takes swan towards the east exit where they&nbsp;
will be picked up while the others go towards the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.480
main exit the homeless man follows sakwu having&nbsp;
overheard his phone call the three go down the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.920
hallway where they see a soldier in the distance&nbsp;
relieved saku tells swan to stay where she is and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.800
he rushes towards the soldier for help only to&nbsp;
see that he is injured the soldier begs them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.560
help him before a horde of infected soldiers round&nbsp;
the corner trampling and consuming him the rest of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.600
the survivors head out the main exit towards the&nbsp;
bottom of the escalator the survivors see a large&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.560
group of uniformed men and realize the soldiers&nbsp;
are all infected and the deployment has failed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.520
several of the passengers are eaten and infected&nbsp;
as they scramble back up the escalator and back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.000
into the station sakwu still inside the station&nbsp;
concourse and facing zombies tell swan to run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.880
she does so and bumps into songkyun and sang&nbsp;
hua who are rushing back to the train with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.240
others soon kyung takes swan and runs to the&nbsp;
platform while sang-hwa fights off the horde&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.560
with sakwu yong-guk and the two other baseball&nbsp;
players once they manage to lock the exit door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.440
they run to the train yong-guk's two friends are&nbsp;
attacked and infected when they reach the platform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.800
meanwhile jin hee yan-sook and a few&nbsp;
others have successfully boarded the train&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.240
soon kyung and swan are also boarding when a glass&nbsp;
bridge above the train shatters and sends zombies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.840
reigning onto the platform one of the zombies&nbsp;
falls between gill and john gill separating them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.360
jon gill is forcibly dragged aboard ginny's&nbsp;
compartment and she watches in gil song kyung&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.800
and swan run in the opposite direction&nbsp;
soon kyung swan in gil and the homeless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.200
man barricade themselves inside a bathroom&nbsp;
in one of the lower infected compartments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.440
while young [ __ ] sakwu and sanghwa successfully&nbsp;
get onto a safe compartment sang-hwa calls his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.400
wife and realizes she is trapped in the bathroom&nbsp;
with a few others unwilling to leave them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.440
die the three of them begin fighting through the&nbsp;
lower compartments to rescue them in the process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.320
they discover the zombies are blind in the dark&nbsp;
and only react to sound they use this to their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.720
advantage and manage to rescue them and they&nbsp;
all run together towards the first compartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.440
yongguk texts jan he that they have rescued the&nbsp;
survivors and are headed towards her compartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.000
when she happily tells the others they react with&nbsp;
hostility and decide to lock the door to their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.560
compartment to prevent the group from entering&nbsp;
with the door locked yongguk attempts to break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.200
it open while sakwu and seung-hwa struggle to&nbsp;
keep the zombies from entering on the other side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.480
realizing that there isn't enough time sunghwa&nbsp;
tells sokwu to take care of his wife and leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.920
him behind to distract the zombies sakwu tearfully&nbsp;
apologizes and lets go of the door dragging swan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.440
and song kyung towards the barricaded door before&nbsp;
he is consumed sunghwa manages to tell his wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.680
the name he chose for their unborn son the&nbsp;
locked door is broken down and the survivors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.000
pile into the compartment safely although&nbsp;
in gill is not fast enough and she is eaten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.320
realizing that seung hwa and ingil could&nbsp;
have survived as well if the group hadn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.360
barricaded the door sakwu angrily punches yan&nbsp;
sook and demands to know why he did such a thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:10.240
unwilling to answer yan suk lies to the others&nbsp;
and insists that sakwu and his allies are infected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.880
instilling fear inside the initial group that&nbsp;
barricaded the door they forced sakwu and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.400
group that just entered the compartment into&nbsp;
the hallway between their compartment and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.400
conductor's car once they are forced out yan suk&nbsp;
and the others use their neckties and shirts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.760
tie down the knob and prevent them from coming&nbsp;
back in john gill still shocked and silent from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.640
seeing her sister die needlessly notices in gill's&nbsp;
face in the crowd of zombies in the door window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.680
she tells her infected sister that she lived&nbsp;
a long and fulfilling life and realizes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.960
the compartment group's actions have led to her&nbsp;
sister's death out of anger and defeat john gill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.920
opens the door allowing the zombies to flood&nbsp;
the safe compartment the survivors inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.160
hallway can only watch as the group is eaten&nbsp;
inside the compartment they see shadows of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.440
passengers desperately clawing at the door they&nbsp;
just barricaded in a cruel twist of events the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.400
conductor receives a radio notification that busan&nbsp;
has succeeded in holding off the zombie infection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.600
however as they approach a station before busan&nbsp;
the train is cut off by debris on the track&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.640
the conductor informs the remaining survivors&nbsp;
on the train over the speaker that he will find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.360
another train on an unblocked track to drive to&nbsp;
busan and that they should follow him but wishes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.360
them luck as they will have to exit the train&nbsp;
and survive crossing the zombie-filled tracks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.520
he exits his cockpit and finds an empty&nbsp;
path successfully discovering a cargo train&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.840
he starts it up and begins going down the track&nbsp;
towards busan searching for survivors on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:39.920
tracks sock wu and the others exit the train&nbsp;
and unbeknownst to them yan suk has survived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.320
the horde of zombies in the compartment he also&nbsp;
hears the conductor's announcement and fights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.320
his way out of the compartment but several&nbsp;
zombies continue chasing him as he gets off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.640
meanwhile sokwu's group is making their way to&nbsp;
the cargo train suddenly a burning freight car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.360
rushes towards them and jin hee and yangbook are&nbsp;
separated from the group when the runaway freight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.640
rams into the cars of a nearby train which falls&nbsp;
and blocks their path they go into one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.600
next train cars to cross over to the other side&nbsp;
through the door not noticing that yansuke who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:15.360
is being chased by a zombie is following them yan&nbsp;
suk enters the car and throws jin hee behind him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.400
sacrificing her to the zombie yong [ __ ] fights&nbsp;
the zombie off and collapses to the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:27.200
cradling the spasming jin hee in his arms as jenny&nbsp;
chokes and begins to turn yong-guk begins to cry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.560
asking why fate had to be like this he apologizes&nbsp;
to jin hee for not telling her how he felt about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:38.400
her as she fully turns and consumes his face and&nbsp;
throat yan suk runs towards the cargo train but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.280
twists his ankle on the tracks and one of the&nbsp;
zombies following him manages to bite his ankle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.600
the conductor rushes off the car to help but&nbsp;
yan suit betrays him and throws him aside to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.240
the zombies like he did with jen hee he ignores&nbsp;
the conductor's screams for help as he boards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:59.120
the train alone meanwhile the homeless man&nbsp;
swan sakwu and son kyung are on the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.920
side of the wreckage trapped under a train full&nbsp;
of zombies the windows of the train threaten to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.720
collapse at any moment sakwu finds an opening&nbsp;
under the train and begins to climb under it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.480
but a part of the train collapses and seals the&nbsp;
hole before the other three can make it through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.920
the impact also shatters a window and a small&nbsp;
group of zombies tumble out and crawl towards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:23.120
the three however the homeless man sacrifices&nbsp;
himself to the zombies at the last minute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.600
allowing enough time for sakwu to pull the&nbsp;
debris away and for song kyung and swan to escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.040
they run towards the cargo train and get on&nbsp;
the outdoor platform of it sakwu approaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.280
the cockpit but backs away when he sees yon&nbsp;
sook in the conductor's seat milky eyed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:42.960
infected he initially shuts the door but yan sook&nbsp;
opens it in spite of being a zombie the infection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.160
has not reached his brain yan suk approaches&nbsp;
sakwu and begs him to take him home to busan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:53.120
speaking like a little boy and reciting his&nbsp;
address and the name of his mother sakwu tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:59.040
he is infected and yan suk is momentarily shocked&nbsp;
and he weeps but within seconds he is fully turned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.240
sokwu begins to struggle with a zombified&nbsp;
yansuk and nearly falls off the ledge of the car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.680
swan screams on the other side of the car platform&nbsp;
which attracts yan suk and he attempts to attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:16.320
son kyung and swan however sakwu intervenes and&nbsp;
his hand is severely bitten he manages to throw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.920
yansuke off the car but notices his injury aware&nbsp;
that he will turn very soon he seats swan and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.160
son kyung in the cockpit and tells them how to&nbsp;
use the brakes once they get to busan station&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.680
he then tries to leave the car but swan begs him&nbsp;
to stay and reveals that on the day of her recital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.320
she did not finish singing aloha away because&nbsp;
she didn't see sakwu in the audience she had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.840
been saving the song for her father the two have&nbsp;
a tearful farewell and sakwu holds swan's small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.080
hands in his for a moment before throwing them&nbsp;
aside and locking himself out of the cockpit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.680
swan begins to scream and cry for him to come back&nbsp;
he slowly approaches the back of the train car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.880
fighting the infection and begins thinking of when&nbsp;
swan was an infant recalling his happiest memories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.760
of cradling her and holding her small fingers&nbsp;
and toes the infection takes hold his eyes going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:07.680
white and veins going dark however in spite of&nbsp;
being fully zombified sakwu continues thinking of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.720
swan and he smiles happily towards the sky before&nbsp;
falling off the car and onto the tracks the train&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:18.000
car finally arrives at the tunnel leading to busan&nbsp;
station however the track is blocked off with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.280
debris the two exit the car and begin walking down&nbsp;
the tunnel not aware that they are being watched&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:29.120
on the other side by the busan military one of the&nbsp;
snipers reports their approach to his superior and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.760
is told to shoot them down as they cannot tell&nbsp;
in the dark whether they are infected or not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.160
just as the sniper is about to pull the&nbsp;
trigger swan begins to mournfully sing aloha&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.280
o-a to rally the exhausted song kyung to walk&nbsp;
to the end of the tunnel hearing her song the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.520
soldiers realize they are not infected and&nbsp;
