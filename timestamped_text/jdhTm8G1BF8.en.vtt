00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.680
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain a drama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.360
fantasy, horror film called,&nbsp;
"The Endless." Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.640
A mysterious package arrives at&nbsp;
the home of brothers Justin ... and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.160
Aaron ... . Inside the box is&nbsp;
a videotape from Camp Arcadia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.320
a group they joined when they were kids. Ten&nbsp;
years ago, Justin pulled himself and his brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.080
out of the supposed U.F.O. death cult after&nbsp;
learning the group's plans to kill themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.560
But Aaron recalls the camp differently, having&nbsp;
only fond memories of food and support. Comparing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.000
their current poor life, Aaron is convinced&nbsp;
that their lives back at the camp were better.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.720
At therapy, Justin shares his worry for his&nbsp;
brother. He admits that he was relieved that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.400
the people at the cult are still alive but feels&nbsp;
guilty for taking his brother away from them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.960
should they be as good as&nbsp;
Aaron remembered. Despite that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.600
Justin adamantly believes being&nbsp;
free in the real world is better.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.000
On the other hand, Aaron expresses his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.440
frustration over Justin's controlling&nbsp;
attitude during his therapy session.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.040
However, Aaron doesn't want to talk to Justin&nbsp;
about it, sparing him from getting hurt.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.680
Upon Aaron's insistence on getting some closure,&nbsp;
Justin finally relents and agrees to go back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.440
the camp for one day. While they're driving&nbsp;
to the camp, Justin lists down all the things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.760
they did that identify the group as a cult, all&nbsp;
of which Aaron doesn't remember. Hearing this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.040
Aaron questions why Justin even agreed to&nbsp;
return if he thinks badly about the cult.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.520
The brothers stop at a field where their&nbsp;
mother had died. Aaron notices a painting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.520
but Justin recalls that it's the painting&nbsp;
they made as kids. Justin looks down the road,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.840
noticing that the opposite paths are alike.&nbsp;
When he turns back, one of the paths changed.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.960
They continue their journey, spotting an&nbsp;
angry man. Finally, they reach Camp Arcadia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.640
where they receive a warm welcome from&nbsp;
Hal … . The brothers have lunch with Hal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.680
and meet old camp friends Tim, … Anna, ...&nbsp;
and Shane ... . Joining them is a newcomer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.680
Lizzy, ... who wandered to the camp after&nbsp;
leaving a mental health facility. Across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.560
the room is Dave, ... who stares&nbsp;
at the brothers with a big smile.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.280
Heading to their quarters, Justin points out how&nbsp;
everyone at camp looks the same as when they left,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.840
which Aaron believes is because the&nbsp;
camp provides a healthier lifestyle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.200
On their bed, Justin finds a&nbsp;
post-it asking them to be quiet.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.240
Justin heads out, jogging around camp while&nbsp;
checking the place out. As he explores the camp,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.000
he finds people practicing archery, Hal loading&nbsp;
up a truck with kegs of home-brewed beer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.280
and the same angry man marching down the&nbsp;
path, who doesn't seem to notice him.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.840
That evening, the camp gathers around the bonfire.&nbsp;
Noticing Justin's detachment from the others,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.840
Hal invites him to his cabin to taste his&nbsp;
brew of liquor. Justin looks around the cabin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.440
finding an unfinished equation, which&nbsp;
Hal coyly refuses to say what it's for.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.720
Changing the topic, Hal assures Justin that&nbsp;
they've forgiven him for leaving and talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.560
to the press about their group, though he&nbsp;
wonders why they returned. Justin's confused,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.640
recalling the videotape they received from the&nbsp;
camp. But Hal claims not knowing about the video.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.080
Aaron chats with Anna at the bonfire and follows&nbsp;
her to her cabin, showing him her fashion designs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.680
Anna recounts Aaron's fishing hobby when&nbsp;
they used to live here, giving him an idea.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.920
Outside, Shane invites Justin to see a card&nbsp;
trick. Shane chooses Justin's card from the deck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.560
but Justin lies and says he's wrong. Shane insists&nbsp;
on showing him another magic trick, throwing an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.120
old baseball into the air, which doesn't fall&nbsp;
back. Shane grabs Justin's hand and positions it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.520
letting Justin catch the ball. Later, Hall gathers&nbsp;
everyone to start the traditional game, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.000
Struggle. It's a tug of war game with an invisible&nbsp;
opponent, symbolizing their struggle for passion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.040
growth, and a higher power. As Hal pulls on the&nbsp;
rope, the other end suddenly raises to the sky.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.240
Justin assumes that it's just Dave on&nbsp;
a ladder in the darkness. The crowd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.520
cheers for Aaron to play next, where he fails&nbsp;
almost instantly. However, he doesn't give up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.280
Aaron ties the rope around his torso on his&nbsp;
second try, letting him use his weight to pull.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.240
He growls as he speeds forward, pulling the&nbsp;
rope successfully until it drops. The crowd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.120
applauds him. Justin hesitates on participating&nbsp;
until Aaron talks him into it. Justin prepares&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.200
himself to pull, but the rope whips forward,&nbsp;
causing him to fall with a gash on his hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.200
The crowd is silent, with Dave smiling behind&nbsp;
them, clearly not the one who pulled the rope.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.360
Later, Lizzy tends to Justin's wound, sharing&nbsp;
how she used to do the same for a gun enthusiast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.000
who lives in the woods. Hal checks on Justin,&nbsp;
apologizing for what happened. With the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.960
staring at him expectantly, Justin leaves. As&nbsp;
they walk back to their cabin, Aaron insists on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.360
staying for another day, interested in shooting&nbsp;
some guns for target practice tomorrow. Justin is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.080
not interested at first but eventually agrees.&nbsp;
They spot Tim smoking by a locked cabin. Tim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.040
claims that there's only rowing equipment&nbsp;
inside, which the brothers don't believe.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.440
On their cabin door is another post-it&nbsp;
saying, "Please, be quiet," which they remove.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.120
Unable to sleep, Just in brings&nbsp;
up Aaron and Anna's relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.240
He remembers Anna watching Aaron&nbsp;
intently, even when they were little.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.520
Aaron wonders if it's because they were meant&nbsp;
to be together, but Justin is suspicious.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.160
On the next day, Justin and Aaron practice&nbsp;
with the guns, but Justin oddly misses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.160
having his bullet fall near them. The bullet is&nbsp;
dented on the head as if it hit something hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.400
Later on, the brothers fish in the&nbsp;
lake before Justin jogs by himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.600
He sees the strange man marching down&nbsp;
the path again, but he disappears,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.680
leaving a single shoe with a drop of blood&nbsp;
behind. Justin carries on until he finds a storage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.760
container in the field that suddenly moves. A gust&nbsp;
of wind blasts, and for a second, the sky darkens.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.160
Justin looks down and sees polaroids scattered&nbsp;
before him. He picks one up, confused at what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.360
going on. A tree from behind him falls, making&nbsp;
him jump. Scared, Justin turns back and leaves.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.720
Meanwhile, in an old tent, a recorder plays a song&nbsp;
repeatedly—someone inside runs and grunts over and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.200
over. An antique clock hangs outside the tent;&nbsp;
its second's hand keeps going back 3-seconds.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.560
That night, Lizzy sings for everyone at Karaoke&nbsp;
Night. Behind Justin, another post-it asking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.640
for people to be quiet is on the board. Justin&nbsp;
pulls Hal away from the party, showing him the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.400
polaroid of a buoy in the lake that he picked&nbsp;
up earlier. Justin feels as though something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.720
invisible was watching him, much like when he&nbsp;
was a kid. He disregarded this as imaginary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.440
but now that he's experienced them again, he&nbsp;
wants answers. In the sky, they find two moons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.160
which Hal describes as a sign of truth, while a&nbsp;
third moon will signify the ascension. Hal advises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.240
Justin to take Aaron to the buoy in the polaroid&nbsp;
tomorrow and find their answers there. No matter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.520
what he believes in or what he finds there,&nbsp;
it would be a weight off Justin's shoulders.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.160
The night continues with Aaron singing for the&nbsp;
crowd and getting recreational substances from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.960
Anna. Justin finds Lizzy sketching the gun-armed&nbsp;
man from her stories, with his house on fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.360
Justin moves on, seeing a girl crying alone.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.200
Meanwhile, Anna takes Aaron away, showing him a&nbsp;
mirror-like phenomenon that reflects the landscape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.520
before them. Aaron brings up the video they&nbsp;
received from camp, but Anna denies sending it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.920
to them. She swears she wouldn't have sent a video&nbsp;
outside of camp, especially not one that Justin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.560
would find. When Aaron asks what she means, she&nbsp;
changes the topic, not wanting to ruin the mood.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.600
Back at the camp, Justin&nbsp;
approaches the woman, Jennifer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.840
who's crying because she can't sleep while&nbsp;
everyone is partying. She'd been leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.520
notes that ask people to be quiet, but&nbsp;
no one listens to her. Jennifer isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.200
part of the group but is there because her&nbsp;
husband disappeared near the camp. For days,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.280
she tried looking for her husband until Hal found&nbsp;
and brought her to camp. Tears wet her eyes as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.840
she contemplates how long she'd been looking,&nbsp;
separated from her son, who's with her parents.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.040
The next day, Justin takes&nbsp;
Aaron fishing, as Hal suggested.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.720
Despite the strange things they've seen&nbsp;
in camp, Aaron wants to stay permanently.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.120
Justin laments about leaving the world outside,&nbsp;
bringing up Jennifer, who's miserable in the camp.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.960
As Aaron argues, Justin finds the buoy&nbsp;
from the polaroid floating on the lake.&nbsp;

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.720
Justin dives into the lake to search for&nbsp;
answers at the bottom, leaving Aaron alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.040
When he doesn't surface after a while, Aaron&nbsp;
prepares to go after him. Justin appears behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.960
him, dropping something on the boat behind&nbsp;
him before climbing in. He stammers in fear,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.160
claiming that something is in the lake and&nbsp;
ordering Aaron to row the boat back to the shore.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.640
Back on land, they open the metal box that&nbsp;
Justin found on the bottom of the lake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.680
The ominous tape inside convinces&nbsp;
Justin to leave immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.600
Aaron protests, but Justin insists&nbsp;
on leaving, even if it's without him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.520
Tired of the same argument, Aaron relents and&nbsp;
asks to say goodbye to everyone before leaving.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.960
That evening, they have dinner with the group&nbsp;
where Lizzy gives Justin a drawing of a shadowy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.640
beast in the woods. Hal insists on playing the&nbsp;
tape that they found on the lake as a parting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.800
ceremony, explaining that it's how the entity&nbsp;
that guards them communicates. The T.V. plays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.440
the video of a younger Justin and Aaron acting&nbsp;
their culty version of Camp Arcadia to outsiders.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.520
Humiliated, the brothers leave, but Hal stops&nbsp;
them, insisting that the message is meant to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.600
forgive the two for shaming the camp to the&nbsp;
outside world. Aaron discovers that Justin's harsh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.840
stories about the camp were lies, angering him.&nbsp;
But Justin explains that he lied because he knew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.400
something was wrong in the camp. Hal, however,&nbsp;
suggests that Justin made up such stories because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.480
he was desperate to leave. Even as a child,&nbsp;
Justin had been uncomfortable seeing no leader&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.880
that controls the camp. He accuses Justin of&nbsp;
wanting to be in control, which the latter denies.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.920
Driven to the edge, Hal accuses Justin of ruining&nbsp;
the camp despite saving their lives from the car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.920
accident that killed their mother. Due to Justin&nbsp;
and Aaron's stories, Hal and the others struggled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.280
to do business in the outside world when many&nbsp;
people have seen their faces on the news,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.760
thinking that they're a crazed cult. Justin isn't&nbsp;
swayed by his accusations, pointing out Jennifer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.920
terrified and hanging on false hope of ever&nbsp;
finding her husband. Justin insists on leaving,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.560
but his brother refuses. Pissed, Justin berates&nbsp;
Hal, who tells him to make it easier for everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.640
and leave by himself. Defeated, Justin&nbsp;
walks away, leaving his brother behind.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.680
Justin heads to his car, but it doesn't start.&nbsp;
He takes his chances and walks on foot but finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.640
strange rocky markers blocking his way. He turns&nbsp;
back and finds a snake on the ground, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.360
disappears as soon as he steps away. Behind him,&nbsp;
there's a cabin that he didn't notice earlier. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.440
spots a man entering the cabin and follows him&nbsp;
to ask for help. But when he opens the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.760
the man has hung himself inside. Suddenly, another&nbsp;
man yells at him from behind. Justin tumbles down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.520
seeing that the man looks exactly like the&nbsp;
one hanging in the room. The other man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.160
Carl, ignores the body and&nbsp;
scolds Justin for being there.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.040
Carl sets down chairs in front of the shack and&nbsp;
jokes about Justin returning to the death cult.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.880
Justin is confused, wondering how he got lost and&nbsp;
how the same man who's been hung in the shack is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.440
talking to him now. Carl chuckles, explaining that&nbsp;
the place is stuck in a time loop that repeats&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.520
tragic events repeatedly to appease the entity&nbsp;
residing there. People stuck in the loop have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.840
kill themselves to reset the time; otherwise,&nbsp;
the entity will kill them more viciously.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.160
Carl tells Justin that if he wants to leave, he&nbsp;
has to do it before the loop resets, or else he'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.640
be stuck there like the others. But Justin wants&nbsp;
to get Aaron back first. Carl offers to help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.000
showing Justin that when someone stuck in the&nbsp;
loop passes beyond the markers, they are looped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.720
back inside. But Justin can still pass them, so&nbsp;
the man asks him to get him a gun from Chris,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.880
who's also stuck in another loop. Carl gives&nbsp;
Justin a compass, telling him to trust it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.680
not what he sees. Before Justin leaves, Carl&nbsp;
laments about being trapped even in his mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.360
The entity doesn't let him sleep or dream,&nbsp;
so all he knows is the world inside his loop.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.320
In the morning, Aaron wakes up and finds a flock&nbsp;
of birds creating a circular shape in the air.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.400
The birds drop polaroids in front of him. Aaron&nbsp;
picks them up and sees one photo of a trailer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.480
and himself. He gives the photos to Hal, who&nbsp;
theorizes that the entity that guards them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.480
shows them what it sees, leading Aaron to think&nbsp;
it was watching him. Hal suggests heading to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.480
trailer in the photo, but Aaron is concerned&nbsp;
about Justin. Leaving the choice to him, Hal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.240
tells him to follow a trail, warning him that he&nbsp;
has to find Justin before the third moon is full.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.960
Aaron follows the trail as Hal suggested.&nbsp;
He passes beyond one of the loop markers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.680
then looks back. Anna walks into the same path on&nbsp;
the opposite side, but neither can see the other.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.600
At Chris' house, Justin meets Chris and Mike.&nbsp;
Mike has Chris handcuffed inside to help him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.560
get through addiction, reminding Justin&nbsp;
of the gun enthusiast that Lizzy talked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.560
about. Mike returns with a hard drive that&nbsp;
contains another message from the entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.160
He plays the video on his computer, seeing&nbsp;
another version of Mike and Chris, who get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.840
killed after trying to escape the loop. The&nbsp;
entity is telling them that their plans will not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.640
work. Chris advises Justin to escape the loop, no&nbsp;
matter what horrible thing the entity shows him.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.720
On the other side, Aaron sees the old tent with&nbsp;
the clock on the front. Hearing the music and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.960
screams, he looks inside and sees a man that keeps&nbsp;
getting up from his seat, killed, then comes back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.760
to where he started. The man sees him, saying&nbsp;
that he cannot help and he should leave. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.160
Aaron doesn't move, the man runs towards him then&nbsp;
explodes into a bloody mess, scaring Aaron away.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.680
Mike lets Justin take guns from&nbsp;
the basement back in Chris’s house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.360
sharing how he still wants to escape&nbsp;
the loop. He mentions his wife and baby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.600
leading Justin to realize that he's Jennifer's&nbsp;
husband. He contemplates telling him where she is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.800
but seeing that they won't meet while&nbsp;
stuck in their different loops, he leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.200
After Justin is gone, Mike douses the house&nbsp;
with gasoline and lights it on fire. Justin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.760
checks his bag, realizing that he left the&nbsp;
map that Carl drew for him in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.080
But Chris's house is already in flames, the map&nbsp;
burning along with it. In a blink of an eye,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.240
the house resets with Chris sitting on the porch.&nbsp;
Mike arrives at the house as if nothing happened.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.000
With the third moon nearly full, Justin&nbsp;
makes his way back to Carl's house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.600
using the compass as his guide. He&nbsp;
finds a trailer with a cougar nearby—the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.400
cougar snarls at him but leaves. Aaron suddenly&nbsp;
appears, entering the loop around the trailer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.400
The brothers check the trailer with a note left&nbsp;
behind by the owner. Thinking that no one's home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.280
the two leave. As soon as they do, a projector&nbsp;
plays, showing the brothers leaving the trailer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.720
The projector suddenly flings into the air,&nbsp;
over the many contained loops in the area.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.280
As the sun goes down, Aaron and Justin find&nbsp;
numerous statues while the camp gathers around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.760
for a feast. The brothers reach Carl's cabin at&nbsp;
nightfall, leaving the gun and taking the map back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.800
to Camp Arcadia. Here, Aaron decides that he still&nbsp;
wants to stay, despite the idea of being stuck in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.720
the time loop forever. He's tired of struggling&nbsp;
with life in the outside world that he'd take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.960
dying for a few seconds on each reset as long as&nbsp;
he's content with life when he's alive. Despite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.720
the idea that he can never leave, Aaron prefers&nbsp;
it rather than struggling with Justin again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.280
Once they leave, Carl clambers out of his&nbsp;
cabin and takes the gun. He shoots it into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.600
the abyss first before shooting himself on the&nbsp;
head. Even when he does this, his loop resets.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.240
Returning to camp, they spot Jennifer leaving on&nbsp;
a bicycle and Tim unlocking the cabin that he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.280
been guarding. Inside, they find countless tapes&nbsp;
and records and a T.V. set at the center. The T.V.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.720
switches on, showing them their experiences&nbsp;
in camp through the entity's point of view.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.360
Then, it shows the camp gathered&nbsp;
around the bonfire that evening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.280
where it drops a rope in the middle of the&nbsp;
group. Frightened, Aaron runs to the bonfire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.440
but he's too late. The place is a wreck, with&nbsp;
the clothes of the group left behind. Justin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.440
reminds him that they'll be back once the&nbsp;
time resets. The brothers sit down, waiting.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.480
Justin decides to stay, not&nbsp;
wanting to leave his brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.240
behind. With Justin finally respecting&nbsp;
his decision, Aaron chooses to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.080
Suddenly, the camp begins to reset. The brothers&nbsp;
run to their car, but it doesn't start. Instead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.640
they push it downhill, with Justin giving Aaron&nbsp;
instructions on what to do. Aaron takes the wheel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.880
tired of letting Justin control their lives. The&nbsp;
brothers finally reconcile their differences,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.000
promising to treat each other as equals&nbsp;
if they make it through this night. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.760
hop into the car as it speeds downhill, passing&nbsp;
through markers before the reset reaches them.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.880
In daylight, the car appears out of nowhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.840
The brothers escaped, leaving Camp&nbsp;
Arcadia and everyone in it behind.
