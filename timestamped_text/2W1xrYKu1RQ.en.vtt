00:00:06.587 --> 00:00:07.931
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:11.867
today I'll show you a supernatural thriller film: "The Empty Man" 

00:00:11.963 --> 00:00:15.131
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:15.275 --> 00:00:19.787
someday, Paul and his friends go hiking on a mountain in Bhutan

00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:23.819
standing at the top of a mountain, they are amazed by the breath-taking scenery

00:00:23.963 --> 00:00:29.099
Paul hears a strange voice that sounds like howling and some musical instrument performance

00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:31.931
however, nobody can hear it except for Paul

00:00:32.027 --> 00:00:36.395
Paul is curious, so he follows the voice but suddenly falls into a crevice

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:38.939
the rest are scared and want to rescue him

00:00:39.035 --> 00:00:41.771
but it's remote, and they can't call in a rescue 

00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:46.283
so the male friend, Angry Mustahe, decides to go down with a rope to save Paul

00:00:46.571 --> 00:00:51.227
when reaching the bottom, he finds Paul sitting on the ground in a catatonic state

00:00:51.371 --> 00:00:56.411
in front of him, there is a strange huge skeleton that has eight arms and hands

00:00:56.603 --> 00:00:58.571
it doesn't look like a human skeleton

00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:03.850
before Angry Mustache can help him up, Paul whispers, "don't touch me or you will die"

00:01:04.052 --> 00:01:08.084
Angry Mustache doesn't understand but still drags Paul out of the crevice 

00:01:08.228 --> 00:01:10.532
and walks down the mountain with the others

00:01:10.772 --> 00:01:15.044
right then, a snowstorm hits, and the temperature drops massively halfway the journey

00:01:15.332 --> 00:01:19.172
they come to an empty house later and have a break, sheltering from the storm

00:01:19.364 --> 00:01:23.732
there is no injury on Paul's body, but he seems to have lost consciousness

00:01:23.972 --> 00:01:25.940
Paul wakes up after three days

00:01:26.132 --> 00:01:30.260
he whispers something into his girlfriend's ear in the early morning then leaves the house

00:01:30.644 --> 00:01:33.284
hours later, others realize Paul is gone

00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:35.396
people start to worry about him

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:38.564
it's dangerous for him to be alone outside in the snow

00:01:38.804 --> 00:01:41.732
they follow his footsteps and find him sitting in the snow

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:44.228
blowing a bone flute that he found in the crevice

00:01:44.516 --> 00:01:48.740
Angry Mustache is annoyed by his blowjob on such a god-damned snowy day

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.236
so Angry Mustache shouts at him in anger

00:01:51.476 --> 00:01:54.692
but Paul shows no emotion and keeps blowing the flute

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.684
suddenly, Paul's girlfriend pulls out a dagger and kills Angry Mustache and his girlfriend

00:01:59.876 --> 00:02:04.275
then throws herself off the cliff, leaving Paul blowing the flute alone in the snow

00:02:04.772 --> 00:02:10.004
in 2018, James suffers from depression after his wife and son died in a car accident 

00:02:10.148 --> 00:02:12.692
and he has to live on pills to ease the pain

00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:14.660
he quit his job in the police force 

00:02:14.756 --> 00:02:19.172
and works at a hardware store selling some cam gears and hormone sprays

00:02:19.412 --> 00:02:22.772
his days are monotonous and lifeless, passing him by

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.708
one day, his neighbor's daughter Amanda has a chat with him

00:02:26.948 --> 00:02:29.396
she has been depressed since she lost her father

00:02:29.636 --> 00:02:32.900
she even tried to kill herself, but she has found a way to make peace

00:02:33.188 --> 00:02:37.028
through meditation, positive thinking, her life has changed completely

00:02:37.364 --> 00:02:41.156
she believes that people are capable of manifesting their thoughts into reality

00:02:41.396 --> 00:02:44.276
James doesn't understand or believe what she is saying

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.255
the next morning, a call wakes James up 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:48.359
it is his neighbor

00:02:48.455 --> 00:02:51.911
her daughter came home yesterday but went missing this morning

00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:55.031
there is a message written in blood on the bathroom mirror 

00:02:55.163 --> 00:02:57.515
saying, "the Empty Man made me do it"

00:02:57.707 --> 00:03:01.499
the neighbor thinks her daughter must have been kidnapped, so she calls the police

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.235
however, the police don't want to take that shit

00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:09.227
but rather, they suppose Amanda is just a teenager blown away by her hormones

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.579
knowing that she can't count on the police

00:03:11.723 --> 00:03:14.651
she reaches out to James, the former police officer

00:03:14.843 --> 00:03:19.691
James was a parent and understands his neighbor's concern, so he agrees to help her

00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:24.779
after the search, James finds a leaflet about the Pontifex Institute in Amanda's diary

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.995
on the back of the leaflet, the word "Tulpa" is written

00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:29.819
James doesn't know what it means

00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:34.811
thinking of what Amanda told him yesterday, James thinks she might have joined the institute

00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:39.515
he asks his neighbor to list Amanda's close friends and starts the investigation from there

00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:43.115
if she planned to run away from home, her friends must know something

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:48.443
James asks Amanda's closest friend if she knows where Amanda is and when she last saw her

00:03:48.683 --> 00:03:52.235
the ladybro tells James the last they met was 3 three days ago 

00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:55.787
when they played a game "calling the Empty Man" with other friends

00:03:55.883 --> 00:03:58.139
they were chatting and drinking on a bridge

00:03:58.235 --> 00:04:02.219
Amanda told her that if they found an empty bottle on the bridge and blow into it

00:04:02.363 --> 00:04:05.051
in the coming days, strange things would happen

00:04:05.243 --> 00:04:09.611
on the first day, they would hear the Empty Man and couldn't stop thinking about him

00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:12.299
on the second day, they would see him approaching

00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:16.475
and on the third day, the empty man would find them and take them to another world

00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:19.115
which means he would kill them and take their souls

00:04:19.403 --> 00:04:23.243
right then, Amanda picked up a bottle and tempted them to blow into it

00:04:23.387 --> 00:04:26.411
out of curiosity and unwilling to lose the blow game

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:29.003
all the kids took turns blowing into it

00:04:29.147 --> 00:04:31.259
they thought it was a stupid story

00:04:31.355 --> 00:04:35.627
but when they finished, a dark figure appeared on the bridge with a strange sound

00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:39.131
every time when the girl recalls this, she finds it creepy

00:04:39.227 --> 00:04:42.491
after that night, they all disappeared, just like Amanda

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:46.763
James thinks the Empty Man might be related to the cult Amanda mentioned before

00:04:46.907 --> 00:04:50.459
he suspects they kidnap kids in the name of an evil god

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.499
James drives to the bridge where they played the game to see if he can find any clues

00:04:55.643 --> 00:04:57.995
he finds the empty bottle and picks it up 

00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:02.411
he also wants to test how excellent his blowjob is and then blows into it

00:05:02.507 --> 00:05:04.667
suddenly the world has gone quiet

00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:06.587
he hears something is approaching

00:05:06.635 --> 00:05:08.699
he turns around but sees nothing

00:05:08.843 --> 00:05:11.675
before he leaves, he sees a manhole uncovered

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:16.091
he climbs down and finds the hanged bodies of the rest of Amanda's friends

00:05:16.427 --> 00:05:20.843
besides them, there is the same message written in blood as found in Amanda' house

00:05:20.843 --> 00:05:22.523
"the Empty Man made me do it"

00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:25.979
when he reports it to the police, the whole town is shocked

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:29.051
later, the ladybro is found dead in her bathroom

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:33.755
it looks like she had delusions before she stabbed herself to death with a pair of scissors

00:05:34.043 --> 00:05:37.067
she left exactly the same message written in blood on the floor

00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:39.083
"the Empty Man made me do it"

00:05:39.467 --> 00:05:41.867
the police begin to take this case seriously

00:05:42.107 --> 00:05:44.363
James doesn't stop the investigation

00:05:44.507 --> 00:05:46.955
he worries that something might happen to his neighbor

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:51.323
he finds the address of the Pontifex Institute and the meaning of "Tulpa" online

00:05:51.515 --> 00:05:54.731
it is a cult that encourages people to sacrifice themselves 

00:05:54.827 --> 00:05:57.083
and enter a new world through meditation

00:05:57.275 --> 00:05:59.675
that night, he wakes up in the middle of the night

00:05:59.771 --> 00:06:01.643
he hears some footsteps in his house

00:06:01.931 --> 00:06:04.427
he also sees somebody wandering outside the door

00:06:04.571 --> 00:06:07.067
he opens the door, but nobody is there

00:06:07.403 --> 00:06:12.059
the next day, James goes to the institute, hoping to find out Amanda's whereabouts

00:06:12.299 --> 00:06:15.275
but he doesn't get any useful information from the receptionist

00:06:15.515 --> 00:06:19.739
he briskly fills in the form the receptionist gave him then goes into the church

00:06:19.835 --> 00:06:24.155
where the cult leader is giving a lecture about the cult and their god, the Empty Man

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:27.707
after the lecture, James asks the leader if he saw Amanda

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:29.867
the leader doesn't answer him directly

00:06:30.011 --> 00:06:32.603
he invites James to walk around the institute

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.723
James sees a lot of bald believers sitting in meditation

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:39.755
later, he meets a believer who tells him that Amanda is still alive

00:06:39.803 --> 00:06:41.195
but she is not here

00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:43.931
she has been promoted because she has great potential 

00:06:44.075 --> 00:06:46.763
and she might have been taken to a camp in the woods

00:06:47.051 --> 00:06:49.115
using the address the believer gives him

00:06:49.211 --> 00:06:53.483
James finds the camp and some documents and preaching videos about this cult

00:06:53.627 --> 00:06:55.595
it turns out for hundreds of years

00:06:55.691 --> 00:06:59.339
the cult members have been helping the ancient evil spirit possess the human body 

00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:02.075
so that they can get asylum and blessings from him

00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:07.451
just when James is leaving with the documents and videos, he hears some noises outside

00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:11.051
James walks out of the house and sees a fire over the lake

00:07:11.147 --> 00:07:15.035
he approaches cautiously and sees the cult performing a ritual

00:07:15.227 --> 00:07:17.003
they spot him and pursue him

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:19.883
James runs back to the car and escapes at last

00:07:20.027 --> 00:07:24.203
when James hands over the evidence to a police officer, he is disinterested 

00:07:24.347 --> 00:07:27.995
instead, he blames James for entering the cult's private realm

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:31.355
now James understands that he can only rely on himself

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.803
the police won't help him solve the case

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:36.635
James goes to his store and grabs some weapons 

00:07:36.683 --> 00:07:40.859
then he goes to his neighbor and tells her that Amanda has joined a cult

00:07:41.003 --> 00:07:45.179
it's better that she leaves the house and stays somewhere safe for a few days

00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:47.579
James slips into the cult's library

00:07:47.675 --> 00:07:50.843
where he is astonished to find lots of information about himself 

00:07:50.987 --> 00:07:55.547
including his date of birth, work experience, a birthday coupon he used in a restaurant 

00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:57.755
and even prescriptions from the hospital

00:07:57.947 --> 00:08:02.123
he also sees some nude photos of him, which he has no memory of at all

00:08:02.507 --> 00:08:06.299
to get more clues, he follows a group of followers and observes them

00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:09.899
he notes that they visit a patient in secret at the hospital each day 

00:08:10.043 --> 00:08:12.587
James guesses maybe they are visiting the leader

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:17.819
so he goes to the hospital with a gun, where he finds Amanda taking care of a sick man

00:08:17.915 --> 00:08:23.051
James is so excited that he calls his neighbor immediately to tell her he has found Amanda

00:08:23.147 --> 00:08:27.899
but much to his shock, the neighbor has no idea who Amanda and James are

00:08:28.043 --> 00:08:33.035
Amanda tells James the man in the bed is Paul, who fell into the crevice years ago

00:08:33.323 --> 00:08:36.491
the strange skeleton Paul saw in the crevice is the Empty Man

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:40.715
although he is long dead, he can still control weak-willed people

00:08:40.907 --> 00:08:44.171
he possesses their bodies and communicates with his followers

00:08:44.363 --> 00:08:48.107
in other words, Paul is now a human vessel for the Empty Man

00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:50.699
however, Paul is weakening and dying

00:08:50.939 --> 00:08:54.107
the follower needs to find a new vessel for the Empty Man

00:08:54.299 --> 00:08:57.755
this time they make one according to the Empty Man's instruction

00:08:57.947 --> 00:09:01.211
the person selected needs to have a hormone-strong and healthy body 

00:09:01.259 --> 00:09:03.707
and must be full of hatred towards the world

00:09:03.851 --> 00:09:06.923
so that the Empty Man can possess him fully for long

00:09:07.067 --> 00:09:12.635
it turns out James has exactly the hormone-strong body, the perfect replacement for Paul

00:09:12.827 --> 00:09:15.131
but the problem is he has a steady mind

00:09:15.227 --> 00:09:18.635
the Empty Man can't penetrate his mind and control him

00:09:18.827 --> 00:09:22.859
so the followers fabricate fake memories and implant them into his mind

00:09:22.955 --> 00:09:26.603
they make James believe that his wife and son died in a car accident

00:09:26.747 --> 00:09:29.435
to make him feel guilty and suffer more depression

00:09:29.531 --> 00:09:32.700
they also make him believe that he was having an affair with his neighbor 

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.235
when the accident happened

00:09:34.331 --> 00:09:39.515
right now, James is full of false memories, and he can't tell what is real and what is not

00:09:39.851 --> 00:09:43.259
that also explains why he can't remember when he took the nude pictures 

00:09:43.307 --> 00:09:45.995
and why the cult has all of his information

00:09:46.235 --> 00:09:51.035
due to all those strikes, James almost loses himself and collapses mentally

00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:54.635
he tries hard to struggle against the demon but to no avail

00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:59.819
the Empty Man takes the chance to enter his body through the mouth and possesses him finally

00:10:00.155 --> 00:10:04.235
shortly after, James shows his stolid face and shoots Paul

00:10:04.475 --> 00:10:08.603
the followers all bow to James, who is now the new Empty Man

00:10:08.795 --> 00:10:11.723
this's Daniel CC movie channel, peace out
