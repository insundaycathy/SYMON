Hi, Movie Recaps here. Today&nbsp;
I will show you a crime,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.280
drama, thriller film from 2020, titled Run Hide&nbsp;
Fight. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.000
Our protagonist is Zoe Hull, a teenage girl that&nbsp;
struggles with the death of her mother - in fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.760
she thinks she can still see her around&nbsp;
and even has whole conversations with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.760
This has caused her to shut down emotionally and&nbsp;
has also put some strain on her relationship with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.600
her father Todd, who is trying his best to connect&nbsp;
with her through activities like teaching her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.760
hunt. It is during one of these hunts that&nbsp;
he passes on some important wisdom to her:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.480
she must always take care of unfinished business.&nbsp;
The advice resonates with Zoe, so when her shot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.560
doesn't finish off a deer, she ends its&nbsp;
suffering by hitting its head with a rock.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.920
After returning from their little hunting&nbsp;
trip, Todd tells Zoe that maybe they should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.160
see a therapist again because Zoe is cutting&nbsp;
herself off from everything she cares about.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.200
This comment angers Zoe and they start arguing&nbsp;
over it for what obviously isn't the first time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.840
luckily they are interrupted by her best friend&nbsp;
Lewis Washington, who has come to pick her up in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.560
his car. On their way to school, they exchange&nbsp;
insults with some bullies in another car, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.040
also notice their classmate Chris Jelick planting&nbsp;
a strange device in the middle of an open field,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.400
but they think it is just a prank. At school,&nbsp;
Lewis tries to ask Zoe to prom, but Zoe dislikes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.520
the idea. Lewis thinks Zoe is shutting down too,&nbsp;
this irritates her the same way it happened with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.680
her dad. She leaves for the bathroom after Lewis&nbsp;
accidentally spills a drink on her and finds Anna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.680
Jelick moving the ceiling panels. Anna leaves the&nbsp;
bathroom in a rush, so Zoe takes the opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.240
to check the panels she had moved but finds&nbsp;
nothing behind them. Several incendiary devices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.280
are set off around town, except for the one Kip&nbsp;
Quade leaves at the school's front office. Having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.920
so many fires burning at the same time means the&nbsp;
roads are clogged and first responders like law&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.600
enforcement and firefighters are overwhelmed. At&nbsp;
school, a van suddenly crashes into the cafeteria,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.480
carrying two armed teenagers: the leader,&nbsp;
Tristan Voy, and Chris Jelick. They're soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.840
joined by Anna Jelick and Kip Quade, who are also&nbsp;
carrying weapons. After shooting various students,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.080
Tristan asks everyone to use their phones to tell&nbsp;
their parents what is going on. Lewis calls his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.880
mom and leaves a message telling her he doesn't&nbsp;
have any regrets. Meanwhile, Zoe learns what is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.440
going on thanks to a wounded girl that enters the&nbsp;
bathroom and dies there. She escapes by crawling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.520
through the bathroom ceiling and falls into the&nbsp;
school kitchen, where the cook is also hiding.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.560
When Chris comes to investigate the noises, the&nbsp;
cook tries to confront him, but he shoots her. Zoe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.640
leaves the building through the back door after&nbsp;
he is gone. After everyone is done talking to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.640
their parents, Tristan borrows a phone and calls&nbsp;
the school's front office to tell them about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.880
shooting. The rules say they need to confirm&nbsp;
the information before they can call lockdown,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.120
so Tristan asks all the students to live-stream&nbsp;
with their phones and tells the video hosting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.600
companies not to interrupt the streams or he will&nbsp;
have to shoot people. As he starts giving a speech&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.000
about entropy and truth, the school's principal&nbsp;
and security guard arrive at the cafeteria to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.480
their confirmation. The principal tries to talk&nbsp;
Tristan down by apologizing for not listening to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.040
him before, but Chris shoots him while allowing&nbsp;
the guard to escape. Tristan asks everyone to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.280
turn off their recordings except for the one with&nbsp;
the most viewers, which happens to be Lewis and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.920
his streaming on the school's social page. He is&nbsp;
tasked with following Tristan around and recording&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.240
everything, and the hostages are ordered to&nbsp;
barricade the hole the van made on the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.720
Outside, Zoe considers leaving but comes&nbsp;
back when she hears voices. She stops a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.720
group of students from entering the school and&nbsp;
warns them of what is going on, they all leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.520
except for Zoe's friend Cora, who accepts helping&nbsp;
Zoe warn the other classes that are still inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.280
One of the teachers thinks they're pulling a&nbsp;
prank and ignores them, so to have better luck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.520
with another classroom, they break a window.&nbsp;
This time they are heard, and the whole class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.080
escapes through the window while Zoe activates&nbsp;
the fire alarm. This proves to be useless because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.480
Anna goes into the electrical room to disable&nbsp;
the alarm and cut off power. Right after the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.200
school's front office calls for lockdown, the&nbsp;
homemade bomb Kip left there earlier explodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.080
The police finally arrive then, and Sheriff Tarsy&nbsp;
starts closing the perimeter. The situation is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.840
finally making it to the news as well, although&nbsp;
they are not showing the stream, they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.800
recording from outside. Irritated, Tristan tells&nbsp;
the phone camera that the public wants to see him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.080
not some reporter. Meanwhile, Zoe is searching the&nbsp;
school to tell any remaining students to get out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.880
but Anna finds her and starts shooting at her.&nbsp;
Her leg is wounded before she manages to run away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.760
and hide in a room filled with balloons that allow&nbsp;
her to sneakily jump on Anna when she follows her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.800
The girls fight for the gun; Zoe overpowers&nbsp;
Anna and shoots her. With Lewis still recording,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.720
Tristan goes to the Spanish classroom to take&nbsp;
those students with him to the cafeteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.880
The teacher tries to reason with him, Tristan&nbsp;
responds by making her take off her blouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.640
He is about to touch her inappropriately when&nbsp;
Lewis interrupts him by saying he has some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.200
questions from the watchers, effectively taking&nbsp;
Tristan's focus away from the teacher. He wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.920
as much attention as possible, so he is willing to&nbsp;
answer those questions. Tristan explains this plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.080
took him fourteen months to make it sing since he&nbsp;
had to research the building blueprints, gather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.800
the weapons, etcetera. A police officer visits&nbsp;
Tristan's house to talk to his parents only to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.680
find the mother dead, her neck had been cut open.&nbsp;
In the meantime, Zoe's dad hears the news about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.840
the shooting on the radio and decides to drive&nbsp;
to the school with weapons loaded in his truck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.840
In the cafeteria, Chris is in the middle of&nbsp;
talking to the voices in his head when hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.760
on the news that the cops have arrived, so he&nbsp;
goes to the hole on the wall and shoots at them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.760
Tristan hears the gunshots and decides to&nbsp;
return, taking the whole Spanish class with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.280
Zoe sees them in the hallway and when Kip&nbsp;
walks in the opposite direction from the group,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.360
she decides to follow him. He is trying to&nbsp;
get to another classroom filled with students,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.800
so Zoe appears in front of him to call&nbsp;
his attention and get him to chase her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.720
She takes him through a slippery floor and after&nbsp;
he falls, she unloads a fire extinguisher on his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.120
face and also hits him with it. Kip is dragged&nbsp;
to the auditorium and handcuffed to a chair,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.440
and he confesses to Zoe that he is doing all this&nbsp;
because of a bullying incident in middle school&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.320
that -in his eyes- has never ended; Zoe thinks he&nbsp;
is disgusting and pathetic for using that as an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.560
excuse for cold-blooded murder. After taking&nbsp;
his shotgun, Zoe comes across another group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.720
of students with their teacher. Wanting to help&nbsp;
them escape, she borrows a phone and calls Cora,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.560
who hands her phone to the sheriff so they&nbsp;
can coordinate a plan. Sheriff Tarsy tells the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.800
reporters to record him instead of the school&nbsp;
before calling Tristan's phone. He distracts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.280
him with conversation while Zoe safely guides as&nbsp;
many groups of students as possible to the exit;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.320
however, her rescue appears on the news, which&nbsp;
allows Tristan to discover the ruse. So he hangs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.120
up on Tarsy and proceeds to call his teammates.&nbsp;
Zoe has Anna's phone so she answers his call,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.920
Tristan tells her to show herself or he will start&nbsp;
shooting people. He even kills a student as proof.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.320
After telling him she will be there, Zoe returns&nbsp;
to the auditorium and frees Kip, who is feeling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.400
guilty for what he has done and wants to die&nbsp;
now. Zoe tells him he should be in charge of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.280
his legacy and convinces him to cooperate, so she&nbsp;
hands him back the shotgun. While Todd sneaks into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.520
the school grounds and gets his weapon ready to&nbsp;
help his daughter, Zoe makes it to the cafeteria&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.680
and Tristan starts asking her questions for the&nbsp;
stream. A furious Chris wants to kill her because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.680
she shot his sister, but Tristan won't allow it,&nbsp;
he believes everything must happen at the right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.760
moment. They are suddenly interrupted by Kip,&nbsp;
who after an exchange of insults with Chris and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.640
Tristan, shoots his shotgun, only managing to hit&nbsp;
Tristan on the shoulder before Chris kills him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.800
Lewis gets hurt in the exchange. Zoe and Lewis&nbsp;
take advantage of the distraction to escape;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.880
Chris goes after them. They hide in the Spanish&nbsp;
classroom, and while Zoe checks on Lewis' wound,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.120
they confess their feelings for each other. Lewis&nbsp;
also informs her of some explosives hidden in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.520
van, so Zoe leaves the classroom to check on it,&nbsp;
allowing Chris to find her and chase her again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.520
Zoe enters the science classroom this time and&nbsp;
opens all the burners, starting a fire when Chris&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.920
tries to come closer. Her attempt at escaping does&nbsp;
not work, however, because Chris still manages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.000
to catch her. He smashes her head against a glass&nbsp;
cabinet then punches her a couple of times before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
throwing her to the ground. When he is about to&nbsp;
kill her, Todd shoots from his spot outside and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.240
kills him instead. The police approach him as soon&nbsp;
as they hear the gunshot, and Zoe can do nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.880
but watch through the window how they arrest and&nbsp;
take her father away. Afterward, Zoe grabs Chris'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.200
gun and makes her way back to the cafeteria, only&nbsp;
pausing to retrieve Lewis' phone when she finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.520
it on the floor in a hallway. She sends Tristan a&nbsp;
picture of Chris' body, causing him not to talk to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.920
her anymore. So instead she hijacks the stream&nbsp;
and tells Tristan the world will remember her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.160
not him, which enrages him. Tristan grabs one&nbsp;
of the explosives from the van and gives it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.400
a student that he drags out of the cafeteria with&nbsp;
him; Zoe sees them leave so she takes the chance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.480
to go in and tell all the hostages to run now&nbsp;
that Tristan's gone. There is still the little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.320
issue of the bomb in the van, which Zoe solves&nbsp;
by putting the shift in reverse and jamming the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.040
gas pedal with Chris' rifle - this causes the van&nbsp;
to move outside and explode in the parking lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.640
SWAT uses this opportunity to enter the&nbsp;
building, and they mistakenly arrest Zoe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.200
while she is trying to find Tristan. An explosion&nbsp;
coming from the next room reveals Tristan's body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.840
and while the SWAT takes care of it, Zoe sees her&nbsp;
mother, who tells her she loves her and wishes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.800
her goodbye before disappearing for good as Zoe&nbsp;
cries her heart out. Outside the school, Sheriff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.080
Tarsy frees Zoe, shakes her hand, apologizes for&nbsp;
the incorrect arrest, and praises her actions;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.240
Zoe responds by asking him to allow her to&nbsp;
see her father. Todd is inside a police car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.800
handcuffed, but he still has a heartfelt talk with&nbsp;
his daughter. They repair their relationship and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.440
reassure each other of how important they are&nbsp;
in their lives. After making sure Lewis is fine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.680
Zoe notices Tristan sneaking out of the school&nbsp;
- he had faked his death by changing his clothes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.920
with the other student so cops would initially&nbsp;
think the burned body was his. She recovers Todd's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.080
rifle and follows Tristan into the woods, where he&nbsp;
is getting some money and a passport out of a box&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.880
he had hidden under a bridge as part of the plan.&nbsp;
Zoe does not hesitate to shoot him from afar then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.600
comes closer, noticing the shot was not enough to&nbsp;
kill him. She mentions the advice on unfinished&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.600
business her dad had given her while hunting&nbsp;
and picks up a big rock to finish Tristan off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.080
Yet when she brings it down, she does not hit his&nbsp;
head - she drops the rock in the river instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.720
Zoe decides to leave him there to die because,&nbsp;
unlike an animal, suffering is what he deserves.
