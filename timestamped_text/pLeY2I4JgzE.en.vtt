he awakens boswick finds himself on a subway track&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.680
he is standing on a stool bound by razor wire and&nbsp;
his tongue is screwed into a vise a tv also placed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.960
on the track turns on and he sees a video from&nbsp;
someone mimicking the jigsaw killer from the saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.040
films the video says the bose wick used his tongue&nbsp;
to lie in court and railroad innocent people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.040
now he will be literally railroaded by an oncoming&nbsp;
subway unless he rips out his tongue and jumps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.960
off the track boswick struggles and eventually&nbsp;
rips off his tongue but it's to no avail as he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.640
is too slow and is crushed by the train we cut&nbsp;
to a man named zeke banks committing a robbery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.120
with his gang as his gang tries to escape they&nbsp;
are surrounded by cops it's revealed that banks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.720
is an undercover agent because he didn't inform&nbsp;
his precinct of this heist they blew his cover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.120
banks has no choice but to return to his role&nbsp;
as a detective banks has a fraud relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.720
with the other cops in the precinct we learns that&nbsp;
they despise him because he turned in a dirty cop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.480
banks also feels inferior because his father&nbsp;
marcus was the precinct's old campus in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.000
beloved cop captain angie garza assigns&nbsp;
him a rookie partner named william shank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.760
shank remarks that marcus is the reason for&nbsp;
everything he does captain garza as signs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.200
banks and shank investigate the killing in the&nbsp;
subway not knowing that the corpse is boswick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.120
the pair also bond with banks telling shank&nbsp;
that he is divorced and doesn't trust women&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.560
[ __ ] replies that he is happily married with a&nbsp;
young son at the crime scene the victim cannot be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.560
identified and all the pieces was scattered after&nbsp;
they returned to the precinct banks gets a package&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.800
with a usb drive and it is a message played&nbsp;
by the new jigsaw killer the killer explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.680
that he intends to reform the police through&nbsp;
his actions it ends with an image of a spiral&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.040
painted on the wall of the courthouse the cops&nbsp;
go to the courthouse where they find another box&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.120
inside is boswick's tongue and badge the police&nbsp;
now realize the killer is targeting them and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.120
boswick was killed in the subway banks pays his&nbsp;
respects to boswick's widow and has an argument&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.360
with his ex-wife who is also there banks goes home&nbsp;
for the night where his father is waiting for him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.360
the two have a distant and strained relationship&nbsp;
nonetheless marcus promises to help banks with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.560
the case over dinner the following night in&nbsp;
a flashback we learn that the police officer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.080
banks turned in for being dirty was named pete&nbsp;
banks witnessed pete shoot and kill a potential&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.080
witness in a murder case against a cop due to&nbsp;
banks testimony pete went to jail for nine years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.320
the next morning detectives kraus and fitch use&nbsp;
video footage to identify the man boswick was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.320
pursuing before he was murdered they decide not to&nbsp;
tell banks because they hate him fitch goes to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.080
warehouse where he believes the suspect's staying&nbsp;
but finds nobody there instead he is knocked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.880
unconscious by a cloaked figure when he awakens&nbsp;
he finds himself in a trap that night banks goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.200
to his father's home to work on the case but finds&nbsp;
him gone a flashback shows that marcus disapproved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.160
of banks turning in pete but still did his best&nbsp;
to protect his son from the inevitable blowback&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.000
the next day another package from the jigsaw&nbsp;
killer is delivered to banks revealing a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.800
location the police venture there and find fitch's&nbsp;
badge and his ten severed fingers in a flashback&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.160
we learn that fitch refused to provide backup for&nbsp;
banks out of anger for what happened with pete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:25.440
as a result banks is shot while pursuing a suspect&nbsp;
marcus then punches fitch for his insubordination&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.440
but doesn't remove him from the force then in&nbsp;
the crime scene another flashback shows us what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.600
happened the jigsaw killer explains in a recording&nbsp;
that fitch used his fingers to murder people so he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.800
must narrate them off to live fitch once gunned&nbsp;
down an innocent man after the man insulted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.960
him during a traffic stop the jigsaw killer has&nbsp;
placed fitch in a tub slowly filling with water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.760
at some point the water will hit exposed&nbsp;
electricity wires and electrocute him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.120
each of fitch's fingers is attached by a wire to&nbsp;
a winch that is activated whenever fitch clenches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.360
his teeth on a mechanism the detective tries to&nbsp;
rip off his fingers but like boswick doesn't do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.440
it fast enough to escape death banks and shank&nbsp;
continue the investigation but find no leads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.520
banks decides to interrogate pete who is&nbsp;
now leading a recovery group for ex-convicts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.400
pete is regretful for killing the witness&nbsp;
but still bitter at banks for turning him in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.320
nonetheless he has an alibi for the murder&nbsp;
meanwhile marcus has still never returned home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.760
the next day banks gets another package inside&nbsp;
this one is shank skin banks recognizes it due&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:42.400
to the skin containing a tattoo from shanks arm&nbsp;
in the note the killer says he is under bank skin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.520
and he will soon go for the head there is also&nbsp;
another clue linked to where the body can be found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.400
banks is devastated that his new partner is dead&nbsp;
at the precinct garza gets a text telling her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.560
get a file from the cold case storage room that&nbsp;
will help her crack the jigsaw case simultaneously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.680
as banks goes to tell shanks family of his death&nbsp;
the police scanner announces an attack by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.600
jigsaw killer on a beat cop banks rushes to the&nbsp;
scene where the cop says that he was slashed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.680
a person in a pig mask banks is confused as&nbsp;
this doesn't match the jigsaw killer's ammo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.680
he eventually deduces that this attack was simply&nbsp;
meant to distract the police he also realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.400
that when the killer said it was going for the&nbsp;
head he meant chief garza as the head of police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.440
banks can't get in touch with the chief and rushes&nbsp;
back to the station meanwhile the message to garza&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.120
lures her into an ambush and she is apprehended&nbsp;
by the killer and attached to a trap the killer's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.240
recording explains that garza turns a blind&nbsp;
eye to the rampant corruption in her precinct&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.320
and she must be punished a faucet above her head&nbsp;
begins dripping scalding hot wax onto her face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.000
she can deactivate the trap if she jabs her&nbsp;
neck against a blade and sever her spinal cord&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:05.120
otherwise the wax will silence her forever garza&nbsp;
is killed by the wax with banks arriving a few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:11.520
moments too slow to save her banks blames pete&nbsp;
for the murders while another cop blames marcus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.600
banks is unsure what to do as he has no idea&nbsp;
where his father is but he pursues his initial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:24.400
lead and goes after pete when he arrives at pete's&nbsp;
workplace he is knocked unconscious by the killer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.240
in another flashback marcus found the killer's&nbsp;
headquarters marcus is attacked by the killer is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.640
knocked out when banks recovers he is handcuffed&nbsp;
to a pipe with a hacksaw nearby banks readies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:43.520
himself to saw through his handcuffs but to no&nbsp;
avail then he sees a bobby pin on the floor nearby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:49.040
he uses the pin to pick the lock banks learns&nbsp;
he is locked in a room with a captured pete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.040
a recording play is telling the duo&nbsp;
that pete's life is in bank's hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.080
a crusher machine is then activated and&nbsp;
glass bottles are sent into the machine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:04.000
via conveyor belt when the bottles are crushed the&nbsp;
shards are shot out of the crusher and into pete's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
back banks finds the key to release pete and is&nbsp;
wounded by the glass in his efforts to free him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.600
although banks freeze pete from the trap pete&nbsp;
dies from his wounds the door opens and banks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:22.320
walks out to find shank it turns out that shank is&nbsp;
the new jigsaw killer we learn that shank was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:28.320
son of the witness that pete murdered banks made&nbsp;
sure that shenk wasn't also killed after helping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:34.080
him stay hidden after his dad was shot shank&nbsp;
explains that he faked his family so that people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:39.360
wouldn't suspect him as a killer and that the skin&nbsp;
with the tattoo on it was actually boswick skin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:46.400
that he tattooed after boswick died shank tells&nbsp;
banks that he has his father he used bank's phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.000
and texted him the address for the ambush shank&nbsp;
then asks banks to join him in his mission of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.160
killing dirty cops shenk also explains that&nbsp;
he was inspired in this mission by john cramer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.680
the original jigsaw killer bank says he will&nbsp;
join shank but the killer doesn't trust him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:09.920
shinks says the banks failed the first test by&nbsp;
trying to save pete he will now give banks a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:16.240
second test to see if banks can be trusted shank&nbsp;
calls the police and reports an active shooting at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:22.000
their location and hands banks a gun with one&nbsp;
bullet he then leads banks into a room where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.920
marcus is strung up by wires from the rafters&nbsp;
shink has been slowly draining marcus's blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.920
the test is that banks can shoot a mechanism that&nbsp;
will allow his father to be freed if he does that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.480
shink will make an escape through a hidden&nbsp;
elevator knowing that banks is not an ally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.040
banks can also shoot shank and stop him but&nbsp;
will then have no bullets remaining to free&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:49.360
marcus and marcus will die of blood loss or banks&nbsp;
can escape with shank thus proving his commitment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.960
and become shanks partner shenk explains that&nbsp;
marcus is being punished because he was the chief&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.000
who presided over a reign of terror letting his&nbsp;
precinct engage in all manner of illegal behavior&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.120
in the name of being tough on crime when shanks&nbsp;
said everything was due to marcus he meant that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:11.120
marcus is indirectly responsible for his father's&nbsp;
death marcus objects to this portrayal and claims&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:17.120
his tactics did more good than harm meanwhile&nbsp;
the cops arrive and begin storming the warehouse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.760
banks eventually uses the bullet to activate the&nbsp;
mechanism to free his father marcus though still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:29.200
attached to the wires is lowered to the ground&nbsp;
banks pulls out the tubes draining marcus's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:35.280
blood as shank runs to the escape elevator banks&nbsp;
manages to catch up to shank and the pair engage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:41.120
in a fistfight the cops bust through the door&nbsp;
and rush in the wires suddenly activate again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:46.480
manipulating marcus like a marionette the same&nbsp;
type of puppet shank used to deliver his messages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:52.240
as the jigsaw killer the wires make it look&nbsp;
like marcus is aiming a weapon at the cops banks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:58.000
abandons shank to try and call off the cops but&nbsp;
they open fire marcus is killed in front of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.840
son as bank screams out in rage shink disappears&nbsp;
in his elevator with a smile on his face
