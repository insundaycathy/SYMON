00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.320
Hello everyone, this is Mr. Brain Junkie here!
and today we'll be talking about a science

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.690
fiction film called Jupiter Ascending!

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.390
Be ready for some spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.980
Somewhere in the far corners of the universe,
an entire civilization appears to have vanished,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.500
leaving only buildings and cars behind.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.880
Apparently, the population was harvested by
a powerful family known as the Abrasax, consisting

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.490
of the eldest brother Balem, the younger brother
Titus and their sister Kalique.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.970
All three children have inherited numerous
planets from their recently deceased mother,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.450
and they're obviously fighting over the estates.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.090
The youngest brother is quite envious towards
Balem, who obtained a valuable planet known

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.420
as Earth that's worth more than all his properties
combined.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.770
Somewhere in the city of Chicago, A woman
named Jupiter is working as a cleaner for

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.320
the rich neighbors, and she seems to hate
her job very much.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.969
Her family doesn't offer her much help either,
as they refuse to lend her money, only wanting

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.879
her to work for them like a slave.

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.199
Jupiter's cousin is the worst out of everyone
else, as he wants the girl to sell her eggs

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.969
like a chicken to the pharmacy, so that he
can make a few extra bucks.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.390
Surprisingly, the woman actually agrees to
this as she also desires to buy something

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.800
that's way out of her budget.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.600
At night, a mysterious hunter named Caine
goes to a clinic in order to search for his

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.600
bounty.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.330
It turns out that the the man is looking for
the main character, and he's able to identify

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.010
her using the smell alone.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.120
However, he quickly notices other bounty hunters
outside the building, waiting to ambush him

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.689
the moment he goes out.

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.840
Caine prepares the weapons and actives the
boots that allows him to levitate in the air.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.880
The man rushes outside where multiple shots
are bombarded towards him, but Caine is able

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.920
to dodge them effectively and block them using
his shield.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.100
He manages to counter quickly and wounds one
of the assassins, taking the opportunity to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.490
escape from the enemies.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.009
Apparently, they are hired by lord Balem to
track down Jupiter as well, but the leader

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.750
plans to betray their master along side his
most trusted comrade.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.090
The hunters reported their finding to Balem's
sister, Kalique, who offers them a better

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.040
deal compared to her brother.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.350
At the same time, lord Balem has received
the news from his team about the girl, but

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.710
the hunters were not able to retrieve any
photos, only her genetic identifier from the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.710
clinic.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.250
Balem order his minions to go through everyone
around the woman's address and kill her immediately

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.430
upon confirming her identity.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.510
Back on Earth, Jupiter is cleaning the house
for her employer, who's struggles about what

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.380
to wear for the upcoming date.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.130
When the woman goes to grab a dress for her
friend, she notices something wrong as she

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.400
sees the woman being lifted in the air by
multiple aliens, trying to identify her genetics.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.980
Suddenly, Jupiter's phone rings and startles
the creatures, causing them to rush aggressively

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.310
towards her.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.790
Moments later, the two are returned to their
previous locations with their memories erased,

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.980
but Jupiter can't help but feel that something
is not right.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.450
She arrives at the clinic after work, but
notices everyone staring at her strangely.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.150
The nurse calls the woman in for the operation,
but Jupiter begins panicking after the physicians

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.849
begin tying up her arms and legs, levitating
her into the air.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.040
The doctors confirm that they have the right
person, and proceeds to try and kill her.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.489
Luckily, Caine rushes in just in time and
begins shooting at the imposters, revealing

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.830
that they are in fact the aliens from before.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.560
The little monsters attack the hunter like
wild beasts, but the man is able to knock

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.720
them back and kill them with his weapon, before
taking Jupiter to a safe place.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.230
Apparently, Canine is working for Balem's
brother, Titus, who's well aware of his sibling's

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.930
plan to eliminate the girl.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.790
The man tries to explain that he's a bioengineered
human who has the DNA of Canines, and that

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.050
she's far from the only intelligent species
in the universe.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.980
Caine tells her that she's likely targeted
by a powerful man who wants her dead, and

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.380
they must leave right now.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.590
The hunter brings Jupiter outside the building
and carries her in the air, as they prepare

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.110
to board the ship that was sent here by Titus.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.420
Their escape is quickly interrupted when multiple
enemy ships appear from the atmosphere and

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.830
fire at them, destroying their only way out
from this planet.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.519
The huge explosion sends both of them flying,
but Caine is able to recover quickly and catch

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.530
the woman before she drops to her death.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.090
The hunter tries escaping while carrying Jupiter,
but the enemies follow closely behind and

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.110
begin shooting furiously at them.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.560
Caine is able to dodge the attacks using his
amazing agility and block the shots with the

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.000
shield, but the aliens cause tremendous damage
as they break through everything in their

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
way.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.120
After escaping a giant explosion, The hunter
manages to land on one of the enemies as the

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.820
ship begins to accelerate quickly, trying
to throw both of them off.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.040
Caine tries to hang on desperately and eventually
is able open the ship's door and throw out

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.170
the alien, planning to use the vehicle for
himself.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.500
The enemies pursue him closely behind while
shooting continuously, but Caine is able to

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.230
evade the attacks and destroy them one by
one.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.200
The last alien charges directly at the hunter,
but Caine counters at the last moment, slicing

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.950
the enemy in to pieces.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.670
He catches onto the falling woman once again,
and finally brings her to safety after destroying

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.920
the entire army.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.480
In order to find a reliable shelter away from
the enemies, Caine brings Jupiter to one of

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.420
his comrades called Stinger, who's also a
genetically engineered human.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.521
The man quickly notices that the bees are
acting strangely around Jupiter as they all

00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:02.500
seem to listen to woman's command.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.560
He immediately kneels down and realizes her
true identity as a member of the royal family.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.880
Stinger explains that bees are engineered
to have the ability to recognize royalty,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.950
and the fact that she can control the insects
means that she's a royal descendent.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.550
Apparently, Stinger was Caine's commanding
officer in the military,

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.470
but the latter attacked a person from the
royal family which resulted in both of their

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.620
wings being cut off as punishment.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.790
This is also why Caine has agreed to work
for Titus, as he wants to help his comrade

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.560
get back what they have lost.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.370
Stinger tells Jupiter that the people on Earth
were evolved from a distant planet called

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.370
Orous.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.960
The original humans combined their DNA into
a specie on earth and grew a population that

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.760
multiplies exponentially.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.030
When the specie's numbers reach a tipping
point, the original humans will begin a process

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.450
called the harvesting.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.840
Their Conversation is cut short when the bees
begin to fly chaotically inside the room,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.870
indicating that enemies are nearby.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.760
Stinger quickly takes the woman away while
Caine decides to stay and give them time to

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.760
escape.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.440
The man shoots furiously at the enemies outside,
but gets knocked away by a massive shockwave.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.690
He recovers quickly and begins attacking the
invaders, knocking them out as he deflects

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.710
the incoming shots from the enemies.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.060
Stinger brings Jupiter outside and is quickly
attacked by numerous aliens, but the man is

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.000
able to kill them using his weapon.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.210
However, they eventually run into one the
the hunters who knocks Stinger to the ground

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.240
using a powerful shockwave.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.280
Jupiter tires to use the bees to attack the
enemy in order to buy her time to escape,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.280
but the man recovers quickly and fires at
her, knocking her unconscious.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.360
The aliens quickly surround the girl, but
before she can be killed, multiple shots are

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.950
fired towards them as the leader of the hunters
betray his team and kills off everyone.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.990
Caine rushes out from the house after killing
all the hunters, but only to see that Jupiter

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.880
is being taken into the spaceship.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.260
He rushes towards the vehicle desperately
while using his flying boots, and grabs onto

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.800
the plane before takeoff.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.250
The bounty hunters eventually arrive at a
planet that looks very similar to Earth, and

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.560
they enter the atmosphere in order to meet
with Kalique, the sister of Balem.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.880
Caine takes the chance to escape from the
ship and waits for the right time in order

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.780
to save the girl from her captors.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.640
At night, Jupiter wakes up in a fancy room
and is greeted by Kalique herself, but she's

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.080
quickly astonished by the girl appearance.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.660
The woman takes Jupiter to a room full of
candles, where a statue that appears to resemble

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.750
the main character stands in front of them.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.660
The woman learns that Kalique is actually
14000 years old, and the statue is her mother,

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.710
who died not so long ago.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:31.260
Apparently, Jupiter is born genetically identical
to Kalique's mother, meaning that she has

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.970
the right to their inheritance, which includes
the planet Earth.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.960
Kalique shows Jupiter her Lazareth pit, where
she enters the pool and regains her youth

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.420
almost immediately.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.470
She explains that they have the means to revive
the human cells, and express that the most

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.850
valuable commodity is time itself.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:51.650
However, their conversation is cut short when
Caine rushes in to save Jupiter, threatening

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.570
that he's called the law enforcers known as
the Aegis towards their location.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:00.740
Surprisingly, Kalique doesn't stop the hunter,
only wishing Jupiter good fortune in the future.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.800
The two boards the ship of the officers, where
the captain plans to take Jupiter to the planet

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.250
Orous, so that she may claim the title to
the inheritance.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.550
After changing into something more comfortable,
the woman thanks Caine for rescuing her once

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.030
again, and tries seducing the man with her
female assets.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:20.430
Caine tells her that it's a bad idea since
he's more related to dogs than humans, but

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.460
Jupiter becomes more excited as she apparently
has a thing for canines.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.590
Upon realizing that the woman is a furry,
Caine leaves right away, Not wanting to pay

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.810
any child supports in the future.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:35.360
After some time, the group finally arrives
at Humanity's birth place, and sees a massive

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.229
planet that's imbedded in technology.

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:42.220
With the help of an android, Jupiter is able
to claim her title after going through a series

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.220
of ridiculous processes.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.721
Just before they can celebrate, the two are
surrounded by mercenaries sent by Titus, here

00:08:48.721 --> 00:08:50.770
to capture the main character.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.760
Jupiter is brought towards the second brother
of the Abrasax family, and the man assures

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.310
her that he's on her side.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.910
He takes the woman to their storage area and
shows her the countless bottles of human essence,

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.570
each are made from hundreds of people that
are grown by the family.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.810
Jupiter is shocked at this realization and
drops the container, but Titus promises her

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.620
that he feels the same disgust.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.770
He tells her that much like his mother before
she died, he plans to stop the farming of

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:15.900
human beings,

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.940
and wants the woman to be his wife and take
over his properties incase he was killed by

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:20.970
his siblings.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.390
However, the man's true objective is quickly
revealed as he plans to terminate Caine for

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.940
not bringing the woman to him like they planned.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.890
The marriage that Titus proposed was only
to obtain Earth from Jupiter, and he plans

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.350
to kill her right after the ceremony.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:39.360
Caine is furious at this realization, as Titus
plans to send him out into space, but the

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.070
hunter is able take the emergency suits in
the last moment as he flies in to the void.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:48.560
After struggling in zero gravity, Caine manages
to put on one of the suits and save himself

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.830
temporarily as he only has 30 minutes of oxygen.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:56.700
Luckily, the spaceship from Aegis arrives
at the man's location right before he suffocates

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.750
and Caine tells the officers about the plan
of Titus.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.970
He Recruits Stinger and the two plans to crash
the wedding in order to stop Titus from killing

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.960
the woman and stealing the planet from her.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.240
They go inside the battle suits provided by
the Aegis and flies quickly towards their

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.240
enemy.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.320
At the same time, Titus is able to convince
Jupiter to marry him, after gaining her trust

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.950
by giving the woman a pardon for the crimes
that Canine has committed along side his commander.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.810
She wears the wedding gown provided by the
man and walks towards the ceremony, only to

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.900
see a crowd of people cheering in the celebration.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:31.040
Jupiter goes on the platform and levitates
towards the center, but Titus realizes that

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.270
invaders are heading towards their ship and
orders the drones to stop them no matter the

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.270
cost.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.010
A horde of Warhammers are sent towards the
two hunters, but they are able to open a way

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.550
into the massive formation by shooting furiously
at the drones.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.920
The machines are able to cause great difficulty
as they try and block the hunters, but Caine

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.160
is able to breakthrough along side his commander
as they dodge all the enemies.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.570
Before Titus can finish the marriage by printing
the ring onto Jupiter's finger, Caine crashes

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:01.470
into the massive ship and flies towards the
woman, forcing the man to stop the schemes.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.030
Jupiter is shocked at the man's betrayal,
but only leaves the place with Caine without

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.350
killing the schemer.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.120
The woman gives the hunter the pardon that
she took from Titus, and tells him that all

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.730
she wants right now is to go back to her families.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:17.730
However, when they arrive back on Earth, Jupiter
notices that her house has been infiltrated

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.750
and her families no where in sight.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.670
Balem's minions appear from the shadows and
assures that the woman's families are save

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.530
for time being, but threatens to kill them
unless Jupiter hands over Earth to his lord.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.570
With no other choice, the main character agrees
to go to Balem knowing fully that she may

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.850
never return.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:37.980
The Ageis follows Balem's men closely as they
enter the atmosphere of Jupiter,

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.540
but the enemies quickly close down the portal
upon entry and forces their ship to abort,

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.970
as the massive gravity from the planet tries
to rip them apart.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:50.030
Jupiter is brought to a large room where she
finally meets the infamous Balem of the Abrasax

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.030
family.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:55.080
He shows the woman her families who are being
prepared to be extracted, and demands that

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.230
she give him back the planet of Earth.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.080
After seeing her mother about to be killed
like a common animal, Jupiter begs the man

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.970
to let them go and promises to give him the
planet.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.310
Meanwhile, Caine contemplates as he stares
at the massive planet, but after hearing the

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:13.170
encouraging words of his commander, the man
decides to save the woman no matter the cost.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.870
He gets into a combat suit and flies directly
into the eye of the planet, rushing into the

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.600
hurricanes as lightning strikes him repeatedly.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.710
Caine arrives closer and closer towards the
portal, as the atmosphere tears apart his

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.350
vehicle piece by piece.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.420
The man continues to charge forwards and eventually
breaks through the shields and crashes into

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.760
the giant factory.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.370
At the the same, Jupiter has realized that
if she hands over the planet to Balem, she

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.390
not only has doomed everyone on Earth, but
the man will probably never let her family

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.570
go as well.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.730
She decides to make the bold move of sacrificing
herself, so that no one on the planet will

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.200
suffer the same fate.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.779
Their conversation is interrupted, when Balem
notices the gasses leaking into the factory

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:53.940
and orders his man to stop it right away.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.250
A large explosion shakes the ground as Caine
rushes in to kill all the enemies and save

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.600
Jupiter's family.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.500
Balem rushes towards the girl and tries to
kill her, but she retaliates and kicks the

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.970
man right in the family jewels, before being
saved by the hunter.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:11.120
Caine fights furiously with the aliens and
kills them one by one, while Jupiter quickly

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.520
relocates her family away from danger.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.279
The gasses begin to spread through out the
factory as flames consume everything in sight,

00:13:18.279 --> 00:13:21.080
causing the people to evacuate quickly from
the planet.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.090
The Aegis sees this and rushes towards the
portal, trying to save their comrades who

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.279
are trapped inside.

00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:30.290
While trying to save her families, Jupiter
is ambushed by Balem who tries to kill her

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:34.510
out of vengeance, but the two are quickly
taken underground as the floor caves in from

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.670
the explosions.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:40.200
they are dragged into a tunnel as they continue
to fall, but Jupiter is able to catch herself

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.860
and escape from the enemy.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:46.240
Meanwhile, Caine manages to make contact with
the Aegis and brings all the humans on board

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.230
away from the exploding planet,

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:52.100
and tells the officers to wait for him as
he goes to rescue the main character.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.960
On the other side, Balem appears behind Jupiter
before she can escape and strikes her down,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.430
trying to kill the woman as he forces her
towards the edge of the building.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:04.750
He confesses that he was the one responsible
for killing his own mother, and swears that

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.850
he'll do the same to her reincarnation,

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.940
but the villains always talk too much before
killing their prey, giving the woman a chance

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.050
to retaliate and regain the advantage.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:17.740
The buildings around them starts falling apart,
and the two begin sliding towards the cliff,

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.520
throwing Balem into the air as he scream hopelessly.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.430
Soon, Jupiter is thrown off the platform as
well, but unlike the villain, her friend catch

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.760
her just in time and prevents her from being
killed.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.380
They rush towards the Aegis as the the facility
is covered in flames, and the giant spaceship

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.750
is forced to begin opening the wormhole to
escape this area.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:39.670
Caine continues to fly towards the ship while
carrying his friend, and a bright light appears

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:43.560
as everything is teleported away right into
the airspace of Earth.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.090
Luckily, the two made it just in time as they
drift on the outer reaches of the planet,

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.690
overlooking the beautiful marble that contains
billions of lives.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:56.230
Sometimes later, Caine has regained his wings
and embraces Jupiter warmly, before the two

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.250
finally share a passionate kiss.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:02.660
They fly off into the distance as the woman
has given Earth a new purpose and freed her

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.400
people from their terrible fates.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.170
