the news they learn that the dead are coming back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.640

by destroying the brain or removing the head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.320
as they watch the news a zombie walks in and they&nbsp;

david is hesitant shawn eventually convinces them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.760
and they all arm themselves they meet up with&nbsp;
ed and cram themselves in phillips small car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.600
they bicker and argue why they should go to the&nbsp;
winchester as they argue philip wakes up and tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.800
sean being a father has been difficult he says&nbsp;
that they met when sean was already a young man&nbsp;&nbsp;

backyards with david complaining the whole time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.720
they run into a vaughn who also has her&nbsp;
family trying to get to the other side of town&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.920
they exchange pleasantries and head in opposite&nbsp;
directions they get to a fence and sean tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.800
them the winchester is just over they notice&nbsp;

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.880
he finds her and they get attacked by a zombie but&nbsp;
shawn fights and impales it to a tree shawn gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.280
an idea to pretend as zombies to get past the&nbsp;
huge crowd of undead in front of the winchester&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.200
the act works until they reach the winchester's&nbsp;
locked doors but adds phone rings ed talks loudly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.800
and gets the zombie's attention sean is furious&nbsp;
and tells that he's been a screw-up he says he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.640
spent his whole life sticking his neck out&nbsp;
for ed and ed always messes everything up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.000
they stop and see all of the undead are staring&nbsp;
at them david takes a trash can and breaks a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.640
window for everyone to get in sean tries to&nbsp;
get the undead horde's attention and leads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.920
them away while everyone else gets into the pub&nbsp;
barbara finds the flower sean had thrown away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.600
earlier saying she thinks it's for her inside the&nbsp;
winchester david wants to take charge as he argues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.720
that shawn's plan has been a complete bust david&nbsp;
is clearly somewhat jealous of sean and expresses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.160
his anger telling liz sean can't be dependent on&nbsp;
sean pops back in getting in through the back door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.520
sean tries to flip the fuses so they could watch&nbsp;
tv but sees that the mob of zombies has followed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.480
him and are waiting by the back door ed turns on a&nbsp;
game and makes a lot of loud noises which attract&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.520
the undead on the streets the dead come up to the&nbsp;
windows and the group tries to devise a plan to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.880
deal with them a zombified bartender shows up from&nbsp;
nowhere and then the jukebox starts playing music&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.040
ed shawn and liz fight the bartender until ed gets&nbsp;
the bartender shotgun and shawn uses it to bash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.480
the bartender's head liz discovers that barbara&nbsp;
has been bitten and her condition has worsened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.240
barbara slowly turns into a zombie and&nbsp;
shawn cries and begs her to stay alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.960
shawn holds barbara in his arms as she&nbsp;
starts convulsing and stops breathing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.480
david appears with a shotgun and aims it at&nbsp;
barbara sean and david argue sean brings up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.520
that all of david's pent-up anger is because of&nbsp;
david's suppressed feelings for liz sean says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.320
he's always known that david is in love with liz&nbsp;
and that david believes sean doesn't deserve her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.800
diane confirms this too and tells him she's known&nbsp;
about it for a long time telling everyone she and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.360
david only got together when liz rejected&nbsp;
him they continue arguing and liz tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.480
calm everyone down but barbara gets back up sean&nbsp;
takes the shotgun and shoots his mom in the head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.880
david succumbs to his temper and opts&nbsp;
to get out and head to the streets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:10.480
saying he'll have better chances diane gets angry&nbsp;
with david and calls him out for his behavior&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.840
she shouts at david and it seems like david gets&nbsp;
some sense knocked back into him david is about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.800
to apologize when the horde of undead breaks in&nbsp;
and takes him diane goes after david and gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:27.680
eaten too ed liz and sean remain and get cornered&nbsp;
at the bar ed gets bitten trying to fend off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.720
attack and they find the cellar doors and hide&nbsp;
underground with nowhere else to go they decide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.600
to use the remaining shells to kill themselves&nbsp;
shawn and liz are sharing a cigarette when sean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.960
sees a switch for the cellar door that leads to&nbsp;
the streets their escape sean tries to take ed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.600
but he tells them he wants to stay he's bleeding&nbsp;
out too much and thinks he'll start turning soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.360
sean apologizes to ed for shouting at him earlier&nbsp;
and calling him a screw-up but ed laughs it off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.440
as the zombies break through the cellar door&nbsp;
shawn and liz make it up the streets but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.720
military arrives with yvonne and start shooting&nbsp;
the zombies six months pass and the zombie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.600
apocalypse is being handled it's still unclear&nbsp;
as to what caused the outbreak but the zombies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.240
have been discovered to still retain their primal&nbsp;
instincts making them ideal for medial repetitive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.600
tasks zombies have been accepted into the world&nbsp;
as some are used for fun tv show games and a woman&nbsp;&nbsp;
