00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.990
Welcome to Movie Shortens, follow us to a
movie titled: Beneath!

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.820
Beware, there are spoilers!

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.639
The movie starts in murky lake waters as we
see the silhouette of someone swimming.

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.889
Panning up from under the surface, we see
a girl treading water.

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.340
A moment later, a fin cuts through the water
and Johnny is awoken from his dream.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.410
Johnny gets out of bed and begins packing
as he has plans to go on a trip with a friend.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.260
He and his friends Kitty, Deb, Zeek, Matt,
and Simon all ride up to the lake.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.990
Kitty and Matt start making out, as Simon
who is driving looks over at this act.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.489
His focus is quite intent and this causes
him to nearly hit another car.

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.190
He apologizes and they soon arrive.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.399
Johnny unlocks the gate and the group venture
on.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.620
Finally arriving at the lake, the group discover
a boat.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.110
After a bit of struggle, they carry it to
the lake.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.150
Kitty walks away, with Johnny trailing behind
her.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.830
He offers her a necklace telling her to wear
it as it will keep her safe.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.579
She accepts and heads back towards the group.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.740
Johnny grabs his backpack and is greeted by
his grandpa’s friend, Mr. Parks.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.600
He asks what he is up to, and Johnny tells
him that they are enjoying the culmination

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.310
of graduating.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.250
Johnny plans to head across the lake with
his friends but Mr. Parks exclaims that it’s

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.250
a bad idea.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.750
He says they need to be respectful of the
lake.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.080
The group board the boat and start rowing
across the lake.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.280
As his friends paddle, Johnny gazes at the
water, watching the paddles as they go in

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.170
and out of the water.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.600
Matt stops rowing the boat and suggests they
jump in the lake.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.850
Johnny protests, but his friends ignore his
remark.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.010
Matt, Deb, and Kitty jump into the lake.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.590
Simon then lights a firecracker, Johnny protests
yet again, telling him to stop.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.580
When Johnny reaches for a beer, he pulls out
a necklace stringed with teeth and places

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.100
it around his neck.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.530
At this moment, something bumps the boat,
it begins to shake and everyone begins freaking

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.530
out.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.659
It turns out that it is just Matt rocking
it back and forth, who then gets something

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.869
to drink, and goes back to swimming.

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.490
Deb and Kitty are wading in the water, reminiscing
about the past few years, and how high school

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.079
is now over.

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.940
At this time, Matt surfaces, and begins wading
with them.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.610
Something bumps the boat again, and the 3
on the boat call out to the others telling

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.200
them to come back.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.200
Johnny looks over the side of the boat and
sees a large catfish heading towards the others

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.700
still in the water.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.560
He however says nothing about the impending
danger.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.400
The 3 of them are oblivious as to what is
coming, but it brushes past them and they

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.900
finally agree to swim back to the boat.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.330
While swimming, Kitty turns around and sees
something approaching.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.959
All three are able to make it back safely.

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.010
Matt and Simon begin freaking out and decide
to stab the water repeatedly using the paddles.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.660
Simon’s paddle then gets caught on something
causing him to lose the paddle.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.370
Deb reaches out attempting to grab the paddle,
and just then the catfish lunges and attempts

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.370
to bite her.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.099
Deb sits down but realizes that the fish has
bitten her puncturing an artery.

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.240
She is bleeding profusely, and asks for a
rope to help stop the loss of blood.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.990
Deb exclaims that they need to get the paddle
so that they can get to the shore quicker.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.470
Matt makes an attempt but unfortunately, the
catfish is waiting for him.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.790
It bites through the paddle, narrowly missing
Matt's hand.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.970
Zeke attempts to tell everyone that Deb has
died but the rest of the group are preoccupied.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.519
The group begin paddling back to shore with
only one paddle.

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.210
As the group wonder what they will tell Deb’s
mom, the catfish returns and nudges the boat.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.160
Simon hits it with the paddle.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.030
The catfish breaks the paddle causing it to
split, so Simon uses this to his advantage

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.690
and stabs the catfish, risking the chance
of being pulled into the water.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.909
The group are then able to pull Simon back
into the boat, but the catfish continues swimming

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.830
into the boat, causing a puncture.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.150
Matt then notices Johnny being quiet, so he
asks why the freak out about jumping into

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.310
the water.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.630
He then asks if he knew about the catfish,
but Johnny declares that he didn’t.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.690
Simon grabs Johnny by the shirt, pushing his
head over the boat and begins telling him

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.800
that he is lying.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.769
Eventually Johnny confesses to knowing about
the catfish, though he claims that he didn’t

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.909
believe in the stories he had heard.

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.260
Kitty then mentions the necklace he gave her
to keep her safe, insinuating he is lying.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.989
Everyone is angry as he allowed them to come
to such a dangerous place.

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.269
Zeke then thinks over the situation, coming
up with a plan to use Deb’s body as bait.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.469
Though there is hesitation from Kitty, eventually
they agree to push Deb’s body overboard.

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:29.949
This way they can paddle back to shore and
not be the target.

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.629
Kitty prays over Deb, and the boys push her
overboard.

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:38.020
As she floats away, the catfish takes the
body underwater as the group begins paddling

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.039
away.

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.580
It doesn’t take long for the catfish to
finish his meal so Zeke warns them to stop

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.580
paddling.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.590
They then try bailing water from the boat,
and attempt to use the cooler lid as a paddle.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.779
Soon after, the fish resurfaces biting the
lid and swimming away with it.

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:57.439
The group then starts throwing their food
into the water and begin using the cooler

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:58.939
to bail water.

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:03.720
Simon thinks that since they can see the catfish
and the paddle, they are safe to paddle by

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.520
hand, but it suddenly turns around causing
them to stop.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.069
Zeke then says that the only reason they made
it as far as they did was because it was eating

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:13.300
Deb’s body.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.189
He then suggests throwing Johnny overboard
as he is the reason that they’re all here

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:18.649
in the first place.

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:22.020
With time running out, Matt says Johnny should
go over.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.009
Enraged, Johnny then jumps into the water
and begins swimming away.

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.830
The catfish follows his trail and then slips
under the surface.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.680
The group is then confident to resume paddling.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.509
Tension begins to boil over as the fish comes
back yet again.

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.990
They devise a plan to use the fireworks which
will harm the catfish, but it proves ineffective.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.039
Simon suggests they need another distraction.

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.620
As the catfish turns around, Matt agrees,
and so they start focusing on Zeke.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.729
In desperation, Zeke says we should ask Kitty
who she has slept with on the boat.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.499
He denies ever touching her, but tells Matt
to ask his brother.

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:03.180
While Simon denies anything, Zeke says he
has Kitty on record cheating on Matt.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.589
Simon then punches Zeke in the face, and throw
him overboard.

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:09.919
As he tries to hang on, they kick at his hands.

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.520
Not long after the catfish comes and tears
Zeke apart.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.149
First biting his arm.

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:18.819
We then see that Johnny has made it to shore,
and he’s fairly near to a motorboat.

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:23.879
Back on the boat, Matt questions his brother
if he has been cheating, and Simon says no.

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:27.699
Matt then starts pondering he and Zeke’s
friendship, and how he might have been able

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:30.280
to make something out of his life.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.580
Matt spurred to action starts throwing anything
unnecessary overboard.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.439
He reaches into Johnny's bag finding a condom
and a hatchet.

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:43.800
Simon then grabs the cooler to use as a paddle,
but the fish soon takes that away as well.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.470
The catfish then comes back attacking the
boat.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.599
Kitty has had it so she grabs the hatchet
and begins striking the fish.

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:52.659
Soon they hear the sound of a motorboat.

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:55.699
They see Johnny in the boat and start to feel
relieved.

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:00.580
As he arrives, they ask him how he will save
them, Johnny responds saying he will tow them

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.580
back.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.139
They ask why they can’t join him in the
speedboat, and he says he’s worried he’ll

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:06.520
be thrown off again.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.809
Johnny hesitates, but then throws a rope over
to them.

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:13.669
They tie their end to the boat, and Johnny
begins attempting to tow them.

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:17.770
The catfish returns, ramming Johnny’s boat,
causing it to spin.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.849
The rope then starts wrapping around Johnny’s
neck.

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:24.129
Kitty grabs the hatchet but Simon warns her
not to.

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:28.860
Even though she had the ability to save Johnny,
she allowed him to choke to death.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.330
Matt and Simon then pull the boat, thinking
they are saved, but the catfish inevitably

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.750
knocks them over.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.659
Simon and Matt try to flip the boat back over
but the rope is too close to the propeller.

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:43.089
It slices the rope and also breaks in the
process.

00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:48.020
They then wait for the catfish to eat Johnny’s
body, but are shocked as doesn’t seem interested,

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.279
swimming away.

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:53.489
Simon then attempts to make new paddles, using
the hatchet to break up the wooden seats on

00:07:53.489 --> 00:07:55.249
the boat.

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:59.580
Between paddling, Matt asks what really happened
with Simon and Kitty.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:04.449
They deny everything, but Matt protests saying
he won’t paddle untill he receives an answer.

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:06.469
Simon suggests another vote.

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:10.429
Kitty then says that anything that has happened
doesn’t matter.

00:08:10.429 --> 00:08:14.800
She finally admits to her infidelity promising
that she will never do it again.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.409
Simon and Matt begin fighting over Kitty.

00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:21.659
Simon points towards Kitty saying that she
came to Simon thinking he was her ticket to

00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:22.989
a better life.

00:08:22.989 --> 00:08:25.509
The brothers then vote Kitty off the boat.

00:08:25.509 --> 00:08:30.539
Before going, she tells Matt that whenever
they were intimate, she was thinking of Simon.

00:08:30.539 --> 00:08:32.190
Matt throws her overboard.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.630
Kitty tries to get back on board, but Simon
stops her.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.800
She then slips beneath the waves.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.349
Simon starts provoking Matt, and they get
into a small scuffle.

00:08:41.349 --> 00:08:46.990
Simon diffuses the fight, and apologizes,
then tries to hit Matt using the hatchet.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:51.670
Matt dodges his attempt and is then able to
use the hatchet hitting Simon’s head.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.940
Simon is then knocked off the boat.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.750
Matt swims out to Simon attempting to save
him.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.870
Simon then sees the catfish, and pushes Matt
into the catfish saving himself.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:06.720
Kitty, still alive and floating on the overturned
boat, reaches over grabbing Johnny’s necklace.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.620
Not long after the catfish comes and eats
Johnny.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.790
She realizes that the necklace can protect
her, so she jumps into the water and swims

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.290
back to shore.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.890
When she arrives, she is greeted by Simon.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:23.750
Simon is upset that Kitty has chosen Matt
over him, but then embraces her with a kiss.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:28.829
This then leads to him choking her, pushing
her head under water and drowning her.

00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:32.120
After she dies, he tells her that she will
never leave the lake.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:36.120
A second later, lights shine on him as he
is holding Kitty’s body.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.360
He drops her body and is then confronted by
Mr. Parks.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.100
He asks about Johnny, to which Simon says
there was an accident.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.970
Mr. Parks then says he was a kind boy, and
that he and his granfather were good friends

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.820
of his for many years.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.259
Simon then tries to lie about his actions
and the deaths.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:58.310
Mr. Parks shows Simon the video camera that
Zeke had, revealing he knows what Simon has

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.310
done.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.730
Mr. Parks then pulls out a gun telling Simon
to try his luck with the lake.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.490
Simon begs to be spared, but Mr. Parks opens
fire.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.889
The first shot misses, but the second hits
his Simon’s leg.

00:10:10.889 --> 00:10:15.019
The catfish then comes dragging Simon to his
death.
