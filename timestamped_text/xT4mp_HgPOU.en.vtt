00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.560
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going&nbsp;
to explain a science fiction horror film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:15.920
called “Splice,” Spoilers ahead!&nbsp;
Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.440
Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast are a genetic&nbsp;
engineer couple working for a company named&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.240
Nucleic Exchange Research and Development (NERD).&nbsp;
Their primary job at the company is to conduct&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.080
research on splicing several animals' DNA to&nbsp;
create hybrid creatures with unique qualities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.280
The company’s aim is to use the unique compounds&nbsp;
found in the hybrid’s body to create medicines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.400
that can treat most of the diseases in the world.&nbsp;
At the beginning of the movie, we see Clive and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.240
Elsa bring out a successful hybrid male creature.&nbsp;
They name the creature Fred and put him with their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.560
previous successful female creature named Ginger.&nbsp;
Everyone watches in fascination as Fred and Ginger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.280
meet for the first time and create a ball-like&nbsp;
shape with their tongues to greet each other. 
&nbsp;

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.920
Later, Clive and Elsa are in a meeting with the&nbsp;
CEO of the company, Joan Chorot. Joan is delighted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.480
with the result of their experiment and wants to&nbsp;
start extracting genetic materials that will help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.000
them create medicines immediately. The couple&nbsp;
puts forward an idea of forming a human hybrid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.880
since that will give them many more varieties of&nbsp;
compounds to choose from. Using such compounds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.960
diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and even&nbsp;
some forms of cancer can be treated. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.680
Joan wants to focus on the existing hybrids&nbsp;
at the moment. Elsa insists that if they don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.360
do it first, someone else will. But the CEO is&nbsp;
adamant about her decision. The couple comes out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.800
of the meeting disheartened and angry, however,&nbsp;
they do not plan to back down. Since the company&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.840
won’t allow them to conduct the experiment,&nbsp;
they decide to do it on their own. At the lab,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.880
Elsa gets human DNA from a random donor and&nbsp;
the two start to experiment splicing it with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.920
animals’ DNA as they did with Fred and Ginger.
When they fail to match the DNA for the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.680
couple of tries, Elsa suggests they bring out&nbsp;
another person’s DNA and continue the experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.960
She hands Clive a sample, claiming that it is the&nbsp;
best human DNA she could find. The two finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.000
get the temperature right and the splicing is&nbsp;
successful. Now, they will have to incubate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.440
cell and allow it to develop into a fetus. But,&nbsp;
since human cloning is illegal and is considered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.120
highly unethical in genetic engineering, Clive&nbsp;
wants to stop the experiment. Elsa, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.400
insists they continue, just to see if the&nbsp;
splicing was actually successful. She insists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.600
that the experiment will be controlled so it&nbsp;
wouldn’t matter even if they fail. Clive obliges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.360
and puts the cells in an incubator. The couple&nbsp;
watches as the cells begin to multiply rapidly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.840
The following morning, Elsa checks how much&nbsp;
the creature has developed and is surprised&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.720
to see it developing at an exponential rate.&nbsp;
Later, the couple is at their home when they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.120
get an emergency message from the lab. They&nbsp;
rush there to see the fetus has developed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.720
fully, way earlier than its due date. 
The two break the incubator and a slimy creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.760
falls to the ground. They leave after putting&nbsp;
the creature in a safe place. The next morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.800
Clive tells Elsa that they have to kill the fetus&nbsp;
because it can be dangerous. Elsa doesn’t want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.040
kill it just yet but knows that they will be&nbsp;
in huge trouble if anyone finds out about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.080
creature. The couple goes to the lab, only to&nbsp;
find the creature is already dead. When Elsa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.400
opens the cell, she sees it is just the outer&nbsp;
skin of the creature, meaning that the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.720
is alive and is somewhere near her. Just then, it&nbsp;
screeches from the ceiling. Clive, from outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.200
asks Elsa to get out so they can fill the room&nbsp;
with poisonous gas and kill the creature. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.160
Elsa does the opposite and opens out her hand&nbsp;
to the newborn, calling it near her. Just then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.880
Clive comes in, scaring the creature. The couple&nbsp;
comes out of the room and knocks the creature out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.320
using a gas. After examining it, they find out&nbsp;
that she is a female and is growing rapidly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.480
At this rate, she will be dead in months, so&nbsp;
they plan to make the best of the time she has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.360
and observe her instead of killing her. 
The x-rays show a tumor inside her body which the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.040
couple is confused about. The creature also has a&nbsp;
sharp venomous tail that she uses for her defense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.000
It is now a week after the creature was born.&nbsp;
Clive tries to feed her but she doesn’t cooperate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.080
The couple soon figures out that she only likes&nbsp;
sweet food which makes it easier for them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.960
feed her. Elsa starts treating the little girl as&nbsp;
her own child. She dresses her up and teaches the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.000
creature to spell her name. The little creature&nbsp;
spells the word “NERD” copying the words on Elsa’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.840
shirt. Elsa is surprised by her intelligence&nbsp;
and names the girl Dren, an anagram of Nerd.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.960
Just then, Clive arrives and accuses Elsa of&nbsp;
treating Dren like a pet. They begin to argue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.920
loudly which is heard by Clive’s brother, Gavin&nbsp;
who also works at NERD. He sneaks into their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.360
lab and is attacked by Dren. Elsa scolds the&nbsp;
girl and asks her to go away. Clive tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.000
explain the situation to Gavin, who is pissed&nbsp;
off about them doing an illegal experiment. 
&nbsp;

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.480
The couple knows that they cannot keep Dren in the&nbsp;
lab anymore, so they bring her to the basement of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.680
the facility. When they reach there, the creature&nbsp;
gets a fever and stops breathing. Clive puts her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.040
into a cold bath and the couple realize that&nbsp;
Dren’s tumor was actually an amphibian lung,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.000
so she can breathe underwater as well. The time&nbsp;
comes when the couple has to present Ginger and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.320
Fred to the media at a conference. They present&nbsp;
the creatures together but the conference soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.200
turns into chaos when the creatures begin to&nbsp;
fight each other creating a bloodbath. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.640
Clive and Elsa brief what went wrong to the CEO&nbsp;
Joan. It turns out that Ginger has somehow changed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.760
her sex and turned into a male. So, the tension&nbsp;
between the two males caused them to fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.320
The couple had been so busy with Dren that they&nbsp;
didn’t even notice when Ginger changed her gender.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.120
Due to all of this, Joan orders them to stop all&nbsp;
the splicing processes and somehow synthesize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.080
the protein they need at any cost. The whole&nbsp;
facility will be taken over in a few days so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.000
Dren has to be taken somewhere safe. 
The couple plan to take her to Elsa’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.160
mother’s old farmhouse in the middle of&nbsp;
nowhere. That way, Dren can be safe and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.920
can have more freedom. A few months later,&nbsp;
she has turned into an adult now. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.680
Elsa and Clive bring Dren to the barn but she runs&nbsp;
away scared. The duo finds her devouring a rabbit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.920
nearby and takes her inside. Elsa scolds a visibly&nbsp;
sad Dren, making her jump into a water tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.560
Clive believes she needs to be alone for a while&nbsp;
so they two work on cleaning the place for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.000
At night, Dren refuses to eat and makes the&nbsp;
words “Tedious” and “Outside” with the alphabets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.400
claiming that she is bored and wants to go&nbsp;
outside. When Elsa says she cannot do that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.880
Dren gets aggressive and runs outside through&nbsp;
the skylight window. The couple climbs up to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.440
the roof to see that she has grown wings&nbsp;
and is about to fly away. Clive calls her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.800
back claiming that he loves her. Hearing this,&nbsp;
Dren hugs him and agrees to go inside again. 
&nbsp;

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.800
The next day, Elsa and Dren are together when&nbsp;
Elsa finds pictures of Clive that Dren has drawn.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.640
She is starting to harbor feelings for him. Just&nbsp;
then, Dren finds a cat and plays with it but Elsa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.440
takes it from her, fearing that she will kill&nbsp;
it as well. Clive comes home to a sad Dren and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.200
dances with her to make her happy. While dancing&nbsp;
he suddenly realizes that Elsa used her own DNA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.760
to create Dren. Clive angrily confronts Elsa&nbsp;
for putting herself into the experiment. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.800
Elsa dismisses the matter, claiming that they have&nbsp;
come too far to talk about that now. The next day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.920
Elsa brings a cat to Dren as a gift, thinking&nbsp;
that she should get a chance to have more friends,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.880
but to her surprise, Dren kills the cat&nbsp;
with her tail and attacks Elsa as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.840
A surprised Elsa lies on the ground as Dren takes&nbsp;
the keys from her and opens the door. But before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.520
she can run away, Elsa knocks her out and ties&nbsp;
her to a table. Fed up with Dren, she has decided&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.320
to cut her tail so she wouldn’t be dangerous to&nbsp;
anyone anymore. Clive walks in to find a naked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:42.000
Dren lying tied on the table and her tail cut&nbsp;
off. He feels bad for the girl and frees her. 
&nbsp;

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.480
Later, he is monitoring Dren through cameras&nbsp;
fitted in her room. He lovingly touches her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.480
through the screen but stops once he&nbsp;
realizes what he is doing. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.760
Elsa is in the lab and has successfully managed to&nbsp;
create the protein using venom from Dren’s tail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.000
She rushes to the farmhouse to tell Clive&nbsp;
the good news. Clive, on the other hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.760
walks into Dren’s room and is greeted by Dren who&nbsp;
kisses him. He tries to retaliate but eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.360
gives in and has intercourse with the creature.&nbsp;
Elsa walks into the room and is horrified at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.640
sight. She runs away angrily while Clive follows&nbsp;
her behind, apologizing. Later, after having a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.520
long conversation, they finally decide to kill&nbsp;
Dren and get rid of the problem once and for all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.480
But when they return back to the farm, they find&nbsp;
her already on the verge of death. Because of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.840
being a rapidly developing creature, her lifetime&nbsp;
has ended. The couple stays beside her as she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:37.840
takes her last breath. Elsa cries, mourning the&nbsp;
death of her daughter-like creature. Heartbroken,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.920
the two bury the body outside. Just then, Clive’s&nbsp;
brother Gavin arrives with an official from NERD.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.720
They have found human DNA in the protein&nbsp;
samples and are here to see the creature.
&nbsp;

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:54.320
Elsa tells them she is dead but a loud screech&nbsp;
is heard right then. It turns out that Dren&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:00.000
wasn’t dead after all. She has changed into a&nbsp;
male like Ginger did and has turned aggressive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.680
The male Dren kills Gavin and his friend within&nbsp;
seconds. It drags Clive into a pond and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.720
chases after Elsa. Soon, Elsa is caught&nbsp;
by the male Dren who uses his regenerated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.840
sharp tail to tear off her clothes and starts&nbsp;
forcefully mating with her. Sometime later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.720
Clive comes to her aid and stabs Dren with a&nbsp;
log. It does the creature little to no harm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:26.320
as he regenerates quickly. Dren is about to kill&nbsp;
Clive when Elsa bashes his head with a rock.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:32.160
She does it repeatedly but stops midway pitying&nbsp;
the creature. However, Dren takes the chance to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.760
strike Clive with his tail and kill him. Seeing&nbsp;
him kill her boyfriend, Elsa strikes the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:46.000
several times and finally kills him. 
It is now a few months after the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.040
Elsa sits with Joan who offers her a deal. It&nbsp;
turns out that Elsa was impregnated by Dren&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:56.160
and is bearing his child. Jude wants to use the&nbsp;
miracle kid to create medicines for the betterment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.920
of mankind. Elsa accepts the deal saying that&nbsp;
she has nothing to lose. The movie proves how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.120
dangerous it is to play with nature. Scientific&nbsp;
inventions and advancements should be done for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.600
mankind’s benefit but humans shouldn’t try to&nbsp;
change the course of nature along the way.
