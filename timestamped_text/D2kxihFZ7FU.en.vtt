00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.800
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain a horror film called "Southbound."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.440
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.600
Best friends Mitch and Jack are driving on&nbsp;
a nameless highway in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.920
Both of them appear to be bloody and in a state of&nbsp;
panic. Along the way, Mitch looks at a photograph&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.120
of his daughter, Katherine, before gazing at a&nbsp;
floating creature from afar. Although the sight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.360
of the evil-looking creature creeps Mitch out,&nbsp;
he does not tell Jack about it. Not long after,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.360
they pull up to a nearby gas station where&nbsp;
Sutter works as a cashier. Upon entering,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.280
she gives the men an intimidating look&nbsp;
while they take refuge in the small space.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.040
Jack freshens up in the bathroom as his&nbsp;
body is covered in scars and deep wounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.040
He fails to notice the skeletal creature from&nbsp;
behind him, allowing it to grab him from behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.200
Mitch patiently waits for his friend in the dining&nbsp;
area while Sutter keeps her eyes fixed on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.360
Suddenly, an earthquake takes place, but everyone&nbsp;
else inside the station does not notice it at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.920
When he looks out the window, the mysterious&nbsp;
creature still waits for them outside.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.480
Jack survives the attack and rushes outside with&nbsp;
his friend. In a taunting manner, Sutter says,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.080
"come again" as they leave. Both of them head&nbsp;
out of the station and back to the road to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.960
far away as possible. Weirdly, they pull up&nbsp;
to the same gas station once again. They seem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.720
to be going in circles multiple times as&nbsp;
they repeatedly wind back to the station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.080
Another problem arises because more skeletal&nbsp;
creatures are appearing along the road.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.040
Mitch loses his patience and gets out of the&nbsp;
car, completely hopeless about their situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.800
Determined to escape, Jack follows Mitch and&nbsp;
reminds him of the purpose of their journey, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.280
is to save Katherine. After their argument, Jack&nbsp;
decides to go back to the car just as the skeletal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.520
creature looks at the both of them. When he gets&nbsp;
inside, it quickly flies to the car and drags&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.840
him outside. In seconds, the creature kills Jack&nbsp;
through his mouth and leaves as soon as he dies.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.320
Before taking the last look at his friend, Mitch&nbsp;
follows the creature, believing that it is his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.080
fate. The creature leads him to a nearby motel&nbsp;
and into room 6-2-2-5. Upon entering, Mitch sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.840
traces of blood on the wall, but the sight of it&nbsp;
does not hinder him from exploring its contents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.920
Mitch feels a sense of confusion as to the&nbsp;
interior looks too familiar and close to home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.160
He examines the other corners of the room&nbsp;
and hears a little girl call out, "dad."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.400
An apparition of Katherine appears from behind but&nbsp;
runs as soon as Mitch tries to reunite with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.800
He chases her around the house, but to no avail.&nbsp;
Katherine keeps begging Mitch to help her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.840
but her screams become muffled. The&nbsp;
whole situation puts Mitch in torment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.160
trapped in the hallways of the&nbsp;
house, which seem to be endless.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.840
In the room, next door, Sadie, Ava, and Kim,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.560
who belong to a band called The White&nbsp;
Tights, prepare for their next gig.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.480
During their road trip, they stop at famous&nbsp;
landmarks to take pictures and have fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.360
Out of nowhere, a tire goes flat, forcing them&nbsp;
to pull over on the highway. They try to contact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.360
friends for some help, but none of them are&nbsp;
available at the moment. Even their phone G.P.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.600
could not detect their location, putting them&nbsp;
in a much more helpless state. Despite this, Kim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.800
remains in a good mood and says that they should&nbsp;
share a drink instead while waiting for help.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.320
After hours of being stranded,&nbsp;
a car eventually passes by.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.760
Inside are a friendly couple, Dale and Betty,&nbsp;
who offers them a ride. Sadie politely declines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.840
and informs the couple that they are used to&nbsp;
sleeping in their van. However, Dale and Betty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.400
are insistent on letting them ride by offering&nbsp;
multiple solutions. Despite their friendly facade,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.880
the girls sense a different vibe and decide to&nbsp;
stay. As the couple drives off, Kim has a change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.560
of heart and calls on Dale and Betty, claiming&nbsp;
that they are their best chance of getting help.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.560
Along the way, the unlikely friend group gets&nbsp;
to know each other. While in the backseat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.960
Sadie spots a bear trap and asks Betty about it.&nbsp;
According to Dale, they keep it there for coyotes.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.760
Finally, they arrive at the couple's home, and&nbsp;
the girls are welcomed into the humble abode.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.200
Betty even leads them to a pleasant room where&nbsp;
they could stay for as long as they want.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.720
Before Betty leaves them to stay cozy, Sadie&nbsp;
hears her mention their late friend Alex,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.240
which she finds odd. Contrary to it, neither&nbsp;
Kim nor Ava seems to notice what the woman said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.080
as they look around the room. Sadie raises&nbsp;
her concerns about staying in the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.840
but the two persuade her to relax and have fun.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.520
Later that night, the Kensingtons: Raymond,&nbsp;
Bunny, and their twin sons come over for dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.600
Before their meal, they hold hands in prayer, but&nbsp;
when Ava says "Amen," the family looks at her in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.360
disgust. They are served burnt roast beef on the&nbsp;
table, but Sadie, a vegetarian, politely declines.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.640
She even finds it weird that Kim and Ava&nbsp;
seem to enjoy their time with the strangers.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.360
After dinner, Ava prepares for a nice warm bath&nbsp;
when a mysterious shadow passes behind her in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.000
the window. However, she does not notice it at&nbsp;
all. Sadie finds a pocket knife inside a drawer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
in the room, but she tucks it in any way. She&nbsp;
expresses her thoughts on being uncomfortable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.080
in the home and that they should be on the road&nbsp;
to make it on time to their gig. Not long after,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.240
Kim starts to blame Sadie for Alex's death,&nbsp;
saying that it was her fault. As she explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.840
how she did not leave Alex on the night of her&nbsp;
death, Kim begins to vomit a black substance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.160
and so does Ava. Shocked by the sight of it, she&nbsp;
runs to the living room to ask for help, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.800
families are untroubled by it. As she grins, Bunny&nbsp;
tells them that the first time is the worst time.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.280
Dale finally gets up to pour a glass of white&nbsp;
liquid medicine, which he lets Ava and Kim drink.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.680
The two girls drink the liquid in sync. Both&nbsp;
act weirder as time passes, refusing to leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.240
the house and the overly friendly couple. Despite&nbsp;
Sadie's pleas, they remain unbothered, causing her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.040
to storm to the bathroom. Inside, she browses old&nbsp;
pictures of the band and cries over Alex's death.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.000
Moments after, she returns to the room where she&nbsp;
sees the twins standing still from the window.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.160
Sadie immediately closes the window and guards&nbsp;
herself with the pocket knife she found earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.240
She sits by the bed and eventually falls asleep.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.280
Sadie dreams about Alex asking her why she left&nbsp;
her before getting killed in a car accident. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.760
Sadie wakes up, Ava and Kim are gone. She peeks at&nbsp;
the window and sees her friends following the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.120
families around a bonfire as they participate in&nbsp;
a cult ritual. While chanting, Betty, Dale, Bunny,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.280
and Raymond cut themselves, and use their blood&nbsp;
to draw a symbol on the girls' forehead. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.440
a triangular symbol is drawn on them, Ava and&nbsp;
Kim's eyes subtly transform, just like the others.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.680
While watching the ritual from a nearby bush,&nbsp;
Sadie's foot gets caught in the bear trap from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.600
earlier, causing her to let out a faint scream.&nbsp;
The noise grabs everyone's attention, and her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.240
friends walk toward her. Ava and Kim creepily&nbsp;
crawl in her direction, but Sadie manages to stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.960
them from getting any closer. She unclamps herself&nbsp;
from the trap and takes refuge in a small shed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.720
Not long after, Alex’s ghost emerges&nbsp;
from the dark to scare Sadie off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.920
Out of fear, she runs back to the highway&nbsp;
in hopes that help will eventually come.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.840
Meanwhile, a man named Lucas drives along the&nbsp;
highway while talking to his wife, Claire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.440
on the phone. He keeps looking at pictures of&nbsp;
Claire, causing a great distraction on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.040
Because of this, Lucas accidentally runs Sadie&nbsp;
over in the middle of the pitch-black road.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.000
Still in a state of shock, he decides to come&nbsp;
down and sees Sadie still clinging to dear life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.960
Lucas calls 9-1-1 to ask for help&nbsp;
with Sadie's critical injuries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.480
but he is unable to tell the dispatcher&nbsp;
where he is. Even his phone could not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.400
detect the location using the G-P-S, so the&nbsp;
dispatcher connects him to Emergency Medical.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.880
In a matter of seconds, a certified&nbsp;
E-M-T gets on the line to help Lucas out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.120
The E-M-T demands him to describe Sadie's&nbsp;
state right now and drive her to a nearby town.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.640
He abides by her orders and gets back&nbsp;
on the road. After the long stretch of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.760
the nameless highway, he arrives at a&nbsp;
local hospital in the heart of town.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.120
Lucas carries Sadie's body inside the&nbsp;
facility and realizes that the hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.880
is completely abandoned. He continues to&nbsp;
communicate with the E-M-T on the phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.680
who is utterly useless at the moment. Lucas checks&nbsp;
the rooms for any signs of help but to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.520
After several empty rooms, he finally arrives&nbsp;
at a surgery room where he could lay her down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.680
Suddenly, Sadie's right knee ruptures&nbsp;
and falls apart from her upper leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.840
Without knowing what to do, Lucas listens to&nbsp;
the E-M-T instructing him to intubate Sadie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.800
At this point, Sadie keeps twitching&nbsp;
as her body loses more blood.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.960
Upon finding the intubating kit, he&nbsp;
inserts the tube through her bloody mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.280
struggling to find the right position. Out of&nbsp;
nowhere, a third voice replaces that of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.280
E-M-T's and claims that he is a professional&nbsp;
surgeon. The voice makes Lucas reach into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.600
poor girl's body to manually compress her lungs&nbsp;
and keep her breathing. Afterward, the voice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.760
instructs him to make an incision just below her&nbsp;
ribcage, which he follows out of desperation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.360
Lucas reaches her lungs from the incision and&nbsp;
compresses them, which kills Sadie instantly.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.920
Through his earphones, Lucas hears the&nbsp;
voices laugh at him, and he hangs up quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.320
He leaves the operating room but realizes that he&nbsp;
is trapped as all doors are now locked. Realizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.160
that he has been tricked into killing Sadie, he&nbsp;
sits in the hallway of the abandoned building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.320
Upon returning to retrieve his phone, Claire&nbsp;
calls him, and to his surprise, it is not her who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.480
answers. The dispatchers from earlier persuade&nbsp;
him to talk about the accident, but he says he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.320
does not deserve it. Surprisingly, they agree&nbsp;
and tell him that he can leave the hospital.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.960
Moreover, they provide Lucas with access to&nbsp;
new clothes and even a new car, so it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.040
appear as though nothing happened. He hesitantly&nbsp;
leaves, but the dispatchers assure him that he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.360
nothing to worry about. Lucas drives away after&nbsp;
hanging up the phone, and a woman named Sandy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.240
who is actually the E-M-T, does the same.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.280
After saying goodbye to Lucas on the phone,&nbsp;
Sandy walks to a nearby bar named Trap. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:28.560
old and rundown bar is occupied by bar patrons&nbsp;
including Warren, and the bartender, Al. As Sandy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.800
orders a drink, Al reprimands her for leaving&nbsp;
the door open, causing an argument to ensue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.080
Warren backs Al up just as Danny barges&nbsp;
inside with a shotgun, looking for his sister,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.120
Jesse. He holds Warren at gunpoint upon&nbsp;
showing Jesse's picture to him but is useless.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.240
While Danny questions Al about his tattoo, Warren&nbsp;
appears to be a demon and transforms his hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.440
He strikes Danny from behind,&nbsp;
causing a big wound on his back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.840
However, Danny manages to knock Warren down and&nbsp;
blows off his demonic hand. For the last time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.360
Danny asks the patrons if they know&nbsp;
Jesse's whereabouts, and Al says yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.800
This prompts Danny to take him hostage and make&nbsp;
him drive through the long stretch of highway.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.680
Both of them arrive at the backdoor of an ice&nbsp;
cream parlor, where Al claims Jesse is located.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.280
They enter through the secret doorway and&nbsp;
see multiple men in a queue. Al then leads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.480
Danny to a room where he sees Jesse&nbsp;
applying a tattoo on a patron's back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.800
The siblings reunite and hold each other for the&nbsp;
first time in thirteen years. While they embrace,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.720
Al hits Danny on the knee, causing him to&nbsp;
fall to the ground. The injured Danny begs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.200
Jesse to come home with him, but she refuses to.&nbsp;
According to her, she is in that place by choice.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.320
In a fit of rage, Danny shoots Al, making him&nbsp;
shriek in a demonic manner before Danny finishes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.720
him off. He kidnaps his sister and drives in the&nbsp;
pitch-black road while the locals, who are all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.200
demons, chase them. Jesse begs his big brother&nbsp;
not to go off-road, but he pays her no mind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.600
determined to be out of the place. The car shakes&nbsp;
violently for some time before Danny decides to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.760
stop for a moment. Jesse reveals that she deserves&nbsp;
to live in the horrible town after killing their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.480
parents. Her words leave Danny speechless, and&nbsp;
demons drag him out of the car not long after.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.640
Without any intentions to help, Jesse leaves him&nbsp;
behind and drives back to the ice cream parlor.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.880
Jesse sees a rather friendly girl named&nbsp;
Jem, who just got out of the bathroom by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.720
the secret entrance. Jesse shoos her away,&nbsp;
and Jem meets back with her parents Cait&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.120
and Daryl. Jem has a few days left before she&nbsp;
embarks on her college life, hence the road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.240
trip to their vacation house. From afar, someone&nbsp;
watches them get into their car and drive off. 
 &nbsp;

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.680
The family eventually arrives at the&nbsp;
place and sees a pleasant living space.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.360
While Jem unpacks her stuff, Cait and&nbsp;
Daryl prepare dinner in the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.280
She overhears her parents talk about her going&nbsp;
to college and if she really is ready. They hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.520
knocks on the door and other corners of the house&nbsp;
out of nowhere, but no one seems to be there. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.440
three of them start to feel unsafe and uneasy,&nbsp;
so Daryl instructs his wife to call the cops.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.240
As he peeks outside, he sees a masked man&nbsp;
standing still just outside their place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.240
When Daryl checks again, the man appears&nbsp;
closer, causing him to be more frightened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.320
The man repeatedly knocks more aggressively,&nbsp;
so they decide to find an alternative exit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.440
They pass through a glass door, but they&nbsp;
go back in when two men block their escape.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.320
Inside, the lights go off, and the shadows&nbsp;
of the intruders are seen by the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.840
As they break in, Daryl, Cait,&nbsp;
and Jem separate unintentionally.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.360
Cait and Daryl hide behind a table, but they&nbsp;
get caught and knocked out by the masked men.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.200
On the other hand, Jem safely hides&nbsp;
inside a closet and stays unnoticed.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.320
Back in the living area, the men confront Daryl,&nbsp;
making him realize that he actually knows them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.240
One of them whispers to Cait what her husband&nbsp;
did, and she is astonished at Daryl's secret.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.960
He repeatedly says sorry to Cait, who is now being&nbsp;
gagged mercilessly. Cait is sadly killed in front&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.840
of Daryl; as he grieves, the car's lights and horn&nbsp;
turned on, grabbing their attention. One of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.480
goes out to check but sees no one inside the car.&nbsp;
As he walks back to the house, Jem stabs him from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.560
behind before taking the bat he holds. The two&nbsp;
men confront her outside and order her to leave at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.520
that instant. Jem drives off on her own while the&nbsp;
men stab Daryl to death. In his dying breath, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.440
force him to look at Katherine's photograph and&nbsp;
unmask themselves—appearing to be Mitch and Jack.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.640
Upon leaving the house, Jem hits them with a bat,&nbsp;
fighting back for what they did to her parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.360
Jack chases her inside the house, but she manages&nbsp;
to stab him with a wine opener. She gets a glimpse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.840
of her parents' corpses before she escapes, but&nbsp;
Mitch kills her in the process. For a moment, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.960
commotion subsides—but not for long. A tentacled&nbsp;
creature comes out of Jem's body and her parents'.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.560
As they try to flee, the third man gets&nbsp;
dragged by a creature from beneath the ground.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.160
Mitch and Jack become slightly relieved after&nbsp;
narrowly escaping death, but the creatures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.120
continue to chase and attack them. One even blocks&nbsp;
their way, but Jack accelerates and runs it over.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.960
After, both of them agree to go back home&nbsp;
as they drive through the nameless highway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.880
With his bloody hands, Mitch clings to&nbsp;
Katherine's photograph, immensely missing her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.640
Mitch notices the creatures along the way out in&nbsp;
the middle of nowhere, but he does not tell Jack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.880
Once again, they end up at the same gas&nbsp;
station, where Sutter expects their arrival.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.480
The story interconnects the lives of the&nbsp;
characters who drive on the same highway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.400
in the middle of nowhere. Each of them harbors&nbsp;
dark secrets that they seem to run away from,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.480
causing their eternal suffering. Everything&nbsp;
is a never-ending cycle of the worst day of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.560
the characters' lives—just as how hell is&nbsp;
depicted. Their sufferings are consequences&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.640
of actions they have done in their past life. The&nbsp;
title Southbound parallels the direction of hell,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.480
which is down. No matter which route the&nbsp;
characters take, all roads lead south.
