00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.600
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain a drama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.240
sci-fi, thriller film called “Synchronic.”&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.960
A young couple lays in bed at a hotel, preparing&nbsp;
to take a designer drug called Synchronic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.120
expecting to have some fun. They take the pill&nbsp;
and wait several minutes. The man then heads to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.600
the lobby taking an elevator. The woman remains&nbsp;
in bed and waits for the drug to take effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.840
Not long later, the woman starts seeing shrubs&nbsp;
and plants in the room. The man notices the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.080
elevator malfunctioning and sees the elevator&nbsp;
walls disintegrating. In front of him, a desert&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.640
wasteland appears. The woman experiences the same,&nbsp;
with the walls around her slowly fading away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.800
and a strange tribal-looking man appears through&nbsp;
the wall. The elevator floor disappears, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.960
the man finds himself falling onto the sand. The&nbsp;
woman also finds herself in the middle of a dense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.280
jungle, and the strange man moves closer. She&nbsp;
sees a snake coming toward her, and she screams.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.400
Steve and Dennis are longtime best friends working&nbsp;
as emergency medical response personnel in New&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.600
Orleans. They respond to a drug overdose. They&nbsp;
locate the house and find two people on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.360
Dennis tends to the bleeding man, seeing he’s&nbsp;
still alive and applying the necessary medical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.240
procedure. Steve tends to the overdose victim and&nbsp;
gets pricked by a syringe. He injects the girl,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.920
and she springs awake. Dennis finds that the&nbsp;
man had been penetrated through to the back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.920
discovering a bleeding exit wound. The police&nbsp;
arrive and find a wrapper for Synchronic and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.280
conclude that the situation is simply a&nbsp;
result of addicts attacking each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.720
Steve sees a copper coin on the floor&nbsp;
and picks it up. Steve and Dennis take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.840
the bleeding man to the ambulance, and the&nbsp;
officers find a bloody sword stuck to a wall.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.600
Later, Steve and Dennis take&nbsp;
a break, and Steve plays golf.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.160
Steve examines the coin he found and sees a date&nbsp;
stamped on it, seventeen twenty-one. Steve later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.160
has himself checked for HIV, fearing that&nbsp;
the needle prick may have contaminated him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.760
The physician recommends that Steve goes through&nbsp;
a complete medical checkup, and he considers it.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.760
The following day, Steve is with Dennis&nbsp;
at a family picnic celebrating Dennis's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.000
daughter's birthday. Steve sees&nbsp;
Brianna, Dennis' eldest daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.120
alone, sitting on a small boulder,&nbsp;
and decides to approach her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.040
Dennis says Brianna had always connected with&nbsp;
Steve as she sees Steve as the cool uncle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.720
Brianna tries to tell Steve about how she feels,&nbsp;
but she gets cut off by Steve's phone call.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.720
At work, Dennis and Steve make their way&nbsp;
to another tragic scene where somebody had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.400
burned to death. Officers inform the pair&nbsp;
that they're unsure how the victim died,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.360
seeing no other signs of fire&nbsp;
nearby. They do, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.480
find an empty Synchronic wrapper as well as&nbsp;
an out-of-place doorknob that has melted.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.480
Steve later gets a brain scan at the&nbsp;
hospital and discovers he has a tumor.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.480
Dennis and Steve then respond to the earlier&nbsp;
couple who had taken the Synchronic at a hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.240
The woman who has a snake bite on her knee is in&nbsp;
a state of shock, only muttering her boyfriend’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.160
name. They find another Synchronic packet at&nbsp;
the scene, and the animal control personnel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.760
tells them they’ve searched for the snake but&nbsp;
came up empty-handed. He also tells them that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.280
he recognizes the snake bite, which could have&nbsp;
only come from a snake that had not been seen in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.520
the area for decades. Steve then sees a bag from&nbsp;
a vape shop where the victim got the Synchronic.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.000
The hotel caretaker tells them he heard a loud&nbsp;
bang from the elevator shaft, and Dennis goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.080
look. He opens the elevator doors and finds the&nbsp;
woman's boyfriend at the bottom of the shaft,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.200
dead, his face filled with euphoria.&nbsp;
On their way to the hospital,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.520
Dennis notices Steve taking&nbsp;
painkillers more frequently.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.760
At the hospital, a doctor tells Steve&nbsp;
that the tumor is cancerous, aggressive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.920
and affects his pineal gland. The doctor tells&nbsp;
Steve he may have as little as six weeks left to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.800
live or as much as several decades. It all depends&nbsp;
on how he'll react to the medication and therapy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.280
Later, Steve considers telling&nbsp;
Dennis the news but holds off.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.760
Dennis plays basketball with Brianna, trying&nbsp;
to connect with her. He’s worried that he may&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.040
have gone a little distant as a father and&nbsp;
is concerned about Brianna’s well-being.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.400
Brianna tells Dennis that she’s not going&nbsp;
through something terrible. She’s just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.240
worried that she still doesn’t know what to do&nbsp;
with her life. She’ll soon be going to college,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.120
and she’s not sure whether or not the path&nbsp;
she’s taking is the right one for her.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.000
Dennis hands Steve a birthday present at a bar,&nbsp;
a nifty desk lamp with a science theme to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.600
Dennis then opens up about doubts he has&nbsp;
about his marriage. He's still unsure if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.760
being a family man is what he wants. He looks at&nbsp;
Steve's lifestyle and can't help but feel jealous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.080
of the bachelor's life. Dennis finally confronts&nbsp;
Steve about all the painkillers he's been taking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.840
concerned that Steve may develop a morphine&nbsp;
addiction. Steve doesn't tell Dennis that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.960
painkillers are for his chemotherapy and&nbsp;
promises that he'll take care of himself.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.120
The next day, the pair arrives at a house party&nbsp;
where they're responding to a call about an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.520
overdose. They find one teenager lifeless on&nbsp;
the floor and another speaking incoherently.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.120
They ask her if there are others, and she&nbsp;
says a girl named Brianna was with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.280
Dennis is terrified hearing his daughter's name.&nbsp;
He immediately calls his wife, and she tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.360
that Brianna isn't at home. He finally confirms&nbsp;
that it is his daughter who has gone missing.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.840
Now that someone close to him&nbsp;
has fallen victim to Synchronic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.920
Steve decides to visit the vape shop that sells&nbsp;
Synchronic and buys all the remaining packets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.280
A man sees Steve buying out the Synchronic&nbsp;
and later follows him to his car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.920
The man approaches Steve and offers&nbsp;
to buy the Synchronic from him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.680
even paying much more than the store’s price.&nbsp;
Steve tells the man off and drives away.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.440
At Dennis’ house, he and his wife are&nbsp;
busy contacting the authorities and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.280
printing out flyers for Brianna. His wife is&nbsp;
distraught, thinking they aren’t doing enough.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.480
That night, Steve is lying&nbsp;
in bed with his dog Hawking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.680
when he hears a noise coming from the living&nbsp;
room. He takes a bat and goes to investigate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.440
He opens the closet and finds the man from&nbsp;
the vape shop. Steve threatens to beat him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.840
but the man pleads and tells Steve he made&nbsp;
Synchronic. He introduces himself as Dr. Kermani,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.880
a chemist, and has been trying to buy back&nbsp;
the Synchronic sold all over the country. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.560
explains that he makes synthetic drugs, changing&nbsp;
the molecular structure of legal medications&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.160
and turning them into something that mimics&nbsp;
illegal drugs. Synchronic was supposed to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.840
a simple hallucinogenic, but he accidentally made&nbsp;
a drug that allows people to travel through time.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.120
Synchronic distorts the fabric of spacetime,&nbsp;
allowing people to crossover to different periods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.600
Synchronic has the most significant impact on a&nbsp;
person’s pineal gland. He explains adults with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.520
developed pineal gland can only appear as shadows&nbsp;
or ghosts in the past, but younger people who have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.120
an underdeveloped pineal gland can travel entirely&nbsp;
and can even get stuck in a different time.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.120
Kermani spent his time tracking down all&nbsp;
the Synchronic to destroy them, and the vape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.200
shop was his final stop. Steve tells him that he&nbsp;
flushed the Synchronic down the toilet and orders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.760
Kermani to leave. Kermani agrees, believing&nbsp;
all Synchronic had been eliminated. But it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.120
revealed that Steve didn’t flush the Synchronic&nbsp;
down the toilet but only threw them in the trash.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.560
The following day, Steve is at his chemotherapy&nbsp;
session. Once he finishes, he immediately feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.760
the side effects and starts vomiting randomly. At&nbsp;
work, Steve is exhausted all the time. Dennis gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.760
a call from the hospital, informing him there’s&nbsp;
a missing supply of morphine. He immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.080
suspects Steve, not knowing about his chemotherapy&nbsp;
and seeing Steve taking more painkillers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.840
They soon get another call about a man&nbsp;
with a broken leg and head to the location.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.360
They find the victim but are unable to&nbsp;
communicate because he spoke a different language.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.720
They start treating the man, and Dennis&nbsp;
begins giving Steve instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.560
Steve is annoyed, saying he knows how to do&nbsp;
his job, but Dennis answers back he doesn’t,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.400
implying Steve came to work drunk on morphine.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.120
As they head out, they get into an argument.&nbsp;
Dennis calls Steve a manchild, and Steve calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.800
out Dennis for constantly complaining about his&nbsp;
life even if there’s nothing to complain about.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.480
They start throwing fists at each other,&nbsp;
but the ambulance driver breaks them apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.160
Steve leaves, heading back home alone.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.120
That night, Steve examines the coin he got from&nbsp;
the crime scene and considers trying Synchronic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.680
A few minutes pass, and bright lights fill his&nbsp;
living room. He turns and sees a swampland slowly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.400
appearing around him, his living room walls slowly&nbsp;
disappearing. His living room disappears entirely,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.720
and he’s left in a swamp. He looks around,&nbsp;
smelling and touching everything, in disbelief&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.280
of what he’s seeing. A man stalks him from a&nbsp;
distance, muttering a prayer. Steve then sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.360
a crocodile approaching him, and he backs away,&nbsp;
also seeing that he’s starting to disappear.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.880
The stalker is revealed to be a Spanish&nbsp;
Conquistador, and he starts charging at Steve.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.280
Steve is terrified, caught between the&nbsp;
hungry crocodile and a sword-wielding madman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.040
Just as the Spaniard brings his sword down on&nbsp;
him, Steve appears back at his living room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.480
Hawking staring at him in curiosity.&nbsp;
He almost dismisses what happened as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.680
a dream until he sees a slash mark on&nbsp;
the floor from the conquistador’s sword.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.760
Steve decides to document his experience&nbsp;
with a video camera and narrates that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.200
pill allows him to go back in time for&nbsp;
seven minutes. He suspects that the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.720
thing could have happened to Brianna. He&nbsp;
takes another pill and slowly disappears.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.120
He reappears in the middle of a frozen&nbsp;
wasteland and immediately starts freezing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.400
He sees a silhouette approaching&nbsp;
him, but he collapses from the cold.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.440
Seven minutes pass, and he reappears&nbsp;
in his living room, shivering.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.080
He discovers that his destination time period&nbsp;
is dependent on his location in the living room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.520
He tries again, this time wearing&nbsp;
a thick coat and carrying firewood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.160
He arrives at the frozen landscape again, and he&nbsp;
manages to start a fire. A figure approaches him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.560
pointing a spear. The figure comes closer,&nbsp;
and Steve sees he’s a caveman. He touches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.800
the caveman’s spear, and the caveman lowers it.&nbsp;
Steve offers the caveman a seat, and they sit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.880
across from each other. Steve slowly returns&nbsp;
to the present, observing that the caveman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.360
who was probably younger than him, looks decades&nbsp;
older. With his triumphant return to the ice age,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.400
Steve confirms that wherever he stands&nbsp;
determines what period he arrives in.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.480
The following morning, Dennis and his wife&nbsp;
are having more trouble with their marriage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.120
Brianna’s disappearance creating a&nbsp;
heavy burden on their relationship.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.560
Steve hears from the radio that&nbsp;
doctor Kermani had committed suicide.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.440
That night, Steve thinks about the copper coin,&nbsp;
the sword, and the doorknob, the three things that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.440
the paramedics found with the victims. He tries&nbsp;
to experiment, aiming to bring Hawking with him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.160
to the past. He plans to take the Synchronic, and&nbsp;
as he starts disappearing, he'll embrace Hawking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.000
He successfully brings Hawking back with&nbsp;
him. Unfortunately, they arrive at a period&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.600
where most of the population still has a&nbsp;
high level of discrimination towards race.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.440
They pop up in a house where a man chases&nbsp;
them away. Steve and Hawking escape but see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.040
that everyone in the town looks at them in&nbsp;
the same way. Seven minutes pass and Steve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.720
doesn't disappear. He decides to return to&nbsp;
the house where he and Hawking appeared in.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.960
Steve takes another pill, and they sneak&nbsp;
back in, but the man discovers them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.280
The man calls to his friends, and they appear in&nbsp;
white drapes. Chaos ensues in the living room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.440
and Steve gets separated from Hawking. Before&nbsp;
the men could shoot Steve, he reappears in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.200
living room without Hawking. He hears Hawking&nbsp;
whimpering and runs to the window to see Hawking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.600
slowly fading away. Steve then makes two&nbsp;
more discoveries. First, if seven minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.120
go by and you are not at the place where you first&nbsp;
appeared, you'll be stuck at the time you went to.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.360
Second, you should hug tightly whatever you bring&nbsp;
with you, whether to the past or the present,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.320
seeing that he only brought back&nbsp;
Hawking's leash. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.280
he can no longer retrieve Hawking as he&nbsp;
has too few pills to make the journey.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.080
Steve then decides to head back to the university&nbsp;
dorm, where they discovered Brianna missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.600
One of the teenagers earlier said they saw&nbsp;
Brianna sitting at a spot before disappearing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.120
and Steve tries to travel at the exact&nbsp;
location. He ends up in the middle of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.720
forest where several men conduct a ritual and&nbsp;
mistake him for a spirit they've summoned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.520
They swarm him, and Steve makes a run&nbsp;
back to the tree where he came from.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.760
Fortunately, he was able to grab hold of a lawn&nbsp;
chair and got transported back to the present.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.720
The teenager who told him about Brianna reappears&nbsp;
and clarifies that Brianna had wandered off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.880
She didn’t actually disappear&nbsp;
from that specific spot.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.440
Steve later meets with Dennis at a bar and&nbsp;
the two talk. Dennis informs Steve that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.120
might be getting a divorce. He feels guilty&nbsp;
about not fulfilling the promise he made to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.960
his wife on their wedding day. She's loved&nbsp;
him unconditionally, and he feels guilty,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.800
feeling like he hasn't been returning the love.&nbsp;
He says that Brianna was the only one keeping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.320
their marriage afloat, and now that she's gone,&nbsp;
he feels that nothing is holding them together.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.560
Steve then reveals that he'd exchange his bachelor&nbsp;
life with Dennis's stable married life in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.440
heartbeat. Dennis is surprised, seeing that he&nbsp;
envies Steve's lifestyle. Steve then reveals the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.640
truth about his brain tumor. Dennis is dumbfounded&nbsp;
and in complete shock upon hearing the news. Steve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.880
tries to calm Dennis down by telling him he's been&nbsp;
doing chemotherapy. The two reconcile, with Dennis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.320
revealing that it was actually their ambulance&nbsp;
driver who had been stealing the morphine.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.560
At a cemetery, Steve shows Dennis video footage&nbsp;
of the evidence of Synchronic's effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.640
Dennis is in more fear than shock, knowing that&nbsp;
Brianna had been plunged back into the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.800
Dennis then realizes that Brianna may have left&nbsp;
a message for them to decipher in the present.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.560
Steve remembers a small boulder at a local&nbsp;
park where Brianna had been sitting earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.320
On the stone written is the word, "Always."

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.120
Steve decides that could have possibly been where&nbsp;
Brianna was when she got transported. With only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.880
two pills left, Steve takes the Synchronic and&nbsp;
gets transported to the time of the American&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.760
Civil War. The sound of bombs and gunshots fills&nbsp;
the air, and Steve runs to a bunker. In it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.920
he finds a mound of a dead soldier as he keeps&nbsp;
calling out to Brianna. He crawls through piles of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.240
dead bodies until he finally hears Brianna calling&nbsp;
to him. Brianna is glad to see her uncle Steve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.880
coming to the rescue. Steve hands Brianna the last&nbsp;
pill, and she swallows it. Steve explains that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.160
they have to reach the boulder in seven minutes&nbsp;
or else they'd be stuck in the past forever.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.200
They make a break for the boulder, but Steve had&nbsp;
been shot, and Brianna helps him across. A random&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.600
soldier appears, holding them at bay and calling&nbsp;
Steve a slave. Steve's seven minutes run out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.080
and he's stuck in his current time. He's now only&nbsp;
focused on getting Brianna back to the present.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.400
Steve sees a mine in front of the soldier, and he&nbsp;
tries baiting him to get him to step on the mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.800
Unfortunately, the soldier steps over it and&nbsp;
prepares to shoot Steve. Brianna disappears,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.200
and a massive explosion rocks Steve and the&nbsp;
soldier. The soldier loses balance and steps on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.360
the landmine, exploding him to pieces. Steve&nbsp;
rises to his feet and sits on the boulder.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.920
In the present time, Brianna reappears,&nbsp;
and Dennis hugs her. They then see Steve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.960
appearing ghostly on the boulder before&nbsp;
fading into nothing, stuck in the past.
