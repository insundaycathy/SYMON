00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.989
Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here.

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.080
Before we start, WARNING!

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.110
Spoilers Ahead!

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.329
Today, I’m going to recap a 2021 Korean
Survival Drama series, called Squid Game.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.870
This series tells the story of poor people
who play childhood games to win prize money,

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.579
with their lives at stake.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.140
In the games, some rules are set to treat
the players fairly.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.320
The entire series will be divided into three
parts that you can find in this channel.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.420
So, what are the games?

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.720
What is the purpose behind the game’s creation?

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.100
Let’s find it out.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.799
At the start of the series, we are introduced
to our main protagonist, Seong.

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.150
He is a jobless widower who lives in his Mother’s
house.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.850
His Wife has married a wealthier man, and
has taken custody of their only Daughter.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.570
He tries to make a fortune out of his Mother’s
money that he stole, in a horse race gambling.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.390
Luckily, he wins the gamble and makes quite
a fortune out of it.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.780
However, after exiting the building, he is
chased by debt collectors.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.500
While running away, he bumps into a girl.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.260
After an effortful attempt, he is still cornered
by the collectors.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.870
He tries to pay a portion of his debt with
the fortune he just made.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.750
But when he checks his pocket, the money’s
gone.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.780
Turns out, the girl that he bumped into is
a Thief.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.000
The collectors force Seong to sign a contract
to pay his debts with his organs next month,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.920
if he still doesn’t have the money.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.770
He is frustrated that on his Daughter’s
birthday, he cannot treat her to delicious

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.800
food and a memorable gift.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.049
He sees himself as a failure both in fathering
and in being a part of the society.

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.460
When in despair, a mysterious man visits him
and asks him to play a game.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.830
If Seong wins, he will be rewarded 100 thousand
Korean won.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.090
If he loses, the man will slap him in the
face.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.580
After a lot of rounds and a lot of slaps,
Seong finally can bring a lot of money home.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.810
Before separating, the man gives Seong a mysterious
contact card and invites him to join more

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.129
similar games where he can win a much bigger
prize.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.349
Seong calls the phone number and is invited
into the game.

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.290
He is picked up by a masked driver, at the
agreed time and place.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.709
During the transport, the participants are
drugged to keep the game’s secrecy.

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.010
When Seong wakes up, he finds himself laying
on a bed with other 455 participants in the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.520
room, and all of his belongings gone.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.290
The game is coordinated by the Front Man who
manages his many masked men subordinates.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.319
In the game, Seong meets with other participants.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.440
Few of them are Cho, Seong’s childhood friend,
an ailing Old Man, an illegal citizen named

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.980
Ali, the Thief who stole Seong’s money,
a Mafia boss, and a talkative Woman.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.870
Realizing that the Thief is among the participants,
Seong is enraged and tries to confront her.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.870
But his attempt is thwarted by the Mafia who
have another problem with the Thief.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.520
Suddenly, the masked men come in to start
the first game.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.340
One of them explains that there will be 6
games and 3 general rules.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.000
The rules are participants cannot quit during
mid-game, participants who try to quit mid-game

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.050
will be eliminated, and the game will be stopped
with the consent of the majority of players.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.180
After agreeing to the terms, the players are
led to another room to start the first game.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.890
The first game is called Red Light Green Light.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.599
In this game, the players have to reach the
finish line within a specific duration.

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.599
They can move however they like when the robot
says Green Light, but have to stop when the

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.450
robot says Red Light.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.019
If they are found out moving during the Red
Light, they will be eliminated.

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.680
Even though the rules are simple, they are
surprised to know that elimination means to

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.180
be shot to death.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.470
A lot of rifles come out of the wall to shoot
the players who move during Red Light.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.220
The Old Man is the first to realize the rules
and continues the game during the shock.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.030
With the Old Man’s lead, the other players
follow.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.069
Cho reminds Seong of the time limit and advises
him to hide behind someone’s back.

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.630
Many of the players have reached the finish
line within the time limit.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.830
Seong tries to catch up but slips and almost
fails.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.860
Fortunately, he is saved by Ali and can finish
the game together.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.659
The rest of the players who have run out of
time are also eliminated.

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:22.319
201 players survive the first game and beg
to leave due to their fright.

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:26.060
Before voting to leave the game, the masked
men show them the prize pool.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.770
100 million won will be added per 1 elimination.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.249
If they decide to quit the game, the surviving
players will receive no reward.

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:39.340
With the current prize pool of 25.5 billion
won in mind, the players cast their vote and

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.569
agree to quit the game with 1 point difference.

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.419
After the vote, the players are sent back
to their residence.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.169
In the morning, Seong reports the homicidal
game to the police.

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.900
However, the police don’t trust him due
to lack of evidence.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.009
After a while, a Policeman comes to report
another case and sees Seong’s contact card.

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:03.189
The Policeman realizes that the contact card
is the same as his brother’s who has been

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:04.189
missing.

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:08.240
Dedicated to looking for his brother, the
Policeman tracks Seong down.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.849
Meanwhile, when Seong comes home, he cannot
find his Mother.

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:15.490
Turns out, his Mother is in the hospital due
to her diabetes.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.190
Doctor recommends she stay and be monitored.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.789
His Mother rejects the offer and tries to
leave the hospital since they have no money

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.500
to pay for the treatment.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.629
Desperate with the condition, Seong decides
to join the game once more.

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.939
The other players are also reminded by their
debtful hellish life and agree to play again.

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:37.460
This time, the players know about the procedures
and are more prepared for the next challenges.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.529
The Policeman secretly follows Seong to the
game arena to find his brother.

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:44.960
He disguises himself as masked man number
29.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.059
Out of the 201 surviving players, 187 came
back to win the prize.

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:53.939
In the night, Thief tries to peek at the second
game with the help of Woman.

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:56.779
She finds out that the masked men are cooking
sugar.

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:59.559
In the morning, they are led to the second
game’s arena.

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:03.879
Cho asks Thief about what she has found last
night, but they are still clueless about the

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:06.139
next game.

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.649
After entering the arena, they are faced with
4 doors with their respective shapes.

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:16.909
Seong, Cho, Ali, and Old Man form a team and
agree to take each of the four shapes.

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:21.060
With Thief’s information and the four shapes
in front of him, Cho is reminded of his childhood

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.369
game where he had to cut out the shapes out
of a candy plate.

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:28.189
He takes the easiest shape which is the triangle
without telling his teammates.

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:33.849
Meanwhile, Ali gets the circle, Old Man gets
the star, and Seong gets the hardest shape,

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:35.249
the umbrella.

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:38.629
Clueless about the game, Thief follows Cho
to take the triangle shape.

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:40.639
Then, the game begins.

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.800
The players start to scrape their candy using
needles within the time limit.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.849
If the shape is broken during the attempt,
they will be shot by the masked men.

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:53.809
Woman heats her needle by using a contraband
lighter to liquify the sugar easily.

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:57.969
After completing the game, Woman gives her
lighter to the Mafia in hope of making a pact

00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:59.099
with him.

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:02.409
Some of the players have succeeded due to
their easier shapes.

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:06.550
At the last few minutes, Seong gets the idea
to lick the back of the candy to cut out his

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.089
umbrella shape.

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:12.449
Inspired by the action, other players follow
him and make it through the game.

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:15.979
When the time’s up, some of the players
don’t succeed in cutting their shape and

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:18.009
are killed by the masked men.

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:22.149
At the end of the game, One of the losing
players holds a masked man hostage and asks

00:07:22.149 --> 00:07:23.819
him to remove his mask.

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:28.130
However, the Front Man kills both of them
because of the game’s agreement.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.800
It is agreed that players mustn't know the
masked men's identity to keep the game’s

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.060
secrecy.
