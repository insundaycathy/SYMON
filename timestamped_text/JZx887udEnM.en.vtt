00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:02.999
Game of Thrones is about to reach its epic conclusion

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.419
but if you're not one of those people who spent the better part of the last decade

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.030
Constantly rewatching the series for clues. You need a last-second reminder to catch you up or you know

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.609
Nothing, including what that references is. It's time to cram all of Game of Thrones into one handy video

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.519
Well, not all all sorry Mirri Maz Duur fans and hot pie enthusiasts some stuff had to get cut away

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.990
And yes, this is a long video

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.500
But hey

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.500
We're about to cram 7 season

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.000
67 episodes and a mythology denser than the hardback version of a Storm of Swords into less than an hour.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I have memorized every damn city, town, lake, forest and mountain

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.780
cause a break

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.239
Before we dive into all the quote-unquote present-day action, let's do a little bit of Game of Thrones

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.949
101 the entire show is largely set on a continent named Westeros

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.869
Which is divided into several parts collectively referred to as the Seven Kingdoms the weather strange in Westeros summers last months or even years

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:05.909
But are followed by harsh winters which bring darkness and misery. At the northern edge of Westeros is the wall a giant well.. wall

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.479
built to keep out all manner of supernatural creatures

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.750
primarily the thought to be extinct White Walkers who can reanimate corpses to become undead White's

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.009
Also living north of the wall are a group of uncivilized folk called

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.769
Wildlings down south is King's Landing

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:30.239
Seat of power for the Seven Kingdoms and home to the royal family of Westeros. For centuries a family called the Targaryen rule the land

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.720
Largely because they were able to conquer the kingdoms and keep power

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.500
using

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.480
dragons, kind of like How to Train Your Dragon

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.400
But the realistic version of what people would do with destructive fire lizards. Over the years though

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.300
The Dragons slowly disappeared and so did the Targaryen power the last Targaryen ruler was Ares

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.940
Second also known as the mad king, who over the course of his reign lost his mind and became a

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.140
Radical tyrant who liked to burn people alive. The Targaryen dynasty came crashing down when Rhaegar Targaryen

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.570
Eris's son kidnapped a woman named Leon a stark of Winterfell

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.530
sistered Eddard Stark and betrothed of Robert Baratheon

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.409
Robert declared war on the Targaryen and killed Rhaegar in battle Liyana also died during the conflict

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.480
robert's rebellion ended with Mad King Aerys dead at the hand of Jaime Lannister his own Kingsguard and

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.380
Robert on the throne as king of Westeros. The remaining Targaryens were hunted down and killed save for viserys and danerys

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.600
Two of Eris's children who fled east across the sea Robert was power married to Cersei Lannister

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.298
daughter of the richest family in Westeros and

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:44.349
Eddard returned home to Winterfell to rule as warden of the north and things are relatively quiet, which is where the show Game of Thrones

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.900
really begins

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.799
Ok enough backstory. What? The series kicks off north of the wall were three members of the Nights Watch

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.880
sworn protectors of Westeros from everything beyond the wall have a run-in with a supernatural white Walker

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.900
A bit further south in Winterfell we meet the rest of the stark family

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.860
Eddard Ned Stark who we know his wife Catelyn and their five children

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.540
Robb

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.620
flexiblelom

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.739
Sansa Arya, bran and Rickon. There's also Ned's bastard, son

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.108
Jon Snow not to stop an Theon Greyjoy the eldest living son of Lord

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.749
Balin Greyjoy of the Iron Islands Theon was taken as a hostage during his father's failed uprising

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.809
Against Westeros and has been raised by Ned as his ward. Each of the stark children also have their own pets

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.440
abnormally large

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.039
wolves called dire wolves Ned's mentor

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.459
Jon Arryn known as the hand of the king pretty much royal chief of staff has died under semi questionable circumstances

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.090
King Robert decides the job should be Ned Stark's and he travels to Winterfell along with his wife Cersei Lannister

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:57.219
Circe's brother Jaime Lannister the Kingslayer and their brother the hard-drinking

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.090
prostitute loving dwarf Tyrion Lannister to make the arrangements

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.489
Once in Winterfell Robert convinces Ned to take the gig by promising to marry his son Joffrey

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:12.819
Next in line to the throne to Ned's daughter Sansa also loyalty Brotherhood blah blah blah anyway

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.799
Unfortunately young bran stark who loves climbing Winterfell Towers spots

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.608
Jaime and Cersei doing a little bit of incest. Bran is troubled

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.249
But he's even more troubled when Jaime pushes him off the tower to keep their secret; "The things I do for love"

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.739
Paralyzing him. Ned, Arya and Sansa head south to King's Landing, while John heads north to join the Nights Watch

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.500
John quickly proves himself a strong fighter and befriends the heavyset and cowardly Samwell Tarly, "I`m a coward"

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.880
Lord Commander of the Nights Watch Junior Mormont takes a shine to Jon and make some his personal steward

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.890
Along with giving of his family's heirloom sword made of highly prized and rare

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.860
Valyrian steel back at Winterfell recovering brand Stark is attacked by a stranger armed with a dagger

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.300
Catelyn comes to believe the Lannisters are involved and heads to King's Landing to tell Ned

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.720
"I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters, in my bones I know it"

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.559
Ned's already got his hands full dealing with a difficult King and the other members of King Robert's small Council they include

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:25.059
Petyr Baelish aka Littlefinger the master of coin. "I have hoped to meet you for some time, lord Stark". The long-serving grand maester Pycelle

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:27.560
"How many years has it been?"

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.520
Robert's younger brother Renly Baratheon and Lord Varys a eunuch who runs the Kings spy network

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.399
There are also all sorts of other colorful characters

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:44.559
Including Joffrey's bodyguard the Hound real names Sandor Clegane and his even more ferocious and massive brother named Gregor Clegane

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.370
Aka the mountain they changed actors later. We'll keep you updated

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.609
We also meet sir Loras Tyrell the knight of the flowers who's actually Renly Baratheon secret lover

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.160
Scandal Catelyn arises in the capital where she meets up with her childhood friend Littlefinger

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160
How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.630
He tells her that the dagger she found used to be his I lost this dagger to whom

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:15.369
Tyrion Lannister Ned meanwhile discovers that King Robert has a number of bastard children stashed around the city including

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.970
Gendry a local blacksmith's apprentice. "Find anything?"

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:26.349
"King Roberts bastard son". On her way back to Winterfell from the capital Catelyn runs into Tyrion and has him arrested for what she believes is

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:33.309
the attempted murder of her son. They head to Catelyn sister Lysa Aaron's castle known as the Eyrie and then all

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.880
Seven hells break loose Tyrion demands a trial by combat

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.569
And a wily knight named Bran volunteers to be his champion

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:43.080
"You have that right"

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.620
Bronwen's the fight and they leave. Ned is attacked in the street by Jamie who then flees King's Landing

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.769
While recovering, Ned figures out the secret that Jon Arryn had discovered and that presumably got him killed

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.129
Cercei`s children are not actually Robert Baratheon`s

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:04.460
But were fathered by her brother Jamie. " Joffrey Baratheon." It's the blonde hair

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.999
That's the clue. It sounds like something King

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.710
Robert would be furious about if he weren't mortally wounded during a hunt my fault

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:19.939
He names Ned his regent and protector of the realm before he dies, but Cersei straight-up ignores this and declares that her son

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.059
Joffrey is the new king. I wish to be crowned within the fortnight

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.340
Roberts brother Renly declares himself the king of Westeros. Give me a hundred swords

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:35.569
You'll come on but Ned suggests that Renly's older brother Stannis would rightfully be the next in line Stannis is your older brother

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:40.460
Ned refuses to swear loyalty to Joffrey and is arrested "Your son has no claim to the throne"

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:47.419
Renly and Loras flee the capital and start assembling an army and Cersei in the small council manipulates Sansa into writing to Robb and

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.730
Asking him to bend the knee to Joffrey

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.760
"Little dove, you must write to lady Catelyn

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.920
And your brother the eldest what's his name?"

00:07:54.930 --> 00:08:00.110
Hoping to save his family Ned makes a false confession and says Joffrey is the real true king

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:05.749
"I come before you to confess my treason," but Joffrey has him killed anyway, "bring me his head"

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.279
Arya in disguise heads north to the wall along with Robert's bastard Gendry robb stark

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:17.540
Assembles an army loyal to the Starks from across the north who all agree that they should declare independence from the Lannisters and King's Landing

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.540
Entirely, why shouldn't we rule ourselves again?

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:25.490
They declare Robb the king in the north and begin a war for independence and revenge

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:32.329
Robb proves himself a natural leader winning multiple battles against the Lannisters and capturing Jaime to use as a

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:37.729
hostage in order to win these victories Robb agrees to marry the daughter of a crusty old lord named

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.549
Walder Frey, he has a number he thinks will be

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.859
Suitable in exchange for his armies passage over the bridge that his house controls

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:51.819
remember this Tywin Lannister patriarch of the Lannister family is none too happy with what's going on and

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:58.449
Begrudgingly since Tyrion to King's Landing to serve as hand of the king and get things in order and that's pretty much it for season

00:08:58.449 --> 00:09:02.378
Oh, wait, that's right. There's a whole other continent in this show. Yep

00:09:02.379 --> 00:09:07.089
We're going east to Essos where we meet the two surviving children of the Mad King

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.439
viserys and danerys targaryen

00:09:09.439 --> 00:09:12.699
You can retake what he sees as his family's rightful throne in Westeros

00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:16.899
Viserys has arranged for his sister to marry the horse Lord Aquaman

00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:23.019
Aka called Drogo who commands an army of horse warriors named the Dothraki we go home

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.959
With an army Daenerys is not happy about this but doesn't really get a say in the matter as a wedding gift

00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:35.229
She receives three apparently petrified dragon eggs from the mysterious eastern land of a shine serving istan

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:39.670
Eris's new advisor and protector is Jorah Mormont a soap your father for many years

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:41.649
Got to be good

00:09:41.649 --> 00:09:43.649
I hope to always serve the rightful king

00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:51.729
Jorah is also secretly spying on the Targaryen on behalf of Lord Varys and tips off King Robert that Daenerys is pregnant with a potential

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.970
Targaryen heir

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.439
Viserys is unhappy that Daenerys is the one getting the royal treatment and

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:03.219
Threatens to kill her if Drogo doesn't take his army west now to recapture the Iron Throne. I want the crown

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.399
He promised me so call Drogo kills him with boiling gold

00:10:07.249 --> 00:10:13.239
Daenerys takes it pretty well. He's new trapping Jorah prevents an assassination attempt from Robert on Daenerys

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.779
Which sells Drogo on the idea of invading Westeros?

00:10:16.779 --> 00:10:23.469
But during a fight Drogo is wounded and dies Daenerys and Jorah are abandoned by most of the Dothraki

00:10:23.749 --> 00:10:25.749
Huffing us was the throw

00:10:26.299 --> 00:10:28.989
Was foul and Daenerys loses her, baby

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:34.929
The boy did not have however after walking into Drogo's funeral pyre with the dragon eggs

00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:43.239
Daenerys emerges unharmed with three living baby dragons and that is the end of season one. It gets quicker from here

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.249
We promise I just introduced like 50 people

00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:53.049
Most of the second season is taken up with the war of the five kings in which a bunch of different Westerosi families

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.050
Go to war over control of the Iron Throne

00:10:55.100 --> 00:11:02.500
We can hopefully get through this pretty quickly because as of right now all of these Kings are either definitely dead or very likely dead

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.839
The first King to drop is Renly Baratheon

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.629
Murdered by a shadow demon conjured by his older brother Stannis a grim man

00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:14.889
Who's also very grim Stannis is able to do this with the help of the red woman?

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:21.310
Melisandre a priestess for the Lord of Light a God who gives visions to his followers and fire require

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:28.479
Sacrifices with fire lights the swords of his warriors on fire. He's big into fire. I have seen the pass to victory

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.860
Stannis is right-hand, man. Is Davos Seaworth a former smuggler?

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:39.459
Who's not sure about this whole fire priestess thing Brienne of Tarth Renly's loyal Kingsguard is blamed for his death

00:11:42.709 --> 00:11:48.609
But flees his camp alongside Catelyn Stark who would come to see about a potential Renly Robb alliance

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:55.029
eventually Brienne swears fealty to Catelyn who asked her to take Jaime Lannister back to King's Landing and

00:11:55.399 --> 00:12:00.489
Exchange him for Arya and Sansa killing. Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children

00:12:01.189 --> 00:12:04.479
But returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:11.078
Ridley's now widowed Margaery Tyrell is you know kind of sad but really wants to keep climbing up that social ladder

00:12:11.079 --> 00:12:13.568
Do you want to be a queen? No, I

00:12:14.209 --> 00:12:18.879
Want to be the queen Robb Stark meanwhile falls in love with a nurse named to Lysa?

00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:21.459
Remember that promise to marry one of Walder Frey's daughters

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.579
Yet that's out the window much like bran

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.870
back in King's Landing Tyrion

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:32.199
Finally returns from his travels along with a woman named Shay who long story short is a prostitute

00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:37.719
Tyrion falls in love with whom he also ultimately kills with his bare hands. That is a whole other video

00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:43.688
Anyway as hand of the king Tyrion gets to work and formulates an alliance with the Martell family of Dorne

00:12:43.689 --> 00:12:50.619
I'm brokering an alliance with house Martell of Dorne by sending Circe's daughter Myrcella away to be married to one of their princes

00:12:50.809 --> 00:12:52.120
Tyrion also discovers

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:59.259
There's a stockpile of wildfire which is kind of like magical supercharged napalm in the capital substance

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.059
So hot it melts wood stone even steel

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:08.039
Eventually Stannis and his fleet attack King's Landing come with me and take this city

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.959
And what comes to be known as the Battle of the Blackwater

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.370
Tyrion and bran destroys Stannis's fleet with wildfire

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.659
But the army keeps on coming The Hound frightened of all these flames

00:13:22.029 --> 00:13:25.559
Abandons his position and leaves King's Landing the city

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.969
The king Tyrion and the Lannister soldiers manage to protect the castle

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.349
But not before Tyrion is brutally scarred in the battle

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:39.060
The rest of Stannis's Force is wiped out when Tywin Lannister arrives along with an additional

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:44.579
Army, courtesy of Marjorie's family the powerful House Tyrell. The battle is over

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:52.320
We have won Stannis retreats back to Dragonstone to be grim where Melisandre convinces him to keep fighting

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:55.620
Tyrion is relieved of his power

00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:01.320
You are no longer a hand of the king and the hand of the king position now goes to Tywin himself

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.639
Thank you your grace and by way of saying thanks for the army Margaery

00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:11.219
Tyrell is now betrothed to Joffrey and Sansa is no longer in line to be married to the king

00:14:11.589 --> 00:14:12.089
Okay

00:14:12.089 --> 00:14:18.029
let's head up north to Winterfell where brand has been having strange dreams about a three-eyed raven and

00:14:18.459 --> 00:14:22.229
Seeing through the eyes of his direwolf summer more on that later in

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:29.459
Need of more soldiers Robb Stark dispatches Theon back to the Iron Islands and his home of Pike to get his father Balon

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.240
Greyjoy to join his cause I brought you a proposal from Bob stock

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:40.319
But Balin refuses and once instead to attack the north while the Starks and their allies are focused on fighting the Lannisters

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.329
Theon flips allegiances and leads a band of Raiders from house Greyjoy to take control of Winterfell

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.050
Thank you

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:52.469
Your castle bran and Rickon escape with former wildling OSHA and Starks servant slash chauffeurs slash

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.219
Mononym Hodor and head north to the wall to meet up with Jon Snow

00:14:56.589 --> 00:15:03.749
Roose Bolton of the dreadfort one of Rob's most powerful allies offers to send his bastard son Ramsay to retake Winterfell

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:08.150
Fionna hosts with his cousin Theon's men turn on him

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:14.570
Abandoned Winterfell, which is then burned and gives Theon over to the Bolton army

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:20.509
Even further north several members of the Nights Watch go searching for the missing ranger Benjen stark

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.819
Who's Ned Stark's brother at an ancient?

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:28.400
Landmark called the fist of the first men. They find a cache of weapons made of a substance called dragon glass

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.450
These will be very important later

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:37.009
Jon Snow gets separated from the other Rangers meets up with a Wilding named Ygritte and becomes a spy for the Nights Watch

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.559
embedded with the army of Mance Rayder the

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:45.289
King-beyond-the-wall. Oh, let's not forget. Arya while travelling north out of King's Landing and toward the wall

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:49.970
She meets up with a man named Jacques and Hegar who's being held prisoner and then that's the first

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:51.990
Make a friend

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.490
Yeah

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:58.760
he always talks funny like that the Lannisters catch up with the party kill arias friend take her sword needle and

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:05.419
Take the entire group to the Lannister held Harrenhal in the process. Arya saves jack ins life

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:11.989
Jaqen, appreciative of arias help agrees to kill three people for her as a mate good man persistence

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:19.819
My nose tree and he ultimately helps arya and Guidry escaped Harrenhal and go into friends with through the gate at midnight

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:25.219
Jock and offers to take Arya with him to the free city of Braavos and teach her to be an assassin like him

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.189
But Arya doesn't want to abandon her family

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:34.820
So he gives her an iron coin that she can use later to find him and as jaqen H'ghar leaves he reveals that he can

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.650
Magically change his appearance. He doesn't even need one of those Mission Impossible masks. That's it

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.840
That's a real time-saver on the other side of the world

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:48.590
Daenerys abandoned by Drogo's men and near-death finds her way to the city of Qarth a wealthy merchant and a warlock their plot to steal

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.590
Our dragons, but she takes them out

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:56.539
And manages to get away with enough valuables to buy a ship. Yeah, that's pretty much Daenerys in season two a

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:04.819
Lot of season three takes place way up north and Castle black and beyond so let's start with the Nights Watch

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:11.329
Jon Snow makes it to the wildling camp and meets tormund Giantsbane and king-beyond-the-wall mance rayder

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:17.779
He convinces them that he's sincere about joining their cause we'll need to find you a new cloak man sins torment

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:25.399
Jon Ygritte and some others on a perilous mission to climb over the wall and then wait to attack Castle black from the other side

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.829
Where they're less defended on their way to the wall Jon and Ygritte fall in love and do it in a cave

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.740
But once they're over the wall, Jon refuses to kill an old man who helps supply the Nights Watch with horses

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:43.099
So the wildlings figure out that he's not really on their side after all they try to kill him even Ygritte

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:51.469
But he escapes on the other side of the wall sam falls in love with a woman named Kelly at the worst air B&amp;B in

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:56.479
Westeros Craster's keep the other Nights Watch brothers grow tired of Craster's lack of hospitality

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:03.170
And kill him Commander Mormont dies in the scuffle and Sam and Gilly run away on their way back to the wall Sam

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.259
manages to kill a white Walker with a dagger made of dragonglass

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:13.099
They eventually make it back to Castle black and warn everyone that the White Walkers have returned

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:13.820
meanwhile

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:14.180
bran

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.689
Stark and his company meet up with two teens from house Reed Jojen and Meera

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:22.129
The reeds want to take brand north to find the three-eyed raven from his dreams

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:29.630
Jojen tells bran that he's a warg meaning he can see through the eyes of animals and control them. You can get inside his head

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.170
Here his eyes and bran has the sight

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:38.689
Allowing him to see things that are happening far away things that haven't happened yet or thinks it happened in the past

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:44.359
Bran sends his brother and OSHA away and decides to venture beyond the wall to find the Raven

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:50.030
Arya Stark is still on the run with ginjury when they cross paths with a group calling themselves the Brotherhood without banners

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.470
It's run by beric Dondarrion

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:57.410
The knight who was sent way back in season one by Ned Stark to track down the mountain

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:58.130
beric

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:04.849
Dondarrion is now loyal to no house and is in league with another priest for the Lord of Light a drunk named Thoris of me

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.679
purely by coincidence

00:19:06.679 --> 00:19:12.918
The Brotherhood also has the hound captive and they put him on trial for murder. I sentence you to trial by combat

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.919
So he and beric Dondarrion have a sword fight the hound wins killing barrack in the process

00:19:18.919 --> 00:19:24.349
But Thoreau Springs him back to life using the Lord of Lights magic. So the Hound decides to take off

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:32.689
Melisandre then locates the group and takes ginjury so she can sacrifice him and his Baratheon Kings blood to the Lord of Light to aid

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.640
Stannis's cause arya takes the chance to run away from the Brotherhood but is captured by the Hound

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:42.709
Who's been waiting for her and plans to take her back to her family for a ransom?

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:48.229
Theon meanwhile is being tortured for fun by Roose Bolton's sadistic cruel bastard Ramsay snow

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:55.370
This torture includes cutting off Theon spike broken by his captors Theon now agrees to be Ramsay's pet with a new name

00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:02.929
Reek and speaking of house Bolton one of their bannermen a guy named locke intercepts, Jaime and Brienne lay man of house

00:20:02.929 --> 00:20:07.879
Bolton and takes them captive. He chops off Jaime's right hand as a show of strength

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:13.219
Once they arrive at Harrenhal Castle Jaime's injury is treated by a disgraced former maester named Qyburn

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:18.169
Who lost his position for conducting illegal and questionable experiments on people?

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:26.179
Roose Bolton agrees to send Jaime to King's Landing where he promises Brienne that he will have the stark daughters released as Catelyn Stark wished

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:30.319
Stannis Baratheon spends this entire season in his castle at Dragonstone

00:20:31.049 --> 00:20:37.099
Grimly brooding about his loss at the Blackwater when ser Davos finds out about MELAS on just plan to sacrifice ginjury

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:42.439
He frees the boy and tells him to head for King's Landing in a rowboat a trip that will take at least a couple of

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.730
Seasons and Kings Landing Joffrey is now enjoying his engagement to Margaery Tyrell

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:54.349
Which is really both to step up and to step down for her Sansa tells Olenna Tyrell the powerful matriarch of the wealthy Tyrell family

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.990
The truth about King Joffrey. He's

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.340
but the wedding plans continue

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.210
anyway

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:07.490
Tywin Lannister decides to lock up the whole damn realm and orders that Tyrion be married to Sansa to secure the north and

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:11.538
Cersei be married to Loras Tyrell to secure the south neither

00:21:11.539 --> 00:21:16.158
one of them is happy with this arrangement and finally in Westeros this robb stark and his are

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:21.530
They're starting to lose the war through attrition and a loss of morale don't have enough to make a difference

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:27.200
Have you lost faith in our cause to secure the men he needs to keep fighting. He has to make good with the man

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.429
He double-crossed Walder Frey. I've come to make my apologies my lord

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.030
They come to an agreement

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:39.920
Catlins brother and mere Tully will marry Walters daughter Roslyn and the phrase will receive Harrenhal as further compensation

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:43.940
On route to Edmund yours wedding to Lisa reveals to rob that she's pregnant

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.940
But their happiness is short-lived

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:52.729
Because as it turns out Roose Bolton and Jaime Lannister were up to something in their time together at Harrenhal. Tell Robb Stark

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.730
I'm sorry, I couldn't make his uncle's wedding

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.090
the Lannisters send their regards

00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:04.489
Immediately after the wedding ceremony and Rob's public apology to Walder Frey. He's betrayed by both the phrase and Bolton's

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:09.139
their regards to Lisa Robb and Catelyn are all

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.859
murdered along with most of their soldiers and even Rob's

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:20.330
Direwolf gray wind for his participation in what comes to be known as the red wedding Roose Bolton becomes warden of the north

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:25.909
Friend of the Lannisters and architect of the most shocking moment in Game of Thrones history

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:31.009
So far and finally we go east to Essos Daenerys uses the money

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.400
she stole from Qarth to travel to the slave city of a

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:40.190
stupor she promises to trade one of her dragons in exchange for a slave army known as the

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.930
Unsullied but the dragon has different ideas and burns the Army's owner alive

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:54.229
Daenerys frees the slaves and now has the unsullied as a willing private army led by the soldier grey worm

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.120
She also recruits a formerly enslaved translator missin day to join the cause

00:22:59.789 --> 00:23:05.628
Daenerys and the unsullied now advanced to a city called un KY intending to free the slaves there as well

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:13.189
See Daenerys mission is kind of shifted from just conquering Westeros to also ridding the world of slavery because she have to dream big

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.600
Um KY is protected by a mercenary group called the second son's but one of them

00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:24.559
Daario naharis is so impressed by Daenerys Beauty that he turns on his leaders kills the men who were sent to assassinate

00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:29.119
Daenerys and brings the second sons into her army. They changed actors later

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.519
We'll keep you updated sir. Jorah Daario and grey worm go on a daring raid to secure. Um, KY

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.149
After which the city's freed slaves embrace Daenerys as Misa meaning mother

00:23:43.409 --> 00:23:44.759
As

00:23:44.759 --> 00:23:51.199
Season 4 begins we turn our attention back to King's Landing. We're planning for King Joffrey's wedding to Margaery

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.399
Tyrell is deep under way among the guests is Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne

00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:58.398
brother of King Aerys the second wife Elia

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:04.699
He wants revenge against the Lannisters in the mountain for the rape and murder of his sister and the murders of most of her children

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:10.009
In the aftermath of Robert's rebellion at Joffrey's wedding. He drinks some poisoned wine and dies

00:24:10.379 --> 00:24:14.419
But usually the death of a child is a tragedy, but you know what I'll give this one a pass

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.959
Cersei assumes Tyrion and his wife Sansa must have been behind it

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:27.559
Orders them both arrested Sansa manages to get away and out of King's Landing with some help from

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:31.339
Littlefinger who was working with the mastermind of Joffrey's murder

00:24:32.039 --> 00:24:33.960
Marjorie's grandmother Lady Olenna

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.590
You don't think I'd let you marry that beast deal

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:43.129
Littlefinger vows to keep Sansa safe and takes her with him to the Vale where he marries her aunt Lysa Arryn and a season 1

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:49.069
Mystery is solved as we discovered that Littlefinger told Lysa to kill her husband Jon Arryn

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:53.899
So they could be together and then send a letter to the Starks blaming it on the Lannisters

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.510
Those tops and told me to pour them into Jon's

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.709
So in a way Littlefinger is really the mastermind behind almost

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.829
Everything that's happened in Westeros so far

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.239
Anyway, now that he's power married with a firm grip on the veil lies the air in the served her purpose

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.630
So Littlefinger pushes her out of the moon door

00:25:14.169 --> 00:25:20.038
Back in King's Landing Jaime who has a new golden hand tasks Brienne with finding Sansa

00:25:20.409 --> 00:25:24.059
ISchool by all the calls that if told us well life admits on the job

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:30.630
He gives Brienne Oathkeeper a Valyrian steel sword Tywin created by melting down Ned Stark's sword ice

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:36.390
He also sends Tyrians and experienced Squire Podrick along with her with Joffrey dead. His younger, brother

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:42.780
Tommen is crowned the new king with Marjorie as his eager new queen and waiting when we marry I become yours

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:50.249
This is also where we meet Tommen's cats, sir pounce a key season four character Tyrion is put on trial

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:56.849
But he knows it's rigged against him. You will not speak unless called upon so he goes with what worked for him last time

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:59.250
I demand a trial by combat

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:06.209
Oberyn Martell joins team Tyrion, there will be your champion with the mountain representing the prosecution

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.740
Approaching Oberyn also known as the red Viper initially has the upper hand

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:15.869
But the mountain grabs him and smashes his head in his hands like a grape

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:22.109
The mountain is horribly wounded in the fight but maester Qyburn believes he could be saved

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.840
approaches move

00:26:25.179 --> 00:26:26.320
out of options

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:32.580
Jamie breaks tearing out of prison and arranges with Lord Varys to sneak him onto a ship bound for Essos

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:37.770
But before he leaves tearing goes to his father's bedroom and kills him on the John with a crossbow

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:45.659
Blunt, but to the point Ari and the Hound managed to avoid any trouble back during the red wedding Massacre at the twins

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:52.289
So they head to the Vale but are turned away after hearing about Lysa Erin's death video and died three days ago

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:57.249
Brienne and Podrick run across both of them on the road you a knight

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:06.670
Which leads to a knock-down drag-out fight between Brienne and the Hound over who wants to protect Arya more The Hound is badly wounded

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.160
and

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:15.789
Asks Arya to kill him but she refuses Arya then goes on the run and makes it to a port where she uses the iron

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:20.110
Coin that jock and Hegar gave her to book passage across the sea to Braavos

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.710
Extremely far to the north at the very top of the world

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:28.840
We get our first real look at the show's main undead nemesis the night king

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:32.620
able to turn innocent babies into White Walkers a

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:39.340
Bit south of there bran and his group arrive at a tree. He's seen in his visions where they're attacked by White's

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:47.799
Jojen Reed is killed but bran Meera and Hodor managed to make it into a nearby cave where they are protected by ancient

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:53.590
Creatures known as the children of the forest bran meets the three-eyed Raven who isn't Max von Sydow yet

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:56.110
But soon will be I've been watching you

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.679
All of you just a bit south of there

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.520
Jon Snow returns to Castle black

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:07.930
Which is good because mance rayder's army Sage's a massive assault just as Jon warned them

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.779
They would yeah, they have Giants. It's the North

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.110
During the battle Ygritte seems to get the drop on Jon

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:20.860
But she's killed by a boy named Ali eventually. The Nights Watch is successful at holding the invasion off

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:26.470
But Mance's army is still pretty big and plans to come back when out here to conquer

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:33.279
We are here to hide behind your wall that is until Stannis Baratheon shows up with a newly aquired army

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.800
courtesy of a loan from the iron bank of Braavos

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:44.080
Who has switched their allegiance from the Lannisters to the real Baratheon's Stannis routes the wildling forces and takes Mance Rayder prisoner

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:50.320
Finally far to the east and Eris and her armies arrive in the final slave City Marine

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:57.460
After liberating Marine Daenerys finds out just how difficult it is to keep the peace and prevent the return of slavery in three cities

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:04.439
So she agrees to delay her trip to Westeros. It appears my liberation of slavers Bay and getting his plan

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:11.099
She also discovers that sir Jorah Mormont had been serving as a Baratheon spy, he'd be treating me

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:20.700
And banishes him from marine and all other slave cities for life, sir, Jorah is sad

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:28.769
Season 5 opens with a flashback showing a young Cersei and her friend visiting a witch in the woods near Casterly Rock

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.370
Future

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:36.629
The witch tells her that one day she'll be Queen and will have three children

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:42.419
But they will all die during her lifetime and she'll be replaced by a younger and more beautiful Queen

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.969
So she's got that going for it, which is nice

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:50.729
Jumping forward to the present at least part of the prophecy comes true with the marriage of Tommen and Margaery

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:58.080
Sarah sees been demoted to Queen Mother but is still trying to run the capital herself and head off the increasingly powerful Tyrells

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:05.639
This includes forming an alliance with a religious group on the rise in King's Landing called the sparrows and their leader the high Sparrow

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:13.560
Initially this works up pretty well for Cersei as the high Sparrow has both sir Loras and

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:20.580
Margaery Tyrell arrested but then Cersei loses control of the group and ends up arrested herself on charges including

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:26.430
Incest and the murder of King Robert, so it's pretty serious as punishment

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:32.640
Cersei is forced to confess her sins and walk naked through the streets of King's Landing while this lady yells shame at her

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:39.869
There is one bright spot though when her walk is over Qyburn introduces her to the newly resurrected

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:46.229
mountain a silent 8 foot tall zombie in gold armor who lives to do her bidding meet

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:50.489
Jaime Lannister is not around for any of this because he's off in Dorne

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:55.229
Electrifly's after getting a threatening message from oberyn's lover ilaria

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.349
Jamie takes Bronn with him to rescue his daughter Myrcella

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:05.190
Don't forget a few seasons ago Tyrion sent Marcella to Dorne to be married Prince Doran of Dorne

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:11.339
Agrees to send Myrcella back to King's Landing if the alliance between the Iron Throne and Dorne is to continue

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:18.659
That engagement must stand as they leave for the return trip. However ilaria goes rogue and poisons Marcella to death

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.930
That's two Baratheon child poisonings in a row

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:29.160
Across the sea Arya arrives in Braavos to learn the ways of the many-faced God from Jackie and Hagar and his lovely assistant

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.920
Jockin tells us she has to become no.1 and she pretends to know what that means. Who are you then?

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:37.960
No one

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:45.900
Eventually Arya runs into her old. Enemy Meryn Trant the Kingsguard who killed her teacher Syrio Forel and starts crossing more names off her list

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.229
Meanwhile Tyrion and Varys arrive overseas and the former master whispers

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:55.560
Convinces his new traveling companion to go meet with Daenerys

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.189
I believe men of talent have a part to play in the war to come

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:04.769
Tyrion eventually makes his way to Daenerys with surgery who has kidnapped him as a peace offering

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:10.079
Daenerys agrees to take on Tyrion as an advisor, but once more censured Jorah away

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:17.009
Tyrion is won over by Daenerys has plans to not just up in the way Westeros works, but break the system all together

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.170
I'm not going to stop the wheel

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:25.229
I'm going to break the wheel but things are falling apart in Mereen the city's

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:32.550
Experiencing an uprising by former slavers calling themselves the sons of the harpy hoping to keep the peace. She agrees to reopen the fighting pits

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:39.209
Gladiator like arenas where men fight for sport the sons of the harpy staged a revolt and begins slaughtering everyone

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:45.660
Daenerys is about to be killed when she's saved by drogon her biggest and let's face it

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:50.160
Favorite dragon who flies away with her on his back surgery

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:56.399
Mormont who keeps turning up like a bad penny and new Daario go to look for dragon headed north

00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.749
We're going to find her. That's what I have to go while Tyrion stays behind to run things in marine

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:06.719
We the viewers see that she's eventually set down and then immediately taken prisoner by another group of dis Rocky

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:09.119
Good job Shogun way to help

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:16.050
Things are also going sideways in Westeros where Littlefinger has arranged for Sansa to marry Ramsay, Bolton

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:20.160
Making her a powerful figure in the north. Stop being a bystander

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.740
Jaime so funny

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.199
Ramsay is of course a horrible person and

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:31.560
Brutalizes his new wife while continuing to traumatize Theon slash reek eventually both of them decide

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:38.549
they've had enough and escaped the castle together at the wall Jon's elected the new Lord Commander of the Nights Watch becoming the

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.150
990 8th man to hold the title, but who's counting among?

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:45.119
His first actions is to seek an alliance with the wildlings

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:50.550
Offering to give them land south of the wall in exchange for help fighting the White Walkers make peace

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.870
to save your people

00:33:52.870 --> 00:34:00.180
This does not go over well with a lot of his brothers who still think of the free folk as their enemy. It's loaded villages

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:09.030
Jon is also losing allies quickly as Sam leaves for old town with Gilly where he's gonna study to become a maester

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.669
Jon tormund and some other brothers and

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:14.159
wildlings travelled north of the wall to the

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:14.860
wildling

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:21.989
settlement at hardhome in an attempt to keep a huge group of wildlings from becoming part of the night king's army the White Walkers don't

00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:25.800
Care if a mountains free folk or crow, we're all the same to them meat for their army

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:27.330
but while they're there

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.610
They're attacked by White Walkers and whites

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:37.499
John discovers for himself that dragonglass and Valyrian steel can both take out white walkers, but it's a rout nonetheless

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:45.209
The battle ends with John and some wildlings escaping but the night king resurrecting all of the dead to serve in his army

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:47.210
So it's kind of a mixed bag

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:52.050
Stannis plans to begin his conquest of Westeros by attacking the Bolton's at Winterfell

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:57.330
But Ramsay gets the drop on him and burns most of his supplies and siege weapons

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:04.860
so Stannis does the only thing he could think of he allows Melisandre to sacrifice his daughter Shireen to the Lord of Light, but whoops

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.440
Stannis's army is still

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.540
decimated by the Bolton's forces

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:16.079
After his devastating loss Brienne finds him and executes him to avenge the death of Renly

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:21.029
I was there when he was mounted by shadow to the old face. At least we're pretty sure that's what happened

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:22.090
It's off screen

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:29.699
but we do know that Davos and Melisandre survived and returned to Castle black where John's brothers are so upset at his alliance with the

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.949
Wildlings they stab him to death

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:38.310
Lavash yeah even Olly this kid is a monster. Oh, yeah, and there's no brand this season

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.370
He's busy in a tree studying for his Raven midterms

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.060
Thankfully John's not dead for too long

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:53.020
Season six opens with wildlings and brothers sympathetic to John putting down the insurgency and retaking control of Castle black then

00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:58.629
Melisandre who we find out actually looks hundreds of years old and uses magic to appear young and beautiful

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.869
Praise to the Lord of Light and brings John back from the dead

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:08.649
John then hangs the traitors who led the revolt against him and leaves the Nights Watch by what she's ended

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:13.479
Having fulfilled his oath to serve until his death gotta love those technicalities

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:14.290
meanwhile

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:17.439
Brienne and Podrick meet up with the freshly escaped Theon and Sansa

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:21.790
Theon takes off to return to his family and the Iron Islands they will keep you safe for the night

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:29.259
While the rest of them head for Castle black as Winterfell is still held by the Bolton's well to be specific held by Ramsay

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:32.319
Bolton who's the new Lord Bolton after murdering his father

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:39.129
Along with dad's new wife and their baby boy Ramsay is so evil guys just really really bad news

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:44.169
Reunited with his sister Sansa John begins amassing an army to retake Winterfell

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:51.220
Including many of the minor northern houses and this actual minor Lyanna Mormont. Yeah. Just want my allegiance

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:57.399
You want my fighting ring Littlefinger who de facto controls the Eyrie due to his outsized influence on young Robin Arryn

00:36:57.859 --> 00:36:59.859
offers the Knights of the Vale to help

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:07.390
This isn't directly plot connected, but you should also know that tormund kind of has a thing for Brienne

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:14.290
Okay, it's time for the so called battle of the bastards Ramsay kicks it off by killing a captive Rickon stark with an arrow

00:37:14.839 --> 00:37:17.139
Serpentine kid always got to run serpentine

00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:23.409
This causes Jon to make some possibly unwise tactical decisions, but just when all seems lost

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:28.030
Sansa Littlefinger and the Knights of the Vale show up and they retake Winterfell

00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:31.599
Sansa feeds Ramsay to his own dogs for revenge

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:38.589
Yeah, get him also. No Davos discovers the truth about what happened to princess Shireen. I loved that girl

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:43.959
Like she was my own and demands that Jon allowed to execute, Melisandre

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:48.010
Jon sends her away instead and tells her never to return to the north

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:53.449
Meanwhile, the other lords of the north pledged themselves to Jon Snow the king in the newel

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:56.420
Yeah, that's how you pledged yourself north of the wall

00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:00.469
We meet back up with bran who's been training to look into the past with the three-eyed Raven

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.650
Who's now in his final form as Max von Sydow?

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:10.160
Bran sees a few important visions including the creation of the first white Walker. I mean listen was a different time

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:10.460
Okay

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:14.420
people were less sensitive about turning humans into frost monsters and in yet another

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:18.500
Vision bran sees the night king who becomes aware of his presence

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:24.110
This alerts the white walkers to the location of the cave, which is then attacked by the knight king's army

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:28.639
mirrors instructions in the present to hold the door for her and brand

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:36.590
Combined with brands time travel awarding powers end up being the origin story for why Hodor compulsively repeats the phrase

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:38.810
Hodor

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.459
But anyway Hodor dies very soon

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:50.330
This is also our maximum seed ow, and summer the direwolf meet their untimely ends or if you're a white Walker

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:52.330
They're perfectly timed ends

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:56.540
outside of the cave Meera and bran are about to be killed by whites when they're saved by a

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:59.480
disfigured Benjen stark remember him from season one

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:01.880
He takes Meera and bran back toward the wall

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:05.959
And this is where brand touches a weirwood tree and has yet another vision

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:10.099
But this is an important one the true story behind Jon Snow

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:15.710
We see that Ned Stark discovered his sister Lyanna giving birth to a son by Rhaegar Targaryen

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:17.880
before dying

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:24.920
Knowing that King Robert would kill this baby if he found it Ned claims it as his own bastard child naming him. Jon Snow

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:27.150
So Jon is of noble blood

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:34.639
He's half stark and half Targaryen and I bet you didn't see that coming unless you were on the Internet ever before this aired

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:40.759
Okay, let's head south for the odds and ends by the time Theon returns to the Iron Islands. He let you go

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:46.339
His uncle Euron has also come back and killed his father bail on

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:53.360
Euron has crowned the new king and vows to marry Daenerys Targaryen and use her dragons to claim control of Westeros

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.600
I wasn't born to be king. I

00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:03.259
Paid the iron price in the aftermath Theon and Yara flee but yeren vows to build a new fleet and go after them

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:03.890
meanwhile

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:06.439
Sam Gilly and newborn baby Sam stop at the end

00:40:06.759 --> 00:40:11.819
Starly home on their way to the citadel for Sam's Meister training and this isn't really important except to note that

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.730
Sam's dad is a dick and Sam steals

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:18.059
The family's Valyrian steel sword hearts bein as payback

00:40:18.519 --> 00:40:23.999
Once they arrived in old town dozens of white Ravens are released signaling the official start of the long winter

00:40:24.369 --> 00:40:31.078
Across the seeds an heiress is taken to Vice doth rack where she immediately burns the entire Dothraki leadership alive

00:40:31.569 --> 00:40:38.459
Daenerys declares herself the new leader of the Dothraki and heads home to marine where she quickly puts down the revolt against her

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:44.819
Just in time to receive a visit from the Greyjoy's sublimes run sisters defeat Eidos took the iron islands

00:40:44.819 --> 00:40:47.939
He asked you to give them back they provide her with a fleet of ships

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:54.119
Which she graciously accepts and uses to set sail for Westeros before departing for her homeland

00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:56.788
She also names Tyrion her hand of the Queen

00:40:57.309 --> 00:41:04.469
Meanwhile, Aria continues her faceless man training which is like 98% stick fighting, but eventually her strong wills lead

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:07.619
Jaqen to give his lovely assistant permission to kill her

00:41:10.869 --> 00:41:18.479
But the assistant loses and she's killed jack and tells arya that she's ready to join the faceless kids club finally a good

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:24.089
But she says she's tired of being no-one and intends to go back to being Arya Stark of Winterfell

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:32.129
This news causes jock into I don't know. It's smart kinda it's not his face. He's still feeling it out back in Westeros

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:37.710
She gets her red wedding revenge posing as a servant in the Frey household and feeding Walder Frey a pie

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:42.509
Containing his two sons and then executing him also back in Westeros

00:41:42.509 --> 00:41:47.549
We find out that the Hound is still alive doing a lay lotv Incredible Hulk kind of thing

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:55.289
Eventually, he teams up with Thoris of mere and beric Dondarrion. It helps them execute some rogue members of the Brotherhood without banners

00:41:56.170 --> 00:42:00.509
Meanwhile back in King's Landing Cersei has had it with both the high Sparrow and the Tyrells

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:03.509
So she and Qyburn do the natural thing and detonate

00:42:03.789 --> 00:42:10.859
wildfire under the great Sept Deering lorises trial this explosion kills everyone inside including the high Sparrow and

00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:16.379
Every Tyrell not played by Dame Diana Rigg while Cersei relishes her victory

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.720
Tommen seeing that his queen is dead

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:24.030
His city is partially destroyed commits suicide and all of Circe's children died

00:42:24.369 --> 00:42:27.209
Just as the wits foretold and sorry

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:33.659
I've always just wanted to say just as the witch foretold in the aftermath of the violence. Cersei is crowned the new queen

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:40.139
Oh and over in Dorne ilaria sand and the red Vipers daughters. The sand snakes assassinate Prince, Doran and declare war

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:42.750
Freakin Dorne. Am I right?

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:51.090
Okay, here we are the second to last season and the last season for this cram it we're almost at the end and honestly this

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:54.929
Is further into the story than george RR martin ever made it so give yourselves a hand

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:58.320
Aria is all set to go to King's Landing and kill Cersei

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:03.779
But when she finds out that her family has retaken Winterfell, she heads there instead in the woods

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:09.419
She sees Nymeria her old direwolf, but the animals got native and prefers running wild and living with the pack

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.140
You know

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.470
It's like a metaphor in

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:17.730
Old town Sam does a lot of reading and meets up with Jorah Mormont who's now infected with a deadly disease called

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:26.070
Greyscale Sam cures Jorah and Jorah heads back to Daenerys to serve his queen. She takes him back because the guy just won't quit

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:31.320
Daenerys arrives in Westeros with her armies and her dragons and everybody else at Dragonstone

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:36.389
Which is empty since Stannis Baratheon abandoned it for his failed campaign in the North there

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:43.379
She's visited by Melisandre who suggests Sam meeting with Jon Snow and I'm stand before you and tell you the things that happen to him

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:46.109
Tyrion seconds the motion so they extend an invitation

00:43:46.599 --> 00:43:52.588
Jon Snow decides to go against sonses advice and leaves her in charge as warden of the north in his stead

00:43:52.839 --> 00:43:55.949
After he leaves Mira and bran make it back from their travels

00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:02.339
But bran has been changed seemingly forever by his powers and has emotionally disconnected almost completely

00:44:02.339 --> 00:44:04.339
I could never be Lord of anything

00:44:05.859 --> 00:44:09.509
He barely even reacts when Mira tells him she's leaving to go back home

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:13.379
Man evil. No, I don't that's cold

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:20.820
I mean obviously because it's the north but it also lacks feeling around this time. Arya also returns to Winterfell and hugs everyone

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:26.369
Littlefinger is also hanging around the castle and generally being a creep he tries to drive a wedge between

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.830
Arya and Sansa for his own benefit

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:33.429
She could want she could want me dead, but it doesn't work

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:36.340
they turn the tables on him and put him on trial the

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:42.040
Conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters it was you who started it. Do you deny it and Sansa finds him guilty?

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:47.020
Thank you for all your many lessons Lord Baelish. I will never forget them

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:47.680
alright

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:55.300
It takes care of the execution herself with his own Valyrian steel dagger the stark girls coming this fall to ADC

00:44:55.700 --> 00:45:02.169
John arrives at Dragonstone and is reunited with Tyrion Lannister who he hasn't seen since they hung out at the wall all the way back

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:05.859
In season one remember that I just started talking crazy

00:45:05.859 --> 00:45:07.160
It's been a long road

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:12.250
Melisandre says that she is now going to return to volantis in the east but she does predict that both

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:15.010
She and Varys are destined to die in

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:18.459
Westeros you gotta wonder if that's gonna you know

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:23.710
Pay off later on even though Jon struggles to convince Daenerys of the white Walker threat

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:27.489
She lets him start mining for dragonglass below the castle anyway

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:36.730
He's also able to bond pretty easily with drogon who perhaps senses his Targaryen ancestor, you know what I'm getting out of myself

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:40.269
Let's go to King's Landing where the Lannisters are doing what they do best

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:43.599
paying their debts Jaime Lannister

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:50.409
Randyll Tarly Sam's dad the jerk and Bronn lead a force that takes the Tyrells Castle Highgarden

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:51.730
Olenna Tyrell

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:54.669
Is there and Jaime allows her to drink poison for a quick?

00:45:54.890 --> 00:46:00.040
Merciful death right before she goes she confesses to him that it was her who ordered the hit on Joffrey

00:46:04.339 --> 00:46:10.149
Cersei takes the news. Well, she died screaming see the Lannisters plan to use the money

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:13.210
They're looting from the Tyrells to pay off their debts to the iron bank

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:23.409
Once those are taken care of the bank will back the Lannisters and hiring the golden company the largest

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:27.489
mercenary force in the world to retain their power but

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:30.130
Daenerys her dragons and the Dothraki

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:34.419
Attacked the wagon train as it moves the loot from Highgarden back to King's Landing

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.080
both bran and Jaime's survived the attack somehow

00:46:38.599 --> 00:46:46.209
Sam's dad and brother Randall and dick and Tarly are captured by Denari and after refusing to bend the knee burned by her dragons

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:49.509
Tyrians not crazy about this strategy don't beheading entire

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:56.799
Speaking of Tyrion. He has Davos sneak him into King's Landing. Hoping to make some kind of peace accord with Jaime

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:03.820
You can ask yourself, ultimately their unsuccessful, but Davos does manage to find Gendry while he's there

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:08.620
Remember Gendry from that boat. He's back in an entirely different boat

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:14.709
Jamie tells Cersei that he met secretly with Tyrion and about the army of the Dead but she already knows all this

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:20.890
Dragon dragon queen. She also tells him that she's pregnant who uses his father

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.930
Yeah back at Dragonstone

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:29.139
Jon decides the only way to prove to everyone that the White Walkers are really really for real and he's super super

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:35.230
Serial about this is to go beyond the wall get a white and bring it back to show everyone

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:37.230
I'm the only one who is fooled

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:39.710
The only one here, who knows?

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:44.440
Going along for the ride are a renewed and invigorated Sir Jorah forgiving his trespasses

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:50.680
Plus torment and some other wildlings Gendry Thoris and barrack and their new friend the Hound

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:55.359
During the harsh journey Thoros is mauled to death by an undead bear

00:47:55.580 --> 00:48:02.259
But the snow aside squad does manage to bag itself a white in doing so they discover that killing a white Walker

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:06.189
Also destroys all of the white serving them which is good to know

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:11.469
They get pinned down and have ginjury run back to Eastwatch on his own for help. You're the Fosters

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:18.400
No, no, and I'm not sure how the timing works on this one, but Daenerys flies up with her dragons to save everyone

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:23.469
But the night king manages to take out Vissarion with an iced javelin

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:27.250
With some help from Benjen Stark John and his group managed to get away

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:35.650
But benjin sadly is killed in the fighting again, I guess geez, this guy has more lives than a cat even worse for Humanity's sake

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:41.320
Viserion comes back to life as an undead ice dragon. That's gonna leave a mark

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:48.549
Daenerys now fully convinced of the threat of the White Walkers vows that she and John will destroy the night King together

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:52.120
It's also pretty obvious to everyone watching that these two have feelings for one another

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.660
Which is gonna be super weird in just a couple more minutes

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.170
Okay, almost there

00:48:57.170 --> 00:49:00.740
So just about every living major character from the show thus far

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:06.319
Formally and officially meets up in King's Landing to talk about the white Walker situation

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.889
Tyrion reconnects with bran and Podrick it's good to see you again

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:15.079
Yeah, you too Brienne and King's Landing at santa's request makes her peace with the Hound

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:18.530
I'm Sammy trying to protect her and it's all very nice

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:21.110
present surprise in an unpleasant situation

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:28.310
Until they show everybody the white you're on just straight-up freaks out and leaves immediately for the Iron Islands

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:34.249
This is the only thing I've ever seen so terrified when Cersei finds out Jon has already declared for the Targaryen

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:38.060
She leaves the meeting the Dead will come with first. Enjoy dealing with me

00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:43.219
We will deal with whatever is left of you Tyrion tries to reason with her. I would not care

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:50.569
And figures out that she's pregnant. But once he leaves Cersei reveals the full scope of her plans to Jaime

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:58.280
She's really in league with Joran who's off with his fleet pickin up the golden company once everyone else has exhausted themselves

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:03.679
Fighting the dead she's going to use her forces to wipe out whoever's left and stay in power

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:08.059
Jaime thinks this is crazy and dishonourable and crazy dishonourable

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:12.410
So he takes off leaving King's Landing just as the first snow begins to fall

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:19.069
Theon remember Theon pledges his allegiance to Jon then returns to the Iron Islands fights

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:26.480
This guy hard enough to prove himself and raises an army to save his sister yarr from the clutches of his uncle Euron. Yeah

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:34.489
Daenerys and John set sail together for Winterfell and totally like get it on along the way

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:37.100
Tyrion gets wise to what they're up to and seems

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:41.900
Concerned or perturbed he seems conserved and this may be why

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:47.809
Sam and Gilly have stumbled on some very telling clues about Jon's real identity and head to Winterfell

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:53.330
These clues and brands greensight are all our heroes need to put together the truth

00:50:53.370 --> 00:51:00.380
Jon isn't really my father Phil Rhaegar Targaryen had his first marriage to Elia Martell annulled by the High Septon

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:06.079
So that he could marry Lyanna stark making their baby. Jon Snow a

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.019
legitimate highborn lord named

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.500
Which also makes Jon?

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:17.090
Daenerys his nephew. Ha you've been thrown these two

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:21.890
They just got thrown and as if that's not enough in the season's final scene

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:28.640
Eastwatch-by-the-sea is attacked by the night king riding an undead Viserion ice dragon together

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:35.509
They take out a big chunk of the wall as beric Dondarrion and tormund Giantsbane look on in horror and the White Walkers

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.790
begin to cross into Westeros

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:42.170
So that's pretty much everything

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:47.870
You need to know from all seven seasons of Game of Thrones and roughly the same time. You need to watch one episode

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:52.729
We've been here for some time and if we could get george RR martin to work at this pace

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:56.360
Maybe we wouldn't have to wonder if the show and the books are gonna end the same way

00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:03.799
Thanks for watching. And now our cram has ended. Oh, oh or how about this? This cram was dark and full of terrors

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:10.909
Alright one more a cram astir always pays their debts. Ok. I'm clearly delirious. So it's time to go. See you next time
