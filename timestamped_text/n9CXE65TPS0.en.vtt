00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.780
Welcome back to another episode of Cinema Summary.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.200
Today we'll be taking a look at the most perfect person

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.240
that ever did exist: Mary Poppins

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.780
a British nanny with a super and
natural skillset.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:19.190
Here we are In Edwardian London, 1910, where
we meet, Bert, who performs as a one-man band

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.990
and does other oddjobs; when he senses "a change
in the wind."

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.910
Afterwards, he directly addresses the audience,
and gives them a tour of Cherry Tree Lane,

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.000
stopping outside the Banks family’s home.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.570
George Banks, The Man
of the House, returns home to learn from Winifred

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.890
that Katie Nanna has decided to quit after
Jane and Michael ran away again.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.210
They are returned shortly after by Constable
Jones, who reveals the children were chasing

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.210
a lost kite.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.620
The children ask him to help build a better
kite, but he brushes them off.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.740
Taking it upon himself to hire a new nanny,
Mr. Banks advertises for a “stern, no-nonsense

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.880
nanny” or... think "baby sitter" for us Americans.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.600
Instead, Jane and Michael present their own
advertisement for a “kinder, sweeter nanny”.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.400
Mr. Banks rips up the letter, and throws the
scraps in the fireplace, and places his own

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.240
advertisement in the papers but the remains
of the Jane &amp; Michael’s advert magically float

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.130
up, and out into the air.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.880
Mr. Banks's ad works

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.120
Look at all o these elderly, sour-faced nannies
waiting outside.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.990
They are suddenly blown away by a strong gust
of wind, and Jane and Michael witness a young

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.230
nanny floating from the sky using her umbrella. Huh.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.690
Introducing herself to Mr. Banks, Mary Poppins
calmly produces the children's restored advertisement,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.280
and agrees with its requests, but promises
the astonished banker she will be firm with

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.280
his children.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.729
As Mr Banks tries to figure out how she got
the advert, Mary Poppins hires herself, and

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.040
convinces him it was originally his idea. After all, Mary
is practically perfect in every way.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.590
She meets the children, then helps them tidy
their nursery through song; and magic we can’t

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.150
forget about that can we? Before they all
head out for a walk in the park.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.430
Outside, they meet Bert, working as a screever, a sidewalk artist; Mary Poppins uses her magic

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.930
to transport the group into one of the drawings.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.420
While the children ride on a carousel or merry-go-round as you might know it,

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.000
Mary Poppins and Bert go on a leisurely stroll

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.740
with a musical number, and are served tea
by a quartet of penguin waiters

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.640
and look at that their dressed in little suits how cute.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.720
Mary Poppins enchants the carousel horses,
and jockeys in a race horse, which she wins

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.519
after all, I told you she was perfect

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:33.140
While being asked to describe her victory,
Mary Poppins announces the nonsense word "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious".

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.640
However, the trip is ruined when a thunderstorm
demolishes Bert's drawings, returning the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.650
group to London.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.529
On another day, the four meet Uncle Albert,
who has floated up into the air due to his uncontrollable

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.960
laughter because magical realism I guess;

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.600
they join him for a tea party on the ceiling,

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:48.609
telling jokes.

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.540
"Yesterday, I met a man with a wooden leg named Smith."

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.580
"What’s the name of his other leg?"

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.000
*Narrator laughs uproariously with little regard to noise complaints*

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.219
But, Mr. Banks finds the family’s cheery
atmosphere quite upsetting, and threatens

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.079
to fire Mary Poppins.

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.599
Instead, Mary Poppins turns the tables and
convinces him to take the children to the

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.960
bank for a day.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.500
Mr. Banks takes Jane and Michael to the bank,
where they meet Mr. Dawes Sr. and his son, Mr. Dawes.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.960
Mr. Dawes aggressively attempts to have Michael
invest his tuppence in the bank, snatching

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.000
it from him

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.620
Ah, the “Anti-Swiss Maneuver”.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.780
Michael demands it back, causing other customers
to misinterpret the incident, and all demand

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.580
their own money back, causing a bank run.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.260
Speaking of running, Jane and Michael run away from the bank,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.740
getting lost in the East End until they run into Bert,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.620
now working as a chimney sweep, who takes them back home.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.800
The trio, with Mary Poppins, go out onto the rooftops using a magical smoke staircase,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.000
where they have a song-and-dance number with other chimney sweeps

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.420
*Narrator proceeds to sing a good song, badly*

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.700
*This continues*

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.800
When, Mr. Banks returns home, he receives a phone
call from his employers, and speaks with Bert,

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.939
who tells him he should spend more time with
his children before they grow up.

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.939
Jane and Michael give their father Michael's
tuppence in the hope to make amends.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.420
Mr. Banks walks thoughtfully through London as he makes his way to the Bank

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.240
Where he is given a humiliating cashiering, an embarrassing firing, and is dismissed.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.920
Looking to the tuppence for words, he blurts
out "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!",

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.840
tells one of Uncle Albert's jokes, the Wooden Leg one, and happily heads home with a song in his heart

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.380
Dawes Sr. mulls over the joke, and he floats up
laughing in the air as he gets the punchline.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.400
The next day, the wind changes, meaning Mary
Poppins must leave.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.680
A happier Mr. Banks is found at home, having
fixed his children's kite, and with his family

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.080
they go out to fly the kite.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.050
In the park, the Banks' meet Mr. Dawes Jr,
who reveals his father died laughing from

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.160
the joke, and re-employs Mr. Banks as a junior partner

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.520
Well does that mean he accidentally killed the guy?

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.660
With her work done, Mary Poppins flies away, with Bert bidding her one last goodbye,

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:49.900
telling her to not to stay away too long.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.900
