00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.100
Hello Ladies and Gentlemen, this is another episode of Cinema Summary

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.680
And, let's talk about something in particular:

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.800
Forrest Gump.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.020
An extremely quotable film.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.820
Inspiring, yet, tear-jerking.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.940
Based on the novel of the same name, it stars Tom Hanks, as the titular Forrest Gump--

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.060
a mentally impaired renaissance man.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.711
Equal parts heartwarming and heart breaking,
hilarious and horrific, a period piece and

00:00:29.711 --> 00:00:31.560
yet so resonant with contemporary culture.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.530
Forrest can run fast, but if you're pressed for time--here's Forrest Gump:

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.110
Gump:
In 1981, Forrest Gump recounts his life story

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.540
to strangers who sit next to him on a bench
in Savannah, Georgia.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.120
On his first day of school in 1950s Greenbow,
Alabama, Forrest meets a girl named Jenny

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.300
Curran who, unlike the other children, immediately
befriends young Forrest.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.650
Due to leg braces fitted to correct a curved
spine, Forrest is unable to walk properly.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.600
One day, a young truck driver stays at the
boarding house that Forrest lives in with

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.600
his mother.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.680
The young truck driver turns out to be Elvis
Presley who, while playing guitar for him,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.330
becomes enthralled at the jerky hip thrusting
movements the hobbled Forrest makes while

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.600
trying to dance.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.229
Later on, Elvis becomes famous by imitating
the dance.

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.298
The Theatrical adaptation of Forrest Gump
does away with some parts that were included

00:01:14.298 --> 00:01:15.298
in the book.

00:01:15.298 --> 00:01:16.298
In fact, Robert Zemeckis did this deliberately:
in the original book, Forrest Gump was looked

00:01:16.298 --> 00:01:17.300
down upon far more harshly, even by his mother.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.600
The perspective and outlook upon Forrest was
changed.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.592
In Zemeckis’s mind, this change from negative
to positive beget more changes, especially

00:01:20.592 --> 00:01:21.592
in regards to the realism of the movie.

00:01:21.592 --> 00:01:22.592
If one thing changed severely, this would
in turn have a domino effect on the characters

00:01:22.592 --> 00:01:23.592
and setting of the film.

00:01:23.592 --> 00:01:25.200
Thus we have two somewhat different stories
today.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.310
Forrest is often bullied because of his physical
disability and marginal intelligence.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.420
One day, while trying to escape some bullies
chasing him, his braces fall off revealing

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.640
the young Forrest to be a very fast runner.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.280
Despite his low intelligence quotient, Forrest's
new running ability leads to him receiving

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.320
a football scholarship to the University of
Alabama in the early 1960s, becoming a top

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.670
running back, being named on the All-American
team, and meeting President John F. Kennedy.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.810
After his college graduation, he enlists in
the US Army, where he befriends a fellow soldier

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.690
named Bubba, who convinces Forrest to go into
the shrimping business with him when the war

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:14.010
is over.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.440
In 1967, they are sent to Vietnam and, during
an ambush, Bubba is killed in action.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.689
Forrest saves many of his platoon, including
his Lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:27.819
his legs.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.060
Forrest is awarded the Medal of Honor for
his heroism.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.829
While Forrest is in recovery for a gunshot
wound to his buttocks received while saving

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.879
his platoon-mates, he discovers a talent for
ping pong.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.469
He becomes a ping pong celebrity and plays
competitively against Chinese teams in ping

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:47.319
pong diplomacy.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:53.349
At an anti-war rally in Washington, D.C.,
Forrest briefly reunites with Jenny, who has

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.810
been living a hippie lifestyle.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.450
While in D.C. in 1972, Forrest meets president
Richard Nixon and is put up in the Watergate

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.965
hotel, where he accidentally reveals the Watergate
scandal, ultimately forcing Nixon to resign.

00:03:04.965 --> 00:03:05.965
The story of Forrest Gump is a ‘been there,
shaped history’.

00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:06.965
With Forrest Gump being a completely fictional
character BUT the events he is involved with

00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:07.965
are true.

00:03:07.965 --> 00:03:08.965
Except for the Bubba Gump Shrimping business
which became real after the movie was released.

00:03:08.965 --> 00:03:09.965
There are ‘artistic liberties’ taken in
regards to certain events but… overall it

00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:10.965
is historically accurate in the same way that
buckshot hits the bullseye: within historical

00:03:10.965 --> 00:03:11.965
authenticity with inaccuracies taken that
do not entirely affect history to be too incredibly

00:03:11.965 --> 00:03:12.965
and wildly inaccurate.

00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:13.965
Returning home, Forrest endorses a company
that makes ping pong paddles.

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:14.965
He uses the earnings to buy a shrimping boat,
fulfilling his promise to Bubba.

00:03:14.965 --> 00:03:15.965
Taylor joins Forrest in 1974, and although
they initially have little success, after

00:03:15.965 --> 00:03:16.965
their boat becomes the only one to survive
Hurricane Carmen, they pull in huge amounts

00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:17.965
of shrimp.

00:03:17.965 --> 00:03:18.965
They use their income to purchase a fleet
of shrimp boats.

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:19.965
Dan invests the money in Apple Computer(which
Forrest naively thinks is "some kind of fruit

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:20.965
company") and Forrest is financially secure
for the rest of his life, but gives half of

00:03:20.965 --> 00:03:21.965
his earnings to Bubba's family.

00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:22.965
He then returns home to see his mother's last
days.

00:03:22.965 --> 00:03:23.965
One of the perhaps stranger things that was
cut out of the book was a section of the story

00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:24.965
wherein Forrest becomes an astronaut and crash
lands on the moon.

00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:25.965
Whilst there, he meets an ape called Sue,
and together they return back to earth crash

00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:26.965
landing in a jungle, filled with cannibals.

00:03:26.965 --> 00:03:27.965
What also changes is the ending.

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:28.965
Whereas the film ostensibly has the shrimping
business be late middle and penultimate part

00:03:28.965 --> 00:03:29.965
of the film, the creation of the shrimping
business is actually the ending to the original

00:03:29.965 --> 00:03:30.965
book.

00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:31.965
In the late 1970s, Jenny returns to visit
Forrest and he soon proposes to her.

00:03:31.965 --> 00:03:32.965
She declines, but slips into his bedroom and
makes love to him that night before leaving

00:03:32.965 --> 00:03:33.965
early the next morning.

00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:34.965
Heartbroken, Forrest elects to go for a run.

00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:35.965
He decides to keep running across the country
several times, over three and a half years,

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:36.965
becoming famous in the process.

00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:39.549
In the present, Forrest reveals that he is
waiting at the bus stop because he received

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.760
a letter from Jenny who, having seen him run
on televison, asked him to visit her.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.419
Reunited with Jenny, she introduces him to
his son, named Forrest Gump, Jr. Jenny tells

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.209
Forrest she is sick with an unknown virus.

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.519
The three move back to Greenbow, Alabama.

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.060
Jenny and Forrest finally marry but she dies
a year later.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.909
The movie ends as Forrest and his son await the school bus on Forrest Jr.'s first day of school.
