00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.500
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.490
Today, I'm going to explain a thriller and
sci-fi film called "Sunshine."

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.779
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.099
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.270
By 2050, the sun's light has started to fade
due to a dark energy destabilizing the star.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.660
With the threat of extinction, the Icarus
Project was launched to reignite the sun,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.230
but the mission failed.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.940
Seven years later, another crew was sent to
restart the sun by delivering a stellar bomb,

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.720
with a mass equivalent to Manhattan Island.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.580
After sixteen months of space travel, Icarus
2, which consists of a crew of eight scientists,

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.880
arrives close to the dead zone, where radio
communications to Earth are no longer possible.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.030
Dr. Searle, the ship's psych counselor and
medical officer, asks the ship's artificial

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.850
intelligence system, Icarus, to filter down
the ship's observation room portal, so he

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.489
could see as much of the sun's brightness
without burning his eyes.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.510
Icarus tells him that the current brightness
is at two percent.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.149
He asks the computer to show him four percent,
but Icarus warns him that it will cause irreversible

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.720
damage to his retina.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.059
The computer recommends observing the sun
at 3.1 percent but only for 30 seconds.

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.380
Searle wears his sunglasses and sets the filter
to the settings recommended by the A.I.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.920
When the rays hit his eyes, he's overwhelmed
by the brightness, but when it's over, he

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.030
laughs in exhilaration.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.750
He recommends the same activity to the other
crew members, saying it's like taking a shower

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.770
in light.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.880
Kaneda, the ship's captain, tells the crew
that the solar wind reading is getting much

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.049
higher as they approach the sun, making it
more difficult to communicate with Earth.

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.470
They're flying into the dead zone seven days
earlier than anticipated, so he tells the

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.229
crew to send their final message to Earth
within the next 24 hours.

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.360
Robert Capa, the physicist responsible for
the stellar payload's delivery and detonation,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.900
enters the communications room to send a message
to his parents.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.390
He makes several attempts because he has difficulty
finding the right words.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.180
Capa reminds them that it will take eight
minutes for the sun's light to reach the Earth.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.200
They'll eventually know that the mission succeeded
when they wake up one morning and see that

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.799
the sky is a little brighter than usual.

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.310
Corazon, the ship's botanist maintaining the
oxygen garden, walks into the observation

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.960
room to report to Kaneda, who appears to be
trying Searle's recommendation.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.040
Corazon reports that they have enough oxygen
reserves to deliver their stellar payload.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.740
She senses that Kaneda is thinking of Icarus
1, so she tells him that she doesn't think

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.900
that the first mission failed due to the lack
of oxygen.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.119
Elsewhere in the ship, a fight breaks out
between Capa and Mace, the ship's engineer,

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.279
because Capa had taken too long inside the
communications room.

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:14.389
Mace is furious because the interference in
the atmosphere is preventing his message from

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:15.480
reaching Earth.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.639
Harvey, the communications specialist, and
Trey, the ship's navigator, burst into the

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.450
room to break up the fight.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.569
Mace visits Searle in his room and tells him
that he has lost track of his mind due to

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.859
the length of time they have spent on the
ship.

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.249
Searle tells Mace to spend two hours in the
Earth room so he could calm down.

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:33.900
In the Earth room, he watches the large waves
splashing against the seawall as three women

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.849
are having fun trying to stand up against
the force of the tide.

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.099
When Icarus brings him to a forest, he asks
the computer to bring back the waves because

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.650
it makes him feel peaceful.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.480
Later on, Mace approaches Capa to apologize.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.390
Meanwhile, Kaneda has begun reviewing the
video logs of Captain Pinbacker, who led Icarus

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.390
1.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.340
Pinbacker informs Moon Base that the ship
has encountered a minor asteroid storm that

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.159
caused punctures to the ship.

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.339
Pinbacker notes that the damage to their ship
was nothing serious, and they were able to

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:59.339
repair it.

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.299
The captain went on to say that he was able
to witness the asteroid hitting their ship

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.959
from the observation room.

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.669
Kaneda is puzzled when he hears Pinbacker
describe it as a beautiful event.

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:11.799
Cassie, the pilot, suddenly calls the crew's
attention to report that they've come close

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:12.919
to Mercury.

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.290
The crew members gather around the observation
room and watch in awe as the planet slowly

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.939
orbits the sun.

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:21.799
As the ship flies over Mercury, Harvey suddenly
hears a transmission that seems to be originating

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.290
from Icarus 1.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.900
Harvey discloses that it's the ship's distress
beacon.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.430
Corazon says that the crew could still be
alive because their oxygen is self-replenishing,

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.949
and their water is recycled.

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:34.480
The first team only have food that could last
for three years, but Kaneda points out that

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.409
the ship might have some survivors if others
have perished.

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.089
The ship's A.I. pinpoints the beacon's location,
revealing that they almost made it to the

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:42.089
sun.

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:45.680
They learn that they are going to pass by
the ship within 10 or 15 thousand miles.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.249
Trey informs them that he could adjust their
trajectory to fly to Icarus 1, but Mace dissuades

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:53.109
the crew, saying they need to complete their
mission to reignite the sun.

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.419
Searle agrees that there is nothing more important
than their primary goal, but he argues that

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.499
they might have more chances of succeeding
if they find Icarus 1.

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:02.540
If they fly to the ship's location, they'll
have two bombs to give them a better chance

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.930
at reactivating the sun.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.900
Mace and Trey point out that there are risks
in Searle's suggestion because they still

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.430
don't know what caused the first mission to
fail.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.239
Searle asks the crew to determine if the risk
of the detour would outweigh the benefits

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.799
of having another bomb.

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.120
Mace suggests a vote, but Kaneda tells them
that the decision should fall on the most

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.979
qualified person on the ship.

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.650
Capa is perturbed that the decision falls
on him.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.130
Capa runs the simulations to look at their
chances of succeeding, but the A.I. tells

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.129
him that there's not enough information to
make an accurate prediction.

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.220
Capa tells Kaneda that the best he can do
is make an educated guess.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.539
Capa recommends going to Icarus 1, noting
that they've already mined the last of Earth's

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.729
fissile materials to create the bomb.

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.900
If they fail, they won't be able to create
another payload.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.310
When Capa wakes up from a bad dream, Cassie
surmises that he's dreaming about the surface

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.490
of the sun.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.800
She confesses that it's the only thing she
sees when she closes her eyes.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.360
While Cassie reassures Capa about the decision
he made, they suddenly hear the alarms blare

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.699
throughout the ship.

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.650
When they get to the bridge, Trey tells them
that he made a mistake when he changed the

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.379
ship's trajectory to take the detour to Icarus
1.

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:01.490
Although coordinates were accurate, he had
forgotten to adjust the shields that protect

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.400
the ship from the sun's heat.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.720
Kaneda asks the crew to determine the extent
of the damage to the ship, but the sensors

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.960
outside are no longer working, so they have
to go out to see what was affected by the

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.990
mishap.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.340
Kaneda volunteers, but Harvey notes that it's
a two-person job.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.759
Mace insists on sending Capa out because he
thinks that the tragic error was the result

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.020
of Capa's decision to take the detour.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.699
Capa agrees to go, so he heads to the airlock
to don an E.V.A. suit.

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.979
Cassie instructs Icarus to rotate the ship
so that the damage would face away from the

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:27.979
sun.

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.370
Harvey warns them that two communications
towers will be lost if the ship turns.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.430
Mace says that the towers are of no use to
them at the moment, but Harvey points out

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.780
that they need them to go home.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.539
Cassie hints that they'll figure something
out after they complete their mission.

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:44.270
As the ship rotates, Icarus reports that comms
towers 3 and 4 have been severely damaged.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.979
Harvey tells the computer to turn off the
alarm and the sensors of the towers.

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.840
Capa and Kaneda investigate the damaged area
on the shield and finds that there are four

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.289
busted panels.

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.870
Corazon cautions Capa to calm down because
he's using his oxygen too fast.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.180
Later on, Kaneda reports that they have closed
the first panel.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.970
The team rejoices when Kaneda notifies them
that they can repair the damages.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.499
While the ship turns, a beam of light reflecting
from the burning comms tower causes a fire

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.379
on the oxygen garden.

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:11.659
With three panels to go, Kaneda is alarmed
by the ship's sudden movements.

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:14.370
Corazon soon realizes that the ship is venting
oxygen.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.550
Cassie tries to control the ship manually,
but the A.I. refuses.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.379
Icarus reports that the override protocol
to allow manual flight control has been removed

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:23.289
because the mission is in jeopardy.

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:27.919
When Cassie asks for the reason, Icarus informs
them that there's a fire in the oxygen garden.

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.280
Corazon runs to the garden as Cassie seals
the doors to prevent the fire from breaking

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.280
out.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.530
Cassie tells Capa and Kaneda to go back to
the airlock, but Kaneda refuses.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.159
He tells them that the ship will burn if the
shields are not repaired.

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:42.520
Trey points out that Kaneda and Capa will
be incinerated if they remain outside while

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.840
the ship rotates, so Cassie uses the emergency
command code to override the computer.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.870
However, the protocol requires another human
confirmation, but Mace refuses to approve

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.150
the override.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.520
When Harvey confirms the override command,
Mace tells Icarus to take back control of

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.710
the ship and asks the captain to back him
up.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.870
Kaneda agrees with Mace, reminding the crew
that their priority is to secure the payload.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.240
The captain then instructs Icarus to resume
the emergency procedure to protect the ship.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.840
Corazon tries to get into the oxygen garden
as it burns, but Icarus tells her that a superior

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.770
comms officer has sealed it.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.969
Icarus notes that there is a 60 percent chance
of failing to contain the fire and a 75 percent

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:18.930
chance of collateral damage to their life-support
systems.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.380
Mace suggests flooding the section with oxygen
to trigger a flashover and extinguish the

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.380
fire.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.150
They open the oxygen tanks, causing the room
to blow up.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.870
Kaneda tells Capa to go back inside, saying
he can finish the job on his own.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.819
Capa walks to the edge of the shield as Kaneda
continues to repair the panels.

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:37.770
Capa tells the captain to move as the ship
turns and exposes the shield to the sunlight.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.800
Moments later, Kaneda informs the team that
the final panel has been sealed.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.910
Knowing that he won't make it to the edge,
Kaneda decides to wait for the sun's powerful

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:45.949
rays to hit him.

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:50.080
Searle, curious about the sun's radiance,
repeatedly asks Kaneda what he sees as he

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.080
burns.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.680
Capa hides beneath the shield until the rotation
is completed.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.349
Trey blames himself for losing the captain,
so Searle diagnoses him as a suicide risk

00:07:57.349 --> 00:07:58.759
and sedates him.

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:02.650
Harvey assumes command of the ship and reports
that the shields and the payload are intact.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.110
He informs the crew that the garden is totally
destroyed, so they don't have enough oxygen

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.110
to deliver the payload.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:11.620
He asserts that the team has no choice but
to go to Icarus 1 to complete the mission.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.919
Corazon tells Cassie and Mace that there is
enough oxygen to get them to the delivery

00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:16.669
point, but not for seven people.

00:08:16.669 --> 00:08:19.620
She says they'll have to lose three crew members
to get them to the sun.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.889
Cassie goes to Capa's room and expresses her
fear that they're probably going to die like

00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:24.559
the crew of Icarus 1.

00:08:24.559 --> 00:08:26.469
She asks Capa if he's afraid.

00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:29.490
Capa tells her that he's not because he thinks
birthing a new star from the dying sun would

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.930
be wonderful.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:35.719
Upon reaching Icarus 1, Searle, Capa, Harvey,
and Mace enter the ship to inspect it.

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:38.419
The crew decides to split up to cover more
area.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:41.490
Harvey orders Mace to get to the flight deck
to find out if the ship can still fly.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.320
He orders Capa to go directly to the payload
and asks Searle to check the social area and

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.779
the quarters.

00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:50.060
Harvey heads to the garden and discovers that
the plants have grown splendidly.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.710
He's ecstatic that they'll have enough oxygen
for the mission.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.550
Corazon is delighted to hear about Harvey's
discovery as well.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.090
Upon reaching the bridge, Mace learns that
the ship is mostly functional, but he can't

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:00.960
get the flight computer to work.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.800
While Searle inspects the kitchen, he finds
out that the ship still has enough food.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.300
As Mace examines the equipment at the bridge,
a video log of Pinbacker suddenly appears

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.740
on one of the screens.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.420
With burn marks all over his face, Pinbacker
discloses that the crew has abandoned the

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.560
mission, believing that their attempt to reignite
the sun is foolish.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.639
Pinbacker rambles that it's not their place
to challenge God if he decides that humanity

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:20.750
should die.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.940
Mace learns that the transmission was made
six and a half years ago.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.850
Corazon notes that Icarus 1 was supposed to
be delivering the bomb by that time.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.930
Capa soon notifies the team that the payload
is fully operational.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.200
Cassie is pleased to hear the news, thinking
that they'll be able to fly Icarus 1 to the

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.200
delivery point.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.589
Mace, however, tells them that they can't
fly the ship because the mainframe coolant

00:09:38.589 --> 00:09:39.690
has failed.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.570
He further reveals that it was an act of sabotage.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:45.910
Meanwhile, Searl has found the remains of
the crew in the observation room.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.889
He concludes from the way they are positioned
that the previous team had burned themselves

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:51.290
by turning off the observation deck's filter.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.360
As he inspects the burned corpses, the airlock
connecting the two ships breaks apart.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.050
The crew members at Icarus 1 scramble to go
back to the airlock.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.389
Cassie tells them that she can hold the position
of Icarus 2, but the ship won't be able to

00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:02.570
dock again.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.910
In addition to the mishap at the airlock,
Icarus 1 is also losing atmosphere due to

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.240
a breach.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.199
Mace finds an E.V.A. suit and tells them at
least one of them will survive.

00:10:10.199 --> 00:10:13.980
He insists that Capa should wear it because
the other members are low priority.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.769
Harvey objects, saying that the ship will
need a captain to keep the mission together.

00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:21.170
Searle argues that Capa is the only one capable
of detonating the payload, so they have no

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.360
choice.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.690
Harvey orders Capa to remove the suit, hinting
that he'll help them when he returns to Icarus

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:26.690
2.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.620
However, Mace points out that they won't be
able to restore pressure when they break the

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.060
seal to the airlock.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.800
Mace soon realizes that Capa will be ejected
from Icarus 1 once they open the airlock,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.070
so he tells Cassie to move Icarus 2 as close
to their ship as possible.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.160
Mace is hoping to join Capa when he ejects
even without a suit.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.839
Corazon warns him that they'll freeze to death,
but Mace thinks that it's still worth a try.

00:10:44.839 --> 00:10:49.440
Searle reminds them that the computer's down,
so one of them has to operate the seal manually.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.810
Harvey thinks that they'll force him to stay
behind, but Searle volunteers.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:56.029
Cassie soon notifies them that the two ships
are already aligned.

00:10:56.029 --> 00:10:59.730
Mace tells Harvey to keep his eyes shut and
slowly exhale when they get outside.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.760
When Searle opens up the airlock, the three
crew members are propelled toward Icarus 2.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.500
Not long, Capa reaches the airlock of Icarus
2.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.810
When he sees Mace drift away, he grabs him
and flings him inside.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.290
Capa sees Harvey, but he has drifted too far.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:16.029
The A.I. detects the crew members inside and
seals the outer airlock door.

00:11:16.029 --> 00:11:19.620
As Harvey floats in space, he opens his eyes
in shock as he runs out of air and freezes

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.940
to death.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.430
Back in the ship, Corazon and Cassie rush
to the airlock to cover Mace with thick blankets

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:25.699
to warm him up.

00:11:25.699 --> 00:11:29.560
As Icarus 2 leaves, Searle enter's Icarus
1's observation room to watch the sun's full

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.560
brightness.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.300
He sits beside the bodies of the first team
and waits for the rays to burn through the

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.649
observation deck.

00:11:34.649 --> 00:11:38.519
Later, Mace finds out from Icarus' activity
file that there was no malfunction in the

00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:39.760
airlock hardware.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.970
They conclude that the airlock has been separated
manually but couldn't figure out who did it

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:46.200
as Corazon was with Cassie on the flight deck
while the other members were on Icarus I.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.060
Mace suspects that it was Trey, but Capa points
out that he could hardly walk due to the medication

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.210
Searle gave him, and he sleeps 23 hours a
day.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.240
Corazon notes that there is another issue
they have to deal with aside from the disaster

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.470
at the airlock.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:01.200
She points out that they lost two people consuming
oxygen when Searle and Harvey died.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.470
If Trey dies, they will have enough oxygen
to make it to the delivery point.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.410
Repulsed by the idea, Capa hints that what
happened at Icarus 1 is now happening on their

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.410
ship.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.639
Mace volunteers to kill Trey, but he says
he will not do it unless they vote unanimously.

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:16.790
Capa and Corazon vote to eliminate Trey, but
Cassie refuses.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.800
Mace apologizes to Cassie, hinting that he'll
go ahead and kill Trey despite her vote.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.010
Cassie asks him to make it easy for Trey.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.490
Mace grabs a surgical knife and goes to Trey's
pod but finds out that he's not there.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:30.569
He checks another room and discovers Trey
on the floor with a deep cut on his wrist.

00:12:30.569 --> 00:12:33.670
Mace blames Capa for all the deaths in the
ship, saying no one would've died if they

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.220
didn't divert the mission.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.300
He dips his hand on Trey's blood and wipes
it on Capa's hand.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.899
Capa gets furious and slams Mace against the
wall.

00:12:40.899 --> 00:12:45.170
After struggling for a few moments, the two
men run out of breath, so they stop fighting.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.720
Corazon tells them that they need to limit
their exertions because the air is low.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.810
Later on, Capa tells Icarus to run the biometric
signs of the crew members and check oxygen

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:53.970
consumption.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.010
Icarus discloses that they don't have enough
oxygen to deliver the payload because they

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:01.220
will die in 16 hours, and it will take 19
hours till they get to the delivery point.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.660
He points out to the A.I. that Corazon was
certain they have enough oxygen for four crew

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.660
members.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.850
The computer, however, reveals that there
are five people on board the ship.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.490
Icarus can't identify the fifth person, but
it points out that the unknown crew member

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.540
is in the observation room.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.990
When Capa reaches the observation room, he
sees a man with severe burns all over his

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.990
body.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.320
Capa recalls the last video log he saw from
Icarus 1 and realizes that he's Pinbacker.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.199
As Capa stares at him in horror, Pinbacker
slashes him on the chest with a knife.

00:13:27.199 --> 00:13:30.680
Capa runs out of the room and shuts down the
filter of the observation deck.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.410
He calls out to other crew members, but no
one answers.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.890
Pinbacker runs after Capa, so he locks himself
into the inner airlock.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:40.110
Pinbacker pulls a lever on the door to keep
Capa locked inside.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:43.730
Pinbacker then goes to the mainframe room
to remove the computer panels from the coolant.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.600
Meanwhile, Corazon visits the garden and sees
a tiny plant growing.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.910
Corazon becomes more hopeful about their mission
and tells Icarus to patch her to Mace.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.560
However, Pinbacker quietly approaches her
and stabs her in the back.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.329
Mace soon notices that Icarus is no longer
responding.

00:13:57.329 --> 00:14:00.240
Cassie wakes up in her room and senses that
someone is with her.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.399
When she sees Pinbacker at the other end of
the hall, she runs to the front of the ship

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:04.459
and hides.

00:14:04.459 --> 00:14:07.970
Mace turns on the monitors and sees Capa in
the inner airlock, so he instructs Capa to

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.490
use the communications link in the E.V.A.
helmet.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.079
Capa tells him that Pinbacker is on board
to sabotage their mission.

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:17.279
When Mace arrives at the mainframe room, he
discovers that the computers have been removed

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:18.279
from the coolant.

00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:21.880
He tries to lower the mainframe, but he discovers
that the mechanism is disabled.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.839
Mace decides to dive into the coolant so he
can pull the mainframe down manually.

00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:29.600
Mace manages to lower the first mainframe,
causing the lights to turn back on.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.910
While looking for Cassie, Pinbacker is agitated
by the light and punches his hand through

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:34.120
a glass wall.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.569
When he grabs Trey's corpse, Cassie stabs
him.

00:14:36.569 --> 00:14:39.130
Cassie runs away as Pinbacker screams in pain.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.330
Mace drops another mainframe, but he starts
to shiver due to the low temperature of the

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.770
liquid coolant.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.680
Cassie ends up in the payload room while running
from Pinbacker.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.480
Mace prompts Capa to break the ship out of
orbit manually by separating the payload.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.810
He then tells Capa that he has to open the
airlock and detonate the bomb.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.069
As he lowers the third mainframe, his leg
gets caught in the mechanism.

00:14:57.069 --> 00:14:59.899
Mace struggles to get out, but he freezes
to death.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:03.339
Capa wears an E.V.A. suit and burns the inner
door to escape the airlock.

00:15:03.339 --> 00:15:06.569
After releasing the door of the outer airlock,
he holds on tight to the metal bars as loose

00:15:06.569 --> 00:15:09.620
parts of the ship fly out, along with Corazon's
body.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.290
When he reaches the mainframe room, he finds
Mace lying frozen on the ground.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.700
He proceeds to detach the payload from the
ship and make his way to the airlock.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.200
He trips on his way out and struggles to get
up due to the weight of the E.V.A. suit, but

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.259
he eventually manages to propel himself to
the bomb as it separates from the ship.

00:15:24.259 --> 00:15:27.649
When he reaches the bomb, the propulsion sets
Icarus 2 ablaze.

00:15:27.649 --> 00:15:31.290
Inside the payload, he takes off his E.V.A.
suit and unlocks the door to the payload unit

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.550
to pilot the bomb into the sun manually.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.790
When he sees Cassie, he asks her if Pinbacker
is with them.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.029
Pinbacker suddenly grabs Capa by the neck,
telling him that God asked him to take all

00:15:40.029 --> 00:15:41.579
of humanity to heaven.

00:15:41.579 --> 00:15:44.930
As the two struggle, Cassie attacks Pinbacker,
ripping the skin off his hands.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:49.310
After breaking free from Pinbacker's grip,
Cassie and Capa slide across the payload.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:52.629
Cassie tells Capa to finish the mission, so
he runs to the payload's control room and

00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:54.220
ignites the bomb manually.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.200
Capa watches the payload begin to light up
as it enters the surface of the sun.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.030
As the flames burst into the room, Capa reaches
out to the fire and accepts his death, knowing

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.220
that he had succeeded in his mission.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.759
Back on Earth, Capa's sister watches his last
transmission, where he asks her to kiss her

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:09.010
kids for him.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.930
She and her children watch the sun's rays
pierce through the clouds and shine across

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:19.629
the frozen Sydney Harbour.
