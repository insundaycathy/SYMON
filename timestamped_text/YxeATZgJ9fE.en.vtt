00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.240
henry enters jimmy's apartment and his lab and&nbsp;
sees a video of jimmy working with akan to create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.920
his cyborg army from the remains of deceased men&nbsp;
when the experiment went wrong akan crippled jimmy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.280
by shattering his spine the original crippled&nbsp;
jimmy rolls in and shows off his several clones to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.880
henry through a rehearsed dance routine punk jimmy&nbsp;
then accuses henry of being a traitor because he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.960
is involuntarily broadcasting his whereabouts to&nbsp;
akan original jimmy decides to trust henry and&nbsp;&nbsp;

to join the colonel as he drops himself down with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.200
a grenade henry meet with colonel they shoot and&nbsp;
blow up some mercenaries killing them one after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.080
the other round the building as they try to leave&nbsp;
with the real jimmy and one of the clone yuri and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.720
his mercenaries arrive but colonel kills them by&nbsp;
blowing up the ceiling and bringing it down on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.480
them they drive to akan's facility where they get&nbsp;
attacked by some of akan cyborgs jimmy has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.840
hit with a shard in his jugular knowing he's dying&nbsp;
he tells henry that he had seen him originally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.280
before he had woken up and noticed a memory block&nbsp;
in his head and had it left in there but he knows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.000
that some of his memories are returning the&nbsp;
colonel dies but before the real jimmy dies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.960
he says it's good to have had henry as a friend&nbsp;
and ask him to make sure he looks into akans eyes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.640
as he kills him henry makes it to a room it is&nbsp;
revealed that akan has his cyborgs ready to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.320
he also reveals to henry that all of them woke up&nbsp;
the same way henry did with estelle claiming to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:12.000
their wife and acting as though she loved them&nbsp;
including henry akan unleashes the cyborgs upon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
henry he proceeds to kill them in every which way&nbsp;
imaginable shooting stabbing grenades heads blown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.640
off sliced off eyes gouged out etc henry makes it&nbsp;
to the roof to face akan but he is taken down by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:31.120
akans powers and even harder when estelle shows up&nbsp;
clearly on akan's side akan taunts henry as he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.400
down and knocks him to the side where he faces&nbsp;
some glass and we get a vague look at henry's face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.240
which is similar to that of his father's&nbsp;
we see the childhood flashback again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.680
henry's father says his own father used to call&nbsp;
him a pussy and he feels he proved him right by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.400
killing the wrong people but he gows to call&nbsp;
henry by his own name and tells him to fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.840
back in the present henry grabs to adrenaline&nbsp;
needles and continues killing the rest of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:02.160
cyborgs he ties barbed wire around his hand and&nbsp;
manages to get close enough to akan to hurt him he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:08.640
splits akan's hand apart painfully akan uses his&nbsp;
powers to lift henry up but henry gets close again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:14.240
and pulls out his own eye stalk to wrap it around&nbsp;
akan's head and sever the top half off estelle is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.120
in the chopper about to leave where henry boards&nbsp;
the chopper and shows off akans head to estelle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.120
she furiously shoots at henry&nbsp;
until he holds his hand up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.000
causing the bullet to ricochet and strike her&nbsp;
estelle stumbles out of the chopper and hangs on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.120
she pleads with henry to listen to his heart&nbsp;
apparently his heart told him to close the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:38.000
door on her fingers and let her plummet to the&nbsp;
ground below thanks for watching please don't&nbsp;&nbsp;
