00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.040
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.230
Today I will show you an action, horror, sci-fi
film from 2000, titled Hollow Man.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.300
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.490
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.910
A rat is released in a lab and gets locked
in a cage.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.529
It smells for food, when an invisible force
catches it and eats it.

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.600
Sebastian is working on his computer on a
chemical formula and runs a simulation that

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.600
fails.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.800
He spies on his neighbor taking her clothes
off and is disappointed when she closes the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.849
curtains.

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.670
Moments later, he gets an idea and reworks
the chemical formula, running another simulation.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.780
This time it shows the element as stable.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.520
Sebastian calls Linda to tell her about the
solution.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.750
When he sees the man sleeping in her bed,
she tells him that it's not his business anymore.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.890
He shows Linda that he cracked the chemical
solution for reversion.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.640
She's impressed that he was able to solve
it out of the blue.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.360
Linda wakes Matt up to tell him that they
need to go to the lab.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.829
She tells him they should take their own cars,
but Matt thinks she needs to tell Sebastian

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.559
about them at the right time.

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.120
That morning, Sebastian arrives at the lab
in a heavily guarded compound.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.850
He scans his fingerprint to get into an elevator
and says his password.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.689
Inside the lab, the invisible animals can
only be seen through thermal imaging.

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.050
Matt pets an orangutan and says hello to a
gorilla named Isabel.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.620
All the animals freak out when she jumps at
the cage.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.630
He puts on thermal goggles to see her with
and calms the animal down.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.680
When he goes inside to sedate her, she bites
him, then runs away.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.110
Matt chasses her through the lab and runs
into Sebastian, telling him that she's been

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.570
more aggressive.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.030
Isabel has been invisible for too long so
it's starting to affect her brain.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.780
Sebastian takes a tranquilizer gun and bets
Matt on who will get to her first.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.260
They find and corner her.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.750
Sebastian tranquilizes her.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.909
Sarah storms toward them and argues with Sebastian
about injecting Isabel with the serum before

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:37.990
it's tested.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.799
She thinks it's unethical, but he thinks it
will save time.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.400
He overrules her objections.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.950
Linda joins them and reminds Sebastian that
he hired Sarah because she's the best vet

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.000
in the country.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.020
Later, Linda is prepping the serum and tells
Sebastian that she'll be ready soon.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.920
Sarah informs him that the gorilla is doing
well and Carter walks in, saying that he's

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.630
just the medical stand by.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.700
Frank calls in from tech and tells them that
they're ready also.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.910
Linda locks the serum into an injection gun
and Matt gets it ready.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.670
Sarah looks for a vein in Isabel's arm and
when she finds it, Sebastian takes the gun

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.869
from Matt, saying that he will do it.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.310
He injects her and the serum visibly moves
through her veins and body.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.900
Her heartbeat is elevated.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.150
The gorilla's body begins to show up and they're
happy that it's working.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.930
Suddenly, she starts to get worse and she
goes into cardiac arrest.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.850
Isabel's heart stops so Linda shocks her with
a defibrillator.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.349
She keeps doing it a few times until her heart
starts pumping again.

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.230
When Isabel begins stabilizing, her body continues
to become visible.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.650
Tech informs them that her quantum signatures
have become stable.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.269
Everyone rejoices that they did it.

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.140
Sarah thinks that she's going to be ok.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.209
Later, they all take her back to her cell
together.

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.580
Sebastian tells Sarah to get her ready for
a vivisection on Monday and when she gets

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.550
incredibly angry, Matt convinces her that
he's joking.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.750
And he is.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.750
Sort of.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.730
Linda jumps in and suggests they go to celebrate
their success.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.470
They celebrate in a restaurant.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.000
Then Linda and Sebastian have a heart to heart,
with him wanting to get back together with

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
her.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
She rejects him.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.239
He goes back to the lab and checks on Isabel.

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.470
There's an invisible dog there too, which
he pets and asks what it's like being invisible.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.120
Some time later, Sebastian presents their
findings to a Pentagon committee.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.100
Dr. Kramer asks Sebastian how they solved
the problem of reversion and he lies saying

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.050
that they haven't, to Linda's and Matt's surprise.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.019
Kramer says that they need to see results
soon and if they can't make it work he'll

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.870
find someone to replace him.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.950
Linda and Matt are pissed at him, but Sebastian
explains that if they reported their findings,

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.740
the Pentagon would have taken over their project
completely.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.470
His idea for their next step is to jump into
human trials themselves, without authorization.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.629
Sebastian tells them that this is their chance
to change the world and get the Nobel prize.

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.190
Matt worries that they'll get in trouble.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.940
Later, they inform the team about the plan
and none of them likes it.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.879
Sebastian tries to convince them, but Sarah
can't believe the committee approved it.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.030
Sebastian doesn't care what they think though
and tells them that they'll be going through

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.180
it regardless.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.080
The day of the procedure, Matt tells Sebastian
that he could change his mind, but he just

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.280
makes fun of him.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.080
They walk inside and Sebastian gets on the
bed, then they connect him to an IV drip and

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.160
restrain him.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.879
He says he feels a little tense and his heart
rate is elevated because of that.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.430
Frank and Janice argue over who'll get his
Porsche if he dies.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.040
They irradiate the serum and bring it over
to Sebastian, who wants to inject it himself,

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.700
saying that if anything goes wrong the others
can't be blamed.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.440
He injects the serum and Linda calls the moment.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.959
Everyone starts freaking out that they don't
see anything happening to his body immediately.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.690
Suddenly, Sebastian begins feeling something.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.470
He begins to convulse and the process of becoming
invisible starts in patches all over his body.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.220
Sebastian says that it hurts much more than
he expected.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.570
Frank tells them that he's on the verge of
a seizure.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.150
As he becomes invisible, his vital signs become
even more erratic.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.590
They get the defibrillator ready and Frank
tells them that he's beginning to shift, so

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.530
Matt tells them to hold off with the paddles.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.639
They all watch him change as his vital signs
stabilize.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.930
When he becomes completely invisible, Frank
is the one that calls the moment when the

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.410
phase shift occurred.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.620
Matt says that he's ok, but that he's in shock
because of the trauma.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.580
17 hours later, Sebastian wakes up and screams
in pain, asking Linda and Matt to turn off

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.580
the lights.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.210
He says he can't close his eyes and Linda
tells him that he can, but that his eyelids

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.460
are transparent.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.930
Sebastian gets up and goes to the mirror,
then the three of them move to the general

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.270
area of the lab.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.120
He immediately starts messing with everyone,
until Frank gets a pair of goggles and sees

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.120
him with them.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.780
Matt and Linda take him back to his room and
turn on the observation monitor, while Sarah

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.710
is doing the same in the other room.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.740
She will be the one to take the first shift
and Carter will take the next one.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.480
Sarah gets the last monitor and turns off
the lights.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.580
Very soon, she falls asleep and Sebastian
walks through the lab and gets into the observation

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.580
room.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.210
He begins to touch her while she sleeps.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.009
Sarah wakes up and asks if he's in there,
then checks the monitors, but as soon as she

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:38.050
turns around he gets back into bed.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.480
The next day she tells Linda about it, but
she's not sure if it actually happened and

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.840
feels horrible.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.510
Linda doesn't know what to do either and Matt
wants to talk to him, though Sarah tells him

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.510
not to.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.250
Later, he's checking Sebastian's vitals and
he questions him as if it's procedure.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.380
The results show that everything is normal.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.940
Sarah takes off the medical device from him
and he manages to make her feel even more

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:57.940
uncomfortable.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.530
Frank and Janice get into the lab and she
goes to the toilet, but she feels like someone

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.210
is watching her, so she puts on the thermal
goggles to be able to pee.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.569
She even tells the same to Carter after lunch.

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:11.290
The team talks about Sebastian and the things
he might do now that he's invisible.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.479
It seems that all of them agree that he won't
be up to anything good.

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:18.160
As soon as they leave the kitchen, a chair
that appeared to be empty turns around.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160
He was listening to them all along.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.389
That night, it's Linda's shift in the lab.

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.229
She is working on the serum, when Sebastian
begins to mess with her too, moving her coke

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:27.580
can around the lab.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.930
He begins to give her a massage and asks her
if she wants to find out what it would be

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.430
like to make love with an invisible man on
his last night in that state.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.750
She refuses his advances.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.960
The next day, Matt and Carter prepare the
serum to phase him back and Linda sprays his

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.759
arm so they can see his veins.

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:45.650
They inject him with the serum and it shows
up, like it did with Isabel before.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.250
The moment in which more of his organs begin
appearing, he says that something isn't right

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.699
and begins to choke.

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:52.289
His vitals became erratic.

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:56.150
Sarah realizes that his lungs are seized and
tells Carter to intubate him.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.490
Sebastian breaks through his restraints, so
the men hold him down.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.349
He pushes Carter off with incredible force
and kicks Matt off of himself, getting up

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:07.039
and looking disoriented as his flesh begins
appearing and disappearing again.

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:11.830
Sarah and Linda intubate him before he becomes
invisible again and Matt compresses his heart.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.080
They get a pulse, but he goes into shock as
he disappears again.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.680
Sebastian wakes up later with Linda by his
side.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.430
She tells him that he almost died.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.010
He says that the committee don't need to know
what happened yet.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.960
Because he's going to be stuck in that state
for a while, they make him a synthetic mask.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.000
Linda cuts a slit for the mouth and two holes
for his eyes while the mask is still on him.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.380
Matt brings him a mirror so he can see himself.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.729
Now they need to figure out what went wrong.

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:38.710
Linda and Matt work from home and can't figure
out the formula for the reversion serum.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.390
He says that he's not a genius like Sebastian,
able to jump to the right conclusion.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.830
10 days later, Sebastian is getting physically
and psychologically sick from all the testing

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.250
they have been doing on him.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.120
He argues with Matt about it, then Linda comforts
him.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.949
Sebastian says that what they're doing for
him is not enough.

00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:57.870
That night, he can't stand being there anymore,
so he decides to leave.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.360
He tells Carter, but he can't let him leave
because the rules forbid it.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.009
Sebastian says that it's his rule and he can
change it.

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:06.800
He leaves and tells him he'll be back in a
couple of hours.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.419
Carter calls Linda to tell her.

00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:12.470
Sebastian dodges the police guard outside,
who's begun to worry that his car hasn't moved

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.910
in a while, and drives out of the compound.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.200
He stops at a light and scares the heck out
of a couple of kids.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.229
Linda and Matt leave their apartment to go
back to the lab and she tells him that he

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:22.379
could be anywhere.

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:26.270
Sebastian walks into his apartment and grabs
a few of his stuff to bring back to the lab,

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.610
then he sees his neighbor undressing again.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.150
Moments later, his neighbor is taking a shower
and her doorbell rings.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.539
She sees no one in the hallway, but it rings
again so she opens the door and goes outside,

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.930
leaving ample room for Sebastian to come inside.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:41.050
He follows her to her room and looks at her.

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.530
He begins moving her mirror, scaring her.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.500
Sebastian grabs her and rapes her.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.060
Meanwhile, Linda is looking for him in his
apartment.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:52.160
The door is unlocked, so she goes inside and
sees he's left his mask there.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.860
Sebastian leaves his neighbor crying and sees
that Linda is in his apartment.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.459
Back at the lab, everyone is getting ready
to find him.

00:08:58.459 --> 00:09:01.830
They pass equipment around and talk about
the fact that no one outside of them can find

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.100
out what he is.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.589
Suddenly, Sebastian arrives and tells them
that he just went to his apartment to pick

00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:08.000
up some stuff.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.420
Linda confronts him, telling him what she
saw in his apartment and Matt asks him why

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.000
he had to go in public.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.880
Sebastian says that he's still the project
leader and it's his decision to make.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.500
Linda threatens him that she'll report him
to the committee if he leaves the lab again.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.770
When everyone leaves, Sarah finds out from
Linda that the committee doesn't know about

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.730
what they've done, but promises to stay quiet.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.740
Linda and Matt wonder if Sebastian's invisibility
has started affecting his mind.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.529
The next day, Carter is performing tests on
Sebastian and they talk about what he did

00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:35.970
the night when he was out.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.601
Sebastian doesn't quite tell him what he did,
but spins things around just so that he can

00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:41.350
get a positive reaction from Carter.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.840
That night, Linda is sleeping and Sebastian
pulls her covers away and begins to undress

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.840
her.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.820
Suddenly, her phone rings and she wakes up
from the nightmare.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.000
Matt tells her that he thinks he's found the
solution.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.190
Next, they're seen in the lab explaining it
to Sebastian and the rest of the team.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:00.630
They run a simulation and it gets only to
95% before it starts breaking down, which

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.630
sends Sebastian into a rage spiral and he
leaves.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.980
Linda goes after him and confronts him about
his treatment of Matt, saying that he's trying

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.090
to fix him.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.910
Sebastian says that he has a gift which he
can't even use and if she wasn't so short

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.710
sighted she'd let him explore it.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.570
Later, he gets an idea about the security
camera and tells Frank that he'll be in the

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:18.570
lab.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.720
He gets a few tools and rigs the camera to
make it look like he's there.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.550
After that, he goes to Linda's apartment and
spies on her.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.250
Matt walks into her apartment, which makes
Sebastian angry, so when they go to the other

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.830
room to make love, he breaks the window.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.779
Matt doesn't see anything, so Linda calls
the lab to check if Sebastian's there.

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:36.580
Frank sees him on the rigged camera.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.570
Back in the lab, Sebastian is steaming mad
about Linda.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.730
The dog keeps barking which makes it even
worse, so he goes to its cage and kills it

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:44.730
brutally.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.040
Sarah finds the dog the next day.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.209
She immediately confronts Sebastian about
it and gets nowhere with him.

00:10:49.209 --> 00:10:52.600
They check the security camera and it shows
him in bed all night.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.160
Later, Linda is in her room and she thinks
that Sebastian is there.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.200
She says that he's not being funny and throws
a blanket over the place she thinks he's standing.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.390
Scared, she runs out of her apartment and
into her car.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.940
Linda drives to the lab.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.360
Matt tells her that Sebastian is asleep as
it's seen on the monitor, but she goes to

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.060
check his room nevertheless.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.760
She realizes that he's gone and figures out
he did something to the camera.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.589
Linda calls everyone back in the lab.

00:11:15.589 --> 00:11:17.120
Sebastian is outside.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.210
Janice asks if they will go after him, but
Linda thinks they should go to the committee.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:24.500
Matt says that he's been going out night after
night and they have no idea what he's been

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.600
doing.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.540
Linda tells the rest that her and Matt will
take full responsibility in front of the committee.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.209
Sebastian is there, listening to what they're
saying.

00:11:32.209 --> 00:11:35.890
As the two of them are leaving, Matt says
that they'll brief the team the next day.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.030
Later, they're at Kramer's house and Sebastian
spies at them from outside.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:44.329
Kramer says he'll call all the necessary people,
as he sends Linda and Matt out the door, telling

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:46.060
them to pack up their stuff.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.910
Kramer goes to make the call, but his phone
line is down.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.050
He hears the door and goes into the yard.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.589
Sebastian appears in the smoke from his pipe,
than pushes him in the pool and drowns him

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:55.589
viciously.

00:11:55.589 --> 00:11:59.200
Sebastian comes out of the pool before Kramer's
wife comes down to check on him.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.880
The next day, Linda comes back to the lab
and Sebastian scares her.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.890
He says it's going to be a busy day.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:08.350
Matt tells her that he got back at 3 a.m.
and has been wandering through the lab ever

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.350
since.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.600
Kramer hasn't called them back, so Linda calls
him.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.660
His wife tells her that he drowned.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.690
Linda tries to call one of the generals, but
the line drops.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.100
Matt checks the phone and finds out that they
have no outside line so they go to inform

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.100
security.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.260
When they walk inside the elevator, it doesn't
accept their passwords.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.780
They come back and tell the others.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.620
Frank checks the security system, while Matt
says that it could take a couple of days for

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.200
someone to find them there.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.850
Frank figures out that there's nothing wrong
with the system, but that Sebastian has removed

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.230
all of their access.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:40.440
They grab their goggles and leave, except
for Janice who forgets hers and comes back.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.290
When she walks outside the door, Sebastian
kills her.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.310
The others look for him in his room.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.440
Linda asks him to tell them where he is.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.890
Sebastian tells her that he can't let them
turn him in because he enjoys his power too

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:51.890
much.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.760
He also tells them that Kramer died before
he could tell anyone.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.730
Linda notices that Janice isn't there, so
they run to find her.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.640
They discover her body in a locker.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.060
Carter thinks that Sebastian has snapped,
but Matt thinks that he planned everything

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.080
out because he knew they would turn him in.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.200
Sarah slaps Linda, yelling that she could've
stopped the experiment at any point.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.550
Frank agrees with her.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.839
Carter just wants to know what they should
do.

00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:14.810
Linda says they're not going to wait around.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.120
The team powers up the motion detectors and
sees him on the monitor.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.870
Matt and Carter go to find him and the rest
watch their backs.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.880
The two split up, when Frank and Sarah come
back.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.730
Linda looses him on the monitors and Matt
almost shoots Carter.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:31.010
They think they see him and Matt goes to take
him down, but it turns out just to be a vent.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.410
Sebastian grabs Carter and when Matt turns
around he begins to shoot, hitting one of

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.410
the pipes.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.880
Sebastian can be seen because of the vapor,
so he shoots him again.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.230
He drops Carter and hurts him really bad.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.810
Linda tells Matt that Sebastian is there so
he shoots the pipes again and is able to see

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.970
him, but Sebastian escapes and locks Matt
in the tunnel.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:51.730
However, he remained on Matt's side of the
door, he just can't see him because he's raised

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.820
the heat and rendered the goggles useless.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.660
Linda goes out to help Matt and tells the
rest to get Carter.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.860
Matt tries another approach to see him and
they argue about Linda, then Matt hits him.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:04.140
Just as Sebastian manages to knock him down,
Linda saves him.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.730
Meanwhile, Sarah and Frank find Carter.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:10.850
She leaves Frank there to apply pressure to
his wound until she gets blood for a transfusion.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.020
Sarah takes packets of blood from the lab,
when she hears Sebastian come inside.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.680
She pours the blood on the ground to see him
and waits a bit.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.570
When he doesn't show up, she grabs the last
remaining pack and goes to the other door,

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.910
when he grabs her from the other side of the
room.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.600
She opens the pack and pours it on him, but
he still gets the upper hand and shoots her

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.660
with the tranquilizer gun, then he breaks
her neck.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:34.100
Simultaneously, Linda and Matt find Frank
just as Carter dies.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.690
They go back to the lab.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:36.920
Linda finds Sarah.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.589
Then Sebastian kills Frank when he has his
back turned.

00:14:39.589 --> 00:14:42.199
He wounds Matt too and locks them in the freezer.

00:14:42.199 --> 00:14:44.480
Linda uses duct tape to close Matt's wound.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.920
In the meantime, Sebastian is getting ready
to finally escape.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.070
Matt looses consciousness and Linda tries
to break out of the freezer.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.360
She gets an idea about how she can do that.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.790
In the meantime, Sebastian is getting what
he'll need to blow up the lab.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.870
He mixes a concoction and throws it like a
grenade to check it.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:03.290
Linda creates a magnet with the defibrillator
and opens the door by pulling out the lever

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.400
with the magnet.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.829
She gets Matt outside and lights a fire to
warm him up.

00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:09.740
Before she leaves, Linda takes a gas tank.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.769
Simultaneously, Sebastian makes a bomb by
putting the concoction into a lab device set

00:15:13.769 --> 00:15:15.230
for 5 minutes.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.010
When he walks in the elevator, Linda catches
up to him and sets him on fire.

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:23.399
She continues doing it, as he tries to take
his clothes of before they fuse with his skin.

00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:26.100
Linda looses gas in the tank and Sebastian
escapes.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.240
Then she activates the sprinkler system.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.149
He sneaks up on her and beats her, trying
to kill her.

00:15:31.149 --> 00:15:33.449
Suddenly, Matt appears and knocks him out.

00:15:33.449 --> 00:15:38.380
Sebastian is still alive though and he attacks
them again, but electrocutes himself by mistake.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.519
His body starts showing up for a moment.

00:15:40.519 --> 00:15:43.860
They find the bomb, so they run and get inside
the elevator shaft.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.709
Matt goes first and Linda follows.

00:15:45.709 --> 00:15:48.699
The bomb explodes and sends the elevator shooting
up the shaft.

00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:52.639
They hide in time, but it comes back down,
stopping just on top of them.

00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:56.509
They continue to climb, when Sebastian grabs
Linda and as they struggle they fall back

00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:58.860
on the elevator, sending it back down.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.610
Her and Sebastian struggle and when he kisses
her, she grabs onto the cable and releases

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:03.649
the elevator.

00:16:03.649 --> 00:16:06.610
Sebastian falls into the fire and Linda climbs
up to Matt.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:11.769
The two of them walk out of the lab alive.
