00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.480
Hi, Movie Recaps here. Today I&nbsp;
will show you a drama, horror,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.880
mystery film from 2017, titled Flatliners.&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.160
The movie begins with Courtney Holmes driving&nbsp;
her car together with her sister Tessa. The girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.640
are having a relaxing time together, but tragedy&nbsp;
occurs when Courtney gets distracted by her phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.880
and crashes the car against the road railing,&nbsp;
causing it to fall into the river. Nine years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.120
later, Courtney is a medical student doing her&nbsp;
rounds at the hospital. When checking on a patient&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.040
that almost died earlier that day, Courtney asks&nbsp;
her if she remembered anything from the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.760
her heart stopped, making the patient ask her in&nbsp;
return if she's lost someone. Ray and Marlo, who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.080
are medical students too, are also working at the&nbsp;
hospital and showing some sort of rivalry while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.560
looking after a patient. Later in the evening,&nbsp;
Courtney goes to the library to do some research&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.200
about the afterlife. Her reading is interrupted&nbsp;
when she hears her classmate Sophia Manning crying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.000
at a table nearby. Courtney decides to go check on&nbsp;
her and learns Sophia is under a lot of stress and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.320
pressure from her mom and how difficult medical&nbsp;
school is. They leave the library together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.080
and Courtney invites her to share a little&nbsp;
side project she's working on, to which Sophia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.040
answers with a maybe. The next day, Courtney,&nbsp;
Sophia, Marlo, Ray, and their friend Jamie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.600
are in class getting scolded by their teacher for&nbsp;
not answering quickly and well enough. Afterward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.440
Sophia works at a doctor's event with Jamie,&nbsp;
who doesn't need it because he's trust-funded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.920
but goes anyway to chase after a caterer. Sophia&nbsp;
sends a message to her mother to show her where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.680
she is and admits her mother has moved in&nbsp;
with her just to keep tabs on her daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.600
After doing more rounds in the hospital, Courtney&nbsp;
invites Jamie to have fun with her later at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.480
hospital's basement, which Jamie misunderstands&nbsp;
as innuendo. When he accepts, she asks him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.720
take the service elevator because there are no&nbsp;
cameras there. Later at night, both Sophia and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.800
Jamie join Courtney at the hospital's basement&nbsp;
as she requested, there's a whole functional&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.960
clinic there in case of emergencies. Courtney&nbsp;
explains to them what her project is about:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.200
she's been searching for the region of the brain&nbsp;
that is responsible for near-death experiences,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.840
so she wants to map the process the same way they&nbsp;
map a seizure. In order to do that, she wants her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.360
friends to stop her heart while she's in the&nbsp;
image scanner, then bring her back after one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.080
minute. Sophia doesn't want anything to do with&nbsp;
it, but Jamie accepts. He stops Courtney's heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.560
with a combination of drugs and the defibrillator,&nbsp;
effectively killing her. While Sophia and Jamie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.880
keep an eye on the scanner and make sure it's&nbsp;
recording, Courtney has an out-of-body experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.120
She sees everyone inside the hospital and then&nbsp;
the roof before going around the whole city.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.360
When the minute passes, Sophia and Jamie start&nbsp;
the resuscitating process, but they aren't able&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.000
to bring her back. Sophia pages Ray asking for&nbsp;
help, and he rushes out of his office when he sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.480
the message, so Marlo sees him leave. Courtney&nbsp;
continues her journey, now she sees the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.040
she is in explode before appearing at a bridge&nbsp;
filled with glowing lights. This vision ends,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.440
however, when her friends finally manage to bring&nbsp;
her back with the help of Ray's smart guidance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.400
As Sophia calls Courtney crazy, Marlo arrives and&nbsp;
demands to know what's going on. Moments later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.640
the five of them go to Courtney's place, where she&nbsp;
tells them what the experience was like; she calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.960
it pure energy. Together they watch the scanner&nbsp;
recordings and notice bolts of lighting appearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.440
on different areas of the brain. Ray decides&nbsp;
to leave because he thinks this idea was crazy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.000
and Courtney spends ten minutes on the balcony,&nbsp;
just watching the city. When Marlo checks on her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.720
Courtney says she wants to bake. The next morning,&nbsp;
all the bread Courtney baked is brought to class.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.200
Marlo says she made six loaves when she remembered&nbsp;
her grandmother's recipe, she also says Courtney&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.440
ran twelve miles. When their teacher starts going&nbsp;
through the cases, Courtney has the right answers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.520
for all of them as soon as Sophia finishes&nbsp;
describe them, she even uses rare knowledge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.840
she read in a book a couple of years ago. In&nbsp;
the evening, when the five of them go to a bar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.760
Courtney plays the piano after twelve years of&nbsp;
not touching one. Her friends are impressed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.080
the way she can access everything she's ever&nbsp;
learned, calling it rewiring of the brain. Ray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.120
still thinks these experiments are a bad idea, but&nbsp;
Jamie is excited and decides to go next. Later at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.280
her apartment, Courtney thinks she hears a noise&nbsp;
in the shower, so she moves the curtains to check.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.040
There's nothing there, so she leaves the bathroom&nbsp;
after making sure the curtains are left open,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.120
but returns when she hears the noise again. She&nbsp;
finds one of the curtains has fallen in the tub,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.440
which is now full of water, and she's startled&nbsp;
by a face suddenly appearing in it. Screaming,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.680
she falls to the floor, only to discover that she&nbsp;
imagined the whole thing when she stands up again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.160
and sees the curtains and bathtub in the same&nbsp;
condition she left them in. The group, including&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.880
a still skeptical Ray, goes ahead and helps Jamie&nbsp;
flatline next. His vision puts him on a bike on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.120
the highway; the ride is exciting and enjoyable,&nbsp;
especially when a blonde woman named Alicia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.280
appears behind him on the bike. But eventually&nbsp;
they make it to a dark neighborhood where Alicia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.360
disappears as she whispers his name and Jamie&nbsp;
is brought back to life by his friends. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.680
confirming he's fine, the group goes to Courtney's&nbsp;
place to drink and party, even accepting to break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.760
one of the apartment's walls when Courtney offers&nbsp;
the idea. She and Jamie seem to be on the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.920
wavelength, they share a kiss and have a snow&nbsp;
fight in their underwear when it starts to hail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.320
Ray still isn't interested in flatlining, but&nbsp;
Marlo decides she'll be going next. While talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.280
about their experiences, Courtney asks Jamie if he&nbsp;
saw anything disturbing, to which he answers no.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.600
The next day at the hospital, Jamie makes a&nbsp;
series of decisions that saves patients' lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.200
Marlo points out the differences between him&nbsp;
and Courtney: while she's focused on the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.680
bringing back old information, Jamie is focused&nbsp;
on the present, using his intuition; and Marlo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.000
can't see what those two things have in common.&nbsp;
After everyone goes back to work, Jamie sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.920
Alicia standing in the middle of the street, but&nbsp;
she's gone after he's distracted by a nurse, who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.400
Jamie thought had asked about an abortion. Later&nbsp;
that night, Sophia tries to leave her apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.800
but her mother doesn't let her, making her stay&nbsp;
and study with her. The group goes on without her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.280
and this time, it's Marlo who flatlines. She even&nbsp;
asks to stay out for three minutes instead of one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.440
like the others. Her visions take her through all&nbsp;
her life achievements before showing her the word&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.160
"murderer" and revisiting the memory of a patient&nbsp;
called Cyrus, whom she couldn't save. His body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.160
appears in front of her at the bottom of a creepy&nbsp;
pool, but before she can come any closer to it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.920
she's brought back to life. The group takes Marlo&nbsp;
to the roof so she can grab some air and they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.240
surprised to see Sophia suddenly showing&nbsp;
up, demanding to go next. Ray disapproves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.920
but he's told to shut up by the others because&nbsp;
he's already as deep in this as they are.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.760
Courtney and Marlo accept to help Sophia, but she&nbsp;
can't stay too long because the cleaning crew will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.720
be arriving soon. Sophia flatlines and her visions&nbsp;
show her teenage days. Her mother was constantly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.640
pressuring her to be a good student, causing&nbsp;
Sophia to get jealous of her classmate Irina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.560
when she was doing better than her at school.&nbsp;
She ruined Irina's life by hacking her phone and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.800
sending out her intimate photographs. Sophia's&nbsp;
experience is suddenly cut short, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.480
when the cleaning crew arrives at the building&nbsp;
and her friends are forced to bring her back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.840
Jamie goes out and pulls the fire alarm to&nbsp;
distract the employees while the group escapes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.320
in a car, almost getting caught by the security&nbsp;
guards. Their worries quickly disappear as Marlo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.600
drives out of there at a very high speed and&nbsp;
they decide to join a party, where they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.440
fun dancing and drinking. Courtney leaves the&nbsp;
dance floor when she thinks she sees Tessa in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.600
the crowd and follows the girl to the parking&nbsp;
lot, where she starts having a hallucination.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.520
The entire place suddenly becomes empty except&nbsp;
for her old destroyed car in front of her;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.440
when she comes closer to look inside,&nbsp;
she finds Tessa's body floating in water.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.240
Her hand suddenly comes up and startles Courtney,&nbsp;
bringing her back to reality. Upset, she decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.440
to leave the party. Meanwhile, Sophia is euphoric&nbsp;
thanks to her flatlining experience, so she takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.660
Jamie back to her apartment and makes love to him.&nbsp;
Her mother can hear them and tries to make them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.280
stop, but the pair doesn't leave the room until&nbsp;
they're done. After Jamie leaves the apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.680
Sophia's mom tries to scold her for bringing a man&nbsp;
over to her place, but Sophia finally stands up to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.240
her and tells her she's moving out. Marlo and Ray&nbsp;
also leave the party together. When they make it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.720
to Marlo's house, she convinces him to come inside&nbsp;
by saying she has something important to tell him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.400
They share a drink while Marlo confesses&nbsp;
Cyrus' death was her fault because she made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.920
a mistake while choosing his treatment, she&nbsp;
also admits being scared because she saw him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.320
during her flatlining. Ray tells her she's a good&nbsp;
person and that everything's going to be fine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.480
then he kisses her and they make love. A couple&nbsp;
of hours later, Courtney goes to the bridge where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.960
she lost her sister and remembers the accident,&nbsp;
desperately crying with guilt. Jamie returns to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.280
his boathouse and has a vision as well - first&nbsp;
he thinks he sees Alicia crying on his bed, then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.680
he hears a baby crying under his furniture. He&nbsp;
finds a baby blanket as Alicia approaches him from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.160
behind, but she disappears when his phone rings.&nbsp;
It's Courtney, who is calling to tell him about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.640
her visions. Jamie tells her to stay home so he&nbsp;
can go check on her. Courtney enters her apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.200
and hears music coming from the radio. After&nbsp;
turning it off, she records a video on her phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.360
apologizing and admitting the real reason behind&nbsp;
her experiments was to see her sister again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.400
not scientific discovery. A light is suddenly on&nbsp;
in her room and the radio starts playing again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.800
Courtney goes to investigate and finds Tessa&nbsp;
writing at a desk, looking dreadful. The ghost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.400
starts chasing Courtney around the apartment and&nbsp;
also appears outside when Courtney climbs out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.160
of the window and onto the fire escape. When she&nbsp;
tries to re-enter the building through a different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.560
window, Tessa pushes her over the railing, killing&nbsp;
her. Her friends are told the news the next day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.880
by their teacher. Marlo thinks they need to talk&nbsp;
about the visions they're having, but Jamie points&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.560
out the priority is to destroy all evidence of&nbsp;
their experiments or they'll be found when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.320
school investigates Courtney's death. Jamie&nbsp;
says he'll break into Courtney's apartment to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.480
get anything incriminating and tells the others&nbsp;
to get rid of their notes. Sophia tells Ray they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.800
should've listened to him, and Jamie tells him he&nbsp;
can walk away, but Ray wants to stick with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.960
When night falls, Marlo gets a call from Jamie&nbsp;
while working at the hospital. He tells her he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.560
and Ray found Courtney's computer and notes but&nbsp;
not her phone, which should be in the morgue,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.320
so Marlo should retrieve it since she has&nbsp;
access to it. Marlo goes to the morgue and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.160
quickly finds the phone in the file cabinet&nbsp;
by making it ring with a call; she's about to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.480
leave when she notices Courtney's name on the body&nbsp;
list. She decides to take it out and look at it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.280
which makes her rather upset. After putting the&nbsp;
body back, Marlo starts having a vision: she sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.280
the word "murderer" painted on the refrigerated&nbsp;
unit and gets a call from Courtney's phone;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.040
she picks it up and hears a voice calling&nbsp;
her name right before the power goes off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.720
Marlo turns on the flashlight on her phone&nbsp;
and sees all the doors from the unit are open,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.600
she's also jumped on by Cyrus's body before the&nbsp;
shock snaps her back into reality. Jamie is having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.920
issues as well: his shower suddenly runs out of&nbsp;
water, and his radio starts playing baby music,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.480
he only manages to stop it after disconnecting it&nbsp;
with a knife. Then he hears a voice whispering his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.560
name and a woman crying before Alicia appears&nbsp;
in front of him, Jamie rushes out of the boat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.960
when a hand touches his shoulder. However, Alicia&nbsp;
is waiting for him outside and when he sees her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.440
he falls into the water. He swims to the dock&nbsp;
and screams when a figure stabs his hand. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.520
group gets together to watch Courtney's recording&nbsp;
and after hearing her talk to Tessa, Marlo comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.200
to the conclusion their sins are coming back&nbsp;
to haunt them. Jaime decides everyone should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.200
tell the truth, and he starts by talking about&nbsp;
Alicia. He slept with her and got her pregnant but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.680
was willing to pay for the abortion, when the day&nbsp;
came, though, he wasn't capable of doing it so he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.680
drove away and left her to fend for herself. She&nbsp;
was the one that stabbed him last night, except&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.600
it couldn't have really been her because she's&nbsp;
still alive and living somewhere else. Sophia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.080
confesses what she did to Irina in high school,&nbsp;
but Marlo doesn't say anything about Cyrus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.160
They think there's some being, perhaps demonic,&nbsp;
that is using their guilt to go after them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.640
Sometime later, during a class, Sophia has a&nbsp;
vision too: she thinks she's getting insulting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.880
text messages like Irina used to get and sees&nbsp;
a video of her sleeping with Jamie appearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.720
on the computer screen. Unsettled, she leaves&nbsp;
the room and makes it to the hallway, where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.120
she hears a girl's laughter while an apparition&nbsp;
walks behind her. Sophia enters the elevator and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.120
notices the ceiling is missing, but she can't&nbsp;
get out because the doors have already closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.760
The elevator starts going up and suddenly stops at&nbsp;
an old abandoned classroom where Irina shows up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.320
startling Sophia back into reality. Ray visits&nbsp;
Marlo at her house to tell her he's discovered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.720
she changed Cyrus' autopsy report to make his&nbsp;
death look like an accident instead of a mistake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.440
and asks her to come clean to the dean. Marlo&nbsp;
refuses to do it because it'll destroy her career,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.080
Ray tells her that then she shouldn't be a doctor.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Sophia asks Jamie to go with her to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.640
Irina. She confesses to her that she was the one&nbsp;
that sent out her pictures and apologizes for her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.760
actions, Irina accepts to forgive her. Jamie is&nbsp;
inspired by this and, after calling Marlo to tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.720
her about this idea possibly saving them, he goes&nbsp;
to see Alicia to apologize as well. He discovers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.120
she never got the abortion and she's been raising&nbsp;
their son alone, so he admits having been a coward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.840
and tells he wants to help from now on. Later at&nbsp;
night, Marlo is at her house reading about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.160
afterlife when she starts having a vision again.&nbsp;
She finds herself in the bottom of the dark, empty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.880
pool with Cyru's body in front of her, but she&nbsp;
wakes up when she touches it. It's already morning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.440
when she leaves the house in her car, crying as&nbsp;
she drives. Another hallucination begins on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.840
way, a pair of hands put a plastic bag around her&nbsp;
head, making it hard to breathe and causing her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.240
crash. Ray gets a message from Marlo saying she&nbsp;
needs to stop all this, so he calls Sophia and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.320
Jamie to help him look for her. They find her&nbsp;
in the hospital's basement rooms, flatlining,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.800
so they try to bring her back while she has her&nbsp;
visions. Marlo finds herself in the pool again and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:46.080
this time, she stays by Cyrus' side and apologizes&nbsp;
to him, but he wakes up and chokes her. Then she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.560
appears on a stretcher that Cyrus pushes into an&nbsp;
empty room. Marlo gets off the stretcher only to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.040
be pushed around before being grabbed by the head&nbsp;
and put into a tub filled with water to drown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.440
As Ray tells her he needs her to come back to him,&nbsp;
Marlo manages to get out of the water but starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.920
being sucked in by a storm. Suddenly, Courtney&nbsp;
appears in front of her and tells her she needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.720
to forgive herself just as Ray finally brings&nbsp;
her back to life. A couple of days later, Marlo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.960
accepts Courtney was right and goes to see the&nbsp;
dean to accept responsibility for what she did,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.440
the dean puts her on probation. Afterward, she&nbsp;
and Ray throw Courtney's computer into the river&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.920
so nobody tries the experiment again. The movie&nbsp;
ends with the group having a drink at a bar and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.480
realizing the guy at the piano is playing the same&nbsp;
song Courtney did, so they drink a toast to her.
