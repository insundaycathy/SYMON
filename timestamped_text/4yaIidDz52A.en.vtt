00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.240
Welcome back to Movie Recaps. Today&nbsp;
I will show you an action, adventure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.160
fantasy film from 2017, titled Kong: Skull&nbsp;
Island. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.400
It's 1944, War World II. Somewhere on the&nbsp;
South Pacific, two planes fall on an island,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.480
followed closely by their parachuting pilots:&nbsp;
American soldier Hank Marlow and Japanese&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.640
soldier Gunpei Ikari. As soon as they see&nbsp;
each other, the shooting and running begin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.960
and the chase takes them from the beach into the&nbsp;
jungle. Hank finds himself obliged to stop when he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.600
comes across the edge of a cliff, an opportunity&nbsp;
Gunpei uses to attack him with his sword. Hank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.160
stops the sword with his bare hands and pushes&nbsp;
Gunpei away, disarming him. But Gunpei takes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.560
knife and jumps on Hank, his knife merely inches&nbsp;
away from his throat when suddenly, a giant hairy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.720
hand appears over the edge of the cliff, followed&nbsp;
by a huge gorilla head that roars at the soldiers.&nbsp;

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.440
We then cut to Washington, where we see a&nbsp;
taxi parking in front of the White House.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.760
Two men come out of it: Bill Randa, head of the&nbsp;
U.S. government organization Monarch, and Doctor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.640
Houston Brooks, a geologist. They're there to see&nbsp;
Senator Willis, and Brooks isn't sure it is a good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.200
idea considering the timing, but Randa reminds him&nbsp;
they're broke and this is their last chance. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.040
Senator receives them in their office even if he's&nbsp;
rather skeptical about it, and the men quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.120
begin their explanation: they've discovered an&nbsp;
uncharted island on the South Pacific of which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.080
legends speak about: Skull Island, the place where&nbsp;
God did not finish creation, notorious for all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.880
ships and planes that have gone missing there.&nbsp;
Randa thinks that the 1954 nuclear tests weren't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.800
tests, they were trying to destroy something there&nbsp;
and that there's an imaginable ecosystem to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.520
found. The Senator still thinks it's a fairytale&nbsp;
so he leaves his office, but Randa and Brooks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.600
don't give up and following him with more reasons&nbsp;
to do this: there's a mission going nearby soon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.520
so they could piggyback on it, and there are many&nbsp;
things they possibly find on the island - Brooks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.920
isn't sure what that could be, but whatever it&nbsp;
is, they can't let the Russians find it first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.560
That manages to convince the Senator, who tells&nbsp;
them this will be the last favor he does for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.520
Randa adds they'll need a military escort.
We're shown an American airbase in Vietnam next,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.320
where all soldiers are getting ready&nbsp;
to go home now the war is over.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.520
Here we meet officers Glenn Mills, Earl Cole,&nbsp;
Reg Slivko, Reles, and their Lieutenant Colonel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.000
Preston Packard. After some drinking, Packard&nbsp;
goes back to his office, where he's checked on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.800
by Major Jack Chapman. It seems Chapman already&nbsp;
has a job in his future, but Packard feels all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.680
his achievements had been for nothing. Later, when&nbsp;
night falls, Packard receives a call asking him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.120
join Randa's mission, he very gratefully accepts.
Meanwhile, in Saigon, Brooks and Randa are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.520
to a bar to hire a former special air service&nbsp;
captain as their tracker. Inside the bar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.080
they find this man, James Conrad, playing pool&nbsp;
and winning money for it. His opponents get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.240
angry for losing and try to hurt him, but he&nbsp;
quickly knocks them out using the cue stick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.800
A moment later, the three of them are sharing a&nbsp;
table and trying to reach a deal. Conrad thinks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.200
this expedition is extremely dangerous, so he asks&nbsp;
for five times the money they're offering plus a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.240
bonus if they make it back. They accept. Conrad&nbsp;
also wants to know exactly what they're tracking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.160
but Brooks and Randa only tell him they want&nbsp;
his expertise in exploring dangerous territory.&nbsp;

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.480
Next we cut to Mason Weaver, a&nbsp;
photojournalist, doing work in her dark room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.040
She receives a call informing she's been accepted&nbsp;
into Randa's expedition, which makes her very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.440
excited. When asked why she's so interested in&nbsp;
this, she explains that different sources have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.520
all told her all the same thing, which means&nbsp;
they're lying. Something must be going on.&nbsp;

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.480
A couple of days later in Bangkok, all&nbsp;
characters are coming together to board the boat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.240
The soldiers aren't very happy with this new&nbsp;
mission, since they had been eager to return home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.600
when the war ended. Weaver introduces herself to&nbsp;
Steve Woodward, a NASA employee, then to Packard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.560
who isn't a fan of her anti-war journalism. The&nbsp;
ship finally sets sail when everyone is on board,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.160
and all the explorers get together to&nbsp;
listen to a talk by another NASA official,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.320
Victor Nieves. He explains the island is&nbsp;
surrounded by a perpetual storm system,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.240
which is what allows it to stay hidden from the&nbsp;
outside world. But they should be able to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.120
it through with Packard's military helicopters.&nbsp;
He also introduces Brooks and Randa, plus a third&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.840
scientist in their team, San Lin. Brooks takes&nbsp;
over the explanation then, saying they'll use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.320
explosives to create vibrations that will help&nbsp;
them map the island. Then it's Chapman's turn,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.640
he explains that the storm's interference will&nbsp;
block all radio contact, they'll be by themselves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.760
and that three days later will meet them&nbsp;
at the north end of the island - that's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.520
only safe departure window for an unknown&nbsp;
period of time, so nobody should miss it.&nbsp;

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.480
Once everyone is dismissed, Conrad and Weaver&nbsp;
scout the boat and come across each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.240
They're both suspicious of the reasons they were&nbsp;
given for this expedition, and they poke at each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.000
other's reasoning for being there as well.
It doesn't take them long to arrive at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.560
island's location, and the storm looks way&nbsp;
nastier in person. Randa wants to cross it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.360
Nieves doesn't. They leave the decision up to&nbsp;
Packard, who decides they are going in. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.840
soldiers plus the civilian teams board a fleet of&nbsp;
helicopters and they take off, flying off smoothly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.320
at first. As soon as they enter the storm though,&nbsp;
things get complicated: constant lighting must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.800
be dodged and the helicopters are continuously&nbsp;
shaken. But Packard is experienced and manages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.720
to keep his cool, guiding his fleet with a speech&nbsp;
about Icarus until they safely make it through.&nbsp;

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.520
The island is absolutely gorgeous, but there&nbsp;
isn't much time to enjoy it since the plan is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.920
getting starting: after leaving all civilians&nbsp;
-except for Weaver, Randa and Conrad- on land,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.280
the helicopters spread to find the&nbsp;
assigned spot to drop the bombs at.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.840
As the radars quickly pick up the vibrations from&nbsp;
the explosions, Brooks' theory is confirmed: the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.560
bedrock is practically hollow. All is going well&nbsp;
until suddenly, one of the helicopters is struck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.200
and knocked down by a flying tree, and another&nbsp;
is hit grabbed by a giant hand. The helicopter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.960
is turned around and the soldier gets to see the&nbsp;
big face of an ape before being swallowed by it.&nbsp;

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.600
All alarms start to go off when everyone raises&nbsp;
their eyes to see the mighty figure standing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.960
against the horizon: Kong, the giant gorilla. At&nbsp;
first he only stays on his spot, roaring at them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.040
but as soon as the soldiers start shooting at&nbsp;
him, he doesn't hesitate to defend himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.200
The bullets don't truly hurt him, so it's easy&nbsp;
for Kong to move among the helicopters to knock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.000
them down, and he even smashes some soldiers&nbsp;
that make it safely to the ground. One by one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.080
Kong destroys every chopper, and he doesn't leave&nbsp;
until there isn't a single one left in the air.&nbsp;

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.160
Because of the attack, all members&nbsp;
of the expedition got scattered.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.880
On one spot, we have Weaver, Nieves,&nbsp;
Slivko, Brooks, San Lin and Conrad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.200
who will guide them up north to be as close as&nbsp;
possible to the meeting point. On another spot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.360
Chapman is alone, but he manages to send&nbsp;
Packard his position before communication dies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.000
Packard is on yet another spot together with&nbsp;
Reles, and when they start moving, they quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.560
find Cole, Mills, Woodward and a couple more&nbsp;
soldiers. Turns out Randa is also nearby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.640
so Packard goes to speak to him in private.&nbsp;
He points his gun at him and asks for the real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.000
reason behind this expedition, so Randa explains:&nbsp;
monsters exist, and nobody ever believed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.640
The bombs weren't dropped for geology, they were&nbsp;
dropped to shake something out. Many years ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.960
Randa was in a ship that got attacked by a&nbsp;
monster. He survived, but the government told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.520
his family the ship had sunk in battle, and the&nbsp;
public never heard about it. Randa's never stopped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.320
believing and now he wants to destroy these beasts&nbsp;
before they destroy humanity. He asks Packard to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.080
take them home with proof so they can send the&nbsp;
cavalry - Packard replies he is the cavalry.&nbsp;

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.760
Back to Conrad's group, Slivko tries to contact&nbsp;
the others to no avail. When they walk by a lake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.000
they encounter a huge bison-like animal that&nbsp;
Slivko points his gun at, but Conrad makes him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.160
put it down, since the animal isn't attacking&nbsp;
them. After staring at them for a moment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.920
the creature turns around and leaves.
Meanwhile, Packard and his soldiers are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.840
searching for Chapman and the special weapons.&nbsp;
As they make their way through the jungle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.680
one of their soldiers is suddenly killed by a&nbsp;
large stick in his throat - when they look up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.400
they realize that stick is the leg of a giant&nbsp;
spider. The team immediately starts firing at it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.840
which doesn't stop the spider from&nbsp;
catching Mills. With a friend in the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.920
they can't shoot anymore, so they start working&nbsp;
on cutting the legs as Mills takes out a knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.920
and starts cutting the limbs that are grabbing&nbsp;
him. It takes him some effort but he succeeds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.080
and as soon as he is dropped on the ground, the&nbsp;
team opens fire again, defeating the spider.&nbsp;

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.800
In the meantime, Conrad's team finds some&nbsp;
abandoned ruins. As soon as they take a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.800
couple of steps inside, they're surrounded&nbsp;
by natives pointing their weapons at them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.640
They point their guns back, but any potential&nbsp;
fight is prevented just in time by a man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.960
appearing among the natives: it's Hank, the&nbsp;
pilot that landed here during World War II.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.280
When he says everything is fine, the natives back&nbsp;
off, and Hank guides the team into the ruins.&nbsp;

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.800
Back to Chapman, he's refilling his canteen when&nbsp;
he sees Kong arrive. Chapman hides behind a rock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.480
and watches the ape drink water and, rather&nbsp;
suddenly, reach into the river and grab a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.720
giant octopus. The creature tries to squeeze&nbsp;
Kong with its tentacles, but Kong proceeds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.720
to tear off his limbs and eat them. He leaves&nbsp;
dragging the rest of the octopus behind him.&nbsp;

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.720
In the village, Hank explains to the team that&nbsp;
they'll be safe as long as they stay with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.040
natives. There's a huge wall surrounding them,&nbsp;
but it isn't there for Kong, it's for the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.680
monsters. Hank takes them to an old shipwreck&nbsp;
and inside it, he shows them some old paintings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.760
on the rocks. They depict the beliefs of the&nbsp;
natives: for thousands of years, they lived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.160
in fear of the monsters, until suddenly, some of&nbsp;
those creatures started protecting them instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.200
Kong is considered the king around here and god to&nbsp;
these people, and he won't attack unless provoked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.840
It wasn't Kong that killed Gunpei, it was another&nbsp;
monster: the skullcrawlers, big lizards that live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.080
underground and have been awoken by the bombs.&nbsp;
Kong usually can handle them just fine, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.040
the biggest one is dangerous: it is the one that&nbsp;
killed Kong's family. Conrad changes the subject&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.800
and tells Hank about the team that will be coming&nbsp;
to rescue them in three days, but Hank says it'd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:54.080
be impossible to reach the north end of the island&nbsp;
in such a short time... at least, not on foot.&nbsp;

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.160
Meanwhile, Packard's team is walking through a&nbsp;
swamp when they see a group of strange birds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.120
They don't attack them, but Packard shoots one&nbsp;
anyway, scaring all the others away. The soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.280
are getting nervous, unsure if they'll make it&nbsp;
in time, but Cole asks them to trust Packard.&nbsp;

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.200
Back to Conrad and company, they're being told&nbsp;
by Hank that he and Gunpei had started to build&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.440
a boat before Gunpei died. Now the team will&nbsp;
help him finish it so they can reach the rescue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.600
team in time. While everyone works on the&nbsp;
repairs, Weaver interacts with the natives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.840
taking pictures of them. It's then that she hears&nbsp;
a noise coming from the other side of the wall so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.600
she goes investigate: it's one of those bison-like&nbsp;
creatures that has been caught under a plane.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.680
She tries to help it but lacks the strength&nbsp;
to move an entire plane by herself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.920
thankfully Kong arrives and picks it up himself.&nbsp;
He stares at her for a short moment before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.160
leaving, seemingly approving her actions.
During their walk in search of Chapman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.520
Packard's team finds the bloodstain&nbsp;
Kong left on a mountain. Now they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.240
know the creature can be hurt and even killed.
While Conrad's team continues to work on the boat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.680
Chapman still tries to communicate&nbsp;
through the radio, but it won't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.840
He sits on a big trunk to rest, but the trunk&nbsp;
moves and reveals it's not a fallen tree:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.320
it's a creature that looks like one. Chapman&nbsp;
shoots it, which scares it off but also calls the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.720
attention of another monster. He barely has time&nbsp;
to turn around before a skullcrawler eats him.&nbsp;

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.280
Night falls. In the village, while others&nbsp;
chitchat, Conrad and Weaver look at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:14.160
northern lights. She's trying to a picture but her&nbsp;
flashlight broke, so Conrad lends her his lighter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.320
a gift from his father who had fought&nbsp;
in World War II. He was his hero.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.800
In the jungle, Packard's team is setting&nbsp;
camp, and Rande tells him this plan is folly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.840
Packard replies that if he doesn't&nbsp;
like how he runs things, he can leave.&nbsp;

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.800
The next morning, the boat is ready to go.&nbsp;
Hank retrieves the sword from Gunpei's grave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.960
to take it with him, since Gunpei had become&nbsp;
his brother during the time they spent together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.680
Everybody boards the boat and, after some extra&nbsp;
effort to make it start, they finally set sail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.600
While Hank tells them about the family he left&nbsp;
behind, they received a call from Packard's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.400
team. They are asked to shoot a signal so they&nbsp;
can find their location, and Packard does so.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.080
Turns out they're close enough to pick them up,&nbsp;
but the celebration is soured when one of those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.720
weird birds flies by and takes Nieves to eat with&nbsp;
its flock. They can't do much but keep moving.&nbsp;

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.360
A couple of hours later, they land the boat and&nbsp;
get off to reunite with Packard and his team.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.000
Now everyone is back together, Conrad wants&nbsp;
them to get back on the ship and leave fast,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.160
but Packard refuses: he still wants to&nbsp;
find Chapman. Hank protests against the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.320
idea since going west means going where the&nbsp;
skullcrawlers live. But since his job is to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.240
track, Conrad ends up giving in under the&nbsp;
condition they make it back by nightfall.&nbsp;

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.560
The group departs in search of Chapman and on the&nbsp;
way, they find the skeletons of Kong's parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.880
Despite Hank's complaints, Packard orders them to&nbsp;
cross the mass grave, which is covered in a weird&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.600
mist - a mist they discover is flammable when&nbsp;
Cole drops his cigarette and causes an explosion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.440
They don't make it very far before a skullcrawler&nbsp;
reaches them, and they quickly hide behind those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.560
giant bones. The skullcrawler pauses to puke out a&nbsp;
skull that lands near Conrad and makes it possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.200
for him to notice it has Chapman's name tag, then&nbsp;
it seemingly turns around and leaves. The team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.440
thinks it's safe to come out, but when Randa's&nbsp;
camera flash goes off, the skullcrawler jumps on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.240
it and eats him. Everyone opens fire, but it's&nbsp;
hard to aim when the lizard hides in the mist.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.240
It suddenly shows up in front of Hank, who manages&nbsp;
to cut it with the sword before it pushes him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.240
out of the way and eats one of the soldiers. It&nbsp;
goes after Weaver next, and that's when another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.800
soldier turns on his flamethrower against it. The&nbsp;
skullcrawler hits that soldier with its tail and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.520
sends it flying, causing another explosion where&nbsp;
it lands. Slivko is hit and knocked out by that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.160
explosion, landing near the cans of gas. The weird&nbsp;
birds from before suddenly show up and while the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.560
soldiers shoot them, Conrad takes Hank's sword and&nbsp;
a gas mask that was on the floor and puts it on to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.960
enter the leaking gas area. He cuts every bird&nbsp;
on the way until he makes it to Slivko, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.200
skullcrawler has made it to them as well - luckily&nbsp;
Weaver arrives just in time to throw Conrad's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.520
lighter at the monster, making it blow up.
Once they leave the mass grave behind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.240
Hank reminds Packard what a horrible idea this is,&nbsp;
and Conrad informs everyone that Chapman is dead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.640
which he proves by showing the name tag the&nbsp;
creature had puked out. But Packard doesn't care,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.800
he still wants to reach the crash site to&nbsp;
retrieve the explosives in order to kill Kong.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.520
Hank, Conrad, the scientists and Weaver try to&nbsp;
stop him, explaining Kong is good and had only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.760
been defending himself, Packard continues&nbsp;
not to listen. Everyone draws their weapons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.080
and it seems a fight is about to begin, but&nbsp;
Conrad mediates: he tells Packard the location&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.080
he and his soldier need, but he will take the&nbsp;
civilians back to the boat - except Woodward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.080
who goes with the soldiers. They find Chapman's&nbsp;
things on the way and retrieve them so they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.640
send them back to his family. Meanwhile, Conrad&nbsp;
tells his team to wait a moment because he needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.960
to find high ground, Weaver goes with him.
It's nighttime by the time Packard's party&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.280
finds the weapons and begins working on a trap&nbsp;
for Kong that includes flames. We cut back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.040
Conrad and Weaver then, who make it to the edge&nbsp;
of a cliff and manage to take a good look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.360
the river and where the boat could possibly be.&nbsp;
It's at that moment that Kong visits them, but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.000
doesn't attack because he recognizes Weaver, who&nbsp;
now feels brave enough to touch his nose. Kong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.240
doesn't seem to mind, but he roars and leaves when&nbsp;
he hears the explosions set off by the soldiers.&nbsp;

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.800
Conrad and Weaver return to their team and&nbsp;
send them back to the boat, the scientists do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.040
as asked but Hank joins them when he learns they&nbsp;
want to save Kong. Meanwhile, Kong has reached the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.600
soldiers and is ready to fight. He runs to them on&nbsp;
the water, but Packard throws a torch and starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.400
a ring of fire around the ape. At first it seems&nbsp;
Kong is in so much pain that he's unable to move,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.480
but eventually he makes it through the flames and&nbsp;
smashes Woodward with his hand before falling to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.400
the ground. Packard asks his soldiers to place&nbsp;
their charges but we can see in their eyes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:09.040
they're hesitating after seeing Kong suffer. As&nbsp;
they all grab the detonators, Conrad, Weaver and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.440
Hank arrive to stop them. Soldiers and civilians&nbsp;
point their weapons at each other while Packard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.760
rants about a soldier's dirty work - the group&nbsp;
seems to be at an impasse, at least until Slivko&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.000
comes through and points at Packard instead.&nbsp;
Conrad declares it's over, but he's interrupted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.720
by a noise in the water: it's the biggest&nbsp;
skullcrawler. Everybody runs away except Packard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.560
who stays behind to turn on the detonator with&nbsp;
the intention of killing Kong but ends up being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.040
crushed by him when he wakes up. Kong engages&nbsp;
the lizard in battle but is soon overpowered.&nbsp;

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.280
The sun rises as the group makes it to the edge of&nbsp;
the island. They send Weaver to fire a flare that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.440
Brooks could see while they work on a distraction&nbsp;
to buy them some time. Conrad and the soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.760
start running as the skullcrawler begins its&nbsp;
chase, Cole decides to stay behind and sacrifice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.680
himself with the intention of blowing up his&nbsp;
explosives when the lizard comes close enough, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.160
he's pushed away by its tail. The skullcrawler is&nbsp;
about to get the rest of the team when Kong makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.400
a reappearance, punching and smashing the lizard&nbsp;
as many times as possible while Weaver reaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.280
a high place and fires that flare. After a couple&nbsp;
more hits include one with a tree, Kong is pushed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.520
back by the skullcrawler and accidentally falls&nbsp;
on some chains that bound him. The lizard is about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.200
to kill him when the scientists arrive with the&nbsp;
boat, shooting their weapons at the skullcrawler&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.760
while the soldiers climb aboard. Between them and&nbsp;
a flare Weaver shoots at its neck, they manage to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.600
distract the monster long enough for Kong to free&nbsp;
himself from the chains and use one to attack his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.520
opponent, hitting the skullcrawler with it before&nbsp;
grabbing it and smashing it against the mountain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.280
which causes Weaver to fall in the water.&nbsp;
Kong sees her and hurries to knock out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.680
lizard with a few hits before reaching into the&nbsp;
water to rescue Waver. He takes her out just as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.680
the skullcrawler makes a comeback, jumping on&nbsp;
Kong and grabbing his wrist with his tongue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.600
Kong takes the chance to grab the tongue and&nbsp;
kill the skullcrawler by ripping its guts out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:46.080
When he opens his hand, Weaver is fine, so he&nbsp;
gently puts her down on the ground where Conrad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.000
comes to check on her. Together they watch&nbsp;
Kong give them one last look before leaving.&nbsp;

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.320
Moments later, everyone is on the boat,&nbsp;
sailing to the meeting point. They're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.320
worried the place will change when word comes&nbsp;
out, but they promise they won't say anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.880
As a fleet of helicopters arrives to rescue them,&nbsp;
we see Kong one last time, roaring for the camera.&nbsp;

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.520
Two final bonus scenes come afterward: one&nbsp;
is of Hank, reuniting with his wife and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.840
son. The other one is Conrad and Weaver, who&nbsp;
think they've been captured by the military,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.200
but it's just Brooks and San Lin, who&nbsp;
explain they've found footage of a cave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:20.160
that shows other monsters kings like Kong: the&nbsp;
drawings represent Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.680
and King Ghidorah. The final image&nbsp;
shows Godzilla and Ghidorah in battle..
