Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.461
Today, I'm going to explain a horror, mystery,
thriller film called "The Possession of Hannah

00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:06.461
Grace."

00:00:06.461 --> 00:00:07.461
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.461 --> 00:00:09.019
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.620
In a church's attic, two priests perform an
exorcism on a young woman tied to the bed.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.210
The young woman, Hannah, doesn't react to
his prayers, opting for the priest to check

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.210
on her.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.710
Hannah's father, Grainger, is in tears, not
knowing if they could save his daughter's

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.710
life.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.640
Suddenly, Hannah's eyes open with one bright
blue eye.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.070
She knocks down the older priest, laughing
maniacally as her body contorts.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.309
The younger priest douses her with holy water
while the older priest continues the exorcism.

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.050
Hannah screams painfully, alerting Grainger
to beg for her to fight the demon inside.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.719
Her beastly growl quiets, and for a moment,
her eyes turn back to brown as she recognizes

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:43.839
her father.

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.399
She looks to her father mournfully but is
quickly overcome by the demon again.

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.579
One of her eyes turns back to blue, and she
breaks out laughing.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.350
The older priest stops his prayer abruptly,
falling into the demon's control.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.569
Hannah shrieks as she telepathically pushes
the priest into a spike on the wall.

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:59.769
Next, she chokes the younger priest in midair.

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.050
Grainger attempts to save the priest, but
he's powerless.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.899
The demon speaks in a deep voice, claiming
Hannah's soul as his for eternity.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.810
Hearing this, Grainger accepts that there
is no hope for his daughter, but he cannot

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.500
let the evil free in the world.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.640
With a heavy heart, he takes a pillow and
smothers his own daughter until her limbs

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.020
no longer move.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.329
As soon as Hannah's gone, the younger priest
is freed from the demon's chokehold.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.439
Grainger grieves over his daughter, not noticing
a fly landing on her hand, making her hand

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.579
twitch.

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.899
Three months later, ex-cop Megan Reed lands
a night shift job at the Boston Metro Hospital's

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.600
morgue with the help of her friend, Lisa.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.000
Dr. Lewis gives Megan a tour of the facility
and shows her how to take in corpses and document

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.659
information from them.

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.710
Working in a morgue at night has scared off
many employees, but Megan is not bothered

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.700
by the dead, believing that death is permanent.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.280
Dr. Lewis welcomes Megan to the team, who's
eager to start a new chapter of her life.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.149
On her first shift, Megan meets the security
guards Ernie and Dave before heading to the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.149
morgue.

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.770
Her night is spent transcribing reports until
the motion-triggered lights go off.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.270
She heads out to activate them but is startled
by the alarm, announcing that a body is about

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.389
to be delivered through the intake bay.

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:07.790
Despite her stoic demeanor about the job,
Megan feels uneasy as she receives the first

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.440
cadaver she has to process alone.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.250
Following protocol, she takes images of the
body and scans the fingerprints for identification.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.090
As she wheels in the first body into the refrigerated
drawer, Dave pops in, startling her.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.799
Dave apologizes for scaring her, but Megan
is not interested in hearing more.

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.069
The rest of the night starts to get boring,
as there is not much to do.

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.120
Megan makes a ball out of rubber bands before
heading to the bathroom.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.980
She accidentally triggers the hand dryer as
she exits, making her jump.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.819
Walking back to her post, Megan spots a man
standing in the middle of the hallway.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.620
The man disappears in front of her eyes, and
her memories flash before her eyes.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.220
She hears a man asking, "why didn't you shoot?"
then sees her ex-partner with whitened eyes.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.129
She snaps back into reality, heaving and shaking.

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.040
She heads for her purse, spilling pills into
her hands.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.689
Staring down on the pills, she questions her
condition.

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.870
Her troubled past haunts her, but she refuses
to be brought down by it anymore.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.120
Megan remembers sitting at group therapy,
recounting the turning point in her life when

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.799
she froze in front of a criminal.

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.650
The man shoots at her but instead mortally
wounds her partner.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.019
The guilt led her to turn to pills, ending
her career and destroying her relationship

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.330
with a fellow cop, Andrew.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.819
Andrew visits Megan the following day to get
the rest of his things from her apartment.

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.760
Here he learns about her new job at the morgue,
which worries him.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.019
Megan, however, believes that working a night
shift will keep her busy and out of trouble.

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.290
The conversation turns into them blaming each
other for their failed relationship, which

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.620
ends with Andrew awkwardly leaving.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.950
That evening, Megan throws her makeshift ball
at the wall to pass the time.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.360
The alarm blares, alerting her that a body
is about to be delivered.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.760
She heads to the intake bay, but she only
finds a hooded man who asks her to open the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.760
door.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.989
Knowing better, Megan refuses to let him in.

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.750
When the man becomes aggressive, Megan backs
away to the elevator and reports him to security.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.750
Not long after, the alarm alerts her again.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.550
This time, it's an E.M.T. named Randy delivering
a body.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.159
Megan helps him get the body off the ambulance,
not noticing the hooded man slip in behind

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.060
them and use the elevator.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.159
Megan learns that the body was found in an
alley with a man still slicing her before

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.269
escaping.

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.650
Megan identifies her as Hannah Grace.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.250
Upon opening the body bag, Megan is horrified
at the corpse's condition.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.819
According to Randy, there are traces of chloroform
in her body, and that her injuries are post-mortem.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.760
Megan studies the body, appalled by its condition.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.290
Randy leaves her with Hannah, promising the
newbie that the job gets easier.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.580
After Megan returns to the receiving room,
the lights at the end of the hallway flickering

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.600
on.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.480
Someone else is on the floor with her.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.860
Megan takes photos of the body, but the camera
keeps failing to load the image.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.910
When she tries for the third time, the camera
electrocutes her, forcing her to stop.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.280
Carrying on, Megan loads Hannah's fingerprints
into the system, but it fails as well.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.970
As Megan wheels the body inside the drawer,
the room starts to shake, causing test tubes

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.720
to fall and break on the floor.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.880
Megan cleans up and gets scratched by the
glass, leaving a drop of blood on Hannah's

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.430
body when she secures it inside the drawer.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.760
Megan tends to her wound but stops when the
drawer opens up behind her.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.180
She looks inside then closes it again.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.840
Suspicious of the events, Megan tries to log
into the police department's database, but

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.730
her account is already suspended.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.660
Megan uses Andrew's login instead, guessing
his password as her name correctly.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.190
This allows her to pull up Hannah's I.D. and
notices something that doesn't add up.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.480
She heads to the morgue and opens up Hannah's
body bag, noting that her eyes are supposed

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.390
to be brown, but instead, it's vividly blue.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.280
As she stares into Hannah's eye, a fly distracts
her.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.600
She opens the bag further, revealing hundreds
of flies come out of Hannah's body.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.480
But when Megan looks back, the flies are gone.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.280
She checks inside before zipping up the bag
again and storing it inside.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.470
Heading back to her desk, she removes her
coat and calms herself down.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.600
The sound of the elevator alerts her.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.890
Thinking it's Dave again, she calls him out,
but there's no response.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.680
Megan looks into the morgue and finds Hannah's
body is missing.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.070
The other door swings close, and she sees
the body sliding down the hallway.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.770
Scared, Megan slowly peeks around the corner
then hurries down the hallway, only to be

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.510
attacked by the hooded man.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.020
He pins her to the wall and threatens to cut
her throat.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.910
But Megan fights back, forcing the knife out
of his hand before knocking him down.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.740
After grabbing the knife, she turns to fight,
but the hooded man disappears.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.680
Megan rushes back to her desk, alerting security
that the hooded man is inside.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.630
She searches for the hooded man and finds
the doors down the hall shut as she turns

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.720
the corner.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.440
Inside, she finds the hooded man ready to
put Hannah's body in the incinerator.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.900
Megan tries to calm the man down, but Dave
enters, distracting her enough to allow the

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.780
hooded man to tackle her.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.600
Dave and Ernie grab and handcuff him while
the hooded man pleads for them to destroy

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.620
the body.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.920
He screams that Hannah is not dead just before
he's taken away.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.270
Back in the morgue, Megan puts Hannah's body
away, but the drawer opens as soon as she

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.270
backs away.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.860
Refusing to believe in the man's claims, she
opens the drawer and checks on the corpse

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.860
again.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.680
Her phone rings, distracting her.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.760
Megan answers Andrew's call, worried about
her after hearing that she got attacked at

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.810
her job.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.200
While she's facing away, Hannah's body moves,
and Megan notices that it has changed position.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.500
Megan peers into the corpse and sees it exhale.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.960
Frightened, Megan closes up the bag and leaves.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.000
She waves her hands to activate the lights
again, but they don't switch on until she

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.930
spots Lisa in the stairwell.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.680
Having heard about the hooded man, Lisa offers
to let someone cover Megan's shift.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.300
Not wanting to give up and let someone else
take over, Megan decides to stay despite Lisa's

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.710
insistence that she should rest.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.340
Noticing Megan's uneasiness, Lisa becomes
concerned.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.960
Megan confesses that she heard Hannah's corpse
breathe.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.380
Lisa explains that corpses sometimes let out
air when they're moved, comforting Megan.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.500
Feeling better about the night, Megan and
Lisa have lunch together.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.740
Megan shares that she didn't freeze when she
saw the hooded man and was focused on defending

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.790
herself.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.670
She questions why she couldn't do that on
the night her partner died.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.550
Lisa encourages her that it's progress for
her healing.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.440
Dave walks in, announcing that someone is
here to visit Megan.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.510
The women head out, leaving Dave alone as
the drawer to Hannah's body opens again.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.340
Megan meets with Andrew, who lets her know
that the hooded man isn't talking to them.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.260
Seeing her stressed, Andrew is concerned,
knowing how she reacts to such pressure.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.680
He accuses Megan of taking a bottle of Xanax
from the items that he retrieved from her

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.270
home, offending her.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.450
Before Andrew leaves, Megan gives him Hannah's
fingerprints to get more information from

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:47.920
the police database.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.590
Megan thinks that Hannah's I.D. is a fake,
given her mismatched eye color.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.540
Back in the morgue, Dave takes Megan's rubber
ball and pretends to be a baseball player.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.120
He hears heavy footsteps inside the morgue
and is surprised to see the same rubber ball

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.830
inside, which he was playing with in the hallway
earlier.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.900
Dave hears movement inside one of the drawers
and hesitantly opens it.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.990
He peers inside, but a pair of hands grab
his head from above.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.780
Suddenly, the room shakes violently as Dave
is pushed up against the door by an invisible

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.780
force.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.270
He floats in midair as his limbs painfully
distort.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.610
His body is dragged against the ceiling until
he drops into an empty drawer.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.230
The drawer shuts, and Dave's screams abruptly
stop.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.150
The lights flicker back on as Megan walks
back inside.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.260
Confused, Megan searches for Dave but cannot
find him.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.070
She heads to the ladies bathroom, gazing down
the hall before entering.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.680
Inside a bathroom stall, she sends Andrew
a text, apologizing for her behavior earlier.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.649
She's confused when she hears the bathroom
door open, then the hand dryer blasts on.

00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:41.909
She calls out, thinking that it's Dave.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:45.160
Nervous at the heavy footsteps, she begins
to dress but stops when her rubber ball rolls

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.250
into the stall.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.500
Scared, Megan checks under the door but finds
the room empty.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.329
She gets up, only to be startled by a rotting
hand grabbing the ball from under her.

00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:56.550
Megan shakes her head, thinking that she's
delirious and imagining things.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.820
Slowly, she walks out of the stall, checking
the other stalls before leaving the bathroom.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.980
Later that evening, Andrew reports that Hannah
Grace has been declared dead for three months.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.730
With all the strange things happening tonight,
Megan gets nervous at this discovery.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.100
She searches the web for Hannah, seeing a
news report claiming she died after an exorcism.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.040
Her family and the church believed that a
demon possessed her.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.589
Megan rechecks the body and notices that the
gash on Hannah's side is gone.

00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:23.209
Hoping to find answers, Megan checks the security
footage from earlier this evening, where she

00:09:23.209 --> 00:09:25.790
sees a distorted figure appearing in the hallway.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.639
She goes for her pills but stops herself from
taking them.

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:31.379
Instead, Megan asks Lisa for help.

00:09:31.379 --> 00:09:35.120
She shows her the figure on the footage and
explains the hooded man's claims about Hannah.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.870
But Lisa spots her pills and accuses her of
relapsing.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.610
Lisa believes that Megan sees things due to
her brain wanting her to retake the pills.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.680
She scolds her for believing in the illusion
but affirms Megan that she trusts her enough

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.730
to leave the bottle of pills with her.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.329
Lisa leaves, taking the stairway to have a
smoke.

00:09:49.329 --> 00:09:51.550
While she's alone, blood drops on her hands.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:55.310
Looking up, she spots Dave from the upper
stairs and heads up, worried that he's hurt.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.399
She finds the lifeless Dave standing in a
corner then runs when Hannah's corpse scrambles

00:09:58.399 --> 00:09:59.509
towards her.

00:09:59.509 --> 00:10:02.779
Lisa reaches the hospital's rooftop, searching
for the strange figure.

00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:05.899
The lights flash, revealing Hannah standing
on the other side.

00:10:05.899 --> 00:10:07.710
Lisa is lifted into the air as Hannah approaches
her.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.639
Her limbs distort in awkward angles until
she drops dead.

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:15.370
Back in the morgue, Megan receives an alert
that Randy has brought in a new body.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.800
She refuses to help him this time, given that
the hooded man slipped in earlier when she

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.800
did.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.880
Megan shows Randy the corpse again, pointing
out that the gash on her side is gone and

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.649
that her arm is no longer bent.

00:10:24.649 --> 00:10:28.050
Megan shares her theory that Hannah is healing
herself, given that she was supposed to have

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:31.459
died three months ago after an exorcism and
that the hooded man claimed that she's not

00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:32.699
really dead.

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:36.040
Noting her skills, Randy wonders why she's
even working the night shift at a morgue but

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.410
drops the question upon seeing her reaction.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:42.399
Instead, he shares how he used to have a drinking
problem until his son was born, giving him

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:44.630
a reason to straighten out his life.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.970
Unbeknownst to them, Hannah's wounds continue
to heal behind them.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.660
Inspired by Randy's honesty, Megan calls Andrew
after Randy leaves.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.129
While she confesses that she did keep his
bottle of Xanax, the elevator opens behind

00:10:55.129 --> 00:10:58.790
Megan, and Hannah crawls inside, her body
continuing to heal.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.149
Back at the intake bay, Randy places back
the gurney inside the ambulance when he hears

00:11:02.149 --> 00:11:04.160
the alarm on his driver's seat door.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.959
He finds the door open and checks inside but
sees nothing wrong.

00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:10.249
He gets in, checking behind to make sure that
there's nobody in the vehicle.

00:11:10.249 --> 00:11:13.580
Once convinced, he starts the ambulance but
runs over something while driving out of the

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.580
garage.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.980
He looks under the car, seeing nothing under.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.970
His phone rings, but when he answers it, the
connection breaks.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.810
The lights begin to flicker, and Randy looks
around, hearing movement.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.060
Having noticed the elevator door close behind
her, Megan checks the security footage to

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.089
find that Hannah's body has crawled inside
the elevator.

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:34.010
In the parking area, Hannah's broken corpse
chases after Randy, trapping him between two

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.149
ambulances.

00:11:35.149 --> 00:11:37.410
Hannah crawls over him and breaks his neck.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.620
Megan reaches the parking area, desperately
searching for Randy.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.300
But she's too late; she finds him lifeless
in front of an ambulance.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.819
Andrew calls to warn Megan that the hooded
man escaped.

00:11:46.819 --> 00:11:50.189
The hooded man ambushes Megan from behind,
holding her at gunpoint as she takes him to

00:11:50.189 --> 00:11:52.040
the morgue to show Hannah's body.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.500
After everything she'd seen, Megan assures
him that she believes him now.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.950
Trusting her, the hooded man reveals that
he's Hannah's father, Grainger, and he cannot

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.690
allow the evil thing inside his daughter's
body to win.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.249
Grainger recounts how Hannah struggled with
depression until the demon was able to get

00:12:05.249 --> 00:12:06.249
inside.

00:12:06.249 --> 00:12:08.439
That's when Hannah's color changed from brown
to blue.

00:12:08.439 --> 00:12:11.999
Even after Hannah died in the exorcism, her
body disappeared, leaving the people in the

00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:13.810
mortuary dead in her wake.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.370
He wonders why Hannah hasn't killed Megan
yet.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.720
Megan prepares the incinerator, convinced
that it's the only way to end it.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.779
But Hannah wakes up, touching Megan fondly
before grabbing her neck.

00:12:22.779 --> 00:12:25.620
Grainger breaks Hannah's wrist and throws
Megan out of the way before getting pushed

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.160
into the incinerator, burning alive.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.720
With the father gone, Hannah turns to Megan,
who struggles to escape.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.709
She tries to open the doors, but her entry
pass won't work.

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:38.019
Megan runs to the elevators, which closes
just before Hannah gets in.

00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:41.690
Taking a moment to breathe, Megan jumps when
Hannah appears behind her just as the elevator

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.249
doors open to the mezzanine.

00:12:43.249 --> 00:12:46.079
Megan struggles to walk, with Hannah still
on her trail.

00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:49.820
Meanwhile, Andrew finds Megan's phone in the
parking lot near Randy's body.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.089
He radios for back-up but gets distracted
when the doors to the intake bay open and

00:12:53.089 --> 00:12:54.170
close.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:57.649
At the mezzanine, Megan struggles to move,
allowing Hannah to crawl up to her and put

00:12:57.649 --> 00:12:59.230
her to sleep.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.339
Downstairs, Andrew heads to the morgue, searching
for Megan.

00:13:02.339 --> 00:13:04.379
Hannah hears him and drags Megan away.

00:13:04.379 --> 00:13:07.500
Andrew searches in the dark with only his
flashlight to illuminate his way.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.800
He looks around, not knowing that Megan is
inside the refrigerated drawers where Lisa's

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.790
and Dave's bodies are as well.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:15.529
Outside, Andrew finds Ernie, who's searching
for Dave.

00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:19.160
The two rush back to the morgue upon hearing
one of the doors snap open.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.610
Megan has escaped from the drawers, warning
them to flee.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.300
A screeching noise blares in their ears, and
Ernie spots Hannah in a corner.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.750
The three run for the elevators, but Hannah
catches Ernie and slits his throat, healing

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.009
her own wound.

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:33.720
She telepathically lifts Andrew in midair,
stretching his limbs.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.689
Seeing herself back in the same situation,
Megan refuses to freeze in fear.

00:13:37.689 --> 00:13:40.990
She stares down at Hannah, who is confused
at her sudden bravado.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.069
Hannah backs away as Megan grabs Andrew's
gun and shoots the creature repeatedly until

00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:45.329
she collapses.

00:13:45.329 --> 00:13:49.329
The lights explode, and Andrew falls to the
floor, hurt but alive.

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:52.699
After putting Andrew in the elevator, Megan
checks back on Hannah, seeing that she's still

00:13:52.699 --> 00:13:53.980
on the floor.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.140
Knowing that it's not over yet, Megan tells
Andrew to call for help as the elevator door

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.140
closes.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.699
No longer afraid, Megan drags Hannah's body
into the incinerator.

00:14:01.699 --> 00:14:05.490
With Hannah halfway inside, she grabs Megan,
pulling her inside with her.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.760
Hannah screams in pain as Megan wrestles her
off, closing the doors to finally end the

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.760
nightmare.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.470
Tired, Megan stays in the morgue, throwing
her rubber ball against the wall as the police

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.149
finally arrive.

00:14:15.149 --> 00:14:18.370
Weeks later, Megan celebrates being sixty-two
days clean.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.290
As her body heals, she jogs faster and feels
stronger.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.420
She looks at herself in the mirror, spotting
a fly landing on it.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:33.889
She swats the fly with her bare hands, knowing
that nothing can stop her now.
