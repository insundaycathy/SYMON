00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.040
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to explain&nbsp;
a horror film called "The Devil's Rejects."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.200
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.720
Somewhere in Ruggsville&nbsp;
County, Texas, a man named Tiny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.760
drags a woman's lifeless body across the&nbsp;
woods. But he stops and removes a burlap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.680
sack covering his burnt face when he sees a squad&nbsp;
of police cars heading towards the Firefly house.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.840
When the police arrive at their destination,&nbsp;
they park their cars and prepare themselves for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.960
a shootout. The family sleeps inside, oblivious to&nbsp;
the arrival of the authorities. As they get into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.760
position, Sheriff John Quincy Wydell utters&nbsp;
some encouragement to Officer Ray Dobson,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.200
saying that dying is not an option for them. He&nbsp;
grabs the speaker box and calls out to the family,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.120
telling them that they're surrounded. The family&nbsp;
immediately wakes up and scrambles to grab their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:51.280
weapons. Baby asks Rufus Jr. if he's seen Tiny&nbsp;
around, but Rufus says he didn't. Mama Firely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.080
tells her that Tiny went out the previous night.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.040
As Mother Firefly puts on an iron mask as a&nbsp;
shield, she reminisces when Baby was born, saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.120
she looked like an angel. The rest of the family&nbsp;
puts on their masks and prepares to fire back at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.160
the police. Outside, the Sheriff tells his men to&nbsp;
get ready and starts counting to three. Bullets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.400
begin to fly as soon as he finishes counting. Otis&nbsp;
fires his Armalite and hits a cop. He also hits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.960
Wydell, causing him to stagger, but the Sheriff&nbsp;
remains alive due to the bulletproof vest. Wydell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.200
fires his shotgun repeatedly at the windows as&nbsp;
he slowly walks toward the house. Before reaching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.280
the door, he orders the men to stop firing and&nbsp;
tells Dobson to throw tear gas into the house.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.760
The firefight continues inside the house&nbsp;
as the family refuses to surrender.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.760
Rufus, who is wearing full body armor,&nbsp;
hits several officers in the shootout.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.680
The family takes cover in the kitchen as&nbsp;
the cops start firing at Rufus repeatedly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.680
Rufus eventually dies despite his thick&nbsp;
body armor. Mother Firefly rushes over to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.000
him while Otis and Baby make a run for it. The&nbsp;
Sheriff tells Mother Firefly to stop moving,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.760
but she grabs a gun and points it to her head.&nbsp;
She tells the Sheriff that she won't let them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.400
get her. Mother Firefly then pulls the trigger,&nbsp;
but she's out of bullets. Baby and Otis make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.360
their way out of the house through a tunnel in&nbsp;
the basement, where they keep their prisoners.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.760
A nurse driving down the road sees Baby lying&nbsp;
on the ground, so she gets out of the car to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.160
check on her. While the nurse tries to listen to&nbsp;
what she's saying, Baby holds her down while Otis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.160
sneaks up on her and stabs her in the back.&nbsp;
They steal the nurse's car and drive away.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.000
Meanwhile, the Sheriff tells his men to search&nbsp;
the vicinity for Otis and Baby while the others&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.800
raid the house. Inside they see severed heads&nbsp;
in refrigerators and skulls used as decorations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.200
In the crawl space of the house, they find several&nbsp;
decomposing bodies. Dobson calls the Sheriff's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.440
attention to a notebook containing pictures of&nbsp;
the family's victims. Wydell recognizes a clown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.720
who appears in many of the photos, grinning&nbsp;
with glee while posing with the victims.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.680
Captain Spaulding watches himself on&nbsp;
T.V. with delight as he promotes his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.520
new attraction featuring Mary the Monkey.&nbsp;
However, his mood soon changes when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.360
commercial is suddenly interrupted by a news&nbsp;
update about the raid at the Firefly house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.800
Before he could pay close attention to the&nbsp;
news, he receives a phone call from Baby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.080
telling him that he has to hide from&nbsp;
the police. Spaulding tells Baby that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.440
he'll meet them at the Kahiki Palms Motel&nbsp;
as they've planned in cases of emergency.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.720
Spaulding soon contacts his adopted brother,&nbsp;
Charlie, telling him that he will come over to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.280
his brothel to hide for a while. Charlie says it&nbsp;
might not be a good idea, but Spaulding insists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.360
on coming. Unfortunately, Spaulding leaves&nbsp;
the phone hanging before Charlie could balk.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.480
Otis and Baby arrive at the motel, but Baby&nbsp;
is irked that Spaulding is not there yet. Otis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.840
becomes enraged when he hears the news mentioning&nbsp;
Spaulding as a crime suspect on the radio.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.480
Meanwhile, a traveling band called "Banjo &amp;&nbsp;
Sullivan" is also checking into the same motel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.440
Roy Sullivan, who sings for the band, meets&nbsp;
Baby while getting some ice for his wife.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.640
Baby soon starts flirting with Roy by talking&nbsp;
dirty to him. Roy, shocked by what he's hearing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.560
asks her to repeat the things she said.&nbsp;
In the band's room, Roy's wife Gloria&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.960
watches a talk show discussing crimes&nbsp;
that seemed to be linked to Satanism.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.840
She asks their bandmate, Adam Banjo, to switch the&nbsp;
channel because she's getting bored with the show.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.080
Back outside, Baby asks Roy if&nbsp;
he wants to take her to his room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.200
Roy tells her that his wife is there,&nbsp;
but Baby insists on going anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.440
She threatens him, saying his brother will&nbsp;
shoot him if he doesn't take her to their room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.080
Otis suddenly turns up behind&nbsp;
him, pointing a gun at his head.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.680
Gloria asks Adam to switch the channel again, so&nbsp;
he grudgingly complies. Baby and Otis abruptly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.400
storm into the room while pointing a gun at Roy.&nbsp;
The duo tells the group to sit on the bed. Otis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.240
hears the shower running and asks Adam who's&nbsp;
in the bathroom. Adam tries to stop him from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.200
going inside, but Otis shoves him to the bed. Otis&nbsp;
goes into the toilet and drags Adam's wife, Wendy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.360
out to the bedroom. When he&nbsp;
asks if everyone is in the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.760
Roy nods, but their roadie, Jimmy,&nbsp;
suddenly knocks on the door.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.400
Baby gets out to greet Jimmy, who thinks&nbsp;
that he knocked on the wrong door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.560
She tells him that he has the right room&nbsp;
and invites him in. Once he's inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.520
Otis forces him down on his knees&nbsp;
and shoots him in the head. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.560
horrified band members scream as they&nbsp;
watch Jimmy's body drop to the floor.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.080
Meanwhile, Spaulding runs out of gas on his way&nbsp;
to the motel. When he pulls over, he sees a mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.080
and a child walking towards their vehicle, so&nbsp;
he approaches them. Spaulding tells the mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.160
he needs their car because he has a "top secret&nbsp;
clown business" that requires his presence. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.400
woman laughs it off, but when she realizes that&nbsp;
Spaulding is serious, he tells her son to lock the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.560
door and walks toward the driver's seat. Spaulding&nbsp;
follows her and knocks her out, and gets inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.960
the car. Before driving away, Spaulding threatens&nbsp;
the child and tells him to get out of the vehicle.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.520
Back at the motel, Baby taunts Roy by&nbsp;
dancing seductively in front of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.320
Otis asks Roy if he's enjoying the show. He&nbsp;
says no because he has a wife. Otis tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.480
Gloria to get up and strip for him to see what&nbsp;
Roy likes so much about her. Gloria reluctantly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.720
removes her clothes after Otis threatens to shoot&nbsp;
someone in the room. Roy covers his face with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.800
hat as Otis starts stroking his wife with his&nbsp;
gun. When Otis puts the gun in her underwear,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.200
she starts kissing him and pretends to enjoy it.&nbsp;
Otis forces her to go down on him, but he gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.920
bored and shoves her away. He then calls Adam&nbsp;
and Roy to take a drive with him in their van.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.000
Wydell arrives at the police station to&nbsp;
interrogate Mother Firefly. He shows him a picture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.280
of her family and tells her that Baby will end&nbsp;
up dead if she doesn't tell them where they are.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.400
Mother Firefly derides him by showing the Sheriff&nbsp;
a picture of Wydell's deceased brother, George,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.960
when the family killed him. The Sheriff strikes&nbsp;
her with a closed fist and shoves her to the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.320
He tells her that he will hunt down her family&nbsp;
and make them experience the same suffering that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.320
their victims felt. Other police officers&nbsp;
pull him away as he starts to strangle her.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.240
Otis makes Adam drive to a junkyard&nbsp;
to take the guns he buried there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.480
Roy asks what he's going to do with them once they&nbsp;
finish the task. He tells them, "that's the end of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.880
the road," implying that he'll kill them. He gets&nbsp;
irritated when they ask him just to let them go,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.600
so he scolds Roy, telling him he's the one calling&nbsp;
the shots. While he yells at Roy, Adam grabs a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.480
large piece of wood and hits Otis on the head.&nbsp;
While Otis is down, he tells Roy to take the gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.880
Adam chokes Otis with the piece of wood, but Otis&nbsp;
manages to grab a knife and stabs Adam in the leg.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.440
As Otis tries to take his gun from Roy, Adam pulls&nbsp;
out the knife and walks toward Otis to stab him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.240
Otis, however, manages to point the gun at Adam&nbsp;
and shoot while Roy was holding the weapon. Adam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.560
gets hit in the neck. Otis hits Roy repeatedly&nbsp;
with the piece of wood and asks Roy to pray before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.880
bashing his head until he dies. He then walks over&nbsp;
to Adam and stabs him repeatedly with the knife.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.840
At the motel, Wendy asks Baby if she could go&nbsp;
to the bathroom. Baby tells her that she has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.280
to do something for her before she can go,&nbsp;
so she asks her to hit Gloria in the face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.560
She hits Gloria lightly, so Baby tells her to do&nbsp;
it harder. She hits her harder, but Baby is still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.520
not satisfied. Baby finally agrees to let Wendy&nbsp;
go to the toilet when she strikes Gloria hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.560
Once inside, she locks the door&nbsp;
and starts yelling for help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.760
When Baby tries to go after her, Gloria&nbsp;
runs to the table to grab the gun.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.240
Baby, hiding a knife behind her, tries&nbsp;
to convince Gloria not to shoot her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.760
saying she's their only hope in surviving&nbsp;
their ordeal because her brother's crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.600
While still pointing a gun at Baby, Gloria&nbsp;
tells Wendy that it's alright to come out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.440
While Gloria is distracted, Baby flings the&nbsp;
knife at Gloria, hitting her in the chest.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.920
Gloria yanks the knife from her chest in&nbsp;
shock. Baby then pulls down her pants,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.760
telling Gloria to go ahead and shoot her. So&nbsp;
Gloria pulls the trigger and finds out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.320
it's not loaded. As Baby pulls her pants back up,&nbsp;
Wendy runs out of the bathroom and sprints toward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.800
the door. As soon as she gets out, she calls&nbsp;
for help by knocking on every room and yelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.200
She runs over to a man, thinking he would help&nbsp;
her. But when she reaches him, Baby calls out to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.280
him, telling him to grab Wendy. Spaulding then&nbsp;
headbutts Wendy, knocking her to the ground.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.360
At the police station, Dobson learns that&nbsp;
Captain Spaulding is one of the characters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.280
from a Marx Brothers movie. They contact a&nbsp;
movie critic who lists all the Marx brothers'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.360
significant characters and a list of films that&nbsp;
featured Groucho. Wydell looks at the list and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.680
discovers that all the aliases used by the Firefly&nbsp;
family were characters from Marx brothers' movies.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.320
Back at the motel, Otis bursts into the room to&nbsp;
scare off the people inside by wearing Adam's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.040
face as a mask. As they prepare to leave, Baby&nbsp;
asks Spaulding what they should do with Wendy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.960
Spaulding hints that they should let the maid deal&nbsp;
with her in the morning. Otis says he has a better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.840
idea. He then shows Wendy the detached face of&nbsp;
Adam and puts it on her face. When the maid goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.080
inside to clean up the next day, she finds the&nbsp;
dead bodies of Gloria and Jimmy in the bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.440
As she is heading out, she sees Wendy hanging&nbsp;
on the front door with her husband's face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.480
strapped to her head. Wendy falls on top of the&nbsp;
maid and tries to ask her for help. The maid,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.520
however, breaks free and runs out&nbsp;
of the room. Wendy follows her out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.280
but she soon decides to run to the middle&nbsp;
of the road and flag the cars down for help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.720
Unfortunately, a truck runs over her,&nbsp;
leaving her entrails scattered on the road.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.280
Wydell arrives at the scene and asks the maid if&nbsp;
she saw Spaulding and his kids, but she said she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.960
never came across them. Wydell then meets&nbsp;
with a pair of bounty hunters named Rondo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.800
and Billy Ray Snapper to&nbsp;
help him track down the trio.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.840
Later that night, Wydell stops by the Firefly&nbsp;
house and goes to the basement. He sees a man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.600
sitting on the couch and points the gun at him,&nbsp;
thinking that he is Spaulding. When he takes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.920
closer look, he sees his deceased brother George.&nbsp;
He tells Wydell that he's living in the Firefly's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.240
basement now, and he can't rest until every&nbsp;
member of the Firefly family is dead. He asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.320
Wydell to kill them. Wydell soon wakes up from the&nbsp;
dream in his office upon hearing the phone ring.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.400
Rondo has called Wydell to let him know that&nbsp;
he tracked a guy using the alias Wolf J.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.520
Flywheel and he has a partner who&nbsp;
refers to himself as The Captain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.560
Rondo went on to inform him that&nbsp;
Flywheel's real name is Charlie Altamont.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.400
Wydell pays a visit to Mother Firefly&nbsp;
in jail and tells the guard to go home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.800
She immediately starts taunting him, saying&nbsp;
she knew he wouldn't be able to resist her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.200
Mother Firefly then asks him if he enjoys doing&nbsp;
it rough. Wydell indulges her and picks her up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.120
from the ground, telling her that he'd rather&nbsp;
do it slowly. As Mother Firefly continues to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.800
provoke him, Wydell suddenly stabs her in&nbsp;
the chest. After watching the light fade&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.240
away from her eyes, Wydell pulls the knife&nbsp;
out of her chest and tosses it on the table.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.840
The murderous trio soon arrives at&nbsp;
Charlie's brothel to hide there for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.560
After catching up with Charlie on old times,&nbsp;
the three go inside to party with his girls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.800
Charlie goes to a farm the following day to buy&nbsp;
fresh chickens for Spaulding. However, Wydell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.040
blocks them on their way out and asks them about&nbsp;
the clown. When Charlie pretends not to know him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.120
Wydell pulls the truck's door to squeeze Charlie's&nbsp;
fingers. The Sheriff tells Charlie to make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.280
that Spaulding and his kids are at the brothel at&nbsp;
midnight, threatening to shoot him if he refuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.880
Wydell visits Rondo and Billy Ray to tell them&nbsp;
that he wants the Captain and his kids alive.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.600
That night, Charlie and Spaulding enjoy drinks&nbsp;
while Otis is in bed with a girl named Candy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.840
Baby is enjoying a bath while talking&nbsp;
to Cassey, a worker at the brothel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.240
When Cassey goes to the fridge to get a drink&nbsp;
for Baby, Rondo grabs her and slashes her neck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.160
Meanwhile, Billy Ray interrupts Candy and Otis&nbsp;
while they're fooling around with each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.440
Candy grabs a gun and points it at&nbsp;
Billy, but he shoots her in the head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.760
Otis attacks Billy, but the bounty hunter throws&nbsp;
him out the window. When Rondo comes across Baby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.880
he immediately tells her to get&nbsp;
out of the bathtub and get dressed.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.880
Wydell soon shows up inside the brothel to&nbsp;
confront Spaulding while he's enjoying a smoke.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.640
The Sheriff chugs down a shot of liquor and slams&nbsp;
the glass on the bar before facing the clown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.480
Spaulding is surprised to see Wydell,&nbsp;
but he soon starts provoking him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.520
He tells the Sheriff to make sure he's dead&nbsp;
when he shoots because when he comes back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.080
he'll make him suffer. Wydell shoots Spaulding&nbsp;
in the leg and takes him outside. Charlie stands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.520
around and watches Rondo and Billy Ray&nbsp;
load the three killers into the truck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.800
Charlie tells Spaulding not to take the betrayal&nbsp;
personally because it was just business.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.720
Wydell brings the family back to their&nbsp;
house and ties them up in the basement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.560
The Sheriff tells them that his family has always&nbsp;
been involved in vigilante justice, even though he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.160
wanted to follow the rules at one point. He&nbsp;
then shows them a picture of a girl who was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.800
found in their house. Otis, without any remorse,&nbsp;
recalls that he cut her tongue out and tied her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.800
his bed for a month. Wydell walks over to him&nbsp;
and staples the picture to his chest, telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.880
him that he can have the photo as a souvenir.
When he shows them another image, Baby tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.200
that she's her victim. So, he staples the photo&nbsp;
to Baby's chest and hits her face with a bottle.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.080
Later, the Sheriff shows Spaulding a picture&nbsp;
of his late brother. Spaulding starts insulting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.000
Wydell's brother, so the Sheriff proceeds&nbsp;
to electrocute him with a cattle prod. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.680
proceeds to beat Spaulding repeatedly with&nbsp;
the prod before using it to shock Otis.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.000
He then shows Baby a picture of Mother Firefly and&nbsp;
tells her that he killed the woman the other day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.520
Baby refuses to believe him, but he&nbsp;
assures her that the photos are real.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.000
He goes on to tell Baby that he&nbsp;
has something special just for her.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.640
Wydell goes back to Otis to nail his hands to the&nbsp;
armrest of the chair, mocking him as he pounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:23.120
on the nail. He goes on to untie Baby and tells&nbsp;
her to run while the other two are unconscious.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.360
The Sheriff pours gasoline on&nbsp;
the floor and lights it up.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.360
While running from Wydell, Baby goes inside&nbsp;
the barn to look for something she can use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.120
as a weapon. Charlie suddenly grabs her from&nbsp;
behind, telling her to calm down so he could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.680
help her get away. Charlie takes her to his car&nbsp;
and tells her to stay put. As he is leaving,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.280
Wydell shows up and hacks him with an ax.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.680
As Baby tries to get away, the Sheriff&nbsp;
shoots her in the leg. He then starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.760
hitting her with a bullwhip and tries to choke&nbsp;
her to death. As he continues to attack Baby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.760
Tiny appears behind him and grabs him by the&nbsp;
neck. Tiny twists Wydell's neck and drops him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.080
to the ground. As Baby catches her breath, she&nbsp;
tells Tiny that Otis and Spaulding are still in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.160
the house. Tiny goes inside to pull out the&nbsp;
nails from Otis' hands and untie Spaulding.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.760
After getting out of the house, the trio gets&nbsp;
inside the car and says farewell to Tiny,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.560
who goes back to their burning home. The family&nbsp;
drives away, feeling weary from their ordeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.160
Spaulding and Baby fall asleep in the&nbsp;
back of the convertible while Otis drives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.320
However, he stops when he comes across a&nbsp;
roadblock. Instead of turning back, he wakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.320
up the two in the backseat and hands them their&nbsp;
weapons. Baby gets up on the backseat and aims&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.480
her revolver at the cops, prompting them to get&nbsp;
into position and shoot back at them. While Otis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.240
drives toward the roadblock, the police shower&nbsp;
the trio with bullets hitting them multiple times.
