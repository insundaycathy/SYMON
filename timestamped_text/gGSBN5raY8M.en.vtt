00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.040
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today, I'm&nbsp;
going to explain an American-Australian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.400
science fiction thriller film called “2:22.”&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.960
The movie starts as a man walks through the Grand&nbsp;
Central Station, New York, with a gun in his hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.840
People around him notice the gun and start&nbsp;
running away. He walks to another man who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.120
seems to be protecting a girl. Both the men point&nbsp;
guns at each other when the security stops them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.200
The camera pans to a clock, which&nbsp;
shows that the time is exactly 2:22.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.640
Then, we can hear gunshots. 
Turns out it was just a dream. A man named&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.440
Dylan wakes up from his dream, and progresses&nbsp;
with his routine; listening to the news. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.080
news talks about a star called Hamlin that died&nbsp;
out 30 years ago, but its light is reaching the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.400
Earth 30 years later, and that this supernova will&nbsp;
have effects on the Earth and its inhabitants. 
&nbsp;

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.960
Dylan is then shown on his way to work,&nbsp;
riding a bike and heading to the Grand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.360
Central Station to take the train. He works&nbsp;
as an air traffic controller with serious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.800
talent in visualizing patterns. After work, he&nbsp;
goes to a club...drinking with his co-workers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.400
and receives a ticket to an aerial ballet&nbsp;
as a gift for his upcoming birthday. 
&nbsp;

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.080
The following day, at work, he starts to&nbsp;
see constellation patterns in front of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.120
He starts to hallucinate about his recurring dream&nbsp;
and cannot communicate with airplanes. He looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.720
at the clock to see it is exactly 2:22. Looking&nbsp;
closely, he realizes that the clock has stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.080
Dylan comes back to his senses only when his&nbsp;
colleagues call him. Dylan notices that the planes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.040
are about to crash into each other due to his&nbsp;
pause. He quickly reports to the pilots and saves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.320
them from crashing by an inch. The passengers&nbsp;
inside the planes are relieved. Dylan notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.200
that the clock has started working again. Due to&nbsp;
this incident, he is suspended for four weeks.
&nbsp;

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.280
The day after he was suspended, he attends the&nbsp;
aerial ballet, where he sees a woman named Sarah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.720
and is stunned by her beauty. After the ballet&nbsp;
is over, everyone is at the after-party. Dylan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.240
approaches Sarah and introduces himself. They go&nbsp;
to a restaurant and start talking. Dylan tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.720
Sarah that his father was a pilot and that he also&nbsp;
trained to be a pilot but could never become one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.760
as he was afraid of flying. Sarah tells him&nbsp;
that she works at the Howard Pace Art Gallery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.320
He also tells her about being suspended from&nbsp;
work, and he finds out that Sarah was on the plane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.840
that almost collided with the other aircraft at&nbsp;
2.22pm. Dylan felt apologetic about the incident,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.200
but Sarah was instead thankful towards Dylan for&nbsp;
saving her life. As they depart, they admit to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.200
each other that for a "first date", they felt a&nbsp;
deep connection and it felt like they had known&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.200
each other forever.
The following day, while on the way to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.960
Grand Central, Dylan notices the&nbsp;
same happenings as the day before;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.680
siren, a woman&nbsp;laugh, construction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.600
sounds, a man saying&nbsp;
"May I help you", and glass breaking. As he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.680
arrives at the Grand Central Station, at 2:21 pm,&nbsp;
he sees a businessman reading his newspaper, a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.400
couple hugging each other, a line of preschoolers&nbsp;
where the last child in line drops something,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.000
and a pregnant woman under the clock. At exactly&nbsp;
2:22 pm, the window of the station shatters.
&nbsp;

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.360
He then goes to meet Sarah and asks her out to&nbsp;
an early dinner. He goes to Central Park with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.000
her for ice cream. Sarah reveals that she&nbsp;
had stopped dancing because of an injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.720
Dylan feels bad, so to cheer her up, he plays&nbsp;
a song and starts dancing in front of her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.720
She joins him and the two happily dance&nbsp;
together in the middle of a busy park.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.880
In the end, they kiss. They go to&nbsp;
Dylan's apartment and make love. 
&nbsp;

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.040
The next morning, they lie on the bed and cuddle.&nbsp;
Dylan asks Sarah where she got her necklace from,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.680
to which Sarah replies that it was from her&nbsp;
ex-boyfriend; Jonas, who happens to be the main&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.560
artist of the gallery at which she works. Dylan&nbsp;
asks when is Sarah's birthday and they find out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.920
that both of them were born on the same day; April&nbsp;
18, 1986, and they are both turning 30 within a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.840
week's time. Dylan suddenly hears a car crash on&nbsp;
the road below his apartment at exactly 9:15 am,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.680
and he tells Sarah that it is the 3rd day in&nbsp;
a row that the same incident had happened.
&nbsp;

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.680
Dylan then takes a cab... going to Grand&nbsp;
Central. As the driver takes the shorter route,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.560
Dylan tells him to stop the cab and notices&nbsp;
again the same pattern of siren, a woman laugh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.440
construction sounds, and a man saying "May I&nbsp;
help you". Dylan then shouts for the cab to stop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.560
and this infuriates the cab driver, who turns&nbsp;
around to tell Dylan off...for shouting at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.840
Just then, another car hits them both, causing the&nbsp;
breaking of the cab's glass windows. Even though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.560
Dylan is injured, he goes to the Grand Central&nbsp;
Station and sees the exact same pattern of events.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.480
A businessman stands with a newspaper, an older&nbsp;
couple hugs, a group of kids walks in a line when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.720
the last kid drops something, and lastly,&nbsp;
a pregnant woman stands under the clock.
&nbsp;

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.400
He tells Sarah of these repeating&nbsp;
patterns, but with different people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.080
carrying out the same actions. 
Sarah does not believe Dylan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.640
but helps to clean his wounds from the car&nbsp;
accident. Dylan goes home and starts writing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.080
all the events of his day...starting from 9.10&nbsp;
am. First, he writes about the drop of water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.600
then a bug dying, and a plane flying overhead.
The following day, Dylan goes to the top of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.160
apartment building to see if the pattern repeats&nbsp;
itself. He waits for the drop of water like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.320
yesterday, but the sky is clear. However, exactly&nbsp;
at 9:10 again, a drop falls onto his notebook.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.080
Surprised, he closes the notebook and when he&nbsp;
opens it, there is a squashed bug on the page.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.840
Then an airplane flies over him. The pattern has&nbsp;
repeated itself; Dylan almost cannot believe it.
&nbsp;

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.080
Dylan goes to the gallery looking for Sarah,&nbsp;
and realizes that the gallery was having an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.880
exhibition with Jonas' art piece as the main&nbsp;
exhibition. Jonas is Sarah's ex-boyfriend;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.680
he has created a light hologram exhibition about&nbsp;
the Grand Central Station, and Dylan sees that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.800
is exactly like the events that he has experienced&nbsp;
in the past few days. A businessman reading his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.760
newspaper, a couple embracing each other, a line&nbsp;
of preschoolers, and a pregnant woman under the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.040
clocks. Dylan assumes that Jonas is stalking&nbsp;
him, as only Dylan knows about these events.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.680
He attacks Jonas, resulting in a brawl; he&nbsp;
questions Jonas on whether he was stalking him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.400
In the audience... is the owner of the&nbsp;
Keifer Gallery; he applauds saying it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.560
a great idea to enact the murder at the Grand&nbsp;
Central Station that happened 30 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.840
Sarah apologizes to Jonas about Dylan's attack,&nbsp;
and puts her relationship with Dylan on hold.
&nbsp;

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.760
Later that day, Dylan texts Sarah to beg for her&nbsp;
forgiveness. In the meantime, he finds a stack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.480
of envelopes hidden in his home. He finds out a&nbsp;
man named Jake Redman had written these letters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.520
to a woman named Evelyn. Upon investigation,&nbsp;
Dylan finds out that Jake Redmond lived in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.680
his apartment 30 years ago...back in 1987. 
He also finds an article online and finds out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.400
about the murder that happened thirty years ago&nbsp;
in grand central. Jake Redmond was the murderer;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.680
he killed his lover, Evelyn, and a&nbsp;
police officer in the middle of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.080
Grand Central. 
Evelyn was even pregnant at that time. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.560
murder occurred exactly at 2:22. Jake&nbsp;
killed Evelyn out of jealousy because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.200
Evelyn was in love with the police officer,&nbsp;
Noah Marks, whom Jake killed that day too. 
&nbsp;

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.560
He also finds that Jake, Evelyn, him,&nbsp;
and Sarah share the same birthday.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.840
In fact, he and Sarah were born on the day&nbsp;
Jake and Evelyn died. Dylan connects the dots,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.880
and figures out that he and Sarah are Jake and&nbsp;
Evelyn in another life. Then he finds Evelyn’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.520
address in the letters, and visits her home. 
Dylan meets Evelyn’s sister who tells her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.160
Evelyn loved Jake a lot, so she thinks the theory&nbsp;
that Jake killed Evelyn because she loved someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.320
else is false. She also informs him that Noah,&nbsp;
the police officer, was in love with Evelyn too.
&nbsp;

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.000
When Dylan gets back home, he links&nbsp;
the constellation that is taking place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.320
after thirty years and their situation. He&nbsp;
sees that the three stars involved in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:40.640
constellation are actually Jake, Evelyn, and&nbsp;
Noah. Currently, it is Dylan, Sarah, and Jonas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.360
Since the constellation has returned, their fate&nbsp;
has returned too. He texts Sarah about what he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.400
has been seeing, and asks her to meet him. Sarah&nbsp;
is in the gallery looking at Jonas’s holograms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.360
She tells Jonas about Dylan’s findings, but&nbsp;
Jonas dismisses it as Dylan’s delusions. 
&nbsp;

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.280
Later that day, Dylan is in his&nbsp;
apartment when Sarah visits him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.320
She sees him distressed and tries to console&nbsp;
him. Dylan tells her that since the following&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.480
day is their birthday, there is a chance&nbsp;
he can kill her... like Jake killed Evelyn.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.240
So, he tells her to go away and never&nbsp;
meet him again for their own good.
&nbsp;

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.400
After Sarah leaves, Dylan loses control and starts&nbsp;
breaking things around his apartment. He then goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.320
to the terrace with the intention of jumping&nbsp;
off the building, but he changes his mind. 
&nbsp;

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.600
Sarah, on the other hand, goes to Jonas’s&nbsp;
office and tells him everything that happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.200
Jonas offers to take her on vacation&nbsp;
to get her mind off Dylan. 
&nbsp;

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.280
The following morning, Dylan realizes that the&nbsp;
water drop, the bug, the plane, and everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.920
that happens in the pattern...happened to Jake the&nbsp;
day he died. The pattern has been trying to inform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:47.840
Dylan that Sarah is in danger. After figuring this&nbsp;
out, Dylan runs to save her. He calls her several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:53.040
times on the way but she doesn’t pick up.
So, he goes to Jonas’s office. There,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.280
he is shocked to see a wall filled with&nbsp;
Sarah’s pictures and several holograms of her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.160
He realizes that Jonas is obsessed with&nbsp;
Sarah. He also finds an empty case of a gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.381
and is now sure that Sarah is in danger.&nbsp;
He rushes to the station to find her. 
&nbsp;

00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:11.280
Meanwhile, Jonas and Sarah are in the Grand&nbsp;
Central station buying the tickets for their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.400
journey. Jonas tells Sarah to wait for him&nbsp;
under the clock. History is repeating itself.
&nbsp;

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.320
Jonas returns to her with the tickets. He&nbsp;
too realizes that they are living their past.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.520
Sarah tells him that she cannot go with&nbsp;
him because she is in love with Dylan. 
&nbsp;

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.040
Agitated, he asks Sarah to tell him that she&nbsp;
loves him, but Sarah refuses just as Dylan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.920
arrives at the Station. Jonas, thinking that&nbsp;
Sarah called him there, gets enraged and makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:41.680
his way towards Dylan with a gun. Sarah begins to&nbsp;
see the same characters that Dylan had described.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.360
The businessman, the couple who&nbsp;
hugs, the children, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.640
She comes to realize that&nbsp;
everything that Dylan said was true.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.400
But that also means the pregnant woman&nbsp;
under the clock is Sarah herself.
&nbsp;

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.840
Jonas first points his gun towards Dylan, and then&nbsp;
he points to Sarah; saying that if he couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:04.240
have her, neither could Dylan. Dylan shields Sarah&nbsp;
just in time; but he gets shot at 2:21 pm.
&nbsp;

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:10.160
The events from 30 years ago plays out, and at&nbsp;
exactly 2:22 pm, Jonas gets shot by the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.360
who have followed Dylan there. Dylan falls in&nbsp;
Sarah's arms and momentarily closes his eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.840
He has visions of Jake and Evelyn being&nbsp;
affectionate. Luckily, he does not die.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:26.080
Sarah then looks at the clock; it is 2.23 pm; they&nbsp;
manage to survive, and fate has changed.   
&nbsp;

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.560
We finally get to know that in the past life&nbsp;
too, the police officer Noah was the one who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.880
killed Evelyn and Jake, but the police had turned&nbsp;
the story around to save their reputation.
&nbsp;

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.320
The dying star, Hamlin, mentioned at the&nbsp;
start of the movie finally disappears but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.560
a new star is immediately reborn.
In the ending scene, it is shown that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.640
Dylan and Sarah are living happily, with&nbsp;
Dylan having finally overcome his fear of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.720
flying and is now a pilot; and Sarah smiling&nbsp;
affectionately at their baby in the cradle.
