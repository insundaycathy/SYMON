00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.470
In a busy restaurant, a girl in a hoodie enters
to order a burger and a drink.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.939
The cashier looks at her surprisedly.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.379
The staff even shock seeing the girl’s disable
hand when she makes the payment.

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.309
As she goes inside, everybody stares at her.

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.130
The girl keeps covering her face when a boy
asks his mother if something terrible happens

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.130
to her.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.330
The girl suddenly flips the table and shouts
at people, saying that she’s had enough.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.349
She runs out of the restaurant and can’t
stop crying.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.340
What makes people scared of the girl?

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.320
This is Movie Shortens.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.070
Follow us to the movie titled: The Final.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.220
Be aware: there are spoilers!

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.350
Sometimes earlier in high school, Bradley
checks on his locker for a Halloween costume

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.460
party flyer next week.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.070
He then comes to the class and bullies a boy
named Ravi.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.100
When the teacher asks him to leave Ravi alone,
Bernard changes the seat for Bradley and Ravi

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.090
again gets hit in the face.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.860
After class, the three hotties: Heather, Bridget,
and Kelly walk straight to Emily, a Goth girl,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.840
and try to mean to the girl, making her cry
and feel ashamed.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.740
Meanwhile, two nerd boys, Dane and Jack, are
setting up some bear traps in a farm.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.290
A man named Parker comes over and offers to
fix the traps.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.230
Dane reluctantly refuses, saying he can figure
it out by himself.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.510
At the school lunch, the outcast students
including Ravi, Emily, Dane, Jack, Andy and

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.860
the Triplets are discussing a plan for the
upcoming party.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.540
They look at the popular boys and gals, and
think they have prepared a perfect horror

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.880
night for their friends.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.810
Suddenly, a milk box is thrown at Ravi’s
table.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.150
The boy calmly brings the milk back to the
bullied kids, who are laughing at their good

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.150
prank.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.780
They even smear Ravi for fun, knowing the
boy would never react.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.120
The bully kids are: Bradly, Tommy, Bernard
and the hotties girls.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.330
Kurtis, a friend of the two groups, comes
and shares about his very first commercial

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.330
TV gig.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.180
He invites the outcasts to his shooting on
Friday.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.000
When Kurtis leaves, Dane tells the team to
make sure Kurtis doesn't make the party.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.630
Ravi says Kurtis is not one of the bullies
and he’s a good friend.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.540
At home, while Emily writes her journal, her
mother opens the door and asks about the packed

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.540
boxes around her room.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.170
The mother also shares a concern as Emily
seems quiet recently.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.170
The girl just assures her mother that she’s
doing alright.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.320
Meanwhile, Dane looks at himself in the mirror
and points an empty gun at his head.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.230
He comforts himself not to be afraid anymore
when the “final '' comes while there are

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.420
noises of fighting from his parents downstairs.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.060
At Ravi’s home, no one talks or even looks
at each other during the meal.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.810
Jack also has a cold father, who doesn't even
look at him when Jack talks to him at the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.810
garage.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.370
At the video shooting, Tommy and Bradley attack
Dane and Ravi in the toilet.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.230
Bradley tells Dane the reason they enjoy confronting
him is that he’s a coward and none of the

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.420
outcasts can stop this.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.310
Tommy then breaks Ravi’s camera for no reason.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.220
Dane assures Ravi that the two of them will
get rid of them soon.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.310
Later at the canteen, Kurtis fights with Bradley
for his torment to Ravi earlier, telling him

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.920
to leave the boy alone.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.930
The Halloween party is held by the outcast
students.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.960
It would be a costume party at Dane’s farmhouse
and they invite all the bullies on purpose.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.740
Jack and Dane predict the party would be so
well prepared that the bullies will never

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.740
forget.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.107
The two then check on the weapons for the
decorations of the Halloween theme.

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:14.810
Later, the outcast kids gather together at
the bonfire and talk about their sufferings.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.710
Jack claims that children are pawns in a sick
game created by adults.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.820
Ravi thinks his worst fear is complete silence
in his house while Dane believes his parents’

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.290
fights are nightmares.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.250
The group will turn the Halloween party tonight
into a night in which they are doing God’s

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.250
work.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.790
They’ll bring justice to the world.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.069
When it is time for the party, the friends
get together at the front yard in their fabulous

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.069
costumes.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.660
Inside, the host kids share the group prayers
before calling off their final plan.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.260
On the way, Bradley and his friends share
their excitement with marijuana and bad jokes.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.350
The cop then forces them to pull over for
driving overspeed.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.540
Smelling pot-smoking in the car, the officer
then asks the boys to give up all the marijuana

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.540
they have.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.340
The trio finally can flee to the party with
some of the weeds they hid in advance.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.150
Inside the farmhouse, the party goes crazy
with loud music, smokes and drinks.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.800
All the kids enjoy their fun moments in colorful
costumes.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.459
Only the outcast kids wear the masks in the
party and blend in with the friends.

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.290
They soon realize Kurtis makes the party although
he wasn’t invited.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.250
Ravi wants to alert Kurtis and sends him home,
but Dane stops him, saying the rule is nobody

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.079
leaves after the party.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.050
Emily secretly pours in a liquid to the bowl.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.120
All the kids are invited to drink from it.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.570
Few moments later, those who drink from the
bowl pass out, Kurtis is not an exception.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.919
The hosts now take the weapons and stand around
the unconscious friends.

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.230
After a little while, a high-pitch noise wakes
the kids up.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.220
They find themselves chained together, still
confused at what is going on.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.020
The five outcasts are on the stage, giving
speeches with a prepared voice from the radio.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.210
Dane tells the tied up friends that the group
has one good news and one bad news for them.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.150
The good news is no one would get killed.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.280
And the bad news is they’ll live a life
worse than being killed after the party.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.430
They want revenge for the years of torment
and want to torture their worst enemies.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.680
A friend named Miles still thinks it is a
lame performance and smears the five.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.810
He then gets shot by a castle gun on the face
and in the leg.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.580
Miles cries out in pain.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.910
Tommy is allowed to leave the party.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.520
He tells his girlfriend that he’ll call
for help.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.360
The outcasts reveal to his girlfriend that
Tommy slept with Heather.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.230
As Tommy runs away, the Triplets, also the
outcasts supporters, chase after to scare

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.230
him off.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.510
The boy then falls into the bear trap that
Dane set up before.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.100
The Triplets bring wounded Tommy back to the
party where he and Miles share the same room.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.139
Bradley becomes scared, accusing the five
for their cruelty.

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.530
The five then laugh at his concerns because
after all the years, Bradley is always the

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.730
worst bully.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.330
Jack starts to play some music by his favorite
instrument.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.419
Bernard dares the five to touch him and earns
himself a stab on his shoulder.

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.570
Ravi is the one who acts it out.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.550
Bernard is then forced to drink a mysterious
drug that prevents his mouth from talking

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.550
or even moving.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.040
Ravi drops a key on purpose as he passes by
Kurtis.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.060
Next, Emily tortures Bernard with some long
needles piercing all over his chest.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.760
Later, he also joins other injured boys in
the same room.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.310
While the group is scaring the bullies with
an ax, Kurtis suddenly escapes.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.500
Dane opens fire at him but fails as Ravi storms
in to stop Dane.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.949
Ravi gets killed instantly for being a betrayal.

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:29.240
The remaining outcasts are shocked at Dane’s
cruelty.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.580
Meanwhile, Kurtis makes it to the cop’s
car, who is enjoying the weeds confiscated

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.600
from the kids earlier.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.400
As the cop tries to understand what Kurtis
means, he gets shot from one of the Triplets.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.660
Kurtis then takes the gun from the cop and
runs away as the Triplets are arriving on

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.130
their ATV’s.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.860
Back to the party, Heather is the next victim.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.860
She is tied up on a chair while Emily covers
her face with a white paste.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.870
The compound gives Heather a slight tingle
first, then a mild burn.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.160
Slowly, her face is destroyed as she touches
it.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.880
Just then, Bradley starts to mouth off.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.520
He wants the outcasts to take off the masks.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.400
As requested, Dane reveals himself.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.050
Elsewhere, Kurtis runs to Parker’s house.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.160
Seeing a boy with a gun, the man fends himself
with another gun pointing at him.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.479
Kurtis is asked to turn around and raise his
hands.

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.460
Parker knocks the boy out for the family’s
safety first.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.860
In his house, Kurtis has a chance to explain
to Parker about the deadly party while being

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.160
bound on a chair.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.389
Parker decides to investigate alone, leaving
Kurtis behind.

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:34.290
As he enters Dane’s family farm, Parker
is caught in a trap and severely injured.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.530
One of the Triplets arrives and ends up being
killed by Parker.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.580
Later, Kurtis manages to get away from the
house and rejoins Parker on the way.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.440
He tells Kurtis that he has killed two boys
from the Triplets.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.390
The boy also informs that he already called
the police and they’re on the way to stop

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.020
the reckless kids.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.990
Back at the house, the outcasts take turns
to show their faces.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:00.000
Bridget tries to apologize to Emily for what
they have done in the past.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.120
Emily then hands her a pincer, requiring Bridget
either cut Bradley’s fingers or she’ll

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.430
lose two fingers instead.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.430
Bridget eventually is cut off two fingers
by Bradley.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.460
When it comes to Bridget’s turn, she still
can’t cut off Bradley’s fingers.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.430
Emily then puts on the same white paste on
her face, leaving her face flesh burning in

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.570
acid.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.590
Bradley now gets chained on a chair.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.020
Dane then stabs Bradley's in the spinal cord,
attempting to paralyze him from the neck down.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.760
The group then torture a boy named Riggs by
cutting off his tongue.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.120
Suddenly, Kurtis appears with the gun pointing
at Dane, saving Riggs’ life.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.339
However, Kurtis gets instantly shot in the
arm right after that.

00:08:36.339 --> 00:08:41.379
Dane decides to finish Kurtis with another
shot, only to get killed by Emily.

00:08:41.379 --> 00:08:44.430
She has enough with Dane’s craziness after
Ravi’s death.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.119
Just then, Jack shoots Emily in the head as
her last will.

00:08:48.119 --> 00:08:51.179
The police storm in and order Jack to put
the gun down.

00:08:51.179 --> 00:08:55.429
The boy tells the cops that there are more
like him outside and they only want justice

00:08:55.429 --> 00:08:57.730
before Jack kills himself too.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:03.240
The next day, a news reporter mentions that
students were kidnapped and tortured "without

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.240
reason".

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:10.079
Kelly, the only stay unharmed but traumatized
by the party, swallows lots of pills in the

00:09:10.079 --> 00:09:11.079
toilet.

00:09:11.079 --> 00:09:14.820
Kurtis exchanges eye contact with the remaining
Triplet.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.700
And it turns out Bridget is the disfigured
girl from the beginning of the film.
