00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.481
If a mad scientist abducted you and sowed
your mouth to another person’s anus, what

00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:06.481
would you do?

00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:09.130
Jesus christ, what have I gotten myself into.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.509
There’s no way this video is monetized.

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.419
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
the American tourists, see if we can make

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:20.449
better decisions, and ultimately attempt to
beat the EVIL SURGEON in, THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.140
(FIRST SEQUENCE).

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.730
Think you could do better, let us know in
the comments!

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.099
Enjoy these How To Beat videos?

Why not like and subscribe.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.849
Have a movie you want me to cover?

00:00:29.849 --> 00:01:11.750
Vote on my reddit page, link 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:34.690
in 
the description.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:54.260
If you guys want me to do the sequels, let
me know.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.530
Alright, let’s take this evil fucker down.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.470
We start out following a deranged man sitting
on the side of the highway, caressing a picture

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.220
of, as far as I can tell, a dog-centipede.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.290
Totally normal behavior.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.929
Moments later a panicked truck driver pulls
up behind him and rushes off into the bushes

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.340
to make a pit stop.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.290
According to the director, the inspiration
for this movie came from a joke he made with

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.739
friends about punishing a child molester by
stitching his mouth to the anus of a fat truck

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:23.739
driver.

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.800
Which is exactly what I’d say to deflect
further inspection from my perverted psyche,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.920
but it’s interesting that they chose to
add a truck driver into the movie.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.370
Taco Tuesday was not kind to this fella, and
now he’s going to pay the ultimate price

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.370
for it.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.590
Besides not eating questionable food before
a long haul, there’s not much this poor

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.739
truck driver could have done differently.

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.940
As a general point though, you should never
travel too far off the beaten path to use

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.620
one of nature’s dunnys.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.950
Privacy be damned.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.519
How many horror movies have you seen where
someone ventures out of their camp at night

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.440
to take a leak, and gets mauled.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.440
A lot, right?

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.170
How many video games have you played where
you hid in the bushes and waited for some

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.189
dipshit to wander off by themselves so you
could slit their throat.

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.430
Probably too many to be good for your mental
health.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.760
Being alone with your pants at your ankles
just makes you the perfect target for predators.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.810
Again, not saying the truck driver did anything
wrong here, just wanted to make this point.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.730
Our main protagonists are two ditzy American
tourists, Lindsay and Jenny.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.459
Of course those are their names.

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.480
These two bimbos accepted an invite to a party
in the middle of nowhere by a random German

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.000
waiter they just met.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.420
They obviously didn’t see the movie Taken.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.380
Going to this ‘party’, which is likely
a honeypot for human traffickers, was a bad

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.730
idea to begin with, even if it was in an easily
found public location.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.180
But the fact that this place is so remote
should be a massive red flag.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:53.000
I mean, I guess they could have been invited
to a forest rave party or something..

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.760
Even then, they have no cell reception, they
are following a paper map, and they both know

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.709
they are ill-equipped to deal with any level
of adversity.

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.879
They should have headed back home as soon
as they left the urban areas.

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.629
It’s no surprise that they get lost, but
then to add accident to idiocy, they hit a

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.629
pothole and pop their tire.

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.889
Not that they have many options here, and
I think they ‘should’ ask the next person

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.380
they see for help, but I can’t help but
be suspicious of the first person that arrives

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.850
to help you minutes after you hit something.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.950
Whatever, I'm probably just being paranoid.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.360
I’m sure this guy will be helpful and call
some help for them or give them a lift into

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.700
town.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.810
Okay, maybe wait for the next person.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.320
They can’t be too far out.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.390
There should be more cars coming by within
half an hour.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.560
They just need to sit tight and not do anything
irrational.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.430
They’re going to do something irrational,
aren’t they.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.430
Yep.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.160
They decide that in order to save themselves,
they need to start walking aimlessly through

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.700
the adjacent forest in their heels while it’s
thunderstorming.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.920
You guys got lost when you had a map in front
of you, and now somehow think that you’ll

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.870
magically find your way without the map in
a dark rainy forest?

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.920
Why wouldn’t you at least walk alongside
the road where you’d actually have a chance

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.940
at coming across someone?

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.540
I can already tell I'm going to be rooting
for the psycho surgeon.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.970
Yah, go ahead and stitch her up behind the
fat truck driver, actually, go ahead and put

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:25.970
her at the very end.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:26.970
Cool, thanks.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.940
They eventually find a house and start yelling
and banging on the backdoors and windows,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.650
which is a great way to scare the hell out
of the homeowner and get you shot.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.300
The homeowner opens up and asks if they are
alone, to which they answer, yes.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.330
Wrong move, and a red flag.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.560
The only reason he’d need to know if you
were alone is if he had sinister intentions

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.480
and wanted to make sure nobody would come
looking if something happened to you.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.380
Well, maybe not the only reason.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.280
He may be genuinely concerned if you had another
friend that needed help as well.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.800
But considering the creepy look on his face,
I doubt it.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.880
Lindsay and Jenny should just leave with the
bad vibes this dude’s giving off, or at

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.340
least said that their other friend was just
up the street by the car and knows they came

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.340
here.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.140
The next mistake they made was to trust the
stranger to make the call for help instead

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.660
of using the phone themselves so they could
verify that someone knew where they were and

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.660
was on the way.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.830
The final nail in their coffin was throwing
back the drinks some old single creepy looking

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.110
dude prepared by himself in the kitchen, when
they know he knows nobody knows where they

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:40.150
are, and they already had an encounter with
the creepy ‘good samaritans’ of this area.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:46.970
I get that he’s an unhinged sociopath, but
bro, if you want to claim some prey maybe

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.620
chill out and stop yelling at the ladies.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.320
As for Lindsay and Jenny.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.320
Leave.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.320
Now.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.390
Especially since you’re suspiciously feeling
woozy all the sudden after sipping on the

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.090
cocktail he gave you.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.980
Lindsay whispers to Jenny that they need to
get out of there right now, which they don’t

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.980
do.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.400
Instead, Jenny gulps down every last drop
of the drink while Lindsay waits for the sociopath

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.120
to come back so she can naively request for
him to phone a Taxi.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.240
Not the sharpest tools in the shed.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.020
Heiter comes back, Jenny passes out, Lindsay
starts foaming at the mouth, and their last

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:30.220
chance to escape with their dignity intact
disappears forever.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.620
The next morning Lindsays the first to wake
up and come to grips with how badly they fucked

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.620
up.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.700
You never want to wake up in a hospital bed,
but you ‘never’ want to wake up in a hospital

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.610
bed in someone’s basement.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.960
Needless to say, they need to get the fuck
out of there ASAP.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.770
Luckily Heiter’s not present.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.270
He might be out of the house or he might be
upstairs.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.840
Either way, it’s best to stay quiet, let
him think you’re still sedated, and use

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.280
this opportunity to attempt an escape.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.560
For that reason, Lindsay shouldn’t wake
Jenny up yet because she’ll just start freaking

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.560
out and screaming.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.470
It looks like he secured them with non-locking
leather restraints around their limbs, which

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.630
weren’t sufficiently spaced apart to prevent
torso and head movement.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.630
Absolute rookie mistake.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:16.110
There’s so many proven effective restraint
setups out there, and this guy uses the absolute

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.520
worst one possible.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.290
All Lindsay needs to do is use her mouth to
unbuckle the restraint and she’s free.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.950
But no, ineffectually squirming and waking
up her brainless friend is definitely a better

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.360
idea.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:36.000
Jenny’s yelping brings Heiter’s attention,
ruining their chance of escaping yet again.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.159
Heiter then compares their blood types, and
concludes that the truck driver’s doesn’t

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.789
match so he needs to euthanize him and find
a replacement.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:48.959
Gotta make sure the blood and tissues match
when conjoining three people together ATM-style,

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:51.570
because longevity is really what the goal
is here.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:56.069
The shining silver lining of the truck driver's
untimely death is that it buys the girls some

00:08:56.069 --> 00:09:00.100
time before Heiter finds a replacement for
whatever sadistic shit he’s planning.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.300
They don’t show it here, but later in the
movie Heiter injects them with sedatives when

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.300
he leaves.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.900
He probably did that here too, so Lindsay
and Jenny wouldn’t be able to undo the shackles

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.900
and escape.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.889
Heiter leaves them to go bury the truck driver
in his backyard in broad daylight with the

00:09:14.889 --> 00:09:17.560
corpse in an unzipped plastic body bag.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:22.060
Bro, could you not wait until nighttime, or
chop him up and put him in black hefty bags

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.569
instead of an obvious looking body bag?

00:09:24.569 --> 00:09:28.199
I wonder if YouTube will play Hefty trash
bag ads on this video now.

00:09:28.199 --> 00:09:32.870
Then he drags a new victim in through his
front door, again, in broad daylight with

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.949
the murder weapon on the roof of the car.

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:39.279
I get that he lives in a secluded area, but
still, why take the risk.

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:43.430
After securing the Japanese tourist on a gurney
he wakes them up and gives them the projector

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:48.050
presentation outlining how he’s going to
connect them together via the gastric system,

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.029
creating a human centipede of sorts.

00:09:50.029 --> 00:09:53.960
There’s no point in telling them this ahead
of time, but he’s a sick fuck and probably

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.960
gets off on it.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.629
He’s now going to put them under general
anesthesia in preparation for their surgery,

00:09:59.629 --> 00:10:01.380
starting with the Japanese tourist.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.740
Now is your absolute last chance to fight
and pull something off before your life is

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.990
forever fucked.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:11.930
Lindsay wises up and unshackles herself while
Heiter is distracted with Katsuro.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:16.639
She makes a conscious decision to leave her
friend behind and run for the exits, but they’re

00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:17.639
all locked.

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:21.879
Of course this guy has his house setup so
that people can’t get out.

00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:26.999
Heiter is like a far more depraved version
of Alex from the movie Tau.

00:10:26.999 --> 00:10:32.920
She locks herself in his bedroom which stalls
him for now, but she needs to at least grab

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.180
a weapon so she has a chance if it comes to
a hand to hand fight.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:48.079
Wow, Heiter really has a picture of his dog
centipede thing next to his bed.

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:51.890
Instead of pleading for your life to the psychopath
who gets off on people pleading for their

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:57.430
life, how about you go over to the phone next
to his bed and call 112, which is the 911

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.170
equivalent for Americans.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.720
Which you should know if you’re visiting
other countries.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.970
She tries to make an escape out the back window,
but Heiter’s one step ahead of her, and

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.569
he has his tranq rifle.

00:11:07.569 --> 00:11:11.220
Without knowing the layout of the place and
Heiter right behind her, it’s understandable

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.379
that she’d accidentally run into a dead
end like the indoor pool.

00:11:14.379 --> 00:11:18.449
It’s also understandable that you’d lose
your coordination when under extreme stress

00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:20.930
like this and trip into the pool like she
did.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.819
I know we all would like to think we’d Jason
Bourne this motherfucker when he stepped through

00:11:24.819 --> 00:11:28.029
the doorway, but real talk, no.

00:11:28.029 --> 00:11:32.250
Lindsay’s out of options here, if she gets
out of the pool she’ll get tranq’d.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.740
Heiter tries to force her out by closing the
cover on his indoor pool, but for some reason

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.529
this causes a power failure.

00:11:38.529 --> 00:11:43.499
I see no reason why he would have needed to
leave Lindsay to fix the power and let her

00:11:43.499 --> 00:11:44.499
escape.

00:11:44.499 --> 00:11:45.540
This was really stupid on his part.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.870
Lindsay breaks out and makes it back to the
room she was previously in that had the window

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:50.870
broken.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.189
That phone looks like a corded landline phone,
which should still work even with the power

00:11:55.189 --> 00:11:56.189
out.

00:11:56.189 --> 00:11:59.579
Picking up the phone to call for help apparently
never crosses her mind though.

00:11:59.579 --> 00:12:05.110
This wide open window seems too easy, but
then again, why did he let her leave the pool

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.600
in the first place.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.589
Maybe he isn’t as smart as he appears.

00:12:08.589 --> 00:12:13.029
He could still be out there with a tranq rifle,
ready to dart her as soon as she exits.

00:12:13.029 --> 00:12:15.009
The odds are in her favor though.

00:12:15.009 --> 00:12:19.279
Dart guns, like the one Heiter’s using,
are single shot and take time to reload.

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:23.970
The darts are relatively low velocity, and
have a hard time puncturing thick clothing.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.040
If she wrapped the bed sheet around herself
and ran for it, even if he was out there,

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.920
there’s a good chance he would miss or it
wouldn’t puncture her, at which point she

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.119
can leave the bedsheet and sprint for it.

00:12:34.119 --> 00:12:39.440
Heiter’s home is not that isolated, if she
sprinted 100 yards in any direction she’d

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.720
probably run into someone.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.990
She just needs to take care not to trip on
a branch and bop her head off a log.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.649
Even if she did get hit and it punctured her
skin.

00:12:47.649 --> 00:12:52.410
She’d still have maybe 3-5 minutes to run
for help before she lost a significant amount

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.809
of her coordination from the tranquilizer.

00:12:54.809 --> 00:12:59.639
Lindsay hesitates, conflicted with her chance
to escape and not wanting to leave Jenny behind.

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:02.069
Going back for Jenny is a bad idea.

00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:06.029
Both Jenny and Katsuro are under general anaesthetics
in the basement.

00:13:06.029 --> 00:13:09.339
Heiter will be back soon, and there’s no
way she could drag them up the stairs and

00:13:09.339 --> 00:13:11.029
haul them to safety in time.

00:13:11.029 --> 00:13:15.490
She needs to secure her own escape first,
from there, it should only take 20 minutes

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.589
tops to bring the fuzz down on top of Heiter’s
operation.

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:23.190
If you did want to go back and try to carry
her out, the most effective way is to use

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.720
the ranger roll and firemen’s carry method.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.209
Too much friction dragging her on the ground,
and way too slow.

00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:33.819
She manages to get Jenny’s unconscious body
topside and out the window, but it’s taking

00:13:33.819 --> 00:13:36.160
too long and she’s too loud.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:43.209
I’d say a tranq round will hit her in the
back of the neck here any moment now.

00:13:43.209 --> 00:13:48.540
Should have just ran and left Jenny.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.929
And realistically, she still could since the
tranq will take a few minutes to kick in.

00:13:52.929 --> 00:13:56.939
Of course he’d probably be able to run her
clumsy ass down anyway.

00:13:56.939 --> 00:14:00.550
Lindsay and Jenny gave up every opportunity
to escape, and now they’re getting their

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:05.779
teeth removed, skin grafted, body parts dice
and sewed together with other humans, and

00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:07.470
all kinds of other horrific shit.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.470
Fun times.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.810
Heiter then cheers to his successful completion
of the conjoinment procedure with a celebratory

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:18.470
drink, a photoshoot he can wank to later,
then puts the human centipede into a large

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:22.639
cage on the first floor of his house for some
dumb reason.

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:24.059
Escaping at this point is going to be..

00:14:24.059 --> 00:14:25.059
Tough.

00:14:25.059 --> 00:14:28.290
There’s no way to effectively coordinate
strategies or movements with the others while

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.290
they are conjoined.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:33.389
They could potentially rip out the stitches
by pulling with their head and hands to separate

00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:37.949
themselves, but their ligaments and tendons
in their knees were sliced so it’s not like

00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:39.240
they could run anyways.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:43.689
Heiter brings them outside to parade them
around the lawn like dogs.

00:14:43.689 --> 00:14:48.089
I get his house may be secluded, but Lindsay
and Jenny stumbled into it.

00:14:48.089 --> 00:14:49.579
It’s not that secluded.

00:14:49.579 --> 00:15:03.059
He must not give a shit about being caught.

00:15:03.059 --> 00:15:08.290
Can you imagine the rage inside you if someone
did this to you, desperately wanting to destroy

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:12.339
him, being so close but being completely unable
to do anything.

00:15:12.339 --> 00:15:14.100
Katsuro does still have his arms intact.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.389
If he gets close enough he could pull the
doc to the ground and choke him out.

00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:20.939
That’s about their only option right now.

00:15:20.939 --> 00:15:24.860
That night, Heiter threatens to cut their
vocal cords if they don't quit their moaning

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.949
because it’s disturbing his sleep.

00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:30.899
Yah, it’s best to just shut up, you don’t
want to lose your vocal cords now when you

00:15:30.899 --> 00:15:32.759
might need them to escape later.

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:35.249
The next morning he gives them a checkup.

00:15:35.249 --> 00:15:39.029
Katsuro and Lindsay are surviving, but Jenny
doesn’t look too good.

00:15:39.029 --> 00:15:43.930
Besides the massive infections she’s developing,
there’s no way anything nutritious is finding

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.839
its way back there, let alone enough water.

00:15:46.839 --> 00:15:50.059
Jenny probably only has a couple days left.

00:15:50.059 --> 00:15:54.429
Someone rings his landline, so Heiter picks
up the phone right outside his torture chamber

00:15:54.429 --> 00:15:57.230
filled with moaning and screaming victims.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.230
Smart.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:02.180
Maybe you’d want to pick up one of the other
phones in the house to answer calls, or just

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.319
let them leave a message while you’re torturing
people.

00:16:05.319 --> 00:16:09.889
It’s the police, letting him know that they
are at the front door and he needs to open

00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:10.889
up.

00:16:10.889 --> 00:16:14.480
Gee, it couldn’t be that they acquired evidence
pointing to him as a suspect in the recent

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.439
abductions with how inconspicuous he was.

00:16:17.439 --> 00:16:21.410
The police obviously don’t have anything
substantial yet though, or they’d have barged

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.410
in already.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:25.509
They also don’t seem to have heard any of
the screaming in the background.

00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:26.509
Such amazing detectives.

00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:29.519
Heiter leaves to go upstairs, leaving them
in the lab alone.

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:33.239
I bet there is a weapon in there they could
grab, like a scalpel.

00:16:33.239 --> 00:16:37.740
Then all he needs to do is grab Heiter’s
leg and start shanking him in the femoral

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.910
artery enough to get him on the ground where
he can cut his throat.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:45.290
The police start questioning him over the
missing people and empty cars in the area,

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.730
and his reply is...

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:54.119
The police had thought they hit a dead end,
but now it’s looking like they have a strong

00:16:54.119 --> 00:16:55.119
suspect.

00:16:55.119 --> 00:16:58.519
I mean, on the other hand, you wouldn’t
necessarily expect an abductor to be such

00:16:58.519 --> 00:17:03.779
an asshole, because often it's the more unassuming
and charming ones that are the real danger.

00:17:03.779 --> 00:17:08.459
Like Jack the Ripper, Ted Bundy, Alex in Tao,
or Trinity in Dexter.

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:11.480
If I was a detective, I'd be suspicious already.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.120
Especially after seeing this cage.

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.510
Apparently the detectives got word that a
witness said she heard an American woman screaming

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:23.010
on his property and they also have evidence
that his Mercedez was at the place where the

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:25.929
dutch lorry where he killed the truck driver
was found.

00:17:25.929 --> 00:17:28.799
Wouldn’t all this be grounds for a search
warrant?

00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:33.470
Heiter realizes they are on to him, so he
offers them his infamous drink.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.400
Yah, that’ll get the cops off your tail.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.100
Two missing detectives and an empty cop car
in your driveway.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.520
Drinking whatever a potential suspect gives
you has to be a big no no for detectives.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.870
Detective Voller starts sipping on it, but
at least Detective Kranz has the brains to

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:51.010
refuse it.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:57.130
Sweet mother of god, they spent this whole
time screaming when a fucking scalpel was

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:58.500
right next to them.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.700
If I was Lindsay, I'd probably want to get
the scalpel and cut Katsuro’s ass from my

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.559
face so I could have a chance at fighting
on my own, and without Lindsay attached to

00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:09.210
his ass katsuro could better fight Heiter
too.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.190
I say this, but it would be absurdly painful.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.670
I think I'd at least try given the situation.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.580
I’m not sure they have a ton of time to
do this, so having Katsuro palm the scalpel

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.010
and ambush Heiter is the best option.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:25.190
The police question him about his cellar,
and the he jokes about it being a torture

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:26.190
chamber.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:30.460
That’s always a good thing to say to cops
when being questioned about recent abductions.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.650
The detectives ask to take a look down there,
but Heiter refuses, saying they need a search

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.220
warrant first.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:41.250
Detective Kranz presses him further, and Heiter
accidentally drops a syringe on the ground.

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.799
Supposedly for his Diabetes.

00:18:43.799 --> 00:18:48.260
By now we’ve clearly established that the
surgeon is a psycho who doesn’t give a fuck

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.190
about people going missing, witnesses saying
they’ve heard American women screaming on

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:56.850
his property, which match the profile of 2
of the people who went missing, his car was

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:02.050
spotted next to the location of the truck
whose driver was abducted, a large suspicious

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:07.730
cage with blood on it, incredibly weird pictures
and art, a cellar which the violent suspect

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.290
refuses to let you into.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:13.899
Oh and he was hiding a syringe under a towel
which is filled with god knows what.

00:19:13.899 --> 00:19:18.490
I don’t know German law, or law in general,
but I’d think they have sufficient probable

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.730
cause to easily get a search warrant.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:21.730
Which they do.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:26.220
I’d also call for some additional backup
considering he’s been pretty volatile.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:30.370
While the cops are out getting a search warrant,
Heiter goes back downstairs to try and hide

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.700
his human triplet.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:43.500
Tall task with only 20 minutes before they’re
back.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.399
Guys what the fuck, you had him.

00:19:45.399 --> 00:19:47.210
Why would you not finish the job.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:51.020
A shank to the leg and a bite on the neck
is nowhere near lethal.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.370
How hard is it to pull the scalpel out of
his leg and slice his jugular and shove it

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:56.370
into his heart.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:00.980
Wouldn’t you want to ensure that he’s
100% dead for what he did to you, and so he

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.830
couldn’t come back after you.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:06.639
Surprise surprise, Heiter’s not dead and
corners them in the bedroom.

00:20:06.639 --> 00:20:10.360
Just when you think you’re going to see
a human centipede versus Heiter knife-fight,

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.000
Katsuro gives up.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.860
He has some sort of epiphany that his ass
being sewed to someone else’s face was God’s

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.330
wrath for living a selfish life and not loving
his family more.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.370
So he kills himself.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:23.710
Because that makes sense.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:27.890
You know what’s selfish, not killing this
guy and freeing the two innocent people trapped

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:32.580
behind you, condemning them to death because
you wanted to commit seppuku to rid yourself

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.580
of sin.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.590
You could have at least tried to save their
lives and take this evil fuck down before

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:38.720
committing suicide.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.169
The doc leaves the triplet and crawls back
over to the pool as the police break in and

00:20:43.169 --> 00:20:44.450
search the place.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.580
Looks like they didn’t call for backup.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.730
Detective Voller should have been feeling
the effects of the drugs by now.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:54.100
At which point he should have let his partner
know so they could call off the raid and get

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.100
backup.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.870
Voller didn’t communicate this and tried
to push through the effects, and wound up

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:01.649
dead in the pool with a scalpel in his neck.

00:21:01.649 --> 00:21:06.110
Kranz hears the fall into the pool, rushes
in halfcocked, and gets lit up.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:14.309
I never understood why when people open a
door and see a dead body, the rush right over

00:21:14.309 --> 00:21:15.309
to it.

00:21:15.309 --> 00:21:19.539
Wouldn’t that make you take a pause and
carefully clear the area, checking all your

00:21:19.539 --> 00:21:20.559
corners.

00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:24.840
Obviously the wounded man who killed your
friend is still down here and is still a threat,

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.149
so hastily running in there would likely get
you killed too.

00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:30.899
At least he dome-shotted Heiter before he
keeled over.

00:21:30.899 --> 00:21:36.340
The movie ends with Lindsay stuck in the middle
of a dead Katsuro and a dead Jenny, with two

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.970
dead cops and a dead Heiter in the pool.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:43.429
We can presume that Lindsay was later found
by other cops who went looking after the missing

00:21:43.429 --> 00:21:47.770
detectives, and they brought her to a hospital
where a surgeon separated her from the rest

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.090
of the human centipede.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:53.490
She then would go on to get plastic surgery
to fix her face, as well as operations to

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:58.309
replace the ligaments in her kneecaps and
her teeth, paid for by Dr. Heiter’s money.

00:21:58.309 --> 00:22:03.100
Isn’t it amazing that nowadays you could
get brutally disfigured, I mean utterly rekted,

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:07.029
and there’s a building you can go to with
people in it who have the tools and expertise

00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:09.059
to fix all the damage done to you.

00:22:09.059 --> 00:22:10.150
It’s honestly incredible.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:14.690
She won’t be winning any beauty pageants
and she’ll have to lower her dating standards

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:19.010
substantially, but at least she could live
a semi normal life, maybe get a book deal

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:23.429
and make some talk show appearances until
she later decides to kill herself due to the

00:22:23.429 --> 00:22:26.820
overwhelming survivors guilt and PTSD.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.990
Let’s recap who would have lived or died
with some different decisions.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:35.840
Firstly, I want to say RIP to Dieter Laser,
who passed away last year.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.380
No, I’m not going to put Dieter Laser on
the Dead board, that would be senseless.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.620
Guys, I'm actually a fairly empathetic person.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.840
But back to the movie.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.230
The trucker was dead no matter what.

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:50.190
Lindsay and Jenny should have stayed in their
car or walked along the road for help.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.120
Which would have prevented all of this.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.960
But, Heiter could have picked them up like
he did with Katsuro and the truck driver,

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.960
so what then?

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.190
There was a pivotal moment when Lindsay could
have dialed 112 and escaped out the back window

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:06.320
and gotten help from the police, but instead
tried to drag her unconscious friend out too.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.440
She could have saved Jenny and Katsuro’s
lives, prevented the detective’s deaths,

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.450
and landed Heiter in prison.

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:16.799
The next pivotal moment was when Katsuro stabbed
Heiter with the scalpel and then they left

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:17.840
him alive.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:22.179
If they had just ensured Heiter was dead,
Katsuro and Jenny might have lived, as well

00:23:22.179 --> 00:23:23.210
as the cops.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:27.570
All said and done, I think we could have beaten
the EVIL SURGEON from HUMAN CENTIPEDE.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:32.750
Thanks for watching, and remember, don’t
ask strangers for help without having a plan

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:34.539
to kill them.
