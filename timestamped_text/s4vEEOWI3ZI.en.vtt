00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.889
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:05.819
Today I'm going to explain a supernatural
horror film called The Forest.

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.200
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.800
Watch out and take careSara Price, an American
woman in her early thirties, has a nightmare

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.400
about her twin sister, Jess, who lives in
Japan, and is a teacher.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.380
She decides to go to Japan to know more about
the disappearance of her twin after receiving

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.730
a phone call from a Japanese police officer
informing her that the school where Jess teaches

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.869
filed a missing person report.

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.100
Despite her fiance, Rob, assuring her that
Jess is okay, Sara is sure that something

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.370
is off, and her twin needs her.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.090
At a dinner with Rob's boss, Sara seems bothered
by the news and is unfocused on the conversation

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.440
while they dine.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.170
According to the police officer, Jess was
last seen in the Aokigahara Forest, an infamous

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.130
place where numerous people take their own
lives.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.030
According to the officer, people who leave
the path to go into the forest alone do not

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.710
want to be found.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.090
Sara is in complete disbelief as she looks
at their childhood picture with utter sadness.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.110
She dismisses the words of the officer and
says that her sister is alive.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.360
Rob makes an effort to stop Sara from leaving
by saying that the situation is a typical

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.490
"Jess move."

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.409
Sara arrives at the airport and tries to contact
Jess, but she is sent to voicemail directly.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.909
She takes a cab to her accommodation and sees
the vibrant city.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.689
While looking outside, she could not help
but be worried about her twin.

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.560
While looking at a building, an older man
heavily taps the cab's window, which gives

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.560
Sara a big fright.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.560
The older man laughs and runs away.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.600
She arrives at her hotel room; the cityscape
amazes her, but it is not enough to put a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.390
smile on her face.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.780
That night, she walks around the city to stop
by a restaurant and grab a meal.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.850
She ends up at a sushi place; the chef serves
her a plate of raw seafood that is still moving.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.920
This puts her in a culture shock, so she decides
to leave as other people in the restaurant

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.330
make fun of her.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.869
Back in the room, she looks at old pictures
and videos of Jess.

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.049
She obviously misses her twin while reminiscing
their moments through her laptop.

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.520
Out of curiosity, she looks up to the Aokigahara
Forest; disturbing images appear, so she puts

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.360
her computer aside because she could not handle
it.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.140
That night, she has a dream about being in
a house.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.529
A voice calls her name, but no one seems to
be around.

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:13.280
She descends to the basement and sees a yellow
tent with a child's shadow.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.430
She comes near it to unzip the tent.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.489
She sees the young Jess, but her face disfigures,
and she lets out a disturbing shriek.

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.669
Sara wakes up the following day and visits
the school where Jess used to teach.

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:28.569
She approaches her twin's classroom to take
a look at her former students.

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.669
Upon opening the door, the students instantly
panic because they have no idea that Jess

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:33.730
has a twin.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.040
At the principal's office, one of the students
apologizes for being afraid of Sara earlier.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.079
Sara asks why she was scared.

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.010
The student replies by saying that it was
because she knows that Jess went into Aokigahara.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.730
The student adds that she thought Sara was
a "yurei" or a ghost.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.790
The principal explains that the forest used
to be a place where families would bring elderly

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.319
women, the blind, or the sick and leave them
to die.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.310
Sara asks why the school would take a class
trip there.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.359
The principal says that Mount Fuji is one
of the most important places in Japan, and

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.199
Aokigahara is simply part of the mountain;
thus, the school trips are made for historical

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:10.730
learning purposes.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.750
The student interrupts by saying that spirits
do not rest there; they come back angry.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.810
Sara takes a look at Jess's room.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.329
She sees a picture of them when they were
young, and it instantly makes her recall their

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.299
happy moments together.

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.219
Sara holds back her tears while looking at
her stuff.

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.799
She spots antidepressants and maps of the
forest as well.

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.109
Sara rides a train to get to the forest in
hopes to get answers.

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.489
She recalls another flashback of her and Jess
packing things for her big move.

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.079
Sara arrives at the Aokigahara Station and
walks through the road.

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.620
She stumbles upon a small service centre in
the woods.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.519
A receptionist welcomes her with a big and
friendly smile.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.609
Sara gets to the point right away and asks
the receptionist if she has seen Jess.

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.750
She says that Jess is "here".

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.959
Sara is confused and excited to hear that
she has a lead on Jess.

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.249
However, the receptionist brings her to the
basement, which is far from Sara's expectations.

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:06.749
She comes down slowly and gradually comes
to terms with the fact that her twin is gone.

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:10.129
The receptionist informs her that this is
where they store the bodies they find in the

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.510
forest.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.799
Someone guards the basement at all times,
or else the spirits will scream all night.

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.440
A funky smell welcomes Sara as she sees numerous
bodies covered in sheets.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.620
Someone calls the receptionist upstairs, so
she attends to it, making Sara alone in a

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.710
room full of cold bodies.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.150
She hears a subtle sound and comes near a
body.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.930
She reveals the sheet and sees a decaying
corpse.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.129
This freaks her out, so she rushes upstairs
to tell the lady that the body does not belong

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:37.490
to her twin.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.199
She explains that her twin is not dead but
is only lost in the forest.

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.770
The receptionist repeatedly tells her not
to leave the path as the forest is dangerous.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.220
While waiting for a ride outside, another
worker at the service centre, Sakura, informs

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.650
Sara that the cellular signal is not that
strong up there.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.099
Sara asks Sakura to guide her into the forest,
and in return, she will pay her.

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.460
Sakura replies by saying that the forest is
filled with "yurei", which can easily trick

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.319
people who leave the path.

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:08.650
According to her, when someone who has sadness
in their heart gets lost in the forest, the

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.930
"yurei" will use it against the person.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.320
These entities can make you see things and
make you want to die.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.250
Sara is still unconvinced and does not show
the slightest emotion of fear.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.849
She makes her way to her hotel on foot.

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:23.349
The
