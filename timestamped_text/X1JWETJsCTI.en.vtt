00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.000
Welcome to Cinema Summary,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.140
and today I'm gonna level with you, this is gonna
be the mother of explanations for VIVARIUM

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.200
because I'm gonna explain everything:

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.740
What's the language, who's in control of Yonder

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.539
Why does the kid mimic the parents,
the significance of the number 9,

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.650
The relevance to the cuckoo bird, who the
other people Gemma saw were and more

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.000
because as much as this movie has some

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.500
good performances, a great premise, and a great start

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.180
it doesn't deliver a good payoff.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.600
So that's where I come in

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.680
and just FYI I'll be going through a
summary first so spoilers ahead

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.220
if you just want to skip ahead
to the explanation

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.440
a timecode should appear on screen now.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.560
Now without further ado this is VIVARIUM (2020)

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.140
Gemma is a young schoolteacher
and she clearly loves her job

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.580
she brightens up and gets very animated with her kids

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.980
but she's much less enthusiastic
about looking for a new home

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.840
it's dragging on and on.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.280
But her co-worker convinces her to take 
her advice and close a deal fast

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.220
The housing market is going through the roof

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.760
Yeah, we're gonna *Sounds of birds chirping*

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.400
and do you hear that?

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.960
It's subtle but-

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.280
Yeah, we're gonna drop *Sounds of bird chirping*

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.560
A chirp. Huh.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.880
After school ends, Gemma runs into a student

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.970
who finds a dead baby bird on the ground

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.240
Gemma tells the girl that a cuckoo bird

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.880
probably kicked this hatchling from its nest

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.940
Ah yes, the cuckoo bird!

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.720
A vicious little thing that will kick out baby birds
from their nests to put its own eggs in

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.680
Yeah, you heard that right!

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.240
It tricks other birds into raising its own hatchlings.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.380
Sounds ridiculous but it's true!

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.360
And keep this in mind because it comes into play later.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.940
Gemma just accepts this shocking cruel reality.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.380
Well, it's just nature. It's just how things are!

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400
But the girl does not take this well it tells Gemma

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.400
"I don't like nature. I don't like
how things are! It's horrible."

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.900
Gemma then meets up with her husband Tom

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.900
who actually does care enough about the
baby bird to bury it and even do a little ceremony

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.420
unlike his wife.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.700
Before the two of them leave to meet
a real estate agent named Martin

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.920
who is dressed like a Mormon and is just..

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.360
So weird

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.840
Like there's this scene where he gives 
this wide-open mouthed smile and

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.120
the camera cuts away from him to Gemma

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.640
then to Martin's name tag,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.880
then to Tom,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.920
then back to Martin who is still
holding that smile!

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.000
Yikes!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.880
This film has so many scenes that
are so off-putting like this. It's great!

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.480
Anyway, Martin tells them about
this special place called Yonder.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.440
it's a really popular suburb with people
snatching up properties there really quickly

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.520
A suburb it isn't what Tom and Gemma are looking for

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.920
and Tom feels something's off

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.940
and tells Martin they can't go
because they don't have a car

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.740
but he's cut off by Gemma who's

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.180
hooked by Martin saying that the homes 
may not be available for much longer

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.880
and Tom gives in.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.660
So the couple follow Martin to the Yonder 
development and this place is creepy

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.940
with the tagline "forever quality homes"

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.940
All the houses look exactly the same in
this awful shade  of green on the outside

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.640
and as if that wasn't bad enough

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.480
same color on the inside too.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.960
Martin seems to love it though.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.660
He shows them House Number 9

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.380
and calls it a "forever home"
that's "perfect for any family"

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.500
and then in the middle of the tour,
Martin just leaves the house

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.740
Gemma's surprised and Tom's like
"Good! Let's get the F out of here!"

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.440
but they can't

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.020
every time they drive around the block
they end up at House Number 9

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.302
again and again until night falls and
their car runs out of gas.

00:03:30.302 --> 00:03:32.440
The next day, Tom climbs the roof

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.000
to see if there's a way out

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.760
but all he sees are rows of houses that go on for miles.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.420
Tom and Gemma desperately try to
walk their out but there's no exit!

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.720
So they go back home, tired and defeated,

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.780
where they find a box with food
and things needed for survival.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.980
Out of anger, Tom sets the house on fire

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.540
hoping to send a smoke signal to anyone but the

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.150
next day, they find the house has been
rebuilt as well as a box with a baby

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.720
inside with the text on the box reading
"Raise the child and be released".

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.620
Two months later...

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.200
2 months later, the baby has grown up very quickly

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.520
becoming a very

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.540
– let me say that again –

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.680
VERY annoying child

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.600
who is very needy and creepy

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.160
like he's always watching his parents and
copying them which is normal for any kid

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.880
but the way he does it and his
voice is just so unsettling

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.720
like he imitates both of them
having a full-blown argument

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.420
and when he does Tom he does a lower voice
and for Gemma he uses a higher pitch one

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.580
"If you didn't say no to every goddamn house we
looked at we wouldn't have ended up here!"

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.100
"So I'm to blame Tom? How is this my fault!?"

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.580
Plus there's the way he's dressed which
is very similar to Martin's outfit and

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.600
when he's not being freaky or annoying
he's watching this trippy TV screensaver

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.980
or acting like Tom and Gemma are
his parents which they absolutely hate

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.320
and remind him that "I am not your mother".

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.680
After a tossed cigarette lands on the front lawn

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.980
Tom finds out that the soil is fake and
begins digging a hole

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.740
becoming obsessed with it,

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.780
digging deeper and deeper into the unnatural earth.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.540
But one day, Tom gets fed up with
the kid and locks him inside the car

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.820
telling Gemma to leave the boy
alone and let him starve to death!

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.200
but she saves his life and grows closer with him

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.820
and again: Tom doesn't stick to his conviction.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.420
Gemma is growing closer to the child and 
begins acting like a mother

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.920
teaching him things, playing with him.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.760
We see more of this: Tom gets made at 
the kid for watching TV at night

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.500
which he turns off but Gemma
gives in and allows it

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.700
and he does nothing.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:43.180
These dynamics – Gemma taking the kid as her own child and Tom giving in– are very important

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.240
But one day, the boy goes missing 
and Gemma has no idea where he is

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.980
whereas Tom doesn't care..

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.320
Tom's pretty much completely on his own

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.820
outside, digging mostly and
hearing sounds "down there".

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.150
When the boy comes back, he has a book
written in a strange language with weird

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.700
diagrams, similar to the TV's screen saver weirdness.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.240
Curious, Gemma asks him what he was doing

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.440
and he tells her that he met someone
but is not allowed to say who.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.120
So, Gemma tricks him into
acting  like the person he met

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.160
by playing a game of pretend with him

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.600
and the boy obeys.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.080
Transforming in front of her eyes
while making these weird chirping noises

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.460
pretending to be who he met!

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.980
It's a terrifying moment for Gemma

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.600
and it really makes you wonder what 
exactly is the boy and who did he meet?

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.360
Several months later, and the boy  is now a man.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.920
The man leaves the home every day to go somewhere

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.780
to do something unknown.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.360
One day, Tom digs up a dead body inside of a bag

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.720
and horrified, he climbs out of the hole but
begins dying from exhaustion and malnutrition

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.060
The boy comes back home, and like it's nothing,

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.000
bags Tom's body, and throws down the hole

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.440
ironically Tom ended up
digging his own grave

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.620
Gemma is furious and explodes in anger!

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.280
Attacking the man who used to be a boy

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.460
but he somehow lives up the sidewalk
and goes underneath to escape

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.820
Gemma tries to chase him but
she ends up horrifyingly,

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.860
clipping and sinking and falling through walls!

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.880
Going through weird versions of
different colored houses

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.600
In each house, there are different
couples who are raising their own boys

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.860
eventually she pops out of
her own House Number 9

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.800
here she's found weak and dying by the former boy

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.960
Who puts her in a bag which he throws down the hole

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.240
but just before he does she has
some last words for him

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.600
I said I'm not your F-ing mother

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.260
then after filling the hole
and cleaning up the house

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.180
the boy leaves Yonder in Gemma's car

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.860
going to the real estate agency where
he meets a now waay older Martin

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.820
who dies on the spot!

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.640
The boy then puts Martin's body in
a bag that he gets from a cabinet

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.020
though not before putting Martin's name tag on

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.800
clipping a receipt on the body and... yeah...

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.860
rolls it up like play-doh and puts it away in that cabinet

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.620
the boy now becoming a
new real estate agent

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.680
and welcomes in a new couple

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.360
So with all that said what does it all mean?

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.660
The entire film is based on that first
scene with the little girl.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.480
The entire thing is a critique, like she said

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.240
"I don't like nature. I don't  like
how things are, it's horrible!"

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.740
and the way that it does that is genius

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.280
using daily cuckoo bird.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.640
throughout the film at key points we hear birds chirping

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.320
like in Gemma's classroom or when
her co-worker says the markets are

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.610
going through the roof, when Tom and
Gemma are in the car, and so on.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:35.480
all the criticisms this film has are pointed out using
a different aspect of the cuckoo bird itself

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:41.000
It's layer upon layer of cuckoo
metaphors and it does so masterfully

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.140
Let me explain

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.240
First, the film criticizes Gemma. Gemma is flawed

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.720
She lets others dictate her life: a co-worker entices her

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.000
with the fear of missing out
before house prices go up.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.680
Martin reels her in into looking at
a suburb house she doesn't want

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.720
because it might not be available
much longer and so on.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.600
The only one who doesn't use this
tactic with her, actually, is Tom.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.480
He's the only one in her life
genuinely giving her good advice

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.980
and she ignores it, just like in that opening scene:

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.240
she can't see what's wrong with a situation.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.040
That's just nature. That's  just how things are.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.600
The cuckoo is used to point out that Gemma

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.860
can't see what's wrong with a
situation including her own.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.820
And then it goes one layer deeper

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.300
because then the cuckoo situation is forced on her.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.800
All of a sudden, now she's taking
care of another's offspring.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.480
What better way to make someone 
realize the horribleness of a situation

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.240
then by forcing them to live it.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.800
She too is completely hooked by the child
who takes advantage of her

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.200
and plays on her maternal instincts by
mimicking her and needing her nurturing.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.880
Just like her coworker and Martin take advantage of her fear of missing out and peer pressure instincts

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.900
and it works

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.960
for a time.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.400
Because actually Gemma isn't all bad

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.640
we do see her briefly shaking her head
after the housing price conversation

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.080
and she does, at first, resist the kid

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.260
but really by the end of the movie,
Gemma comes full circle.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:10.100
Eventually the situation gets so bad
so horrible even she can see it

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:15.149
she snaps when Tom dies, and with her last
dying breath, as the former boy zips her

00:10:15.149 --> 00:10:20.490
body bag: We can see she sees and
understands what the cuckoo has done

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.400
"I'm not your effing mum."

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.720
Perhaps she even finally  understood 
what the boy himself has become:

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.440
A full-grown cuckoo ready to
take the role of Martin

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.040
and entrap another couple with his offspring.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.280
In her last moment she has
overcome the dictates of others

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.520
Secondly, we have Tom.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.260
Tom actually does seem to care for the baby bird

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.140
that was ejected from its nest
as we see him burying it.

00:10:45.149 --> 00:10:47.420
He doesn't have Gemma's problem:

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.280
He's okay with not seeing the place,

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.640
Never gets enticed by the kid
and generally has good ideas

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.100
and is right about almost everything!

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.160
I mean, yeah!

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:01.620
How about we don't go to the place this really creepy
real estate agent is trying to set us up with?

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.260
But Tom's got a different problem

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.140
and here the cuckoo analogy
plays a different role.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.240
Tom is a cuck

00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:12.380
A cuckold. Derived, you guessed
it, from the word cuckoo.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.140
A cuckold is someone who
let's other walk all over them.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.120
This is again the critique of the girl
who doesn't accept how things are

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.519
You can have all the right answers in the world

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.660
but if you don't have the
conviction to stand by them.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.280
What is going to change?

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.480
Nothing.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.280
He might try to turn off the TV
or tell Gemma to let the boy die

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.580
but he always gives in.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.149
They go see the place, Gemma lets
the boy out of the locked car

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:40.400
the two grow close and the TV stays on

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.400
and Tom himself is the one ejected from the nest

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.200
Alone

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.780
Outside

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.060
Digging a hole

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.320
in which he is eventually buried

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.580
just like the baby bird which was kicked
out by the cuckoo and that he to buried

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.900
but we are not done.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.200
What in the world is going on in Yonder?

00:11:59.200 --> 00:11:59.920
Who made it?

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.140
What's the purpose of it?

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.060
Why Number 9?

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.200
What did the trippy TV and language mean?

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.040
and who did the boy meet?

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.940
Let's take a look at a few hints

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.460
When Tom flicks his cigarette
onto the grass, it doesn't burn it.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.100
It has this weird distortion sound
effect and the grass just recedes.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.560
Furthermore, when Tom goes digging

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.120
we see that it's artificial with no subsoil or roots.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.520
Other similarly weird things are
that all the houses and clouds

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.200
seem like they're all the same, repeating pattern

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.319
and there's also the weirdness of the former
boy being able to go under the sidewalk

00:12:35.319 --> 00:12:37.800
and Gemma clipping through the walls.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.580
That's all because, according to my theory,

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.880
they are in a simulation, and in my opinion

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.220
Specifically a gaming simulation although 
I'll talk about another option later.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.540
Sim games are a genre of gaming
that includes a huge amount of titles .

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.940
All the way from The Sims, Sim
City, and Rollercoaster Tycoon,

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.060
to Farming Simulator to arguably, 
Minecraft and Ark: Survival Evolved.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.540
Simulation games are meant
to imitate a real-world activity

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.300
but obviously they can't
be a perfect one-to-one copy

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.580
due to processing limitations they often
have to make very specific compromises.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:17.100
For example, using just one 3D model of a
house and repeating it again and again

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:21.060
Or one 3D model of a cloud,
 repeating it again and again

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.420
Or or example. using simple low
res effects for grass burning

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.660
instead of the real looking thing

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.080
and maybe not bothering with
designing roots or proper subsoil

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.909
Games very often reduce the resolution drastically

00:13:33.909 --> 00:13:36.800
in areas they don't expect
the player to get to

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.640
Out of bound areas.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.140
Which explains why Tom started to see
the dirt come in small clumps

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.160
When he got deeper in the hole

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.600
and that explains different mechanics
like the house popping back up

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.500
after being burned down,
their trash disappearing,

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.460
and the food they need appearing regularly

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.559
As for Gemma moving through
walls that looks exactly like

00:13:56.559 --> 00:14:00.789
some sort of accidental clipping bug
probably triggered by her entering a

00:14:00.789 --> 00:14:05.200
non-player area by chasing the man
and the other people she sees?

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.980
Other save files

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.000
played by other players.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.140
Maybe this game is very popular

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.720
with so many wanting to
escape the pressures of their lives

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.180
not only can we tell from the different
colors of the houses that Gemma sees

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.540
that there are many other neighborhoods
going on at the same time

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.680
but from the fact that Martin's car
at the beginning of the movie is different

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.580
from the former boy's car which
he steals from Gemma at the end.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.440
We can tell it continues happening
to different people every time .

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.120
Not just the same ones again and again

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.370
As I said simulation games are
meant to imitate a real-world activity

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:47.660
but yet at the same time, they are so popular because
they allow players to escape their own reality.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.400
This too is a criticism of the
movie in my opinion.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.640
Players of simulation games get to enjoy
 the good aspects of the activities

00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:00.020
without the bad aspects such as stress or 
injury that can come from the real thing.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.100
It's not criticizing those players

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.700
but it's criticizing people trying
to do that in their real lives

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.400
trying to live without anxiety or risk.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.840
Conforming to the needs and wants of society

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.360
like getting a house and raising a kid

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.180
without thinking for themselves
and being willing to take chances.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.700
The movie points out the extreme
version of how monotonous and empty

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.480
it is for you let others tell you how to live.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.539
By literally use the example of
someone dictating to you how to live

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:32.580
The Player dictating the real-world life
of a character in a sim game.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.340
There is a limit to how much you can escape

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.520
at some point you still need to rise up in your own life

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.920
and face challenges otherwise people suffer.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.700
Baby hatchlings get kicked out of nests
and who knows!

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.380
Maybe it's actually the NPC's in your game

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.280
You assumed were subconscious

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.160
but we're actually living the horror of Tom and Gemma.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.420
In which case, I must actually be worse than Hitler

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.120
but that's probably taking
the analogy too far

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.880
This is again the criticism of the little girl who sees
something wrong and isn't okay with it;

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.020
Suffering.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:07.900
But is faced with Gemma as
a jaded adult who is okay with it

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.500
So who's doing all this to them?

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.100
In my opinion: the player

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.840
the third person this movie is criticizing: Us.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.860
That  is also who the boy meets
in my opinion and why he can't say

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.100
He's part of it. A part of the program

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.380
and he can't break the game's rules

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.400
The TV and the strange language in the book

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.980
Those are all coda Ex-Ah-Cute-Tables:

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.960
Ones-and-zeroes. gibberish to
anyone other than a machine

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.540
This is why the boy becomes capable of 
breaking the physics engine's rules

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.780
and escape by going underneath the pavement

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.040
His program has admin privileges.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.350
As for the Number 9

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.300
I think this is more of a reference,
above anything else.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.880
Either to a British TV called Inside No. 9

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.940
in which easy story took place in a
building with the number 9 on it

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.160
Or more likely to the nine stages of life

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.900
Prenatal Development

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.520
Infancy and toddlerhood,

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.880
Early childhood

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.280
Middle childhood

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.660
Adolescence

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.060
Early adulthood

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.640
Middle adulthood

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.300
Late adulthood

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.840
Death and dying.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.189
With the boy going through all
of these stages fairly quickly

00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:21.900
and this process of boys
growing up, implied to be a cycle.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.760
So that's my explanation

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.580
The cuckoo bird metaphor is used to
criticize Gemma's indifference,

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:28.600
Tom's inaction

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.180
and our society's thoughtlessness

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.480
In other words:

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.280
A lack of care

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.380
A lack of action

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.740
and a like a thought.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.880
There are a few other possibilities.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.020
The language can be an alien language

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.720
Especially the kind of alien that evolved on their world

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.420
In a similar parasitic way to the way
the cuckoo bird evolved in ours

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.919
and that explains the voice chirping
when imitating who he saw

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:55.880
and that species is using our society to 
raise its offspring in the same way.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.340
By creating a cheap knockoff
simulation of our world

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.580
while we do its bidding

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.800
Who knows!

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.980
Maybe, Martin gassed Tom and
Gemma as soon as they entered his office

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.080
and their brains are actually hooked
up on a mothership somewhere

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.620
So the boy can learn to imitate them

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:16.980
but in my opinion aliens can be too easy
of a catch-all explanation sometimes

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:21.280
I really want to hear if anyone else has other theories like this or

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.840
can explain the alien theory

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.880
or my theory a bit deeper

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.940
Please feel free to comment with your opinion.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.039
Making these videos and theorizing is

00:18:30.039 --> 00:18:32.180
something I really enjoy doing but

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.149
usually it's even more fun to jump into

00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:38.230
the comments and see the theories
evolve after the video is published

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:41.289
So that being said thank you so much
for watching ladies and gentlemen

00:18:41.289 --> 00:18:43.320

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.840
Wait. Do you hear?

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.220
Sounds like...

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.080
*Cuckoo cuckoos*
