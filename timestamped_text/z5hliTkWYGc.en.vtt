00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.520
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today, I’m going&nbsp;
to explain an American fantasy adventure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.800
comedy film called “Gulliver’s Travels.” 
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care!
 
&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.440
A middle-aged man named Lemuel Gulliver wakes up&nbsp;
in his messy New York apartment and goes on with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.480
his morning routine. He talks to his superhero&nbsp;
toys on a shelf and dances in the shower,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.920
showing us his goofy side. Gulliver works in&nbsp;
the mailroom of a New York newspaper company.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.360
That day, he meets a new employee named Dan and&nbsp;
befriends him. Gulliver is Dan's boss in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.480
mailing department. As the two deliver their mail&nbsp;
for the day, they come across Gulliver’s longtime&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.840
crush and a journalist named Darcy Silverman.&nbsp;
He has been in love with her for years but has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.200
never confessed. Later that day, Dan brings out&nbsp;
a notice that says he has been promoted to head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.560
of the mail department on his first day. Gulliver&nbsp;
has been working in the facility for ten years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.960
but no one there respects him. Dan claims&nbsp;
that Gulliver is scared to talk and will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.000
never progress in life other than his mailroom&nbsp;
job. A distressed Gulliver is walking out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.880
the office and notices Darcy working late. 
He gathers up courage and goes to her cabin to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.160
ask her out. However, his nerves get the best&nbsp;
of him, so instead, he picks up a random paper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.280
from her desk and heads out. Darcy asks him if he&nbsp;
wants to apply for a travel writing assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.400
A nervous Gulliver agrees and has to submit&nbsp;
a travel blog the following day. At home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.360
he copies and pastes several articles from the&nbsp;
internet for the blog. The following day at work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.320
he submits it to Darcy, who is impressed by his&nbsp;
writing skills and provides him with a new task.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.880
She wants him to travel to the Bermuda Triangle&nbsp;
and write an article about the legends of ships&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.640
mysteriously disappearing there. To impress her,&nbsp;
Gulliver agrees. Darcy arranges a contact and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.080
a boat for him. Gulliver flies to Bermuda the&nbsp;
very next day, where he is picked up by a man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.960
He takes Gulliver to a rented boat and shows him&nbsp;
how to use it. The journey is pretty simple as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.320
the boat is automated. Gulliver finally sails for&nbsp;
the Bermuda triangle alone in the boat. For the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.360
first few hours, he enjoys himself by reading&nbsp;
‘how to build a robot’ magazines and drinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.960
several cans of coke. He soon falls asleep.
Sometime later, he wakes up to a massive wave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.720
in front of him. A sea storm hits, and he quickly&nbsp;
puts a life jacket on. The boat shakes vigorously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.480
in the water. Gulliver turns around to see an&nbsp;
enormous sea tornado coming his way. Gulliver,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.160
with his boat, is sucked on top of the tornado,&nbsp;
then right into its eyes. The screen goes black.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.080
When Gulliver opens his eyes, he cannot move his&nbsp;
body. He looks down and is surprised when he sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.600
some tiny men standing on top of his chest. Their&nbsp;
leader introduces himself as the commander Edward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.120
Edwardian of the Liliput. The camera zooms out,&nbsp;
showing us a crowd of tiny people standing around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.720
Gulliver. He is pinned to the ground with tiny&nbsp;
ropes and wood. Commander Edward calls Gulliver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.560
“a beast.” A confused Gulliver yells in fear and&nbsp;
breaks free from the ropes easily. Thinking that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.320
this is a dream, he tries closing his eyes. Edward&nbsp;
orders his soldiers to bring the beast down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.640
The soldiers attach their hooks to Gulliver’s&nbsp;
pants and make him fall unconscious. 
&nbsp;

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.800
When he wakes up, Gulliver finds himself tied&nbsp;
to a cart and being pulled into the kingdom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.120
of Lilliput. The tiny civilians come out of&nbsp;
their houses to get a look at the ‘beast.’&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.480
He is pulled into the royal palace and presented&nbsp;
to the King of Lilliput, King Theodore. The king’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.200
daughter, Princess Mary, pities Gulliver and&nbsp;
asks Edward if the restraints are necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.200
Edward claims that Gulliver is a spy&nbsp;
from their enemy kingdom, Blefuscia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.640
Gulliver finally speaks and asks the king where&nbsp;
he is. King Theodore's secretary, Jinks, tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.840
that he is in Lilliput, the greatest nation in the&nbsp;
world. Gulliver thinks this is a prank and asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.800
the non-existent cameraman to show himself. 
In the following scene, we see Gulliver imprisoned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.840
inside a cave. He meets a fellow prisoner named&nbsp;
Horatio, who was sentenced to life by Edward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.320
for trying to court princess Mary. The two are&nbsp;
approached by Edward again, who listens to them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.040
referring to him as ‘lame ass.’ When an angry&nbsp;
Edward threatens to imprison them for life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.840
Gulliver claims ‘lame ass’ means someone who is&nbsp;
brave. Happy with the answer, Edward takes both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.240
the prisoners to a field to plow it with the help&nbsp;
of Gulliver’s strength. He restraints Gulliver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.200
with a machine. Just then, two rings of a bell are&nbsp;
heard from the palace, indicating that Blefuscia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.240
has attacked. They are trying to kidnap Princess&nbsp;
Mary and have started a fire at the palace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.880
Edward quickly runs to the palace and orders&nbsp;
everyone not to save the princess, as he wants to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.000
be the one to save her. But Horatio asks Gulliver&nbsp;
to do it because Edward can’t reach her on time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.840
Gulliver easily takes the Blefuscian&nbsp;
soldiers down and saves the princess.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.560
But the king and his secretary are stuck in&nbsp;
the fire. Gulliver, in a hurry, urinates on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.280
the building. Everyone claps for him when he&nbsp;
stops the fire and saves king Theodore. 
&nbsp;

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.440
The king removes him and Horatio from&nbsp;
imprisonment and thanks Gulliver for his bravery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.400
He also invites everyone for a feast at night to&nbsp;
celebrate the occasion. Edward is furious to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.880
someone else being praised for their bravery.&nbsp;
At the feast, the king asks Gulliver where he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.520
is from, and he answers he is from Manhattan. The&nbsp;
people assume that Gulliver was the president of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.960
Manhattan as he is the bravest one there. Gulliver&nbsp;
feels like a hero for the first time in his life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.880
so he fabricates the story, claiming he was known&nbsp;
as “president the awesome.” Everyone believes him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.760
except for Edward. The following day, the people&nbsp;
of Lilliput build a massive home for Gulliver with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.344
all the facilities he couldn’t get when he was&nbsp;
in New York. The king sends a search party to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.344 --> 00:05:22.080
look for his washed-up boat at Gulliver’s&nbsp;
request. Gulliver also makes them build a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.960
theater to fit everyone in the kingdom. Then,&nbsp;
he shows them a drama of the sinking Titanic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.080
claiming it to be the story of his life. Everyone&nbsp;
is amazed by the tragic life that he has had.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.880
Edward inquires how he was saved after drowning,&nbsp;
and Gulliver claims that he was resuscitated. 
&nbsp;

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.280
Later, Horatio asks Gulliver to help him&nbsp;
impress princess Mary, and Gulliver agrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.240
The two go to the palace, and Horatio approaches&nbsp;
the princess. A hidden Gulliver recites the lyrics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.040
of the song “Kiss,” making Horatio repeat it. By&nbsp;
the end of it, the princess starts to fall for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.760
Horatio. But she is called by Edward, who has come&nbsp;
to court her. The two have been destined to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.880
married as Edward is the bravest of the kingdom.&nbsp;
Princess Mary isn’t fond of Edward, but she cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.320
seem to get rid of him. Somewhere else, the search&nbsp;
party finds the washed-up boat with cans of coke.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.640
Gulliver comes to the scene and finds his phone&nbsp;
is still working. He has twelve voice messages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.200
from Darcy. Turns out she is furious to have&nbsp;
found out about Gulliver’s plagiarized article.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.160
She has to now sail on the same trail Gulliver&nbsp;
came through to do the Bermuda triangle research&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.560
herself. Gulliver now doesn’t want to go back&nbsp;
to New York and face her, so he decides to stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.040
in Lilliput permanently. Edward is not happy&nbsp;
about the decision and tells the king he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.520
suspicious of Gulliver. The king dismisses&nbsp;
him, claiming that he trusts Gulliver. 
&nbsp;

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.720
Because of his stay, the king gives&nbsp;
Gulliver the title of the new general&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.840
and demotes Edward to vice general. A jealous&nbsp;
Edward turns Lilliput’s defense system off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.880
making it easier for their&nbsp;
enemies Blefuscia to attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.600
Blefuscian soldiers and their king see this&nbsp;
and plan to attack Lilliput immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.000
They approach the kingdom through waters and&nbsp;
launch cannonballs toward Lilliput. Being the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.560
general, now it is Gulliver’s responsibility to&nbsp;
stop them. He nervously steps into the water and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.600
starts to splash it around. The cannonballs do not&nbsp;
work on Gulliver, who is massive compared to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.800
Eventually, he defeats the Blefuscians and becomes&nbsp;
the savior of Lilliput. The people from Lilliput&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.920
fulfill all of Gulliver’s wishes. They even build&nbsp;
a model of Times Square so he would feel at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.280
They change their clothing to match that&nbsp;
of Gullivers. Soldiers are appointed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.080
to cut his hair and give him massages. 
One night, Edward barges into the princess’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.040
chamber. He claims that it is his right to&nbsp;
come in anytime because he courts the princess.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.200
The princess finally reveals that she doesn’t love&nbsp;
him and doesn’t want him to court her anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.800
An angered Edward leaves for Blefiscia to ask for&nbsp;
help from their king. Edward’s men have found the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.280
‘build your robot’ book Gulliver had on the boat.&nbsp;
The Blefiscian king agrees to help him build a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.480
robot using the book to battle Gulliver. Some&nbsp;
days later, Gulliver is at the model time square&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.480
when the bells of the palace ring, suggesting&nbsp;
an invasion. Gulliver gets ready to battle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.440
tiny people but is surprised when a huge robot&nbsp;
being operated by Edward stands in front of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.720
Edward challenges him for a duel. Gulliver has no&nbsp;
way out but to accept. He tries to push the robot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.240
but it is way stronger than him. It picks Gulliver&nbsp;
up with his pants and makes him accept his defeat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.600
Gulliver also confesses that everything&nbsp;
he said about him being the president&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.000
is a lie. The king and the princess are&nbsp;
surprised to have been betrayed by him. 
&nbsp;

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Edward sends Gulliver to a forbidden place&nbsp;
called "the island where we dare not go"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.480
as a punishment. When Gulliver is left there,&nbsp;
he is picked up by a giant little girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.040
Turns out the island is the home of giants. The&nbsp;
girl thinks Gulliver is a toy and keeps him in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.320
her Barbie house, dressing him in girly pink&nbsp;
clothes. Meanwhile, back in Lilliput, Darcy’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.120
body washes up on the shore. Gulliver had told&nbsp;
everyone that Darcy is his princess back home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.640
so Edward recognizes her and imprisons her. She&nbsp;
meets King Theodore and his queen in prison, who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.880
have been captured after Gulliver’s defeat. 
Horatio sees this and decides to travel to "the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.400
island where we dare not go" to get Gulliver back.&nbsp;
He is minuscule on the island and manages to reach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:58.000
Gulliver safely. The little girl’s dollhouse also&nbsp;
has a skeleton of a dead U.S. Air Force pilot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.840
Gulliver uses the parachute to&nbsp;
escape and fly back to Lilliput. 
&nbsp;

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.000
He first goes to meet Darcy in the prison&nbsp;
and confesses that he has a crush on her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.920
She forgives him for plagiarizing the&nbsp;
article and seems to be opening up to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.480
Gulliver has decided to challenge Edward for&nbsp;
a duel. He doesn’t want to prove his bravery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.520
anymore but genuinely wants to help Lilliput. 
The following day, the two stand before each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.840
ready to battle. Gulliver wants Edward to give&nbsp;
the kingdom back to king Theodore if he wins.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:29.040
But if he loses, Edward will destroy the kingdom&nbsp;
altogether. The two fight, and Edward overpowers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.880
him within seconds. Horatio runs to help him and&nbsp;
manages to get inside the robot. He defeats Edward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:40.400
from inside, eventually depowering the robot.&nbsp;
After that, Gulliver easily manages to defeat it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.360
and the crowd erupts in cheers, even Darcy&nbsp;
celebrates the win. Because of Horatio’s bravery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.560
he is provided permission to court Princess&nbsp;
Mary. The two finally kiss. But just then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.960
Edward, who has reached the point of insanity,&nbsp;
takes the princess hostage, but the princess,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.040
finally having enough of Edward, beats&nbsp;
the traitor up in frustration. Darcy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.440
then kisses Gulliver for the first time. 
The Blefiscian king and Theodore are about to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.920
initiate the war again, but Gulliver stops them.&nbsp;
He successfully helps to make peace between the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:13.200
rival island-nations by reciting Edwin Starr's&nbsp;
"War,” and finally, he, along with Darcy, return&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.600
to New York City on their repaired ship. 
Cut to a few weeks later, Gulliver has left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.880
the mailroom job and is a travel writer now. He&nbsp;
and Darcy are in a happy relationship. Gulliver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.400
has just completed a travel assignment,&nbsp;
and the movie ends as the two walk out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.960
Darcy’s office while holding hands.
