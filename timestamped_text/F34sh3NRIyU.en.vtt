00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.280
on it while they are marching out they meet with&nbsp;
another group the arcadians the leader of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.680
arcadians says they heard that sparta was going&nbsp;
out to fight against turks's and they are here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.360
to join but he is surprised at the small number of&nbsp;
men the king brought with him to show how arrogant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.120
and cocky the spartans are leonidas asked one of&nbsp;
the soldiers from arcadia what his profession was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.280
of 300 and roars what their profession was the&nbsp;
arcadians are met with thunderous Hooo! and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.280
king says that he has more soldiers than you have&nbsp;
the arcadians are impressed and everyone marches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.760
down to the ocean together meanwhile the&nbsp;
queen wants to talk to the councilmen to ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.160
if they will send an army to help leonidas&nbsp;
fight against the persian army she has one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.480
of the councilmen trying to set up the meeting and&nbsp;
he says that she will be able to speak in two days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.840
she says that the king may not have two days&nbsp;
when the group finally get to the beach area the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.320
arcadians are starting to doubt themselves when&nbsp;
they see how many persian boats are in the ocean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.000
that night the greeks gods send a huge storm to&nbsp;
turn over and destroy some of those boats and at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.800
first the arcadians are happy but in the morning&nbsp;
the number of boats seem to have not diminished&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.360
the other spartan men are happy as they&nbsp;
can only hope to finally meet their match&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.080
someone that can give them a cause to have a&nbsp;
beautiful death they want to die for a good cause&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.200
for their country as they are setting up a wall of&nbsp;
stone one of the searches these messengers comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.560
up to demand once again that sparked a bow on&nbsp;
their knees the messenger mocks the wall of stones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.200
the spartans are building before he sees that in&nbsp;
between those stones are the dead bodies of some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.240
members of the persian army that was in charge&nbsp;
of the lookout one of the spartans insult him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.520
and with aliens before he can stretch out his whip&nbsp;
the spartan jumps and cuts off the messenger's arm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.600
orders him to tell xerxes that the fight is on&nbsp;
while this is happening a hunched back monster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.480
named Ephialtes that has been following them&nbsp;
walks up to leonidas and his captain who wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.040
to help fight he warns the king that there is&nbsp;
another opening that the persians can get through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.720
he has a strong thrust with his spear but cannot&nbsp;
raise up the heavy shield he carries the king&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.800
says he cannot fight with the spartans because&nbsp;
the spartans use their shields to cover not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.760
only themselves but also cover the man to their&nbsp;
left and since Ephialtes cannot raise his shield&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.840
he is of no use ethialtes gets extremely upset in&nbsp;
the first battle shows how strong the spartans are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.640
in the narrow opening they stand and wait while&nbsp;
the first group of persian armies come out to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.560
fight they easily beat the army killing them&nbsp;
all in tactical formation slaying them like they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.320
brought them to war and finally driving the rest&nbsp;
into the sea the spartans wins losing no one while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.120
they catch their breath the rest of the persian&nbsp;
army shoots out so many arrows that they block&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.000
the sunlight in unity the spartans fend off the&nbsp;
arrows with their shields and call them cowards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.280
while both sides take a time out to recoup and&nbsp;
clean up the battlefield xerxes comes out to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.680
meet with leonidas xerxes is a seven foot bald and&nbsp;
pierced god king he again offers leonidas a chance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.320
to bow down to him but the king says that it will&nbsp;
not happen as his thighs are sore from killing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.600
first persian army xerxes is pissed off and says&nbsp;
that he can wipe out sparta and no one on earth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.480
will ever know about them will never know who they&nbsp;
are he will cut out the tongues and eyes of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.920
who even mention their name and soon everyone will&nbsp;
forget who king leonidas is or who the spartans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.200
are the next battle is against the immortals&nbsp;
they are soulless monsters who have black eyes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.000
and teeth that are filed into fangs they wear&nbsp;
those black and gold masks and their special&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.760
weapon is this huge chained up monster the king&nbsp;
chop off the monster head and the spartans easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.840
defeat these enemies though they do lose some of&nbsp;
their men as xerxes watches on this godlike deity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.560
feels a human chill go up his spine the next&nbsp;
fights have the persians bringing on as much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.160
power as they can using large size animal-like&nbsp;
rhinos elephants from halfway around the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.920
and magics but still the spartans conquer when&nbsp;
xerxes sees the army losing he disciplines his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.480
generals by chopping off their heads during&nbsp;
one of these battles the captain's son's head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.480
gets chopped off and he cries out as his heart is&nbsp;
broken it takes three men to pull them off his son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.760
the following morning the king meets with one of&nbsp;
his man dilios and asks him to return home to tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.440
the tale of sparta to tell everyone all the greeks&nbsp;
his story and his 300 men he knows that they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.960
going to die for sparta he gives back the necklace&nbsp;
his wife gave him to dilios to return to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.400
meanwhile the queen is meeting with theron she&nbsp;
offers him something to drink to which he asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.280
if it's poison he says that the councilman&nbsp;
will never allow an army to go to the king&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.400
and he insinuates that he can persuade them that&nbsp;
she sleeps with him she allows it and he roughly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.680
starts to have sex with her while telling her this&nbsp;
will not be over quickly you will not enjoy it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.440
i'm not your king Ephialtes has gone to xerxes&nbsp;
in the tent there are belly dancers concubines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:09.680
contortionists transsexuals and slaves he is in&nbsp;
awe of everything xerxes has to offer wealth women&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.720
a chance to fight if only he bowed down to&nbsp;
him at the ephialtes mesmerized by everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.360
agrees and tells him about the second opening&nbsp;
where the persian army can easily overpower the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.480
spartans the next day the queen gets to meet with&nbsp;
the councilman she gives a great speech to why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.200
they should allow the army to go and help the king&nbsp;
some of the members are touched by what she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.720
saying and is starting to agree with her when she&nbsp;
ends her speech theron sarcastically applauds her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.920
he turns against her by saying that why should&nbsp;
anyone listen to her as she is an adulteress&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.320
he tells everyone that she came onto him&nbsp;
and offered herself to him but that he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:50.720
an honest man and turned her down she gets upset&nbsp;
and starts to go after him but two guards grab her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:56.640
she struggles to let go which they do and when she&nbsp;
is free she grabs one of their swords and stabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:02.000
theron in the stomach when she pulls out the sword&nbsp;
as money pouch also comes free and as he falls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.040
so do the persian coins that he's been bribed with&nbsp;
the other councilman pick one of the coins up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.000
realize he's a traitor and word spreads quickly&nbsp;
once again xerxes comes out to watch as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.680
persian army surrounds the spartans and one of his&nbsp;
minions asks leonidas to bow down to xerxes but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.960
this time leonidas actually takes off his headgear&nbsp;
and puts down his shield in spear and kneels down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.880
but only to compose himself as his huddled group&nbsp;
of spartan men break away and one number runs up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.760
and jumps on leonidas's back to spear that&nbsp;
minion to death as everyone starts fighting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.080
again the king picks up his spear and throws&nbsp;
it where it slices through Xerxes's cheek&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.800
but does not kill him xerxes is surprised&nbsp;
and holds his hand up to his bleeding face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:49.360
one by one the spartans fall even the king after&nbsp;
facing the sun and saying his last words my love&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.920
the rest of the persian army makes sure all the&nbsp;
spartans are dead by shooting a gazillion arrows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.720
into the air again dilios returns home to give the&nbsp;
queen the necklace and he spreads the word about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:04.240
their victory it ends one year later where dilios&nbsp;
looks like he's the leader of the spartan army now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.640
and they are getting ready to fight the persians&nbsp;
again but this time there are thousands and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.920
thousands of spartans in on command they run&nbsp;
