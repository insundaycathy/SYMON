00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.680
you have never seen anything like this&nbsp;
trapped in a giant cube and forced to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.240
compete to the death in twisted children's&nbsp;
games this movie has zero chill putting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.640
your strength intelligence and sanity to&nbsp;
the test with a trick around every corner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.120
what do you do this one will have your reasoning&nbsp;
with utter madness as i'm going to break down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.680
the mistakes made which you should do in how&nbsp;
to beat the twisted games in as the gods will

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.080
it's a normal school day until the teacher's head&nbsp;
explodes into bloody marbles and a japanese daruma&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.560
doll pops out of his stump telling the class he&nbsp;
wants to play a game the rumor dolls are a common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.600
symbol for good luck in japan but it's safe to&nbsp;
say this one isn't the lucky kind this daruma doll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.160
here starts the game and turns around as these&nbsp;
two kids run for the exit and their heads explode&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.680
into marbles too this particular death game is way&nbsp;
too bloody for youtube so every time you see these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.880
here someone's head just exploded and you'll have&nbsp;
to use a little bit of imagination the doll tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.440
them the rules of the game this is red light green&nbsp;
light the nightmare version usually this is just a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.120
children's game where you have to sneak up on the&nbsp;
leader in the front and tag them before they turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.120
around and see you but in this version they have&nbsp;
to push the button in the back of the doll without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.240
being seen before time runs out and if he turns&nbsp;
around and sees you moving your head will explode&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.120
okay this is [ __ ] insane but if you're only&nbsp;
thinking about why this is happening you're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.200
to lose the game we need to be thinking about how&nbsp;
to keep our heads and beat this thing before the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.760
time runs out if we're free to move around when&nbsp;
he's not looking we need to maximize his time to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.880
gather information and develop a team strategy as&nbsp;
much as possible this hero tries to rush forward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.960
to push the button but doesn't make it in time&nbsp;
as the daruma doll turns his head and catches it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.320
moving being a hero won't work but if we move as&nbsp;
a group and each take one step at a time in unison&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.960
our chances of survival increase some people will&nbsp;
mess up but with each step we'll get closer to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.920
achieving the goal next we can block his sight&nbsp;
once we're all closer i toss my jacket over his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.080
head aiming to cover the doll's eyes just as&nbsp;
it turns around you would then have a better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.480
chance of touching the button without getting&nbsp;
killed in a situation like this every piece of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.960
information is useful for survival and we need&nbsp;
to think about what this doll's limitations are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.200
he has no neck so even if he can turn himself&nbsp;
around he doesn't appear to have the physical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.240
ability to look downwards beyond his peripheral&nbsp;
vision so if it's me i'd consider crawling on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.720
floor and sneaking up to him from below the desk&nbsp;
if i could hide below his eye level until he turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.640
around again i could quickly reach the button&nbsp;
without getting caught now i wouldn't actually do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.280
this myself because it's way too risky but i would&nbsp;
advertise it to my schoolmates as a strategy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.480
encourage others to test the idea there's only two&nbsp;
people left standing with 35 seconds remaining but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.840
the kid's friend has an idea he tells sean here to&nbsp;
use him as a springboard to vault over all these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.120
dead bodies and with less than 10 seconds left the&nbsp;
kid rushes forward he jumps off his friend's back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.840
and makes it to the rumor doll pressing the button&nbsp;
with one second remaining what a badass way to win&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.240
the game but there's no time to celebrate because&nbsp;
this kid's head explodes and we learn a simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.760
fact in this case there can only be one winner the&nbsp;
daruma doll explains the student who presses the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.720
button is the only one who gets to live and then&nbsp;
warns him that he's a mouse and that the cat is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.680
coming this means that there are more horrifying&nbsp;
games we have to go through and we can't relax&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.080
now considering all these dead students saved my&nbsp;
life by making enough mistakes for me to learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.640
from i'm looking for other students from the other&nbsp;
classes to try banding together the more bodies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.040
there are between me and the next death game the&nbsp;
lower the probability that i'm dying right away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.600
and i can figure out how to keep myself alive&nbsp;
that's when the kid's childhood friend ichika&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.640
opens the door he finds out that she was in a&nbsp;
daruma doll game of her own and she won just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.480
like him he uses his momentary freedom to call the&nbsp;
police but finds out he's not in a service area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.800
okay this is the time to find a way out and&nbsp;
to plan ahead i would take this opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.600
to explore all escape options even if we find out&nbsp;
there's no way to escape we can focus on beating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.720
the games it's clear that other games are coming&nbsp;
as the daruma doll said so i'm going to take my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.040
time carefully investigating my surroundings and&nbsp;
gathering useful resources for whatever might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.880
come next things to throw like pencil cases rulers&nbsp;
scissors or even textbooks they continue running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.280
until they reach the gymnasium where they see&nbsp;
a bunch of other students wearing mice costumes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.000
the door suddenly shuts itself behind them and now&nbsp;
they're locked in this is their next game and as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.280
the writing on the floor explains the objective is&nbsp;
to put a bell on a cat the class president orders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.840
them to put on the mice costumes but they don't&nbsp;
and this hesitation will pay off later the floor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.200
opens up and a giant manaki neko statue rises up&nbsp;
this is yet another symbol of good luck in japan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.840
that's going to bring these students the exact&nbsp;
opposite the goal to put the giant bell in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.520
cat's basket collar without getting eaten okay&nbsp;
whoever designed these challenges are complete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.080
psychopaths we're told to get into a mouse costume&nbsp;
and personally i would rush to put one on because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.720
i'd be scared of punishment for not following&nbsp;
the rules but immediately it eats a mouse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.360
but those still in their school uniforms are&nbsp;
left alone so there's more to this than it seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.600
as long as there are meister chase it's blind&nbsp;
to the students who are still wearing uniforms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.640
if the mice costumes are optional but this must be&nbsp;
considered a variable in our strategy to defeat it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.360
so i would take off my mouse costume immediately&nbsp;
and take a step back to safely assess the pieces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.840
of the game this collar is about 20 feet high&nbsp;
double the height of a regular basketball hoop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.000
unless your dude perfect and nailing impossible&nbsp;
shots the likelihood of a regular student getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.720
this shot off is extremely low and it would take&nbsp;
too many attempts to even consider as a viable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.520
option with the cat running us over and swiping at&nbsp;
us it's too dangerous to make multiple attempts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.080
throw the bell in its face it also has a string&nbsp;
along its back that could be grabbed if we ran up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.440
it my solution is to climb it for a dunk or layup&nbsp;
whenever it eats a mouse it pauses and that's your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.360
best chance at this you could wrap the bound on&nbsp;
your shirt and tie around your back like a sling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.960
then when a classmate gets eaten climb up the&nbsp;
cat with the bell in the sling and work your way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.600
around the collar to go in for the dunk one of the&nbsp;
students is the basketball team's mvp and has the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.760
girl pass the bell over to him the shooter makes&nbsp;
the free throw but the bell is caught by the cat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.040
who throws it right back in the basketball player&nbsp;
they've just lost their mvp and now it can use its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.720
hands things just got way worse they realize the&nbsp;
cat is only eating mice and they finally take off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.360
their mouse costumes putting an end to the most&nbsp;
dangerous cosplay event ever but with no more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.800
mice to eat it starts going for humans now this&nbsp;
is where we need to get a little creative with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.600
our teamwork if there's too many mice more people&nbsp;
will be eaten and if the cat has only one mouse to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.880
chase then you're stuck in a mouse costume with&nbsp;
the undivided intention of a giant [ __ ] cat i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.520
would make everyone wear only the mouse legs and&nbsp;
fold the top of the costume down that way everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.760
can rotate wearing the mouse costume depending on&nbsp;
where the cat is in the room and when it needs to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.920
be distracted somewhere else by simply throwing&nbsp;
on the top of the costume like a jacket we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.480
effectively appear and disappear to the cat as&nbsp;
needed work together to get the bell in the basket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.640
and avoid getting eaten shawn here takes one&nbsp;
for the team and puts on a mouse costume and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.760
after getting seriously cat handled he realizes&nbsp;
he can hear it complain about its itchy back he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.360
finds out so long as he's wearing this hood he can&nbsp;
understand what it's saying i didn't expect this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.080
but we can't be too surprised a cat that likes&nbsp;
mice of course likes to be scratched it probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.800
also likes catnip tearing couch sofas and licks&nbsp;
itself inappropriately in front of guests we need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.280
to think of this thing not just as a monster but&nbsp;
with everything we know about cat behavior they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.280
also love chasing lights and lasers and if any one&nbsp;
of them had a laser pointer they could distract&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.760
the cat away from the mice now that's obviously&nbsp;
a joke but if you're not doing everything you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.080
to use what you know against this thing to keep&nbsp;
yourself alive that you're already losing the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.240
he climbs up the cat and begins to scratch its&nbsp;
back with the help of the other students they all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.800
work together until it finally goes to sleep shun&nbsp;
here is about to put an end to this game but one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.920
of the students questions if there can only be one&nbsp;
winner like the first game this is a valid point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.400
but there's enough objective logic here to infer&nbsp;
the answer in the children's game red light green&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.120
light there can only be one winner whoever reaches&nbsp;
the end first and everyone else is eliminated from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.480
the game basketball however is a team sport and&nbsp;
when one person scores the team benefits this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.120
is enough to convince me to surrender the shot as&nbsp;
someone with more skill if someone was insistent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.360
on shooting and skilled enough to take the shot&nbsp;
i'd put my ego aside and let them have the bell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.000
we don't have time to argue and it's important&nbsp;
to get the job done quickly without interference&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.320
their argument for shooting privileges&nbsp;
wakes up the cat who rips two students apart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.880
they don't have time to put it back to sleep&nbsp;
but sean has another idea grabbing the ripped up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.360
basketball on some spare mice costumes he and his&nbsp;
friend disguise the bell as a basketball since he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.600
knows the camera lives and seen something before&nbsp;
it acts they can confuse the cat and maybe get at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:23.200
least one shot up before time runs out in a high&nbsp;
pressure situation this is really good thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.600
he's been paying attention to the cat's behavior&nbsp;
knows its weakness and is perfectly exploiting it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.480
but he made one mistake if i had seen this room&nbsp;
before i would have used it more strategically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.200
throughout the game we could run inside for cover&nbsp;
as a mouse and come out safely as a student there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.440
also might have been more basketballs in there to&nbsp;
shoot and distract the cat with the girl takes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.320
shot but the cat smacks it away giving the boy the&nbsp;
chance to shoot the bell but it bounces right off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.880
the rim and there's not enough time to try again&nbsp;
right at the last second this student jumps over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.640
the cat's head and slams it into the hoop game&nbsp;
over but the killing continues as the hero of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.320
hour starts killing the other students believing&nbsp;
they don't deserve to live because they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:07.040
brainless losers okay this guy is a psychopath&nbsp;
but he's also not wrong unfortunately i'm not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.840
trusting him in a game because he's blinded by&nbsp;
fanaticism instead of survival in the greater good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.400
killing them off serves us no purpose the more&nbsp;
expendable people that are in the games the more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:21.200
we can benefit from their deaths every game will&nbsp;
require a certain amount of mistakes to learn how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.680
to play them and these kinds of people are perfect&nbsp;
for that let them make the mistakes and we study&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.400
the game's response and then use that information&nbsp;
to beat it then the cap loses sleeping gas at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.200
them knocking them out when sean here wakes up he&nbsp;
finds himself in a room with an old classmate and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.400
some strangers all four students have survived&nbsp;
two games the daruma and the caffeine this guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.120
activates a device and the group finds out they're&nbsp;
trapped in a giant floating cube with no way for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.480
anyone to break in and save them the government&nbsp;
and military are powerless someone knocks on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.280
door and these four kokeshi dolls enter the room&nbsp;
they're here to play kagome kagome a game where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.200
the player wears a blindfold while the kokeshi&nbsp;
dolls sing as they circle around him and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.160
must guess who's behind them when the music stops&nbsp;
this guy guesses incorrectly and gets a laser to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.800
the head as the dolls take control of his body and&nbsp;
start bashing his head against the floor then this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.360
girl goes after him but she can't figure out who&nbsp;
it is either he gets ripped in half from the legs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.160
up okay this one is tricky because the premise&nbsp;
leads you to assume it's a game of chance like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.160
russian roulette for children so the strategy&nbsp;
here is to eliminate as much chance out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.960
equation as possible and we do this by gathering&nbsp;
as much information as we can from every sense of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:32.000
perception we have available to us and then using&nbsp;
them to cheat the game we can try to observe their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.560
starting order before putting the blindfold on if&nbsp;
we can confirm they form a circle in a specific&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.600
gender pattern our chances already improve next we&nbsp;
use our ears to track them by distinguishing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.560
male voices from the female voices if we know the&nbsp;
pattern and locate a male's voice as it circles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.280
it tells us the gender that is behind us when the&nbsp;
music stops now all is left is to determine which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.600
member of the gender it is and now comes the&nbsp;
cheating part of the strategy before i put the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.040
blindfold on i would assign a number of taps for&nbsp;
each doll one tap for this one and four taps for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.200
this one when the doll stops seeing the other&nbsp;
student in the room can tap the number for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.760
doll and hopefully not get ripped apart from where&nbsp;
the sun don't shine when it shuns turn to play&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.400
he can't figure out who's behind him the hero doll&nbsp;
tell him he's out of time and another doll repeats&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.280
it but this was all a part of his plan realizing&nbsp;
who just spoke he deduces correctly which one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.640
is behind him he tricked this doll by playing a&nbsp;
recording of one of them saying you're out of time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.880
baiting her into speaking and revealing the&nbsp;
order of their positions around him all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.960
dolls explode into dust and one of them drops&nbsp;
the key they need to move to the next stage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.280
the two survivors walk out of the room and see&nbsp;
this guy come running at them asking to hold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.320
their hand behind him another doll is chasing them&nbsp;
and they all grab hands just in time the monster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.120
inspects them but leaves when it sees they're&nbsp;
all linked together ichika comes running around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.680
the corner and chun manages to save her from the&nbsp;
handholding monster just in time they meet some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.480
other students as well and discover that to beat&nbsp;
this game they need 7 students to turn seven keys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.440
at the exact same time they don't have enough of&nbsp;
either until that killer student from the cat game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.480
appears has brought exactly what they need with&nbsp;
an extra person to spare and to no one's surprise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:12.000
he eliminates him without remorse once again&nbsp;
foolish i would use this extra kid as a lookout&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.240
for the hand-holding doll because we will need&nbsp;
to stop holding hands in order to turn the keys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.720
and if the hand-holding doll catches us unlinked&nbsp;
we might not be able to turn the keys in time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.280
everything is a resource here and this guy is&nbsp;
wasting them i would confront him that this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.680
a poor strategy and that we can let the game kill&nbsp;
him later but he did just save our lives for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:34.480
second time so i'm not going to hold it against&nbsp;
him too much the alternate keys at the same time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.280
beating this game with 12 seconds left on the&nbsp;
clock meanwhile the cube is live streaming their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.160
victory as everyone gathers in tribuya square to&nbsp;
watch and cheer for them the group go through and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.600
find themselves on a hot spring except everything&nbsp;
is frozen over as soon as i see this environment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.600
i'm staying against the walls this looks like&nbsp;
a lake that's frozen over and i'm not leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:58.000
myself vulnerable to any traps without reason i'm&nbsp;
getting a head start in the game and encouraging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.720
the others to do the same suddenly a giant polar&nbsp;
bear comes surfing in and tells them that in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.600
game everyone will be asked a question that they&nbsp;
need to answer truthfully if they don't they must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:13.600
choose someone to be killed okay this sounds&nbsp;
too easy to be true and i'm not relaxing here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.680
the real game is something hidden beneath the&nbsp;
surface we have to find out what's the trick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.240
there's no incentive for anyone to lie but&nbsp;
surely they won't let us all pass through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:27.520
i'm starting this one off by choosing not to trust&nbsp;
a single word this polar bear says expecting traps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:32.000
of double meaning insinuation or metaphor we&nbsp;
can't think literally even when we're trapped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.200
in a giant cube and talking to a giant polar bear&nbsp;
the first question asked is what is your favorite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.840
food which they'll answer easily but the bears&nbsp;
surely freaks out because someone told a lie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.640
and threatens to kill them if they don't identify&nbsp;
the liar in two minutes the players decide that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:52.080
this guy must be it because his favorite food&nbsp;
is parsley and the bear crushes him to death now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.320
i'm a classic over analyzer too this one would&nbsp;
honestly scare the living [ __ ] out of me the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.200
answer to this question is deceptively complicated&nbsp;
because it's based on a general opinion and not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.840
objectively true if i've had different favorite&nbsp;
foods throughout the years or a favorite in each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.320
food category and if i change my mind after&nbsp;
trying new dishes how could i have one true&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:16.800
answer to this question so therefore how could the&nbsp;
polar bear know the truth is if i myself do not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.760
this revelation is how we beat the game if i don't&nbsp;
know the truth then neither does the polar bear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.240
and none of us have any reason to lie so when&nbsp;
the polar bear says he knows someone is lying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:31.200
that statement itself is a lie and i would&nbsp;
accuse him as his secret liar to beat the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.760
the bear tells them there's an imposter in the&nbsp;
group who's intentionally lying to get them killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.640
this student realizes that everyone goes to the&nbsp;
same school except for this girl so she must be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.840
the imposter and the polar bear stomps her flat&nbsp;
now that's what i call a high school crush but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.000
as the kid looks at the bear's paw he sees&nbsp;
a black patch of skin and realizes that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.640
is a japanese demon bear as the snow melts&nbsp;
off revealing his true identity underneath&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.120
the group was taken to their new arena where&nbsp;
these dolls appear announcing this will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:04.800
the final game kick the cam the rules are simple&nbsp;
whoever is it must take the can and place it in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.360
the circle then try to catch the others by looking&nbsp;
at their face call out their name and step on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:14.800
can those captured can be freed if another player&nbsp;
kicks the can but the kicker must sacrifice his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.000
life because the can will explode the game ends&nbsp;
if the players avoid being captured while the one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.960
who's it wins by capturing at least three players&nbsp;
by the time the sun sets then they draw stakes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:30.240
decide their roles in the psychotic student is&nbsp;
it everyone runs before the shooting kicks one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.880
of the dolls into the air knocking the cane to&nbsp;
the ground and places it at the designated spot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.880
okay hold on a second didn't they say that can&nbsp;
would explode if it was kicked this might mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.040
it's not triggered by impact and could be one&nbsp;
of the game's tricks if we need to kick the can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.840
to save someone later but more importantly if i&nbsp;
was it i need to manage my time wisely because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.640
finding people will be very time consuming and i&nbsp;
need to know how much time i have the setting sun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:59.040
is too abstract and i need to convert that into&nbsp;
minutes the best way to do this is to hold your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.600
fingers horizontally against the sky in between&nbsp;
the horizon and the sun each finger that fits in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.400
between the sun and the earth is approximately 15&nbsp;
minutes the two boys try to hide as far away as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.040
possible but the psycho student finds them first&nbsp;
and beats them into submission that's two down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.560
two to go now finding people who have already hit&nbsp;
it will waste a lot of time and by retrieving the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.920
can first you're giving everyone too much time if&nbsp;
it were me i would skip the can and quietly follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.000
them to their hiding spots first once someone's&nbsp;
find a good hiding spot it's unlikely they would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.760
move from it and if i know where they're hiding&nbsp;
i can go retrieve the can and come back to their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.640
hiding spot to catch them i would also prioritize&nbsp;
who i should put in prison the best person to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.720
follow is shun because he's going to hide with&nbsp;
the girl and that way i'm more likely to catch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.840
two people at once sean has proven himself to&nbsp;
think quickly on his feet and be heroic while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.640
the other two are more cowardly so if shun here&nbsp;
is locked up first it's very unlikely anybody will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.200
be coming to save him and as long as i get to be&nbsp;
captured i win the game there's only two players&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.920
left the psycho kid spots them and runs up the&nbsp;
stairs shun escapes as the girl goes off to block&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.000
the entrance but he breaks through and captures&nbsp;
her shout here is stuck trying to figure out what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.760
to do as he's going to lose if he doesn't free&nbsp;
the prisoners now shun's team did not strategize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.400
as well but honestly they have the best chance of&nbsp;
surviving from the start he has to see your face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.800
and call your name to capture you by eliminating&nbsp;
either these two as a possibility you can work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.520
the game to your advantage so i would have covered&nbsp;
my face of my jacket so he can't legally capture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:28.080
me as a prisoner i would tell everyone to do&nbsp;
this no matter how much you're punched kicked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.320
or beaten if you don't treat your face it will&nbsp;
become impossible for him to win then there's no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.800
need for anyone to kick the can and sacrifice&nbsp;
themselves because no prisoners will be taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.520
this is the best possible outcome if someone does&nbsp;
get caught we can remove another win condition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.160
from him when he's out finding people to capture&nbsp;
i would steer nearby to move the can and hide it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.720
even if he sees her face and says your name you're&nbsp;
unofficially captured after these steps on the can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.160
if they had thought about this from the beginning&nbsp;
they wouldn't be in this hopeless situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.800
but then sean here sees this old [ __ ] of arbor&nbsp;
nearby and he gets a clever idea he leaves his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.520
hiding place dressed against the armor like i gave&nbsp;
you tennis just by looking at it this is clever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.520
one of the rules for being captured requires clear&nbsp;
eye contact between a player and the person who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:12.240
was it the helmet not only makes it harder but the&nbsp;
entire armor set am i protected from the explosion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.800
if he kicks the cam he's covered two weaknesses&nbsp;
that gizzly advance she needs to beat this game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.640
but it's too hard to move and there's no way he&nbsp;
can fight the student he backs away to the edge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:25.600
and gets caught but this was a part of his plan he&nbsp;
changed the psycho and throws himself off the wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.760
dragging the other boy along with them as the&nbsp;
student is busy trying to pull the armor up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.560
he's escaped and climbing back over runs for&nbsp;
the can he kicks it but it doesn't explode&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.280
his team wins and the dolls revealed that they&nbsp;
lied about the explosion now that it's all over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:44.080
all the players are given popsicles as a reward&nbsp;
but the girl finishes her ice cream and realized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:49.040
that these popsicle sticks declare who gets to die&nbsp;
and this was the secret final test they only get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.920
the pass if luck is on their side the unlucky&nbsp;
players evaporated to magic powder and the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:53.920 --> 00:19:08.400
winners are transported to the top of the white&nbsp;
cube as people below celebrate their survival
