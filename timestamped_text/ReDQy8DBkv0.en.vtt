00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.480
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today, I’m going&nbsp;
to explain a psychological thriller war&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:15.920
film called “Mine”. Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.800
The movie begins with a hardened US marine Mike&nbsp;
saying goodbye to a young woman at the airport and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.640
traveling in a helicopter to his next mission. 
In the next scene, Mike and his spotter Tommy are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.760
set up on a cliff overlooking a desert, waiting&nbsp;
for their target to arrive. Tommy is a chatter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.760
box by nature, while Mike has a more serious&nbsp;
disposition. They notice multiple people on foot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.920
on one side and multiple armed vehicles on the&nbsp;
other approaching. Mike’s target is a 65 year old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.840
terrorist Sayid Assiff. As Tommy and the voice&nbsp;
over the radio try to get Mike to make the hit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.240
he realizes that the group has gathered for a&nbsp;
wedding, and the target might be the groom's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.080
father. Matter further complicates when the groom&nbsp;
and bride block the target. Mike is ordered to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.720
take out the groom to get to the target but he&nbsp;
can’t bring himself to take an innocent life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.360
Mike lies to his command centre that he&nbsp;
lost the target. The duo are then spotted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.960
by armed men protecting the ceremony. Gun&nbsp;
fire follows. The target immediately flees,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.066
while Mike and Tommy are forced to retreat as&nbsp;
armed men start chasing them. Who would become a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.640
terrorist just to guard a wedding couple in the&nbsp;
middle of nowhere. While running, they damage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.120
their GPS and hide behind a rock formation. 
The armed men start walking towards the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.200
rock when Mike quickly creates a clever&nbsp;
distraction to send them the other direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.480
After evading the armed men, the duo request an&nbsp;
evacuation but are told they need to cross the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.520
desert in front of them to get to a village five&nbsp;
hours away, where they can be picked up. They set&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.960
out on foot, weathering sandstorms and scorching&nbsp;
heat. Tommy entertains( perhaps annoys) Mike with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.320
the stories of his son back home. Seeing Mike&nbsp;
silent and seemingly troubled by something,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.600
Tommy forces Mike to open up. Mike reveals that&nbsp;
he is having a hard time proposing marriage to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.560
his girlfriend Jenny. Tommy makes fun of him&nbsp;
for being so scared, but also gives him advice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.880
that initially marriages can be difficult&nbsp;
but over time you get the hang of it. 
&nbsp;

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.600
While passing through the desert, wind brings&nbsp;
a warning sign flying right beneath their feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.200
Mike takes the sign seriously, recalling that 33&nbsp;
million landmines have been buried in the desert&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.120
in the last 40 years. Tommy assures him it's just&nbsp;
a Berber trick to keep enemies away. Mike is still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.120
proceeding cautiously, his mind preoccupied with&nbsp;
the warning sign. Tommy walks backwards carefreely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.520
a few yards in front of Mike, taking light&nbsp;
hearted digs at Mike for being an overthinker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.480
Suddenly a click sound is heard and an explosion&nbsp;
follows. Tommy had stepped on a landmine. 
&nbsp;

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.440
As he goes temporarily deaf, Mike takes a step&nbsp;
towards Tommy, and hears another "click" where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.360
his foot just landed. He freezes in shock. The&nbsp;
sand from the blast starts to clear out. 
&nbsp;

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.320
Tommy has survived the explosion, but his&nbsp;
legs below the knees have been amputated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.720
Tommy screams and quivers in pain. Mike, unable&nbsp;
to move himself, struggles to calm Tommy down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.440
When nothing seems to work, Mike brings up&nbsp;
Tommy's son, which gives him some motivation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.640
and he's able to inject himself with the morphine&nbsp;
marines carry in their front pocket. Tommy then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.080
tries to reach his radio, but the pain again takes&nbsp;
over him. Seeing his partner in pain, Mike offers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.720
to take his foot off the landmine in order to&nbsp;
help Tommy. Mike speculates that perhaps the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.040
landmine he stepped on is old and defunct. Tommy&nbsp;
warns him not to and inorder to dissuade Mike,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.320
he pulls out his gun and aims it on his head. He&nbsp;
tells Mike that he must survive no matter what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.508
and shoots himself. 

00:03:35.508 --> 00:03:37.520
Mike helplessly screams in grief.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.200
He is stuck in the desert all by himself unable&nbsp;
to move. He soons gets tired of standing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.480
gets on his one knee. Mike realises he must&nbsp;
somehow fetch the radio lying next to Tommy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.840
several yards away. He ties his shoe lace to&nbsp;
an axe to pull the radio bag towards himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.800
However, he learns that the radio's battery&nbsp;
is dead and the spare is on Tommy's body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.080
Mike is dejected, but thinks of another plan. He&nbsp;
makes a makeshift arrangement to charge the radio&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.840
using solar power. Mike is then able to contact&nbsp;
his superiors. He requests immediate evacuation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.120
but he is told that rescue choppers can’t fly&nbsp;
to his location because of frequent sandstorms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.960
If it all goes well, a convoy&nbsp;
will rescue him in about 52 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.920
Mike gets frustrated by the response. The&nbsp;
major then suggests Mike to try digging a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.160
ditch and jumping in it, which would "only"&nbsp;
result in a non-life-threatening limb loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.440
Mike decides to tough it out and wait for&nbsp;
rescue, setting a countdown on his watch. 
&nbsp;

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.000
Then, another massive sandstorm hits full force.&nbsp;
He manages to wait it out without moving from his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.840
spot. Once it's over, the first thing he realizes&nbsp;
is that the storm has brought Tommy's body (and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.800
therefore the spare battery) right next to him,&nbsp;
yet the radio has drifted too far from his reach.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.880
Hours pass by. Mike runs out of water and gets&nbsp;
increasingly desperate and at times wonders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.480
about shooting himself dead. He then notices a&nbsp;
Berber coming towards him, walking in a zig zag.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.640
Mike tries to warn him about the landmine&nbsp;
but the Berber imitates his actions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.240
seemingly making fun of him. Mike tries to explain&nbsp;
his ordeal to the Berber man, but he insists that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.320
Mike must take the next step. He then takes Mike’s&nbsp;
water flask and disappears into the desert.
&nbsp;

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.240
Completely dehydrated and desperate, Mike proceeds&nbsp;
to drink his piss when he notices a little Berber&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.160
girl coming his way bringing back his water flask.&nbsp;
She hands it to Mike, and to his relief, it's full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.560
with water. Mike quenches his thirst. Although the&nbsp;
girl never speaks, using her toy soldiers, she too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.000
seemingly tells Mike that he has to step off the&nbsp;
mine and move on. Mike tells her that he can’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.520
move and asks the little girl to fetch him his&nbsp;
radio but the girl doesn’t understand. Desperate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.880
Mike gets too loud, scaring the girl away. 
Soon, the night falls and the temperature starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.160
to drop. Mike lights a fire to keep himself&nbsp;
warm. He starts hearing noises of wild animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.880
He takes out his phone and looks at the pictures&nbsp;
of his girlfriend to keep himself distracted. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.760
finds a video from his girlfriend. In the video,&nbsp;
Jenny tells Mike that she is waiting for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.360
Mike must win the war and come back to her as soon&nbsp;
as possible. Mike begins to get emotional. He is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.160
afraid that he might never see his girlfriend&nbsp;
again. Tired of everything happening to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.640
he starts to fall asleep, but he snaps out&nbsp;
of it to find that the fire has died out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.360
He finds himself surrounded by wild&nbsp;
animals. He tries to scare them with his gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.480
but fails. Guess he should have watched a bit of&nbsp;
‘Man vs Wild’. The animals drag Tommy’s body away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.120
One animal starts to proceed toward him but using&nbsp;
his torch light, Mike shoots the animal with his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.880
gun. The animal lands on a landmine, causing an&nbsp;
explosion and scaring the other animals away. 
&nbsp;

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.080
The morning arrives and the same berber man again&nbsp;
drops by. He tells Mike that he is very lucky that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.720
he has survived thus far even after stepping on&nbsp;
a landmine and spending a night in the desert&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.160
with wild animals. He once again suggests Mike&nbsp;
to step forward but Mike doesn't comply.
&nbsp;

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.520
Mike tells him that he probably knows the location&nbsp;
of the mines as he always walks in a pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.400
The Berber responds that he doesn’t know where&nbsp;
the landmines are and he only walks in a zig zag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.120
because it is safer than walking straight.&nbsp;
Mike again asks him to fetch his radio. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.080
Berber man finally agrees and brings the radio&nbsp;
back to Mike, and then heads on his way.
&nbsp;

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.640
Mike checks his watch, and there’s still 24&nbsp;
hours left for the help to arrive. He slowly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.320
starts hallucinating. Mike sees Tommy wake up from&nbsp;
his death. The imaginary Tommy motivates Mike, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.360
tells him that he will get out of this alive.
The sun sets again, and Mike starts to think about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.840
all the mistakes he has made in his life. He&nbsp;
starts regretting leaving his girlfriend Jenny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.104
alone and coming to the mission. He again&nbsp;
finds himself surrounded by animals. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.104 --> 00:07:40.880
time even mine explosions do not deter them. Mike&nbsp;
aimlessly starts shooting at them in the dark but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.160
the animals still attack him. He gets lost in his&nbsp;
thoughts as he fights off the wild animals. 
&nbsp;

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.280
As the sun rises, Mike again descends back to&nbsp;
reality. All the wild animals that attacked him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.560
lay dead around him. Despite being outnumbered,&nbsp;
he managed to kill all the animals. 
&nbsp;

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.080
Mike has been in that desert all alone by&nbsp;
himself, with his foot over the mine, without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:07.760
moving for the last 45 hours. He then receives&nbsp;
a communication from his senior who informs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.120
him that the rescue team is running late. The&nbsp;
senior asks him if he can hold on for 17 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.080
Already way past his breaking point, Mike&nbsp;
replies that he cannot go any further. 
&nbsp;

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.320
The major tells him that there is someone who&nbsp;
wants to talk to him. Mike then hears the voice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.520
of Jenny. Mike frantically starts apologizing to&nbsp;
her for leaving her, for messing everything up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.320
and destroying everything he touches. He then&nbsp;
starts hallucinating and sees Jenny sitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.800
on a couch in front of him in the desert. He&nbsp;
tries to reach her but starts losing strength.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.400
He begins to collapse, when Berber catches him&nbsp;
seemingly arriving out of nowhere. The man starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.360
nursing Mike’s wounds and tells him about the time&nbsp;
when he too once stepped on a mine, which took off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.040
his leg. He tells Mike that losing his leg felt&nbsp;
like he had lost everything in his life. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.080
the pain of losing his leg was all washed away&nbsp;
when he met his wife and had a daughter. He says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.440
that whatever happens in our life, we must keep&nbsp;
moving on. Mike tells the man that he indeed is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.560
lucky as his daughter who brought him water is&nbsp;
really beautiful and has her father’s smile. 
&nbsp;

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.720
The man tells Mike that he no longer has&nbsp;
a daughter; she died in a mine explosion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.200
during one of their father-daughter excursions&nbsp;
to dig out mines and replace them with tin cans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.800
Mike listens, dumbfounded. The Berber tells&nbsp;
him he's happy his daughter came to meet Mike,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:28.560
but he really needs to move on now. Then, he&nbsp;
leaves. Mike sees his daughter again. But,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.280
she quickly fades away with the wind. 
Mike starts to hallucinate again. He sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.360
his abusive father who used to beat his&nbsp;
mother while he watched helplessly. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.240
sees his terminally ill mother. He also sees the&nbsp;
lovely times he spent with his girlfriend. 
&nbsp;

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.960
At that moment, he hears on the radio that the&nbsp;
rescue team is passing and they need him to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:52.240
his exact location known. He picks up his flare&nbsp;
but before he gets to use it, the terrorists from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:57.280
before start shooting at him from over the hill.&nbsp;
The shooting triggers a mine explosion nearby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.720
which sends the flare flying out of Mike’s hand&nbsp;
and reach. He tries to fire back but he is too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:08.400
weak. But he remembers his girlfriend and uses it&nbsp;
as a motivation. Mike then uses his gun to shoot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:13.040
at ground and triggers mine explosions around&nbsp;
him which creates a sand smoke, shielding him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.080
from the enemy. He then quickly grabs his sniper&nbsp;
rifle and eliminates the terrorists. With the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:23.680
rescue team passing by, the flare is still out of&nbsp;
reach. Mike remembers the Berber man’s words that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.120
“You have to keep moving on”. He takes a leap of&nbsp;
faith and takes a step forward. Nothing happens;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.320
there's no explosion. He finds that the&nbsp;
mine he'd stepped on was in fact a tin can,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:39.360
probably placed there by the Berber's daughter&nbsp;
when she was alive. The villager’s words come to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.400
pass. This entire time, the villager told him that&nbsp;
he could move forward with his life and go back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.680
to his girlfriend. He reminded him that he CAN do&nbsp;
it and the only thing stopping him was fear . 
&nbsp;

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.680
Mike is relieved to be alive despite the&nbsp;
non-lethal gunshot wounds he sustained in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.480
the standoff. He starts bursting into tears.&nbsp;
Maybe he was relieved knowing the fact that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.560
he will be saved or maybe he was angry&nbsp;
for not realizing the correctness of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.440
situation.Whatever be the reason, one thing was&nbsp;
for sure, this incident would change his life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.960
completely and he had learnt a valuable lesson.
He then shoots the flare and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.920
collapses on the ground. 
The rescue team finds him and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:13.200
he returns home. Back home at the airport, Jenny&nbsp;
is waiting for him with happy tears in her eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.200
Even before hugging her, he drops to one&nbsp;
knee like he has done throughout different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.920
stages of his life. He then proposes to&nbsp;
her, promising to not leave her alone&nbsp;&nbsp;
