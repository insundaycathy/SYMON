as peter talks to one of their neighbors ray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.960
flashes of light appear from the night sky they&nbsp;
watch as a single drone drops from the sky as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.520
soon as it touches down an enormous shock wave&nbsp;
pushes them back into the apartment breaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.080
all the glass within miles they recover from&nbsp;
the wave and glance up in horror as they see a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.520
hundred more drones drop from above peter and ray&nbsp;
quickly search the building for their daughters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.600
amidst the commotion they find the girls&nbsp;
stuck in the elevator and swiftly rescue them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.200
meanwhile alice hugs lucy under the table as&nbsp;
they evade capture from the surveying drones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.680
the family soon reunites in their home as&nbsp;
they try to come up with an escape plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.600
someone bangs on their door they hide their&nbsp;
daughters and then barricade their door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.440
while they're forcing the intruder out lucy slips&nbsp;
away to look for her beloved stuffed toy she finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.200
it under the dinner table and hugs it paralyzed&nbsp;
with fear suddenly laser beams penetrate the walls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.720
and then comes a sword when they go back to their&nbsp;
hiding place they find out that lucy is missing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.920
by then a soldier had already made his way into&nbsp;
their home he finds lucy under the table and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.600
examines her before the soldier can strike peter&nbsp;
emerges and pins him down they struggle on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.680
floor as peter takes out his gun lucy escapes to&nbsp;
her mother while the soldier is distracted alice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.800
then intervenes helping her husband by smashing&nbsp;
debris on the soldier's helmet the soldier falls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.440
to the floor unconscious the family escapes&nbsp;
but finds the building swarming with soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.400
they carefully make their way to the rooftop&nbsp;
and find their neighbors ray and samantha with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.480
their daughter megan as the family stand on the&nbsp;
rooftop they witness the devastation before them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.400
the families crouch down and hide as another&nbsp;
drone flies over to survey their building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.800
seeing no other means of escape they hop&nbsp;
on the window cleaners platform on the side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.000
of the building they slowly descend to the&nbsp;
ground but suddenly one of the bars gives in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.400
with the other cable now threatening to break&nbsp;
they escape through a broken window in one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.160
lower floors just in time as the entire platform&nbsp;
collapses to the ground meanwhile the soldier left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.440
at peter's apartment regains consciousness and&nbsp;
starts tracking his gun as they take refuge in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.880
one of the rooms alice apologizes and asks him if&nbsp;
he saw them die in his visions he doesn't answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.440
this but instead focuses on fixing the soldier's&nbsp;
gun so that they could use it they formulate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.840
a plan to escape to peter's factory using the&nbsp;
old tunnels that alice was tasked to redesign&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.000
out of nowhere a blast hits them from outside the&nbsp;
building a drone fires at them immediately killing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.440
ray's wife and daughter peter's family makes a run&nbsp;
for it they manage to make it to the ground floor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.560
but are stopped in a narrow hallway by two other&nbsp;
soldiers with their guns peter is forced to rewire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.840
their gun on the spot risking his life he grabs&nbsp;
an electrical cord from the opposite side and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.520
then completely reboots the gun he shoots at the&nbsp;
remaining soldiers leaving them dead on the floor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.160
the family makes it out of the building and out&nbsp;
into the burning streets they hide from rubble to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.440
rubble barely escaping with their lives meanwhile&nbsp;
the revived soldier is tracking their steps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.960
and is close behind peter's family reaches the&nbsp;
tunnel's entrance and one by one they slip through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.840
when lucy's turn comes she stops mid-run and&nbsp;
stares at the incoming drone paralyzed with fear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.440
alice runs and scoops her daughter up and manages&nbsp;
to make it to the entrance peter closes the door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.000
and the drone spots them firing several missiles&nbsp;
at them and causing the entrance to cave in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.360
amidst the explosion all of them make it out&nbsp;
alive but alice is severely injured on her side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.640
they carry her by the arm limping as they&nbsp;
try to make out the tunnel's complex system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.440
peter is losing hope he knows if they don't get&nbsp;
help soon his wife isn't going to make it they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.800
take a quick break but fate won't let them this&nbsp;
time the soldier has caught up to them and attacks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.520
peter from behind they struggle for the gun but&nbsp;
peter gains the upper hand and fires several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.880
shots at him a cloud of dust impairs his vision&nbsp;
as he tries to look for his enemy firing random&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.640
shots in the dark just then the soldier emerges&nbsp;
from the dust grabbing the gun peter catches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.600
a rock and starts bashing it into his head the&nbsp;
soldier surrenders into a corner and slips down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.880
peter confronts him and surprisingly the soldier&nbsp;
takes off his helmet revealing himself to be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.640
human being peter is shocked thinking he was an&nbsp;
alien monster all alone he threatens him with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.760
gun and orders him to carry alice together they&nbsp;
make it to the factory and meet up with david&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.040
along with several more survivors the girls cry&nbsp;
as the medical team tries to revive their mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.320
peter begs them to stop as he can't handle seeing&nbsp;
his wife in any more pain the medics inform peter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.120
that it's too late to save his wife but he&nbsp;
doesn't accept it just then the soldier who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.400
is now a captive calls out telling him that he can&nbsp;
help her peter points the gun at the enemy but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.120
knows he doesn't have any choice if he wants&nbsp;
to save his wife he has to gamble on a chance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.840
he takes the chance and asks david to bring his&nbsp;
daughters to the last train evacuating the city&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.360
he gives them a teary goodbye as his colleague&nbsp;
drags the girls away he then takes alice and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.240
soldier to one of the medic's rooms he hands the&nbsp;
soldier his swiss army knife who then uses it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.760
cut open alice's wound peter begs him to go easy&nbsp;
but the man insists that there is no other way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.760
as he opens up the wound he tells peter&nbsp;
that it's just as bad as the medics say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.000
peter takes a look at his wife's wound&nbsp;
and is shocked to see not just flesh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.920
but wires cords and visible electricity pumping&nbsp;
through her body the soldier looks at him equally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.200
confused and genuinely asks him if peter doesn't&nbsp;
know what he is peter can only shake his head and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.760
answer the soldier then tells him that the only&nbsp;
way to save her life would be to get power from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.120
another energy source meaning peter but the gamble&nbsp;
is that this might not also work and the current&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.240
might split and they will both be dead but peter&nbsp;
knows that he should try as hard as he can if not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.760
for him for his daughters he takes the knife and&nbsp;
cuts a line into his chest he's surprised to feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.720
no enormous pain and is shocked to see the same&nbsp;
wires and electricity running through his body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.560
the soldier attaches a wire and connects peter's&nbsp;
body to alice's as they recharge they experience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.840
the same visions but this time it's revealed that&nbsp;
peter's visions were actual memories of the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.880
it turns out that alice and peter who have&nbsp;
fallen in love were called synthetics artificial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:42.080
intelligence who looked like humans created by&nbsp;
humans to serve all of humanity the synthetics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.760
wanting equal rights started a revolution peter&nbsp;
rescued alice from human soldiers killing one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.360
unintentionally with his bare hands together they&nbsp;
fought side by side with the synthetic rebels and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.560
successfully drove away the humans to outer space&nbsp;
as the remaining synthetics survey the cities for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.360
survivors alice and peter happen upon hannah&nbsp;
and lucy whose parents have died from the war&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.120
unable to leave the children behind the couple&nbsp;
adopts them as their own after the war most of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.720
synthetics including peter alice and their adopted&nbsp;
children voluntarily had their memories replaced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.840
so that they could stop living in fear and start&nbsp;
living like a family while others like david chose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:25.600
to keep their memories and prepare for the return&nbsp;
of the humans peter wakes up and finds alice alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.800
the gamble has paid off the soldier introduces&nbsp;
himself as miles and tells peter about the fate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:36.400
of humanity after they were driven off by the&nbsp;
synthetics they had to settle in colonies on mars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.200
it took them years to rebuild their resources and&nbsp;
to come back to take what was supposedly theirs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.840
but now miles knows that it's only half of the&nbsp;
story he helped them because he didn't know that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.760
when they came here they were going to be killing&nbsp;
children and families and that's not what he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.960
signed up for alice then wakes up telling peter&nbsp;
of her new revelations and frantically asks for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:00.400
the girls peter helps his wife up and takes one&nbsp;
last look at the human who saved his wife's life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.800
peter thanks him for his kindness by telling&nbsp;
him his name and giving him his swiss army knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.520
saying that it didn't belong to him anyway peter&nbsp;
and alice run deep into the tracks and are caught&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:15.520
in a crossfire the humans managed to take down a&nbsp;
few but the synthetics hold their fort strong with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:21.280
one last shot peter runs through the fire grabbing&nbsp;
lucy's toy and a gun as he stands cover for alice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.240
alice runs through the steel doors followed&nbsp;
closely by peter they run through the tunnels just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.880
as the humans break through the fort they reach&nbsp;
the doors and run after the leaving train carrying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.680
their daughters the girls run out of the train&nbsp;
to meet them sobbing and hugging them with david&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.160
trailing behind david holds off the attackers&nbsp;
as the family makes their way for the train&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.920
the four of them get on and david jumps&nbsp;
inside firing several last shots at the humans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.320
the train pulls away and the family hugs in&nbsp;
tears feeling relieved that they're all alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.800
and safe the train speeds out from the tunnel&nbsp;
and they look out through windows at the sunrise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.200
seeing their once beloved city in flames and&nbsp;
destruction as the tracks detonate behind them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.680
leaving no chance for their pursuers to&nbsp;
follow them perhaps if humans realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.120
that they're not so different from each&nbsp;
other they might have a future after all
