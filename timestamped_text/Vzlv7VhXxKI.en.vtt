00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.640
Hey everyone. Welcome back to Movie&nbsp;
Recap. Today I'm gonna show you 2015&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.003
erotic psychological thriller&nbsp;
film called, The Boy Next Door.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.560
Claire Peterson is on the verge of divorcing her&nbsp;
husband Garrett after he was caught cheating with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.560
his secretary. She kicks him out and it causes&nbsp;
a rift between both of them and their son Kevin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.760
Claire's best friend Vicky Lansing stands by her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.000
and urges her to sign the divorce papers&nbsp;
immediately and leave Garrett for good.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.960
For Kevin's birthday, Garrett shows up for&nbsp;
dinner. He invites Claire and Kevin to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.840
fishing trip following a business&nbsp;
trip he's taking in San Francisco,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.400
which is where his affair took&nbsp;
place. Claire declines the invitation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.040
but allows Kevin to join his father. She&nbsp;
is still very much hurt by the deception.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.920
One day, Claire is getting ready to take&nbsp;
Kevin out when their garage door gets stuck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.200
Claire goes to push it open and is helped by&nbsp;
a young man named Noah Sandborn. He is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.800
nephew of Claire's wheelchair-bound neighbor.&nbsp;
Noah offers to help fix the garage door. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.840
goes with Kevin to the hardware store. After&nbsp;
they leave, Noah's uncle tells Claire that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.760
Noah's parents died the previous year&nbsp;
and he is still coping with the loss.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.960
The boys walk to the hardware store, and Kevin&nbsp;
learns that Noah is going to attend the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.520
high school as him, where Claire happens to&nbsp;
be a teacher. After they get their stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.360
Kevin notices a girl from his school that works&nbsp;
there named Allie Callahan. He has a crush on her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.280
but is too nervous around her. Noah persuades him&nbsp;
to go up and talk to her. As Kevin goes to pay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.000
Noah introduces himself to Allie. Moments&nbsp;
later, three punks on skateboards led&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.576
by a guy named Jason Zimmer come in and&nbsp;
harass Kevin in front of Allie and Noah.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.840
Noah spends a lot of time with Kevin while his&nbsp;
uncle is in the hospital, and Claire invites him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.960
to have lunch with them and Vicky. Claire mentions&nbsp;
that she teaches classic literature at school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.600
prompting Noah to quote Homer and express&nbsp;
his love for "The Iliad". Claire is clearly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.120
impressed by this. Later, Noah notices a&nbsp;
pair of stilettos that Claire keeps in a box,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.000
which she says were a gift from Vicky. Noah&nbsp;
comments that the shoes are for women who try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.200
to be sexy, and that Claire doesn't need to&nbsp;
try. He apologizes for sounding too forward.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.600
With Kevin and Garrett away on their&nbsp;
trip, Claire is getting ready to go out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.120
She looks out the window and&nbsp;
sees Noah naked in his room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.080
He spots her watching him, but&nbsp;
she hides behind the curtains.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.960
Claire goes on a double date with Vicky and&nbsp;
her boyfriend Ethan with his buddy Couper at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.400
a restaurant. Couper is a douchebag that insults&nbsp;
Claire's fondness for classic literature and calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.000
her a firecracker when she defends her opinion.&nbsp;
She also notices him checking out a waitress.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Claire leaves the restaurant and goes home.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.880
Noah calls Claire and tells her he tried&nbsp;
defrosting a chicken in a microwave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.680
He asks her to come over and help him cook it&nbsp;
properly. She ends up going over and staying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.800
to eat the chicken with him after they cook it&nbsp;
properly. Noah continues to flirt with Claire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.400
and while she is interested, she feels it would&nbsp;
be wrong. Noah starts to kiss her and feel her up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.120
leaving her unable to resist. They end up&nbsp;
having very passionate meat injection session.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.040
The next morning, Claire starts to regret what&nbsp;
happened the previous night. She tells Noah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.320
what they did was wrong. But it makes him so angry&nbsp;
that he punches a wall and bloodies his knuckles.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.080
Kevin and Garrett return from their&nbsp;
trip. They have lunch with Claire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.080
when Noah shows up moments later.&nbsp;
Claire brings in a plate of cookies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.560
and Noah asks her if she told the guys&nbsp;
what happened while they were gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.240
She says there was a big rainstorm, to which Noah&nbsp;
smugly remarks that it got very wet over there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.240
Kevin offers him a cookie, and Noah&nbsp;
responds, "I love your mother's cookies."

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.400
The school year begins, and as&nbsp;
Claire begins her first class,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.280
the principal comes in and tells her that Noah is&nbsp;
joining their class, since he made it appear as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.160
though Claire requested him to transfer into her&nbsp;
class. She realizes that he hacked her computer.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.640
Kevin and Noah hang out, despite Claire&nbsp;
starting to feel uncomfortable with Noah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.160
Noah takes Kevin to the woods&nbsp;
with a gun belonging to his uncle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.760
He sets up a line of oranges and manipulates Kevin&nbsp;
into hating his father for cheating on Claire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.600
This is present at the dinner table when&nbsp;
Garrett comes over and Kevin yells at him.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.880
Kevin joins Noah at the school gym and he&nbsp;
takes out his frustration on a punching bag.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.240
Kevin overexerts himself&nbsp;
and starts to go into shock.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.920
Noah rushes to the locker and grabs Kevin's&nbsp;
epipen. He sticks it in Kevin's leg and saves him.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.480
Vicky brings Claire some flowers at work&nbsp;
that they both believe came from Garrett.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.120
Claire calls him and he denies sending&nbsp;
anything. She figures that Noah sent them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.840
and she confronts him in the gym. A teacher&nbsp;
notices this and sees her shove Noah.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.160
Kevin goes back to the hardware&nbsp;
store to ask Allie out to a movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.440
She says she can't, but she would&nbsp;
like to go with him to the fall fling.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.880
Claire and Garrett go out on a date,&nbsp;
and he starts to get handsy with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.880
She is still upset over the affair,&nbsp;
but Garrett truly wants to start fresh.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.960
Noah notices all this and he angrily&nbsp;
confronts Claire about it the next morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.240
Kevin catches them, and, since he's still upset&nbsp;
with his parents, he rides to school with Noah.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.400
Jason and his buddies go over to Kevin and bug&nbsp;
him. Kevin steps up to confront Jason when Noah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.440
comes in and kicks Jason into the locker before&nbsp;
repeatedly slamming his head against it. Vicky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.280
runs in to break up the fight, only to get shoved&nbsp;
by Noah. He is pulled off by a bigger teacher.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.200
Noah is sent to the principal's office&nbsp;
where Vicky, who is the vice principal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.760
says the school never got Noah's transcript from&nbsp;
his previous school because he was kicked out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.360
for disorderly conduct. In response, Noah&nbsp;
calls her a "dried-up dirty f**king cunt."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.840
Vicky raises her hand to strike him, but&nbsp;
he catches it. He leaves as she expels him.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.360
Claire chaperones the fall fling and leaves&nbsp;
Kevin with Allie. Allie tells Claire about a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.880
leak in the boy's bathroom. She goes to turn the&nbsp;
sink off and sees in big letters on the wall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.160
"I f**ked Claire Peterson". Noah emerges from the&nbsp;
darkness and tries to force himself on Claire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.160
only to get kicked in the beanbag. She&nbsp;
tells him to stay away from her and Kevin.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.080
The next day, Claire's students&nbsp;
are locked out of the class.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.600
She opens the door and looks&nbsp;
inside to see something awful.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.920
She leaves her students outside and finds&nbsp;
hundreds of pictures all over the classroom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:59.200
showing her and Noah having meat injection game,&nbsp;
with even more being printed out. Claire unplugs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.520
the printer and frantically tries to get rid&nbsp;
of the pictures as the principal shows up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.800
She opens the door for the students to come in.&nbsp;
The principal expresses his concern over Claire's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.880
recent behavior, and he tells her of what he heard&nbsp;
regarding her confrontation with Noah in the gym.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.600
Garrett picks Kevin up from school to drive&nbsp;
his car home. Kevin drives it angrily, still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.600
resentful towards his dad. He goes way too fast&nbsp;
and is unable to stop since the brakes are out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.720
Kevin nearly hits two cars until Garrett helps him&nbsp;
swerve into a row of water containers on the road.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.800
Claire returns home and sees&nbsp;
the dent in Garrett's car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.840
He and Kevin don't tell Claire what happened&nbsp;
and assure her they're both fine. She finds them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.520
watching TV with Noah. He follows her into the&nbsp;
kitchen where she tells him about the photos. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.160
tells her he took a video of their night together,&nbsp;
and if she wants it, she has to go to his house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.000
Claire does go over later that night,&nbsp;
but Noah promises to give the video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.800
only if she continues to have another meat&nbsp;
injection game with him. She refuses and leaves.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.480
Claire tells Vicky everything&nbsp;
and asks for her help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.680
She tells Claire to get into Noah's&nbsp;
house and find the tape herself.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:21.360
Noah follows what he thinks is Claire's car, only&nbsp;
to see Vicky. He turns his car around, prompting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.720
Vicky to call Claire, just as she is breaking into&nbsp;
Noah's house. She finds the camera hidden behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.840
a clock above the fireplace. She walks into the&nbsp;
basement and finds hundreds of pictures of herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:37.200
all over the walls. Claire looks into Noah's&nbsp;
laptop and finds the video and picture files.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.520
She trashes all of it, and then spots&nbsp;
two other files with pictures of brakes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.160
implying that Noah was the one that cut the&nbsp;
brakes out of Garrett's car, as well as from a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:52.788
minivan. Claire goes back upstairs and is startled&nbsp;
when Noah's uncle shows up. She runs back home.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.120
At home, Claire calls Vicky and is&nbsp;
startled when the door gets banged on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.400
She thinks it's Noah, and Vicky tells Claire to&nbsp;
go to her house with Kevin. The door opens and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.200
its just Kevin. After the ladies hang out,&nbsp;
Vicky gets knocked over the head by Noah.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.120
Later that day, Claire meets with&nbsp;
a detective and learns that Noah's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.280
parents were killed in a car accident&nbsp;
after his dad swerved into a truck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.480
She is taken to the remains of the car and figures&nbsp;
it's the same minivan listed in Noah's laptop.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:32.080
That evening, Noah calls Kevin and invites him&nbsp;
to go over to Vicky's house. He has Vicky tied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.720
up and gagged while he calls Claire and uses a&nbsp;
recording of Vicky's voice to have her come over.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.200
Claire arrives at Vicky's house. It's&nbsp;
dark and the lights have been cut.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.520
Claire gets frightened by Vicky's cat and&nbsp;
stumbles against the closet, which opens up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:53.680
and drops out Vicky's dead body. Noah slashed her&nbsp;
throat. Claire screams and runs out of the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.960
She calls the police, right as Noah finds her and&nbsp;
pulls her out of the car. She tells him she knows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.080
he killed his parents. Noah says that he loved his&nbsp;
mother, but she killed herself after his father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.320
cheated on her, and he cut the brakes of the&nbsp;
minivan to kill his father and the mistress.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:16.240
Noah takes Claire to a barn house where he has&nbsp;
both Garrett and Kevin tied up. Noah threatens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:21.680
to kill them both unless Claire agrees to stay&nbsp;
with him. She grabs a wrench and whacks him with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:27.600
it. She runs over to Kevin and tries to untie him&nbsp;
until Noah gets up and pulls Claire away. He grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.200
some kerosene and throws it all around Garrett and&nbsp;
Kevin. He takes out the lighter when Claire pushes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:39.120
him and makes him drop it, igniting the kerosene.&nbsp;
The barn house starts to go up in flames.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.640
Garrett gets himself loose and wraps the rope on&nbsp;
his wrists around Noah's throat. Noah gets his gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:50.480
and shoots Garrett once in the chest. Claire takes&nbsp;
Kevin's epipen and jabs Noah's eye. She tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.840
go back and untie Kevin, but Noah continues to&nbsp;
fight her. She sticks her finger in his eye,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.960
making it ooze pus and blood. Kevin breaks the&nbsp;
rope and whacks Noah with a block of wood, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.800
Noah pushes him off. He aims his gun at Kevin and&nbsp;
says that sometimes heroes need to make difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:12.640
choices. Claire calls Noah and says, "You're no&nbsp;
hero" before pulling a switch that drops an engine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:18.000
on Noah to finally kill him. Claire and Kevin pull&nbsp;
Garrett up and walk out of the burning barn house.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.800
On the last scene of the movie, The&nbsp;
paramedics and police arrive on the scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.040
They wheel Garrett into the ambulance&nbsp;
with Claire and Kevin riding by his side.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.750
She continues to assure Garrett everything will&nbsp;
be okay and that they're finally going home.
