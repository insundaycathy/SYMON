00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.760
Story Recapped here. Today, I’m going to explain&nbsp;
a drama and horror film called, “Interview with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.640
the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles.”&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.680
In modern-day San Francisco, a young&nbsp;
journalist named, Daniel Molloy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.760
is interviewing a man named,&nbsp;
Louis de Pointe du Lac,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.640
who claims to be a vampire. Daniel is&nbsp;
reluctant to believe him, but Louis’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.960
supernatural abilities and appearance convince&nbsp;
him to listen to the unnatural man’s story.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.920
In 1791, in New Orleans, 24-year-old Louis is a&nbsp;
wealthy plantation owner who had just lost his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.880
wife and infant in childbirth. He quickly sinks&nbsp;
into depression and spends his time and money on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.920
gambling and prostitutes. He wishes nothing&nbsp;
more than to join his family in the grave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.160
One night as he’s gambling, Louis gets into a&nbsp;
fight and the other gambler threatens to shoot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.280
him, which Louis happily accepts. The gambler puts&nbsp;
his gun away and Louis and his woman for the night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.720
exit the tavern to seek more privacy. Unbeknownst&nbsp;
to Louis, a vampire lurks in the darkness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.600
watching him. Louis and the prostitute end up at&nbsp;
the docks where a pimp threatens him with a knife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.440
All of a sudden, the pimp and the prostitute are&nbsp;
snatched away and killed. Louis, too drunk to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.200
aware, falls into a pile of sacks. The vampire&nbsp;
finally reveals himself as Lestat de Lioncourt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.880
and bites his neck. They fly off the ground as&nbsp;
he sucks Louis’s blood and asks him if he’s had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.560
enough of death. Louis wants nothing but to die so&nbsp;
the vampire drops him on the banks of Mississippi.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.760
Louis survives the waters but becomes extremely&nbsp;
sick. Lestat visits him in his mansion and offers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.040
to take all the pain and death away forever.&nbsp;
When morning comes, Louis sees his last sunrise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.080
and visits his family’s grave. There, Lestat&nbsp;
bites his neck again and makes Louis drink&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.280
from his own blood, finally turning him into&nbsp;
a newborn vampire. After his transformation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.320
he takes Louis into one of the coffins and lets&nbsp;
him sleep in the darkness. Louis wakes up the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.280
evening with a thirst for blood. He joins Lestat&nbsp;
at a tavern as he kills a prostitute for Louis’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.440
first meal. Louis joins him in drinking&nbsp;
her blood but refuses to take her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.560
Back at the mansion, Louis is still hungry and&nbsp;
senses the sweet blood of one of her servants,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.720
Yvette. He fights the temptation and Lestat&nbsp;
makes him drink rat blood instead. Drinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.040
animal blood can help a vampire survive but it&nbsp;
won’t help keep their youthful looks and powers.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.800
Lestat teaches Louis the ways of the vampire. He&nbsp;
takes him hunting with him among the aristocrats.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.080
Lestat makes two to three kills every night,&nbsp;
starting off with a young and beautiful girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.160
On one particular night, as they attend a party,&nbsp;
Lestat sets hit eyes for the widow, St. Claire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.960
and her young lover. Louis learns that Lestat can&nbsp;
read other people’s thoughts and he tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.600
St. Claire had her lover murder her husband.&nbsp;
Evildoers are easier to kill and they taste&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.480
better. Lestat takes off with her lover while&nbsp;
Louis accompanies St. Claire as she walks her dogs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.680
on the mansion grounds. Lestat kills the young man&nbsp;
easily but Louis finds himself distracted by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.840
yapping dogs. Suddenly, Lestat hears a scream and&nbsp;
finds St. Claire crying over her murdered dogs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.760
He breaks the widow’s neck and reprimands&nbsp;
Louis for almost getting them caught.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.320
Louis gets angry and pushes Lestat against&nbsp;
a tree, but he only commends his fury,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.360
stating that this is the reason why he chose Louis&nbsp;
in the first place. Lestat laughs at him and tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.760
him that he can choose to eat what he wants, but&nbsp;
he will wait until Louis finally turns around.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.200
Refusing to kill humans, Louis feeds himself on&nbsp;
any animal he can find around the plantation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.520
This causes great alarm for his servants who&nbsp;
think the land is cursed and are performing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.800
rituals to banish the evil. At the mansion, Louis&nbsp;
begs Lestat for the meaning of this wretched life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.160
but Lestat doesn’t know. Instead, he urges Louis&nbsp;
to go out and feast on the local cuisine but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.680
without success. Lestat takes off on his own to&nbsp;
quench his thirst. Meanwhile, Yvette begs her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.480
master to help the plantation and send Lestat&nbsp;
away. Louis finally gives in to his starvation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.960
and drinks Yvette’s blood. As the servants&nbsp;
storm their master’s mansion, Louis kicks the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.840
door open and hands them Yvette’s dead body. He&nbsp;
reveals himself as a vampire and sets them free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.440
He tells them to run away for the land is cursed&nbsp;
and starts burning down his home. Lestat arrives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.840
and is angry at Louis for ruining the only&nbsp;
wealth they had left. The loss of their mansion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.840
doesn’t dampen Lestat and soon enough he rents&nbsp;
rooms for them near the center of New Orleans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.760
One night, Lestat has two prostitutes over and&nbsp;
kills one of them. He kisses the second woman’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.880
chest and she gasps as she sees the pool of blood&nbsp;
staining her dress. He opens her wrist and drains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.400
her blood into a glass and hands it over to Louis.&nbsp;
He refuses to drink the blood and tosses it away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.680
angering Lestat. Lestat plays with the woman some&nbsp;
more, sticking her into a coffin and pretending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.800
that she’s dead. The woman begs Louis for her life&nbsp;
but he still refuses to take any part of the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.800
Lestat finally kills the woman,&nbsp;
angry at his companion’s cowardice.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.160
The city is now in the midst of a strong&nbsp;
plague, killing hundreds of families by the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.080
As he stumbles through the houses, Louis comes&nbsp;
across a crying child, Claudia, whose mother has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.680
just died from the plague. Claudia is all alone&nbsp;
with no family to look for her. At this point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.040
Louis is so hungry that he digs his fangs into&nbsp;
Claudia’s neck. Realizing what he has done, Louis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.480
leaves Claudia on the bed as Lestat catches up to&nbsp;
him, laughing at his hypocrisy. Louis runs away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.680
into the sewers but Lestat finds him by following&nbsp;
the corpse of rats. He convinces Louis to go back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.720
to the apartment where he has taken Claudia. Not&nbsp;
wanting the girl to die, Louis gives in and lets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.480
Lestat give the girl a new life. Claudia drinks&nbsp;
Lestat’s blood, almost draining him to death,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.760
and then begins to transform into a newborn&nbsp;
vampire. For her first meal, she finishes off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.920
one of their maids. Now a vampire, Claudia becomes&nbsp;
their adopted daughter. Louis is forced to stay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.000
wanting to protect Claudia and give her the love&nbsp;
and attention that he was never able to give to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.280
his own child. They soon move to a bigger home&nbsp;
and Lestat pours all his attention to Claudia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.240
filling the lonely void in his existence. He buys&nbsp;
her dolls and even gets a seamstress to make her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.360
new clothes. Claudia, with her undisciplined&nbsp;
thirst, kills off the seamstress and Lestat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.720
scolds her, reminding her to never kill inside&nbsp;
the house. Louis dotes on Claudia just as much,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.680
letting her sleep with him in his coffin until she&nbsp;
wants one of her own. Claudia is a true prodigy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.320
and learns fast. She lures her victims with&nbsp;
an innocent act and then kills them instantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.360
Some nights, she and Lestat would go hunting&nbsp;
and eliminate entire families at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.000
30 years passed by and even though Claudia never&nbsp;
grew older, her mind was that of a fully-grown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.640
woman. She doesn’t understand why she didn’t grow&nbsp;
up to be like the woman she saw at the docks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.000
One evening, Lestat visits her in her bedroom&nbsp;
and gives her another doll. Tired of being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.480
treated like a little girl, she lashes out&nbsp;
at Lestat and starts throwing away her dolls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.880
revealing the corpse of the woman she saw at the&nbsp;
docks, hidden away in her bed under her toys.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.360
It turns out that Claudia had killed and&nbsp;
kept her in the hopes to become like her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.720
Louis and Lestat are shocked to see the&nbsp;
corpse and run after her in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.080
Claudia cuts off her own hair to look older, but&nbsp;
to her surprise, her hair just magically grows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.800
back. She demands to know who made her the way&nbsp;
she is and cuts Lestat’s face with the scissors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.480
Lestat, angry at his adopted daughter, vows to&nbsp;
never tell her how to turn a mortal into a vampire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.200
and orders her to get rid of the corpse.&nbsp;
Claudia storms out and Louis follows her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.560
Louis finally reveals to her that she will&nbsp;
never grow old, die, or grow up. He also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.400
takes her to her original home where they had&nbsp;
found her and told her how he had fed on her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.920
and how Lestat turned her into a vampire. Claudia&nbsp;
decides that she hates them both and runs away.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.280
After a night of killings, Louis returns home&nbsp;
and finds Claudia who eventually forgives him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.320
for turning her into a vampire. She then suggests&nbsp;
that they leave Lestat and go off on their own,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.000
but he tells her that he will never&nbsp;
let them go. But Claudia has a plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.920
One night, as Lestat is playing the piano, Claudia&nbsp;
approaches him and pretends to make peace, taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:52.480
him to see her gifts. She brings him, two boys,&nbsp;
on the couch, and Lestat, having not fed enough,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.600
immediately drinks the boys’ blood. All of&nbsp;
a sudden, he tastes laudanum on his lips. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.640
turns to Claudia, realizing what she had done.&nbsp;
The laudanum had killed the boys instantly but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.440
it kept their blood warm. She reminds him of the&nbsp;
lesson he taught her, to never drink dead blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.720
Lestat struggles on the floor and calls for Louis,&nbsp;
but Claudia grabs him by the neck and slits his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.640
throat with a knife. When Louis arrives, he finds&nbsp;
Lestat choking on his own blood on the floor. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.600
watch as whatever life left in Lestat leaves his&nbsp;
body. They get rid of his body by dumping it in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.200
crocodile-infested swamp. Despite hating Lestat,&nbsp;
Louis feels terrible for ending his life the way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.800
it did. Lestat made him the way he is after all.&nbsp;
After that, they quickly booked a passage for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.600
old world, Europe. While waiting for the boat,&nbsp;
Claudia learns all that she can about their kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.400
through myths and legends. As they’re packing&nbsp;
their luggage, Claudia sets her pet birds free&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.760
while Louis answers a knock on their door. To&nbsp;
his surprise, it’s Lestat, back for revenge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.760
alive but barely surviving. He grasps Louis’s neck&nbsp;
but Louis manages to push him back out. He carries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:01.120
Claudia back to the house but finds Lestat playing&nbsp;
by the piano. He managed to survive by feeding on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:07.040
crocodiles, snakes, toads, and whatever else he&nbsp;
could find in the swamp. He lunges at them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.880
throws Louis aside. As he runs for Claudia, Louis&nbsp;
tosses a lamp at him, immediately igniting him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.920
on fire. Lestat stumbles around and sets the&nbsp;
house on fire as Louis and Claudia run away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.200
The whole building is engulfed in flames and they&nbsp;
make it to the ship just as soon as it sets sail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.240
They reach the Mediterranean and search every&nbsp;
village, ruin, and country, for anyone like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.200
their kind. At one point, they even began to&nbsp;
believe that they were the only vampires left.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.640
Louis and Claudia arrive in Paris in&nbsp;
1870 and start living aristocratic lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.400
Just as soon as they’d given up&nbsp;
their search, a vampire named Armand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.720
finds Louis. Armand invites them to his theatre&nbsp;
of vampires and reminds him to remember his name.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.280
Louis takes Claudia to the theatre and cautions&nbsp;
her for these vampires will have different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.600
powers and they might read her thoughts. The&nbsp;
show begins and it turns out that Armand’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.160
theatre is a group of vampires pretending to&nbsp;
be human actors telling stories about vampires.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.960
They watch the show as Armand appears on the stage&nbsp;
and takes the life of a beautiful young woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.080
Unbeknownst to the audience, Armand actually&nbsp;
kills the woman for real, and the rest of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:17.040
group feasts on the woman’s body as the curtains&nbsp;
close. After the show, Armand takes Louis and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.640
Claudia to the crypts and introduces them to his&nbsp;
clan. As a welcome, Armand lets Louis try the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:28.000
blood of a young boy they’re keeping. Louis asks&nbsp;
him the origins of their kind, but to his dismay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.200
even Armand, who’s known to be the longest vampire&nbsp;
who ever lived at 400 years, doesn't hold the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.800
answer. Louis’s fears are confirmed. There is&nbsp;
no meaning to this existence. As they leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.440
crypts, Armand reads Louis’s thoughts about how&nbsp;
he has wronged Lestat and asks him about this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:49.200
Louis refuses to answer but Armand threatens him&nbsp;
that there is only one crime amongst vampires.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.240
To kill another of your own kind means instant&nbsp;
death. When they get home, Claudia tells Louis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.320
that Armand wants her gone so that he could&nbsp;
make Louis his own companion, but he reassures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.840
her that it will never happen. The next evening,&nbsp;
Louis visits Armand in the crypts again. Armand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.720
tells him that Claudia is in danger because it is&nbsp;
forbidden to turn someone so young into a vampire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.040
The clan is already suspecting them of killing&nbsp;
their maker, Lestat, and is planning something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.480
sinister. Armand insists Louis send Claudia away&nbsp;
for her own safety, but he tells him that he will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.080
leave too if she does. Before Louis can leave,&nbsp;
Armand lures him back, baiting him with answers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.720
his endless questions. He tells Louis that if he&nbsp;
stays with him, he will help him know the meaning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:34.080
of being a vampire. Armand reveals that he knew&nbsp;
Lestat and suddenly, Louis feels a bit of peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.000
He knows he has found a true teacher in&nbsp;
Armand that Lestat could have never been.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.960
When Louis arrives home, he’s shocked to see&nbsp;
that Claudia has taken a woman named Madeleine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:49.280
from the streets. Madeleine is a humble shop owner&nbsp;
who voluntarily wants to become a vampire after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.480
her only daughter has passed away. In Claudia,&nbsp;
Madeliene sees a child who cannot die and someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.360
whom she can care for and love forever. Claudia&nbsp;
demands him to turn Madeliene into a vampire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.760
so that she could be her new companion since&nbsp;
Louis has already found a new one in Armand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.520
Claudia begs him to turn Madeliene into&nbsp;
a vampire and he eventually gives in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.160
He bites her and transforms her into&nbsp;
their kind. Claudia goes to the balcony&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.000
to thank Louis but they’re suddenly&nbsp;
kidnapped by members of Armand’s clan.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.880
All three are taken to the crypts. Death is&nbsp;
sentenced upon Claudia and Madeliene and Louis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.760
is subjected to eternity in a box. He screams&nbsp;
for Armand as he’s separated from the only thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.400
he’s ever known. Louis is carried deeper into&nbsp;
the crypts and is forced into a steel coffin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.360
The vampires seal him in and drag him down&nbsp;
a set of stairs, taking him deeper into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:40.160
tunnels. They hoist him up to the hole in the&nbsp;
wall and start sealing up the hole with stones.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.200
Meanwhile, Claudia and Madeleine are locked into&nbsp;
a room with a gaping hole above where they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.080
see the moon. Claudia knows that when the sun&nbsp;
rises, it would be the end for both of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.760
They huddle and embrace each other in&nbsp;
a corner as they wait for their death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.000
When morning comes, Claudia wakes Madeleine and&nbsp;
they shield each other from the glaring sun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.840
But the rays soon hit them, burning their skin as&nbsp;
they let out piercing screams. All of a sudden,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.960
Armand changes his mind and digs Louis out of the&nbsp;
wall. He opens the coffin and lets him escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.880
Louis runs around the crypt looking for Claudia&nbsp;
and finally finds them in the room. It’s too late,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.480
the sun has burned their skins to ashes, leaving&nbsp;
only a pile of bones behind. He weeps as he mourns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.560
her death, knowing that he will have to live an&nbsp;
eternity without seeing her face or hearing her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.160
voice ever again. While the vampires are sleeping,&nbsp;
Louis douses their coffins with gasoline and sets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:36.240
the whole place on fire. The fire instantly kills&nbsp;
the clan as he escapes his way out of the theatre.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.800
He faces another member of the clan and cuts&nbsp;
him in half with a scythe. He drops the weapon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.440
and walks out of the burning building. He shields&nbsp;
himself from the sun until a carriage approaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.880
He jumps into it with Armand and they escape&nbsp;
together. Armand offers him one final chance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.760
to stay with him, but Louis refuses, telling him&nbsp;
that he knew Armand let Claudia and Madeleine die.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.040
For years Louis wanders on his own visiting&nbsp;
Greece, Italy, and all the ancient lands,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:06.400
until he finally decides to go back to America.&nbsp;
Through the innovation of technology, Louis sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:12.720
his first sunrise in 200 years through films. In&nbsp;
the spring of 1988, he returned to New Orleans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.040
One night as he’s walking, he catches the&nbsp;
scent of ancient death from an old house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.280
He arrives at a room and sees corpses of rats on&nbsp;
the floor. There, weak and decrepit sits Lestat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.840
who has somehow managed to make it through the&nbsp;
decades drinking vermin blood. Lestat tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.840
how he’s been dreaming of this moment and how&nbsp;
Claudia should have never been one of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.480
As Louis walks towards him, Lestat backs away,&nbsp;
but he reassures him that he means no harm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.880
As they talk, a passing helicopter&nbsp;
and its searchlights frighten Lestat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.760
thinking that it’s the sun. Louis comforts him as&nbsp;
Lestat begs him to help him become the old Lestat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:51.200
Louis refuses his offer and leaves. Back in the&nbsp;
present time, Louis admits to the journalist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.160
that he never knew what happened to Lestat after&nbsp;
that. He feeds on anyone who crosses his path,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.520
but since Claudia’s death, he has never been&nbsp;
the same. And that’s the end of Louis’s story.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.520
Daniel is shocked to learn that it’s the&nbsp;
end of his story. He tells Louis that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.200
must have brought him there for a reason&nbsp;
and he’s willing to become his companion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.040
He declares that he won’t let the story end&nbsp;
like this but Louis holds him up in the air by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:18.240
the collar, reminding him of his mortality. When&nbsp;
he’s dropped down to the floor, Louis disappears.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:24.240
Daniel hurriedly takes his things and escapes to&nbsp;
his car. As he’s driving, he places one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.200
tapes to see if it recorded correctly. He sighs&nbsp;
with relief as he hears Louis’s voice on the tape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:35.440
All of a sudden, a hand grabs Daniel from the back&nbsp;
and pulls him to the backseat. It’s Lestat! He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:41.440
bites Daniel and tosses him aside. Lestat regains&nbsp;
his youth and takes control of the steering wheel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.160
He looks over at Daniel, his soon-to-be new&nbsp;
companion, and gives him a chance he’s never had.
