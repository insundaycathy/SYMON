00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.160
Welcome back to another movie recap.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.960
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of a 2016&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.760
American horror-thriller&nbsp;
film called Don't breathe.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.880
There will be Spoilers ahead,&nbsp;
so please proceed with caution.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.240
Okay, let's begin.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.720
Three Detroit criminals named&nbsp;Rocky, Alex and&nbsp;
Money, who survive by breaking into victims&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.080
homes and stealing possessions. Rocky wishes to&nbsp;
go to California with her younger sister, Diddy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.640
to get away from their controlling mother and&nbsp;
her alcoholic lover. To the trio's annoyance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.960
their fence continues to undervalue the&nbsp;
goods they deliver. Norman Nordstrom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.080
a Gulf War veteran, has $300,000 in cash&nbsp;
in his house in an abandoned Detroit area,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.400
according to a tip from their fence. The&nbsp;
money was said to be a compensation after his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.400
daughter was murdered in a vehicle accident&nbsp;
by a rich young woman named Cindy Roberts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.560
Nordstrom is blind, and the three of them&nbsp;
discover this while spying on the house.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.360
The group approaches the house late at night,&nbsp;
drugs Nordstrom's rottweiler dog, and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.840
breaks in. Nordstrom's bedroom is equipped&nbsp;
with a sleeping gas bottle, thanks to Money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.960
When Money sees a closed basement door, he&nbsp;
believes the loot is inside and shoots the lock.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.320
Nordstrom is awoken by the disturbance, and he&nbsp;
overpowers Money, grabs the gun, and murders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.480
him while Rocky and Alex watch calmly. Rocky sees&nbsp;
Nordstrom examine his belongings in a secret safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.600
She unlocks the safe and grabs the money after he&nbsp;
departs. Nordstrom, on the other hand, discovers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.920
Rocky and Alex's shoes and thinks there are&nbsp;
more burglars, returning to find the safe empty.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.760
Rocky and Alex sneak into the&nbsp;
basement, avoiding Nordstrom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.640
They discover a pregnant lady who exposes herself&nbsp;
to be Cindy Roberts, who is bound and gagged.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.800
Rocky and Alex manage to release her&nbsp;
and unlock the storm cellar entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.160
Nordstrom fires at them, killing Cindy in&nbsp;
the process. Nordstrom sobs and cries out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.720
in pain over her body. He then turns out the&nbsp;
lights, completely darkening the basement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.720
Alex knocks Nordstrom out after a blind&nbsp;
pursuit and fight, and they run upstairs.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.960
They confront the dog, who has awoken,&nbsp;
and run into the bedroom after sealing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.400
the cellar entrance. Rocky makes his way out&nbsp;
of the room via a ventilation duct. Alex gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.360
knocked out after falling out of a window into&nbsp;
a skylight. Nordstrom seems to kill Alex with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.440
a pair of garden shears after shooting out the&nbsp;
skylight and cornering him in the utility room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Rocky is pursued by the dog into the vents&nbsp;
before she is apprehended by Nordstrom.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.360
Rocky is confined in the basement when he wakes&nbsp;
up. Cindy was pregnant with a 'replacement' for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.080
Nordstrom's daughter, according to Nordstrom.&nbsp;
He then prepares to use a turkey baster to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.840
artificially inseminate Rocky, vowing to let her&nbsp;
free after she has given him a child. Alex saves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.320
Rocky and arrests Nordstrom after surviving by&nbsp;
duping Nordstrom into stabbing Money's body.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.640
Rocky and Alex attempt to exit via the front door.&nbsp;
Nordstrom manages to get free and kills Alex.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.880
Rocky bolts as the dog closes in on her.&nbsp;
She captures the puppy in her trunk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.360
but Nordstrom captures her again. Rocky&nbsp;
disorients him by setting off the alarm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.600
system after being pulled back into his house,&nbsp;
then strikes him repeatedly in the head with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.120
crowbar and drags him down the basement. As he&nbsp;
collapses, the pistol discharges into his side.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.400
Rocky flees before the cops&nbsp;
come, believing he is dead.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.680
Rocky and Diddy later come upon a news storey&nbsp;
about the event. In self-defense, Nordstrom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.040
who is recuperating in a hospital, is said to have&nbsp;
murdered two invaders (Alex and Money). He makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.720
no mention of Rocky or the money that was taken.&nbsp;
Rocky and Diddy travel to Los Angeles by train.
