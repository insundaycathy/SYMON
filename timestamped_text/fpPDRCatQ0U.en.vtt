00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.520
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and
gentlemen and there are three rules in

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.600
this house and if you were to disobey any one of them

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.860
the punishment would be most severe

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.880
now let me be transparent with you

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.119
I'm gonna go over the movies story very
quickly and very briefly following up

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.040
with a section dedicated to explaining
the ending.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.960
Explaining things like

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.250
the bird, the bodies, the twins and the curse
as well as why Rachel wasn't taken at

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.460
the end of the film and if you're just
here for the ending explanation you can go

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.300
to this time stamp on screen now or down
below and with that out of the way

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.960
This is The Lodgers

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.260
So the Lodgers is about the orphaned twin siblings Rachel and Edward

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.610
living their spooky dilapidated mansion; living in Ireland after the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.720
Irish War of Independence nearby a quiet
little village

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.140
in their own little world away from the world

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.500
you see there's something sinister afoot in this mansion

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.160
because there are three simple rules to
living here

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.380
First! They must be in bed by midnight

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.440
Secondly! Don't ever let a stranger inside

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.220
And thirdly! Never leave each other alone

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.300
and if the twins were to ever break these three rules they

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.300
would be promptly punished by them:

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.530
A mysterious group of individuals that can

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.320
only sometimes be seen or heard that
linger in the mansion punishing the twins

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.840
who live beneath the floors. Beneath the wooden trapdoor that rests at the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.366
foot of the staircase waiting to leak
out and punish them.

00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:22.280
Rachel &amp; Edward have led a very isolated existence

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.880
with Edward being an introverted shut-tin

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.570
leaving Rachel to do the shopping for
the both of them but everything changes

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.750
for them on the day of their 18th
birthday when after she goes shopping

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.500
Rachel receives a letter and sees a
handsome war veteran named Sean

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.280
she reads the letter at the lakeside where she
hallucinates two bodies hovering over

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.090
the water when she gets home she sees
Edward hiding behind a pillar except

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.340
Edward's on the staircase. Huh.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.670
Anyways, she tells Edward that they've run out of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.549
inheritance money and the family
solicitor will be visiting soon

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.270
something neither of them are looking
forward to later she goes back to her

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.829
room, fantasizing about Sean when
Edward comes in with a birdcage and the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.979
twins have a chat where we learn that
their parents passed away years ago and

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.560
they were also the ones that taught them
the three rules

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.580
That night Rachel goes to take a bath

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.040
and as she lays in the bathtub something happens

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.250
the trapdoor starts flooding, the bathroom
door locks itself

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.720
a ghostly voice whispers

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.540
and an eel appears in the bathtub

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.290
The next day, Sean prepares herself to
leave his house as an old man comes and

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.410
enters the mansion's premises.
This is Mr. Birmingham, the solicitor

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.070
of their family's estate who demands to
come inside and speak with Edward which

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.040
is against the rules so Rachel tries to keep him out long

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.640
enough to retrieve and give a pearl
necklace so that he can sell it off,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.120
giving the twins a little money; as Sean
watches from afar

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.120
Rachel manages to get Mr. Birmingham away
from the house

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.160
leaving Edward alone stuck listening to
the trapdoor as it whispers to him.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.560
As for Rachel, she deals with Mr. Birmingham who

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.340
suggests that she either sell the house,
sell Rachel's silver necklace or even

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.860
marry someone to stay financially secure

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.510
And she's not having it

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.540
Sean tries to follow Rachel who catches
him in the act and tells him to come back

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.120
tomorrow and returns home where strange
things are afoot

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.720
and that night Edward reveals to Rachel

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.780
that the twins are becoming more sensitive to the presence

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.860
of Them! Who are demanding that the twins
fulfill their destiny.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.840
The next day, Sean and Rachel go to
the place where her parents died.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.080
Taking him to the lake where they chat

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.640
and we learn that on the day
her parents drowned themselves

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.500
Rachel had woken up with the necklace
around her neck. It's the event that

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.130
traumatised Edward forever but what's
weirder is that all their ancestors died

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.860
the same way by drowning themselves

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.959
as he listens, Sean makes a move on her

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.170
only to be stopped by Rachel who asks
him to help her escape from her home but

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.280
he refuses but as that's happening,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.660
Mr. Birmingham comes marching back to the estate

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.160
he's come back to return the pearl
 necklace which has turned into a

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.450
necklace made of bones and as Edward
invites Mr. Birmingham inside with a knife

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.600
hidden in one hand

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.500
Sean and Rachel get intimate only to stop as Rachel

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.769
confesses to Sean about the truth of the
mansion which was built hundreds of

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.730
years ago to hide the shame of Rachel's
family. A curse, a stain that would follow

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.840
their family for generations haunted by
Them!

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.360
Them being the creatures who live below the house
and who made the rules

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.880
and that's when Mr. Birmingham gets shanked by Edward–now deathly pale

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.040
as a Rachel, hysterically breaks down and tells Sean to leave her alone!

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.540
"If you won't help her escape!"

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.060
When Edward tries pushing Mr. Birmingham into the trapdoor

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.000
Birmingham's body is suddenly yanked into the hole

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.700
as the Rachel comes back
late at night. She's briefly stopped by

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.790
Edward and reveals to him that
she intends to leave tomorrow with or

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.480
without him. She goes to her room to pack
where she's haunted by Them who show

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.920
Rachel terrifying visions and she wakes
up the next day to find water dripping

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.190
from the ceiling. Later Rachel runs into
Sean's sister who gives back Rachel's

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.000
necklace to which Rachel asks her if her
mother told her about Rachel's secret

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.050
you see the locket has a picture of
Rachel's parents who are not only twins

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.190
but are identical to Rachel and Edward–a
part of the stain upon their family

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.850
after that Rachel finds herself going to
the lake where a vision plays before

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.960
her eyes of Edward watching their
parents drown themselves

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.240
Rachel comes back to find Edward changed by them

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.860
and she tells him that their mother wanted

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.940
them to escape from the curse but Edward
reveals that the house is speaking to them

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.080
even through the bird in the cage.
A bird, Rachel can't see but she will see

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.880
soon enough their curse will make her
see things from his perspective but what

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.570
more he reveals that their cursed blood
draws them to each other

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.520
flaming a desire to have children with
each other.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.960
To breed their immortality in the pit of her body

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.550
Edward tries to kiss her but Rachel

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.680
pushes him away but Edward's adamant, They
are telling him to claim her

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.100
But she lies! Lying to him that Sean has already claimed her, so Edward knocks her out

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.100
bringing her upstairs to their parents bed where
Edward begins to prepare himself only to

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.860
be interrupted by Sean knocking on the
door. He's come for Rachel and Sean is

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.550
brought inside as he and Edward have a
little chat with Rachel waking up

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.020
finding the door locked by Them.
It's then as Sean sees a painting on the

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.130
wall depicting a familiar looking couple
that he's attacked by Edward and the two

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.340
get into a scuffle with Edward
accidentally stabbing himself and

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.850
impaling Sean through the hand
Rachel waits with bated breath as the

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.600
door unlocks and Edward staggers into
the room, collapsing to the floor, locket in hand

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.040
as she listens to Sean's agonized screams of pain

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.160
as he tries to remove the knife from his hand

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.420
and that's when the clock rings, heralding the arrival of Them!

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.640
P,ale, nude and muck-stained
bodies. Who crawl up the stairs as

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.780
Rachel desperately tries to remove the
knife and when she does they disappear

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.620
So, Sean and Rachel tried to leave but
the doors are locked and Rachel backs

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.200
away and falls into the hole which Sean
dives into

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.460
where he finds himself in an upside down version of the mansion

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.050
and here Sean finds Rachel floating there

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.000
and just as they reunite Sean is dragged back by Them

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.080
and she's left to be surrounded by the wailing
ghoulish bodies of Them

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.080
Who stare at Rachel who manages to surface, in the lake!

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.840
She's alive but Sean's dead and when she goes inside

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.180
all that remains of him is his
fake leg and Rachel goes upstairs to

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.610
her parents room to find Edward lain in
bed

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.520
who's realized what happened:
Sean was taken instead of her

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.340
and although he's sorry for her loss

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.180
he hopes that maybe they
can be together but it's too late for that

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.360
Edward is dying and soon he'll be free from their curse, from life.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.100
From all that, and they say their goodbyes with Rachel

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.340
taking her locket and leaving the house
although not before laying the locket

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.030
upon a gravestone and when she finally
makes it to the gate she sees Edward's

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.660
blackbird and takes one look at it
before leaving with the blackbird

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.560
following closely behind

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.340
So what was with that ending? Let's start with that bird

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.080
That bird is a representation and a symbol of the family curse and of Rachel herself

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.800
because Rachel is as free as a bird,
she's now no longer bound by her

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.730
cursed fate and is now free to go over-
wherever she wants to but that's not

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:46.510
entirely true because that bird was the
same bird that Edward has been

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:51.130
hallucinating seeing throughout the entirety
of the film implying that Rachel is now

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.830
Well, there's no (nice) way to say it, but she's crazy

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:59.470
driven a 'little' insane by her cursed blood because wherever she goes,

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.910
she might be free of her cursed fate, that
cursed blood still lives within her

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.480
and after all Edward did tell her that soon
she'll see things from his point of view

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.880
which brings me to the pale bodies
those are heavily implied to either be the

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:16.810
spirits or the reanimated corpses of
Edward and Rachel ancestors who have

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.980
been cursed to forever haunt the mansion
and its descendants

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.520
the descendants of Rachel &amp; Edwards

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.860
Into fulfilling their destiny as prescribed by the curse

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.120
and the curse itself is much more complex than
just being haunted by ghosts and giving

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.960
birth to children who look exactly like
you.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.760
No. Edwards lines about immortality adds a lot more context

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.660
you see the curse isn't just to die it's actually to be

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.530
reborn into the world, in the bodies of
your children who have this natural

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:49.510
desire to breed with each other and once
they're of age, once they commit the

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:53.470
cardinal sin of incest, they then kill 
themselves out of shame and

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:57.380
the process repeats again and again and
there's a lot of hints of this throughout the

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.740
film with the locket, with the painting, and
the fact that the bodies–The "Them"

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.400
actually look exactly like Rachel and
Edward and the cherry on top of this theory

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:10.180
that confirms this–is that Brian
O'Malley, the director of the film posted

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.950
this on Twitter he's confirmed that the
curse itself is to be reborn into the

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:19.900
world again and again. Due to committing incest
eons ago which finally brings me

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.740
to Rachel why wasn't she taken at the end of the film?
Well, I believe it's due to the timing.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:30.000
It wasn't the right time because Rachel wasn't a "de-virgin", she was still a virgin

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.560
and she hadn't given birth at the time that she was under water,

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.600
and I believe that this is a limitation 
of the cursed ones ("Them")

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.580
They cannot claim someone who was not 'ripe' yet and
so they have no choice but to let her go

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.350
allowing her to escape from her family's
fate at least to some extent as we find

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.840
out at the end of the film and with that
being said thank you so much for

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.360
