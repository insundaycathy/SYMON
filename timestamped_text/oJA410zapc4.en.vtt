00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.200
Hi, Movie Recaps here. Today I will show you&nbsp;
an action, sci-fi, thriller film from 2016,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.200
titled ARQ. Spoilers ahead!&nbsp;
Watch out and take care.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.640
The movie begins by throwing us right in the&nbsp;
middle of things in a post-apocalyptic world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.560
Renton wakes up beside his ex Hannah right&nbsp;
before three masked men burst into the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.720
and take him away. Renton tries to escape&nbsp;
and when one of the men tries to grab him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.840
he is pushed down the stairs and&nbsp;
killed. But he wakes up in bed again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.160
where the clock is showing the same time. In&nbsp;
the same way as before, the men burst into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.880
bedroom and take him to the research room, where&nbsp;
a fourth masked man is lying on the floor dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.800
Renton and Hannah are tied to chairs before the&nbsp;
men start talking to them while taking their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.000
guns out as a threat. The leader explains that the&nbsp;
dead man on the floor, their cousin nicknamed Cuz,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.720
was electrocuted by Renton's weird machine before&nbsp;
introducing the group - his partners are Brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.200
and Sonny while he can be called Father. The&nbsp;
men are here for Renton's scrips, so Father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.720
gives them five minutes to think about it while&nbsp;
the trio leaves to have a snack in the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.160
Renton has apples, which are almost gone from the&nbsp;
world. While dragging his chair to a nearby desk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.240
Renton tells Hannah that the men must've followed&nbsp;
her when she came to visit the day before and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.480
should've known she's under surveillance. He grabs&nbsp;
a pair of scissors with his teeth and drops them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.400
on the floor so he can fall and retrieve them&nbsp;
with his hand, then uses them to free himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.800
and Hannah. After closing the door, he checks&nbsp;
the identity of the dead man and thinks it's one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.360
of the guys that arrested him years ago. Hannah&nbsp;
tries to touch Renton's machine but he stops her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.680
just in time, explaining it's rigged with 20000&nbsp;
volts. He calls it ARQ, arcing recursive quine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.680
and thinks the men are here for it. Hannah&nbsp;
disagrees, she thinks they're just hungry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.000
like everybody else, but Renton insists&nbsp;
his former employer, the Torus corporation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.240
has sent someone to take it back after he stole&nbsp;
it. Except he doesn't want to call it stealing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.160
because he's the one that built it in the first&nbsp;
place as an engineer for the company. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.720
putting on a taser-glove, he tells Hannah to stay&nbsp;
in the room while he sneaks out to find the men.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.280
The trio is eating in the kitchen and watching tv,&nbsp;
the news talks about the Energy Wars and how the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.240
Torus corporation is taking over everything while&nbsp;
a rebel group called Bloc tries to stop them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.760
Hannah joins Renton while he's spying on them,&nbsp;
and he throws something on the floor to make the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.680
men come out of the kitchen. When they do,&nbsp;
he effectively manages to knock Sonny out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.160
with a punch, but when he does the same to&nbsp;
Father, he gets stabbed in return and dies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.200
The same scenario repeats: Renton wakes up in bed&nbsp;
next to Hannah at the exact same time. He tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.200
to warn her of the incoming men, but they're&nbsp;
captured and taken to the research room again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.360
As he repeats the lines Father's told him,&nbsp;
Renton realizes they're stuck in a time loop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.360
but he's the only one that can tell. He tries&nbsp;
to explain this to Hannah as he goes through his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.920
stunt with the scissors again to free them, but&nbsp;
she thinks he's crazy. Renton checks his computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.800
and realizes the ARQ is the one causing the loop,&nbsp;
he proves his theory to Hannah by guessing Cuz has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.600
a scar before taking off his mask. They sneak out&nbsp;
again but this time they go to the basement, where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.680
Renton makes a plan to kill the men, something&nbsp;
Hannah isn't very happy with. He takes out some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.000
gas masks so they can be protected while releasing&nbsp;
cyanide gas into the house through the furnace,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.480
which surprises Hannah because it means Renton&nbsp;
has a lot of electricity, which is rare. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.640
plan is for Renton to crank up the thermostat and&nbsp;
when the furnace is on, Hannah should throw the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.120
gas canister in its chute. Renton returns to the&nbsp;
hallway outside the kitchen and rushes to connect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.680
the thermostat as the men come out to chase him,&nbsp;
he avoids them by hiding in his bedroom. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.440
he notices the furnace has been turned on,&nbsp;
he comes out and goes to the research room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.160
where the men have Hannah, who says she wasn't&nbsp;
capable of killing. After being tied up again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.560
Renton accepts to cooperate and opens the safe&nbsp;
where he keeps his money and scrips. Now that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.720
have what they want, Father decides he should&nbsp;
shoot Renton because he saw their faces, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.280
Hannah stops them because she doesn't want anyone&nbsp;
to get hurt. It turns out Hannah is working with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.720
them, they even call her Mother. She reminds them&nbsp;
they're the Bloc and they don't kill civilians.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.120
Renton tells Hannah that he would've given her the&nbsp;
scrips if she had asked before Sonny shoots him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.440
He wakes up in bed again and rushes to block&nbsp;
the door, but the rebels burst in anyway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.320
and they end up tied up in the research room once&nbsp;
more. Renton frees himself but not Hannah, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.960
he asks her to retell him the story of her past&nbsp;
while he checks the computer. When Torus arrested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.920
Renton years ago he got to escape, but Hannah&nbsp;
was captured and interrogated for three days.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.240
They let her go after she swore she had nothing&nbsp;
to do with his stealing their scrips. While Renton&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.720
watches a video of the two of them that he doesn't&nbsp;
remember recording, Hannah tells him Torus took&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.000
her citizenship and their home, she was also sent&nbsp;
to a refugee camp. She asks Renton to cooperate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.720
with the men, he replies he's already tried that&nbsp;
before taking her to the basement. He pretends his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.840
back is hurt to distract her and electrocute her&nbsp;
before telling her his own story. His supervisors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.320
had called him a fraud when he said the ARQ&nbsp;
could generate limitless energy, but then they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.080
tried to take it from him because they did know&nbsp;
it worked and wanted it for their war machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.680
Renton confesses he knows Hannah is Mother and&nbsp;
wonders if she truly is Bloc or Torus turned her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.680
Hannah shows him the torture scars Torus left&nbsp;
on her as she admits being a freedom fighter for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.480
Bloc. Renton tells her he never stopped looking&nbsp;
for her, but Hannah says she still hates him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.480
They put on the masks and go to the kitchen,&nbsp;
where Hannah electrocutes Sonny with the glove&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.560
and Renton threatens them with the gas canister.&nbsp;
They take the men to the research room and tie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.680
them to chairs, here we learn that Father -whose&nbsp;
real name is Grimm- is Hannah's boyfriend. Renton&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.440
asks Hannah to get away with him before sending&nbsp;
her to the kitchen to grab something to eat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.920
then he kicks Sonny and punches Brother for what&nbsp;
they did to him. When he tells Grimm Hannah will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.160
leave with him, Grimm jumps on him and Renton&nbsp;
responds by powering his glove to punch him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.880
but Hannah shows up to stop him. Renton tells her&nbsp;
he'll give Bloc the scrips if she accepts to come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.760
with him, Hannah refuses and threatens him with a&nbsp;
gun. Since Renton doesn't believe she'd shoot him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.800
she shoots the ARQ instead, making Renton accept&nbsp;
to cooperate. He's bluffing, though, and when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.120
tries to take the gun from her hands, he's&nbsp;
accidentally shot and killed. When he wakes up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.160
again, he discovers Hannah also remembers the loop&nbsp;
now. The events happen as usual and once they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.720
alone in the research room, Renton frees them with&nbsp;
the scissors before checking the computer. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.440
the loops have been logged, there are five of them&nbsp;
and they always start and finish at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.080
The ARQ is causing all this, and when Hannah&nbsp;
asks him how it works, he explains that it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.280
got fuel cells that power the ARQ, and the ARQ&nbsp;
charges them in turn, but he doesn't know how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.400
this affects time. Hannah wants to use the ARQ to&nbsp;
help the cause and asks Renton to shut it down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.520
but he refuses to do so until they make sure they&nbsp;
won't die first. He wants to kill them, but Hannah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.840
says they're her subordinates and they wouldn't&nbsp;
hurt anyone, which Renton doesn't believe. So they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.040
ideate a plan instead. After loosely tying Renton&nbsp;
up on the chair again, Hannah also ties herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.600
up and calls the guys over. She tells them she&nbsp;
knows where the scrips are so after they free her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.520
she grabs half of them from the safe. Sonny&nbsp;
wants to do something about Renton because he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.320
saw their faces, but Hannah promises he won't say&nbsp;
anything. When she decides they'll be taking the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.840
ARQ with them, Sonny takes out his gun and kills&nbsp;
everyone, revealing himself as a Torus mercenary.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.840
He takes a walkie-talkie from Cuz's pocket and&nbsp;
calls Torus to tell them to come to pick up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.360
the ARQ while Renton frees himself and tries to&nbsp;
reach a gun, but Sonny stops him and shoots him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.760
As soon as they wake up in bed, Renton tells&nbsp;
Hannah that Sonny is a Torus merc and asks her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.080
to play along. The men burst in and take&nbsp;
him away while Grimm approaches Hannah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.480
who promises him she didn't sleep with Renton and&nbsp;
asks him to give her five minutes alone with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.560
After the scene in the research room happens as&nbsp;
usual, Hannah says they should tell Grimm about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.480
Sonny, even if Renton doesn't trust him or Hannah&nbsp;
right now, because they're going to need all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.800
help they can get. The men hear some noises and&nbsp;
go to check on the prisoners, they find Renton&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.040
gone and Hannah with tape over her mouth. After&nbsp;
they free her, she orders Sonny and Brother to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.480
check the main floor while she stays with Grimm&nbsp;
to tell him about Sonny and the ARQ. Upstairs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.040
Renton is sneaking around and finds Brother's body&nbsp;
on the floor, who was hit by Sonny just a moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.760
earlier. Sonny goes back to the research room and&nbsp;
tells Hannah and Grimm that Renton killed Brother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.480
Hannah doesn't believe him so Sonny shoots Grimm&nbsp;
before demanding answers from her. Renton arrives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.920
then and knocks him out by electrocuting his face.&nbsp;
After noticing the ARQ is spinning faster, he logs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.800
in to the computer, revealing his password is&nbsp;
September 19, the last day he and Hannah saw each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.000
other. Suddenly, Grimms wakes up, and while Renton&nbsp;
searches for a first-aid kit to help him, Brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.480
shows up and shoots him. When they wake up this&nbsp;
time, Renton is ready to break a window and leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.600
a house, which Hannah is hesitant to do because&nbsp;
they don't have air masks. A noise distracts them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.080
though, and they go investigate. They find Grimm&nbsp;
and Brother dead in the research room, which means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.200
Sonny is now aware of the time loops too. The&nbsp;
ARQ emits electromagnetic frequencies that can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.040
affect memory; the effect just wore off Renton and&nbsp;
Hannah first. Renton realizes that the ARQ isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.320
producing unlimited energy, it's just reusing the&nbsp;
same energy over and over. After retrieving the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.400
masks and gas from the basement, Renton comes&nbsp;
back to Hannah telling him he should give the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:30.160
ARQ to the Bloc to win the war. Renton doesn't&nbsp;
trust the Bloc, so Hannah asks him to trust her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.960
He makes her swear that she'll destroy the ARQ if&nbsp;
Sonny gets to it first and gives him the password&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:40.080
to activate the process, which is "sky", the&nbsp;
codeword he gave her before they were separated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.640
Wearing a mask and his taser glove, Renton goes in&nbsp;
search of Sonny with the gas canister ready in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:50.720
hands. In the bedroom, he discovers his clock is&nbsp;
going faster and in a closet, he finds Cuz's body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.440
which means Sonny is pretending to be dead in the&nbsp;
research room. By the time he goes back, it's too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.880
late, Sonny is already holding Hannah at gunpoint.&nbsp;
After calling Torus to tell them he has the ARQ,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:06.000
he orders Renton to shut it down. Renton pretends&nbsp;
to cooperate but when he comes closer, he touches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.080
the ARQ and Sonny's gun, electrocuting them both.&nbsp;
Hannah and Renton wake up, but the men don't come.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.040
They go out to investigate and find out Sonny&nbsp;
saved Cuz, who is working with him for Torus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.240
Sonny kills Grimm and Brother before&nbsp;
closing the door of the research lab,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.280
so Renton uses the chance to put a padlock on it&nbsp;
before they leave to execute their original plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.680
They crank up the thermostat, put on the masks,&nbsp;
and throw the gas canister into the furnace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.320
When they hear a noise coming from the research&nbsp;
room, they go in and find out Sonny has killed Cuz&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.200
and himself to slow them down because Torus is&nbsp;
coming. They argue again over the possibility of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.720
giving the ARQ to the Bloc and Hannah, furious,&nbsp;
throws an object at the board, cracking it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.200
This makes Renton have a realization and goes to&nbsp;
the computer to play that strange video again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.840
the board is cracked there too. Neither of them&nbsp;
remembers making that video, which was recorded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.880
right before a reset. The video also shows the&nbsp;
robots sent by Torus, so Renton hurries to try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.160
shut the ARQ down. Hannah moves to grab the scrips&nbsp;
from the safe but on the way, she realizes Grimm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.640
has something in his mouth. She puts a plastic&nbsp;
sheet on top of the blood to walk on it and come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.600
closer to check, what she finds in Grimm's mouth&nbsp;
is a little piece of paper that says "sky". As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.320
she steps out of the plastic, her feet touch the&nbsp;
blood, which acts as a conductor for the ARQ and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:24.000
electrocutes her. Devastated by her death, Renton&nbsp;
decides not to shut off the ARQ and wait for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.960
next loop reset. As soon as they wake up, Grimm&nbsp;
and Brother enter the room and Hannah stops them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.000
to tell them everything. It turns out they now&nbsp;
remember the loops too, so they accept to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.240
The four of them leave the room and sneak around&nbsp;
the house, but Sonny had planned for this, so he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:43.040
and Cuz capture them and take them to the research&nbsp;
room. Since Renton won't tell him the password,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.000
Cuz starts suffocating Hannah, forcing Renton to&nbsp;
talk. Sonny disables the electrical rigging and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.200
pushes Hannah against the ARQ to check it's safe&nbsp;
now. After Cuz shoots Brother for trying to leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.480
Sonny points out the ARQ is still spinning and&nbsp;
asks Renton to disable it. Renton goes to a switch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.520
on the wall and cuts the power in the whole house&nbsp;
as he tells Hannah to run. In the now dark room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.240
a couple of bullets are shot, apparently killing&nbsp;
Grimm, but Renton and Hannah manage to escape in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.640
the confusion. They make it outside the house,&nbsp;
wearing blankets around their heads and taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.280
turns with a small air mask to protect themselves&nbsp;
from the polluted air. There's a black, petrified&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.920
line on the ground that makes them realize the&nbsp;
time loop ends there. Renton tells Hannah to go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.040
a safehouse nearby while he destroys the ARQ, but&nbsp;
Hannah refuses and is determined to go back with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.520
him. Both of them return to the house and hide in&nbsp;
a closet when they hear Cuz approaching them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.480
calling out Hanna's name. She realizes he's one&nbsp;
of the men that tortured her, so she comes out and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.760
jumps on him. Cuz pushes her off but Renton is on&nbsp;
him next, punching him. Hannah retrieves a jar of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.480
kerosene from the kitchen and empties it on Cuz&nbsp;
before setting him on fire. The lights suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.360
come back, which means Sonny has turned the ARQ&nbsp;
back on. They hurry back to the research room and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.320
Renton fights Sonny until he overpowers him and&nbsp;
kills him by smashing his face against the ARQ.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.640
A message comes through Sonny's talkie saying&nbsp;
Torus is about to arrive. Renton goes to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.360
computer to shut the ARQ down, telling Hannah she&nbsp;
can take it to the Bloc. But then he discovers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:10.080
something: there's an interruption every nine&nbsp;
loops, which creates a sequence. They've already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.800
gone through thousands of sequences, and after&nbsp;
every sequence, their memories get reset as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.040
which is why they don't remember recording&nbsp;
that video. Torus is arriving now the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.280
way they arrived to interrupt the video,&nbsp;
so they decide they must destroy the ARQ,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.920
but Renton changes his mind and stops the process&nbsp;
midway because he wants the loop to reset so they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.800
can try again. Hannah points out they've already&nbsp;
tried thousands of times, Renton says this time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.120
they can leave a proper message. He records a&nbsp;
warning for their future selves as the Torus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.840
robots break in and kill them both. The movie ends&nbsp;
with Hannah waking up before Renton this time.
