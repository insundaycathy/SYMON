00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.240
Detective Recapped here. Today, I’m going&nbsp;
to explain a thriller film called, “Elle”,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.080
which follows the sordid story of a woman&nbsp;
who ordered takeout after getting violated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.720
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.
The indifference and ignorance of animals are,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.000
for the most part, completely forgivable.&nbsp;
The fact that they do not know any better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.920
relieves them from any true accountability, at&nbsp;
least by human standards. That same apathy is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.840
displayed one tragic afternoon by a cat owned&nbsp;
by a red-haired woman named Michele Leblanc.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.360
Her cat sits motionless as a masked assailant&nbsp;
comes into her home and breaks her things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.400
Then, he forces himself onto Michele. Strangely&nbsp;
enough, that same outward nonchalance is displayed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.720
by Michele. After the ordeal, she simply picks&nbsp;
herself up from her living room floor to resume&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.800
her life. As if on autopilot, Michele sweeps&nbsp;
the broken glass immediately after getting up.&nbsp;

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.880
After Michele takes a bath and orders&nbsp;
takeout, her son, Vincent, visits her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.160
When he notices her forming black eye,&nbsp;
Michele lies about falling on her bike.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.760
They proceed to dinner, and Michele&nbsp;
pre-emptively anticipates Vincent’s request.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.800
She tells him she’ll give him money for his new&nbsp;
apartment on the condition that she’ll look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.720
it first. Vincent tries to be coy about it, saying&nbsp;
he was planning to have her pay collateral and not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.680
money. As their conversation goes on, she openly&nbsp;
disapproves of his pregnant girlfriend, Josie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.200
After the dinner had concluded, Michele&nbsp;
retrieves a mallet. She looks slightly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.280
unsettled as she looks out the night streets&nbsp;
through her window. Later, Michele falls asleep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.280
with her the mallet in her hand. Despite the&nbsp;
initial apathy Michele displayed, she’s shaken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.680
by the experience in her own way. After all, not&nbsp;
everyone will have the same response to trauma.&nbsp;

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.480
The next morning, Michele goes to her job, where&nbsp;
she’s the head of a successful video game company.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.080
A meeting is held to discuss the current status&nbsp;
of their latest game. Michele is a particular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.000
kind of woman who attracts a particular kind of&nbsp;
attention. Being the head of her company, she has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.360
the right to be assertive and adamant about her&nbsp;
visions, especially when they’re within reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.120
But the male employees on board clearly hate her&nbsp;
and don’t value her opinion and instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.000
Kurt, for instance, abhors her, and it shows as he&nbsp;
challenges her during their meeting. But the man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.160
is left quietly seething when Michele flippantly&nbsp;
shoots him down. The only one who adores her there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.040
is Kevin, who’s open about how much he loves her,&nbsp;
even if jokingly. After that meeting, she goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.360
the hospital to have herself tested for a possible&nbsp;
S.T.D. because of what happened the day before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.760
Afterwards, she goes to visit her aging mother,&nbsp;
Irene, who has a penchant for Botox and hiring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.160
male escorts to sleep with. The behavior upsets&nbsp;
Michele, as she finds it especially inappropriate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.880
considering her mother’s financial situation. When&nbsp;
Irene asks what Michele will do if she remarries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.040
Michele bluntly tells her that she’ll kill her.
By the end of the day, Michele encounters her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.520
next-door neighbours, the married couple Rebecca&nbsp;
and Patrick. As Rebecca and Patrick walk into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.520
their house, Patrick looks over his shoulder at&nbsp;
Michele, and Michele seems to look back at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.040
Michele’s cat approaches her when she walks&nbsp;
into the house. Suddenly, she is reminded of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.880
the traumatic incident. She picks up the cat and&nbsp;
half-jokingly asks why it didn’t at least scratch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.960
the man. Things aren’t finished yet, however, and&nbsp;
Michele receives a message from her assailant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.080
saying that she’s tight for a woman her&nbsp;
age. This text prompts her to shop for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.160
self-defense weapon. She buys the most powerful&nbsp;
can of mace there was and decides, on a whim,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.160
to also buy a hand-ax. Calling the police should&nbsp;
have been the first thing that Michele’s done when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.560
she was violated but instead, she slept with a&nbsp;
mallet. And now, with her assailant texting her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.520
she has all the reasons to believe that&nbsp;
the man personally knows her. Still,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.040
Michele continues to take matters into her own&nbsp;
hands as opposed to telling the authorities.&nbsp;

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.560
After making her purchase, Michele leaves&nbsp;
to park at a restaurant for a meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.800
Michele parks poorly, and crashes her car into&nbsp;
another one after mistakenly backing her car too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.040
much. But ever nonchalant, she just heads into&nbsp;
the restaurant after acknowledging it. There,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.000
her ex-husband, Richard, greets her, and they&nbsp;
talk about Vincent and about how broke Richard is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.760
They both agree that their son’s girlfriend is a&nbsp;
psycho, and Richard comments that ‘psycho’ usually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.920
means ‘good in bed’. Suddenly, Michele asks him&nbsp;
if he thinks she’s tight for a woman her age.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.400
This takes Richard aback, and he just stares at&nbsp;
her. Fortunately, Michele’s friend and co-CEO,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.720
Anna, shows up, along with her husband, Robert.&nbsp;
While they're discussing and lightly dismissing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.080
Richard's video game idea, Michele drops the&nbsp;
bomb that she was attacked the other day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.480
To their horror, she says that she guesses she&nbsp;
was violated. Everyone is shocked by the news,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.560
and even more so when they find out that she&nbsp;
hasn’t contacted the police. After dinner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.040
Richard speaks with Michele, trying to convince&nbsp;
her to report the crime. Michele refuses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.720
claiming she doesn’t want to deal with the&nbsp;
police ever again. The topic easily shifts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.800
to Richard’s rejected video game proposal, and&nbsp;
the exchange causes Richard to walk to his car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.880
which is the one that Michele backed into.&nbsp;
Unmoved, Michele lets him know that someone messed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.120
up his fender. Since there’s a high possibility&nbsp;
that Michele’s assailant is someone who she knows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.560
she’s starting to question who took advantage&nbsp;
of her. She repeated the text to Richard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.440
and she isn’t bothered at all that she&nbsp;
damaged her broke ex-husband’s car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.280
It’s unclear whether Michele suspects him, but&nbsp;
given how fast and sudden everything happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.520
the assailant could be anyone. It could be&nbsp;
Richard, Robert, or someone else entirely.&nbsp;

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.040
The next morning, Michele and Vincent head&nbsp;
towards his and Josie’s upcoming apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.720
When Michele arrives at the empty property,&nbsp;
Josie deliberately gets on Michele’s nerves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.560
by openly kissing Vincent in front of her. She&nbsp;
even makes sure to look at Michele. Immediately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.400
Michele realizes that the apartment is more&nbsp;
expensive than the one that Vincent mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.080
Josie is set on this apartment as she thinks&nbsp;
that the last one is a dump, but Michele calmly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.320
asserts that it may be basic, but it isn’t&nbsp;
a dump. Josie isn’t having it, and soon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.480
the two women have a heated exchange, and in the&nbsp;
end, Michele withdraws her financial assistance.&nbsp;

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.480
Michele arrives at her office where she’s greeted&nbsp;
by Robert. It’s revealed that the two of them have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.560
been having an affair behind Anna’s back. With&nbsp;
Robert wanting to get pleasured, Michele blankly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.000
reminds him that she just went through a traumatic&nbsp;
experience. Robert retorts that part of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.560
character is being unpredictable before undoing&nbsp;
and pulling down his pants. Then, he comments that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.640
he knows Michele’s a wilting flower, but surely,&nbsp;
she can at least touch his member. In response,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.960
Michele places a bucket right in front of Robert.&nbsp;
It’s clear that Robert cares as much about Michele&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.600
as he does a bed because that’s just what she is&nbsp;
to him – his next lay. Still, he barely shows any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.880
concern towards Michele despite the tragedy&nbsp;
that happened to her. It wouldn’t even be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.320
stretch to wonder if her assailant was Robert&nbsp;
and that he was playing a sick game on her.&nbsp;

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.360
Later that evening, Michele stays&nbsp;
behind the office after work hours,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.120
and she suddenly receives another disgusting text&nbsp;
from her assailant. This time, it’s complimenting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.360
the colour of her blouse, adding that his seed&nbsp;
won’t leave a stain on it. Subtly perturbed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.960
Michele slowly looks around the office, and she&nbsp;
finds that the only person there that night is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.800
Kurt. If there’s any man we’ve seen so far who&nbsp;
has a grudge against Michele, it’s Kurt. If Kurt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.960
wants power over Michele and if he wants to break&nbsp;
her façade of stoicism, then it’s easy to imagine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.480
him as the assailant. But we don’t know what&nbsp;
Kurt wants, only that he’s pissed at his boss.&nbsp;

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.240
Michele meets with her mother Irene once again&nbsp;
and she discusses the upcoming parole hearing of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.200
Michele’s father. He was a popular mass-murder&nbsp;
from many years ago. This is the primary reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.800
why Michele refuses to ask the police for&nbsp;
help as she fears that her father’s reputation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.320
will affect how the cops will treat her.
That evening, Michele notices an unfamiliar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.000
car roving about her neighborhood. Michele&nbsp;
decides to pick up her can of mace along with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.920
her hand-ax. Michele goes straight to the car,&nbsp;
breaks down the glass window with the hand-ax,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.840
and sprays the driver right in the face. This&nbsp;
goes to show Michele’s tenacity as a character,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.680
having no inhibitions in delivering vengeance and&nbsp;
defending herself when the opportunity presents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.760
itself. Not many would choose to take up arms like&nbsp;
she did in that situation. To be able to confront&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.840
one’s abuser is no small feat by any means. When&nbsp;
the man comes out of the car, it is actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.760
just Richard. Michele takes Richard into her home&nbsp;
and helps him with the pepper spray in his eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.360
Richard explains that he was just worried for&nbsp;
Michele’s safety because she refuses to ask for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.440
help from the police so he decided to patrol the&nbsp;
vicinity himself. Michele asks Richard why he’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.120
using a different car, and Richard says that his&nbsp;
car is in the shop and that he’s borrowing a car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.520
from a friend. Michele immediately infers that&nbsp;
the car belongs to Richard’s girlfriend, Helene.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.360
Once again, his very presence warrants&nbsp;
an examination of him as a suspect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.400
Richard claims that he was patrolling&nbsp;
the vicinity in concern for his ex-wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.480
Moreover, he’s using a different car,&nbsp;
which puts him in a suspicious position,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.560
though Michele did ruin his fender. However,&nbsp;
having known Richard for the longest time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.960
Michele doesn’t doubt his intentions and instead&nbsp;
focuses on the jealousy she feels towards Helene.&nbsp;

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.880
One day in the office, Michele receives&nbsp;
a lewd video of a CGI scene in her game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.600
edited to make it look as if Michele was being&nbsp;
abused. Again, Anna tries to convince Michele to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.320
approach the police but she still refuses. Later&nbsp;
that day, Michele visits Helene at her workplace,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.760
where she sees that Helene’s a young and&nbsp;
beautiful yoga instructor. The awkward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.240
encounter results in an invitation for Helene to&nbsp;
a Christmas dinner. Afterward, Michele returns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.480
to her car but gets interrupted by a call from&nbsp;
Vincent, who reports that Josie is in labor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.480
Michele rushes to the hospital to find Josie&nbsp;
already on the way to the delivery room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.440
Moments later, Josie’s baby is successfully&nbsp;
delivered with no complications. However, Michele&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.840
is bothered by the fact that the baby has a much&nbsp;
darker skin tone than both his parents. Michele,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.720
who is already wary of Josie, spots a tattoo on&nbsp;
her left breast with another man’s name, “Eric”.&nbsp;

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.480
When Michele drives home that evening,&nbsp;
she is greeted by a couple of police cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.920
Rebecca explains to her that there was a&nbsp;
suspicious character lurking about in her bushes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.640
Apparently, her husband Patrick went and spooked&nbsp;
the man away when he checked on Michele’s house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.120
This positions Patrick in a delicate situation.&nbsp;
Mainly, one could think that Patrick may be the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.840
man lurking in the bushes. This puts yet another&nbsp;
man on the list of suspects. Patrick offers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.680
escort Michele back into her house which leads to&nbsp;
Michele’s fluttering attraction towards Patrick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.320
blooming into infatuation. Later, Michele reaches&nbsp;
out to Kevin. She asks him to teach her how to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.480
shoot a gun then assigns him with finding out&nbsp;
who sent the lewd CGI video of her. Being her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.720
admirer in the office, Kevin agrees, especially&nbsp;
with Michele’s handsome payment for the job.&nbsp;

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.800
Christmas is nearing, and Michele is set to host&nbsp;
a Christmas party for the people in her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.280
On the evening of the party, the complete cast of&nbsp;
colorful characters fills Michele’s dining table.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.360
Michele’s table includes her elderly mother Irene&nbsp;
with her young male escort of a boyfriend Ralf,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.200
her distant son Vincent with his troublesome&nbsp;
partner Josie, and her ex-husband Richard with his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.200
young and pretty yoga girlfriend. Then, there’s&nbsp;
even her business partner Anna with her husband&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.360
Robert, with who Michelle has an affair. And last&nbsp;
but not least is her neighbor Rebecca with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.520
husband Patrick, the man who Michele is currently&nbsp;
seducing with her feet under the dinner table.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.080
At this point, we’re face to face with many of the&nbsp;
suspects. And yet, it’s anyone’s guess as to who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.320
it could be. However, it is strongly suggested&nbsp;
that the assailant is most definitely sitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.240
at that dinner table. It’s a sight to behold&nbsp;
with chaos brewing right after Irene announces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.840
to everyone at that table that she and Ralf are&nbsp;
getting married. This prompts an applause from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.040
everyone at the table with the sole exception&nbsp;
of the blunt Michele, who could not contain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.800
her laughter and her disgust for her mother.
After dinner, the guests are all left to their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.040
own little activities. Michele finds Patrick&nbsp;
sitting on the couch all by himself. She takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.120
this opportunity to speak with him. However, among&nbsp;
all of the topics Michele could’ve chosen to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.960
about, she decided on recounting her childhood&nbsp;
and how her life was ruined by her notorious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.800
father. Michele explains that when she was young,&nbsp;
her father came home one day with blood on his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.440
hands. Crazed, he burned the entire house down on&nbsp;
a whim, and the young Michele helped her father,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.160
not knowing exactly what it meant. Eventually,&nbsp;
the police and the media came, took a photo of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.160
amongst the burning rubble, and she was forever&nbsp;
branded as the psychopath’s daughter. Michele&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.360
had since then worked the life out of her body&nbsp;
just to bring her name from the brink of shame.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.000
This bit of narration from Michele is very&nbsp;
revealing about her fears and her character.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.080
She doesn’t trust the police at all, especially&nbsp;
since they had misconstrued her image before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.200
Michele was just a child; her life&nbsp;
was ruined by her father, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.360
And if the police didn’t bother with helping a&nbsp;
child facing injustice, why would they bother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.280
with the now-grown psychopath’s daughter? When&nbsp;
Michele is done opening up about her life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.640
she walks to the kitchen where she encounters&nbsp;
her mother. Irene tells Michele that she was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.600
needlessly cruel to her. A small argument ensues&nbsp;
which eventually leads to Irene having a stroke.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.120
The entire party is brought to a halt, and&nbsp;
Michele accompanies her mother to the hospital.&nbsp;

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.120
In the ambulance, Irene tells Michele to go&nbsp;
see her father. She didn’t know it at the time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.960
but these are the last words that her mother would&nbsp;
say to her. Whether Michele would come to regret&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.680
her actions is left ambiguous. Either way, Michele&nbsp;
would no longer have a chance to apologize to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.600
mother. In the hospital, the nurse reports&nbsp;
that while Irene’s in a stable condition,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.360
there’s little hope for her to wake up from&nbsp;
her coma. That evening, Michele goes home to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.240
get some rest, and she’s accompanied by her best&nbsp;
friend, Anna. The two of them sleep side-by-side,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.160
snuggling for warmth. They recount the time&nbsp;
when the two of them attempted to hook up. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.240
didn’t get to it, though, since at the time,&nbsp;
the two of them couldn’t stop laughing. Anna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.240
then gingerly kisses Michele’s lips, and it’s&nbsp;
unclear whether it was platonic or romantic.&nbsp;

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.320
The next morning, Michele is startled awake&nbsp;
by Robert touching her thighs. At this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.880
Michele turns him down and ends their affair.&nbsp;
With that, she visits her comatose mother. Michele&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.320
speaks to her as if at any moment she would wake&nbsp;
and reveal that it was all just an elaborate act&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.000
to get back at Michele for hurting her. She keeps&nbsp;
trying to convince herself of this, but she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.080
soon confronted with a harsh reality as several&nbsp;
nurses rush in to revive Irene, whose heart had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.160
just stopped beating. At this point, the only&nbsp;
thing Michele could do is wish with all her heart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.960
that it was just a ploy, but the truth is that her&nbsp;
mother is dead. Once again, she is left powerless&nbsp;

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.320
Michele is not given much time to grieve&nbsp;
since her assailant is still out and about.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.160
When Michele arrives home from the hospital,&nbsp;
she spots her bedroom with the lights on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.320
She equips her pepper spray and her hand-ax then&nbsp;
proceeds to the bedroom. When she gets there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.080
all she sees is her laptop with the words, “I’m&nbsp;
sorry I couldn’t stop myself” flashing on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.560
screen. This only reinforces the possibility that&nbsp;
her assailant is someone who she knows. Bizarrely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.640
enough, the message can be interpreted as the&nbsp;
assailant feeling remorseful for his actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.240
But it’s also possible that it’s another one of&nbsp;
his twisted games to get under Michele’s skin.&nbsp;

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.880
Soon, Michele and her family start searching&nbsp;
for a place to spread Irene’s ashes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.720
But as they’re strolling on, Josie starts&nbsp;
berating Vincent about a small mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.640
This pitiful display prompts Michele to be frank&nbsp;
with her son, saying that Vincent is obviously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.960
not the father of the child. Vincent erupts at&nbsp;
his mother and he storms off along with Josie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.120
When everyone had left, Michele and Richard&nbsp;
throw Irene’s ashes in the park by the water.&nbsp;

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.200
During a windy evening, Patrick helps&nbsp;
Michele close her shutters. Eventually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.120
one thing leads to another, and they start&nbsp;
kissing. However, Patrick suddenly stops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:30.000
himself and leaves. This is yet another suspicious&nbsp;
bit of behavior from the men in Michele’s life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.600
While blueballing others and yourself doesn’t&nbsp;
mean that you took advantage of someone, Patrick’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.160
sudden refusal and escape remain questionable.&nbsp;
After all, if he were the assailant, then sleeping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.160
with Michele might give away what he did.
Later that day, Michele receives an update&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.880
from Kevin about his special project. Kevin&nbsp;
reports nothing significant about Kurt. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.280
Michele gets the idea of suspecting Kevin as&nbsp;
well. She sneaks around after hours to access&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.080
Kevin’s computer. Soon enough, she discovers that&nbsp;
the video was indeed created by Kevin. Despite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.160
the revelation, Michele senses no malicious&nbsp;
intent from him, so she lets Kevin explain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.800
Apparently, the video was just a ridiculous&nbsp;
joke he had created for himself but one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.560
employees caught wind of the video and sent it&nbsp;
to everyone as a joke. Michele wonders if Kevin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.560
was her assailant so she orders him to strip.&nbsp;
Unlike her assailant, Kevin’s member is cut,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.480
so she lets her grudge towards him go, just&nbsp;
like Kevin has to let that extra payment go.&nbsp;

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.320
Michele comes home after a long day and receives&nbsp;
the crib that she had ordered for her grandchild.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.320
She places it on top of the table with its&nbsp;
strap dangling from the edges. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.480
her masked assailant ambushes her from behind&nbsp;
and once again tries to force himself on her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.040
With her worst nightmare repeating itself, Michele&nbsp;
is determined to fight back. With a stronger grip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.280
on herself, Michele gathers her strength and&nbsp;
refuses to be used once more. She grabs the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.680
crib strap to pull it towards her, and it hits the&nbsp;
back of the man’s head. Then, she grabs a pair of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.760
metal scissors and pierces it through the man’s&nbsp;
hand. Finally, Michele can discover the truth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:50.960
behind the man who violated her. She pulls the ski&nbsp;
mask off and to her surprise, she sees Patrick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:55.040
Enraged, Michele threatens Patrick with the&nbsp;
scissors, demanding him to leave the house.&nbsp;

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.200
The following morning, Michele spots Patrick&nbsp;
across her front gate. Patrick wears his suit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.120
on the way to work as if nothing had happened.&nbsp;
Seeing this, Michele realizes that discovering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.960
her assailant’s identity means nothing as&nbsp;
she still refuses to turn to the authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.600
And so, Michele is caged in a peculiar and tragic&nbsp;
conundrum. Her own assailant is living right next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.200
door, and she has no one to turn to.
Despite her distaste for the police,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.040
Michele resolves to see her father after&nbsp;
discovering that his parole had not been approved.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.800
Though this is difficult for her, Michelle keeps&nbsp;
her mother’s final wish in her mind, and she has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.640
unresolved issues of her own with her father.&nbsp;
In an ironic turn of events, Michele’s father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.720
hanged himself the same morning that Michele went&nbsp;
to see him. This leaves her upset over not being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.800
able to tell her father of all the things she&nbsp;
wanted to get off her chest. However, she takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.320
comfort in the fact that her despicable father had&nbsp;
decided to kill himself rather than to face the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:43.120
daughter that he had ruined. Somehow, she tells&nbsp;
herself that it was she who killed him in the end.&nbsp;

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.960
Michele is driving home from the prison, when&nbsp;
suddenly, she receives a call from the press&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.560
asking for an interview about her father’s&nbsp;
recent passing. With all that’s happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.960
Michele’s still rattled by the events. She gets&nbsp;
distracted from the road, and she fails to see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.120
deer that’s crossing the street. In the long list&nbsp;
of Michele’s misfortunes, one would think she’d&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.680
be spared from yet another terrible event. But as&nbsp;
it stands, Michele is stuck inside her tilted car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.760
She calls several of her friends and family&nbsp;
for help but none of them are available.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.960
Out of everyone she could have called, and out&nbsp;
of everyone who could have answered the phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.240
it’s Patrick, her very own attacker, who&nbsp;
comes and helps her get out of the car.&nbsp;

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.200
Michele and Patrick return to Michele’s house.&nbsp;
He looks after Michele’s wounded leg and applies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.760
first aid. At this point, Michele confronts&nbsp;
Patrick about why he forced himself on her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.040
To this, Patrick admits that it was&nbsp;
the only way he could get turned on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.840
Feeling ashamed, he leaves abruptly. Several&nbsp;
other conclusions occur over the next few days.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.680
Robert and Michele have their one final&nbsp;
session before officially ending their affair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.320
Vincent comes home with his infant son after being&nbsp;
kicked out by Josie. On that very day, Josie comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.360
barging in to retrieve her son. The irresponsible&nbsp;
Vincent is distraught mostly over losing the baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.400
Michele finally understands this&nbsp;
and the two of them reconcile.&nbsp;

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.880
One day, Michele and Vincent stumble upon Patrick&nbsp;
while doing groceries. He tells them that his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.800
wife’s out on a long trip, and he’s left with&nbsp;
too much food in the house. Patrick invites the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.040
both of them over, and Vincent readily agrees.&nbsp;
As for Michele, she mulls it over for a second,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.680
but strangely enough, she also says yes. That&nbsp;
evening, a still-distraught Vincent drinks too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:10.800
much of the wine. This leaves Patrick and Michele&nbsp;
alone together. In a rather dark and strange turn,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.440
Michele remains attracted to Patrick. She seduces&nbsp;
him and in turn, Patrick leads Michele down to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.720
the basement where no one can hear them&nbsp;
indulging in their deplorable delights.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.040
What follows next is sickening and twisted, to&nbsp;
say the least. Patrick grabs hold of Michele and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.600
beats her, making her fight back and thrash on the&nbsp;
ground. Still, she looks at Patrick and tells him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.480
“Do it”. Patrick stops abruptly, the excitement&nbsp;
leaving his body. He explains to Michele it only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.960
turns him on when that the other person is being&nbsp;
forced. Upon hearing this, Michele hits Patrick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.040
which quickly re-invigorates him. After the&nbsp;
perverse lovemaking had finished, Michele goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.800
to Vincent and tells him they’ll be going home.
Michele is going to be having a party for their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.520
game’s launch. At their latest meeting, Michele&nbsp;
finally gives Kurt credit for doing a good job.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.280
Michele even entrusts the planning of the party&nbsp;
to Vincent. Things are falling into place for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.760
the final act. All the characters are present, and&nbsp;
they’re finally getting what they want. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.280
there still hangs a dark and foreboding aura&nbsp;
in the air. Before the launch party begins,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.440
Anna admits to Michele that she thinks Robert&nbsp;
is cheating on her. This surprises Michele,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.760
and she simply feigns her ignorance. During the&nbsp;
party, Michele first greets Robert, who recently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.080
got dumped by Helene. She cheers him up by asking&nbsp;
him to coordinate with Kurt for his story ideas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.640
for a new game. Meanwhile, Patrick is also there,&nbsp;
and he gleefully dances with Michele as if they’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:23.680
a normal couple. Then, Michele spots Robert and&nbsp;
Anna flirting with each other. Upon seeing this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.960
she tells Patrick that she needs to do&nbsp;
one thing before the two of them leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.720
Tired of living a lie, Michele admits to her best&nbsp;
friend that the woman Robert was sleeping with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:35.040
was her. Anna is speechless with Michele,&nbsp;
and she directs her anger towards Robert.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.280
With this, Michele and Patrick take their leave.
In spite of everything in this strange and dark&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.200
climax, it’s hard to tell whether Michele&nbsp;
has accepted this new relationship. Is she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.840
willing to accept this deplorable situation?&nbsp;
Is this provocation part of the game they play?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.480
Or is she sincerely plotting to get rid of Patrick&nbsp;
once and for all? On the car ride home, Michele&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.560
tells Patrick that their relationship is sick.&nbsp;
She tells him that at the end of the day, she will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.560
still report him to the police. Patrick looks to&nbsp;
Michele in disdain as the two of them reach their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.960
neighborhood. Michele goes down the car first&nbsp;
and enters her house at a deliberately slow pace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.800
Just as she expects, Patrick is there in the&nbsp;
darkness of the kitchen with his ski mask on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.360
Once again, Patrick tries to force himself on&nbsp;
Michele. Believing that Michele’s playing along,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.280
Patrick doesn’t see Vincent coming in with&nbsp;
a blunt object. Vincent smashes Patrick’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.960
head so hard that it injures him fatally.&nbsp;
Patrick musters the last ounce of strength&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.120
he has to stand up, and he looks at Michele&nbsp;
in bewilderment, asking her “Why?” Finally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:29.040
Patrick slumps down on the floor and Vincent&nbsp;
breaks down after being the one who killed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.400
In turn, Michele comforts her son,&nbsp;
telling him that it’s all over now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.560
Despite the ever-looming threat being gone,&nbsp;
things in Michele’s life will forever be changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.360
Will these changes be beneficial? Or will they&nbsp;
be yet another scar in Michele’s broken psyche?&nbsp;

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.560
Eventually, the police come and&nbsp;
Michele sends in her report.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.160
In the end, Rebecca doesn’t resent Michele&nbsp;
for killing her husband, fully understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.080
that Patrick is a troubled individual. Before&nbsp;
leaving the neighborhood, Rebecca admits that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.640
she’s thankful that Michele was able to provide&nbsp;
what Patrick needed for a time. As Rebecca leaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.800
Vincent and Josie drive by Michele’s house on&nbsp;
their brand new convertible. After proving to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.800
be an excellent event organizer, Vincent finds his&nbsp;
calling and takes his responsibilities to heart,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:09.120
winning back Josie and their son.
Michele visits her parents’ grave at the cemetery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.200
Suddenly, Anna appears and she approaches&nbsp;
Michele to make amends. Anna tells Michele&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.120
that she kicked Robert out of the house. With&nbsp;
this, Anna concludes that her house is too big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.960
for her and it would be best if the two of them&nbsp;
lived together. After all, the only thing they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.200
have left is each other. The two best friends&nbsp;
walk on to greet their more peaceful future.&nbsp;

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.360
Elle is a dark and controversial movie that leaves&nbsp;
audiences divided whether the story is powerful or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.440
pointless. The film is less of a whodunit thriller&nbsp;
and is more of a character study of Michele&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.840
Leblanc, who is a morally dubious person to say&nbsp;
the least. Michele was subjected to terrible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.320
things by terrible people, but she herself engaged&nbsp;
in cruel acts, like being unnecessarily harsh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.160
with Josie and her mother and having no qualms&nbsp;
about sleeping with her best friend’s husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.840
Among the myriad of things that characterized&nbsp;
her ruthlessness, it is the complexity of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.520
character that leaves a valuable impression&nbsp;
in cinema. One of the takeaways we’d like to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.200
mention is the film’s critique of patriarchal&nbsp;
society. That there is a twisted desire to put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.720
down or humiliate strong women perhaps on a&nbsp;
psycho-analytic level that not many people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.720
realize. However, despite the imperfections of&nbsp;
her character, it is with that same strength that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.480
Michele was able to liberate herself from her&nbsp;
assailant. Most of all, she managed to liberate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.760
herself from the shackles of her past.
By the end of the movie, Michele&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.240
had the strength to accept that she&nbsp;
didn’t have to face the world alone.
