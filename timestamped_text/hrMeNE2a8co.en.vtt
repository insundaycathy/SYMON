00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.040
Story Recapped here. Today I'm going to explain&nbsp;
a psychological thriller film called Would You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.760
Rather. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care&nbsp;
Iris is a young woman who struggles to find a job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.040
to care for her sick brother. At a job interview,&nbsp;
she shares her experiences, but the interviewer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.080
does not sound interested in hiring her. Raleigh&nbsp;
suffers from leukemia. He feels like a burden to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.960
his sister, but Iris always reminds her that he is&nbsp;
not. He does all he can to help her, but because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.840
of his disease, his abilities are limited. Their&nbsp;
budget is very tight, so Iris does all she can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.160
to make ends meet. One day, she informs Raleigh&nbsp;
that she will visit his oncologist, Dr Barden,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.560
because according to him, he can help cut some of&nbsp;
the costs for his treatment. Iris arrives at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.800
clinic and helps an elderly woman on a wheelchair&nbsp;
named Linda to enter the building as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.800
Dr Barden welcomes her to his office where&nbsp;
he introduces her to Shepard Lambrick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.640
his philanthropist friend. Iris takes a&nbsp;
seat to discuss her brother’s condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.440
Dr Barden has already informed Shepard&nbsp;
about Raleigh’s needs. According to Shepard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.240
his foundation can help improve his situation&nbsp;
through financial means. The doctor adds that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.720
the Lambricks provide funds for building clinics&nbsp;
and schools all over the world, especially in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.840
developing countries. Shepard gets up his seat to&nbsp;
proceed to discuss his proposal in great detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.480
He says that his family believes in creating&nbsp;
opportunities for people who have not received&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.280
any luck in their life — like Iris and Raleigh.&nbsp;
This sparks interest in the young woman because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.920
she desperately needs assistance with her bills.&nbsp;
So she asks what she has to do to get the help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.520
they need. Shepard replies by saying that he will&nbsp;
host a dinner party, and she simply has to join.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.440
She makes it clear if there are other people&nbsp;
invited to which he replies that people who are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.680
also in the same situation as her will come.&nbsp;
Individuals that they want to help have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.960
participate in a game of sorts. The winner will&nbsp;
be taken care of from their bills, education,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.680
house, and basically everything. Iris&nbsp;
asks what will happen if she does not win,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.120
but Shepard simply says “you just don’t win”.&nbsp;
Still confused about his generous offer, Iris&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.880
asks Dr Barden if it is legit. Shepard laughs at&nbsp;
her remark. The doctor explains that Shepard saved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.189
his life; he was once invited to the dinner, and&nbsp;
won the contest. Since then, the promise of a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.560
life has been fulfilled by Shepard’s foundation.&nbsp;
Iris says that she will need more time to think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.160
about it. Before she leaves, Shepard hands her&nbsp;
an information card if she decides to RSVP;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.520
the deadline will be by 8 PM that day. He also&nbsp;
adds that if she wins, he will pay for Raleigh's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.640
treatment and use his foundation's influence to&nbsp;
shortlist a bone marrow donor for him. That night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.840
she receives a call from the interviewer where she&nbsp;
recently applied, but she got rejected. Because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.640
this, she rummages through her hamper to look for&nbsp;
the Lambrick Foundation business card and confirms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.520
that she will participate in the dinner party. The&nbsp;
following day, she lets Raleigh know that she will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.440
have dinner with some of her high school friends&nbsp;
and says that he will have to stay home alone for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.960
the night. She gets ready and puts on the best&nbsp;
dress she owns. A luxurious car picks Iris up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.560
from her home just before the sun sets. During the&nbsp;
ride, she recalls conversations with Raleigh, as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.960
source of strength to get through the evening.
She arrives at the manor; where Bevans,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.920
Shepard’s butler and former M I 5 agent,&nbsp;
welcomes her. According to him, she is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.480
eighth and final guest for the party. Iris is&nbsp;
introduced to the other contestants: Lucas; Cal;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.440
Peter, a high stakes gambler; Linda, a paralyzed&nbsp;
elderly woman; Travis, a war veteran; Amy;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.440
and Conway, an alcoholic debtor. Meanwhile, Dr&nbsp;
Barden is at his home, looking at photographs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.760
and recalling his conversation with Shepard&nbsp;
from the past day. Dr Barden seems to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.920
an accomplice of Shepard; but he dismisses&nbsp;
the idea that Iris should join the contest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.680
However, he hands the doctor an envelope of money&nbsp;
to silence him. Shepard prepares himself for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.360
evening while giving reminders to his son, Julian,&nbsp;
to be on his best behavior for the night. Julian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.320
is stubborn but his father tolerates his behavior.&nbsp;
In the common room where the contestants gather,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.800
Bevans announces that all their possessions,&nbsp;
such as phones and keys, must be left in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.240
room during the game. He assures them that their&nbsp;
belongings will be safe and secure. One by one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.520
they hand their stuff to Bevans. After, he guides&nbsp;
them through to the dining room. The table is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.840
prepared beautifully with elegant tablewares.&nbsp;
Place cards are provided for their seating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.160
arrangement. The eight contestants take their&nbsp;
places in accordance with their assigned seats.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.360
Shepard and Julian make their entrance just&nbsp;
in time. He welcomes everyone to the Lambrick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.880
house and introduces Julian. He orders Bevans&nbsp;
to serve them the meal. A steak and foie gras&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.760
dinner is served along with some red wine. Iris&nbsp;
raises her hand to let the host know that she is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.120
a vegetarian. However, there are no available&nbsp;
options in the kitchen to replace her meal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.760
She has been a vegetarian for most of her life,&nbsp;
so she declines to eat the steak. Shepard then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.120
offers her ten thousand dollars to compromise&nbsp;
her principles. Initially, Iris refuses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.880
but after some convincing, she reluctantly accepts&nbsp;
his offer and eats the steak. Shepard notices that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.960
Conway isn’t drinking wine, so he offers him other&nbsp;
alcoholic beverages. When Shepard realizes Conway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.840
is a recovering alcoholic, he offers him ten&nbsp;
thousand dollars to drink a glass of wine. Conway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.040
declines the offer because he has been sober for&nbsp;
16 years. Shepard does not give up on persuading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.400
Conway, so he offers him fifty thousand dollars in&nbsp;
exchange for drinking a whole decanter of scotch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.520
Conway fights his morals that he carefully&nbsp;
built for almost two decades. Eventually, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.080
accepts the offer and drinks the scotch. Shepard&nbsp;
is clearly entertained by putting his guests in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.600
uncomfortable situations. After the meal, he makes&nbsp;
an announcement regarding the game for the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.160
He introduces the famous childhood game called&nbsp;
“would you rather”. He explains that in each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.280
round, each player will be given a choice between&nbsp;
two things. Whichever they choose, they must act&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.160
upon, or else they will face consequences.&nbsp;
He adds that as the game continues with one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.440
dilemma after another, eliminating players as&nbsp;
they continue, only one winner can succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.880
Their time to make their decision is only limited&nbsp;
to 15 seconds, or else, they will be eliminated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.360
The game is basically decision making in its&nbsp;
rawest form to expose the players’ characters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.800
Shepard gives a last chance for anyone to leave&nbsp;
the manor if they no longer wish to participate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.200
However, everyone is still willing to be&nbsp;
part of the game. They officially begin;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.000
Bevans wheels in an equipment covered in black&nbsp;
cloth. He later reveals that it is an electric&nbsp;

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.600
machine. All of them get confused and scared.&nbsp;
Conway gets up because he knows that Shepard plans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.160
on hurting them. He attempts to leave but Shepard&nbsp;
tells him that the chance to flee has already been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.840
given. Conway tries to walk away but Bevans shoots&nbsp;
him immediately. They all scream as the incident&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.400
takes them in a state of fear. The remaining&nbsp;
contestants learn how serious and deadly the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.600
game is, and realize they can only win the game if&nbsp;
they are the last surviving player. Participation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.640
is no longer voluntary. In order for them to not&nbsp;
end up like Conway, they should follow the rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.120
The first round is played by having two&nbsp;
players connected to the electric machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.160
One of them has to decide if they should&nbsp;
electrocute themselves or the other person. Bevans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.080
places the headpiece on Cal and Amy. Shepard asks&nbsp;
Cal if he would rather electrocute himself or Amy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.040
The blue button is for him, while the red is for&nbsp;
the latter. The timer starts, and Cal presses the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.480
blue button which gives him an abrupt shock. Amy&nbsp;
smirks as she is spared some pain. The headpiece&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.760
is transferred to Linda while she cries in fear.&nbsp;
Before Shepard asks the question, Amy presses the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.640
blue button to electrocute the poor lady. Linda&nbsp;
falls unconscious for a split second, but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:20.000
manage to revive her. It is now Linda’s turn to&nbsp;
choose as the other headpiece is worn on Peter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.280
He tries to get up, but a gun is pointed at him&nbsp;
right away. Linda decides to electrocute Peter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.280
Meanwhile, Dr Barden plans on stopping the evil&nbsp;
ways of Shepard. He opens a drawer to get his gun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.160
then drives to the manor in the middle of the&nbsp;
night. Back in the dining room, it is now Travis’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.440
turn to choose between electrocuting himself&nbsp;
or Lucas. Travis spares himself, leaving Lucas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.400
being hurt. Now that it is his turn, he assures&nbsp;
Iris that he will take the shock instead of her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.920
which he does accordingly. During the second time,&nbsp;
he looks fazed, and his head falls to the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.640
Now that it is time for Iris to choose between her&nbsp;
and Cal, she selflessly presses the button that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.280
electrocutes her. Shepard gives them a moment&nbsp;
to compose themselves while his team prepares&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.480
for the second round. While all of them try to&nbsp;
strategize and form a game plan, Julian reenters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.520
the dining room to have a casual conversation.&nbsp;
A menacing vibe radiates from him, and starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.080
to disrespect everyone in the room. Travis&nbsp;
gets up to tell him that he should keep quiet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.760
but Julian tells him that opening his mouth was a&nbsp;
big mistake. Julian is now up to something vile.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.320
The other servants bring rolls of plastic to cover&nbsp;
the whole room. The players worry about the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.880
round being worse. Dr Barden arrives at the back&nbsp;
portion of the manor where there are no lights.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.080
Knowing that everyone is busy attending the&nbsp;
game, he climbs up the wall to make his way in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.080
The second round begins; each of them will get&nbsp;
30 seconds in order to make their decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.280
He begins with Iris; Shepard asks if she would&nbsp;
rather stab Cal in the thigh with an ice pick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.920
or strike Travis three times with a whip. Travis&nbsp;
tells her that it is okay to strike him rather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.560
than stab someone. He removes his coat to&nbsp;
receive the strikes voluntarily. Shepard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.120
reminds Iris that the strikes should be strong&nbsp;
enough to hurt him, or else it won’t count.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.680
On the first try, Iris strikes him gently,&nbsp;
but Shepard refuses to count it valid.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.720
She does it again, which obviously hurts&nbsp;
Travis, leaving three big wounds on his back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.840
Lucas is given the options of stabbing Iris&nbsp;
on the thigh or striking Travis thrice again;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.080
he chooses to do the same to Travis who is still
willing to be on the receiving end of the painful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:23.440
dare. Lucas strikes three times. These&nbsp;
options are clearly orchestrated by Julian,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.080
who got into a heated argument with Travis&nbsp;
earlier. Travis is now the one to choose;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:33.120
he either stabs Lucas on the thigh or receive&nbsp;
three more lashes administered by Bevans. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:38.960
refuses to stab anybody, so he receives three more&nbsp;
lashes. At this point, it is clear that he needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:44.240
serious medical attention as a lot of blood is&nbsp;
lost from his system. Travis is badly injured and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.280
Peter, knowing he won't survive another lashing,&nbsp;
stabs Linda in the leg after apologizing to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.560
Unfortunately, he hits her femoral artery, so an&nbsp;
uncontrollable amount of blood seeps from her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.080
Peter tries to stop it by using a belt to apply&nbsp;
pressure. It is Linda’s turn to choose between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.600
whipping Travis or stabbing Amy. She takes a split&nbsp;
second to think, then stabs Amy, who in return,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.880
hits her face. Among the players, Amy is the odd&nbsp;
one out, she does not feel sorry for the others&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.440
who got hurt. Amy is then given the options&nbsp;
to either whip Travis or choose any player&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.920
to stab with the ice pick. After saying that&nbsp;
the game is not about helping each other, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:26.320
eliminating everyone, she chooses to stab Iris. As&nbsp;
she approaches, Iris begs her not to do it. Out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.600
nowhere, she asks Shepard if she could stab Iris&nbsp;
anywhere. Iris panics as the host agrees to Amy’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.480
sadistic request. She stabs Iris on the right&nbsp;
part of her torso, leaving her in great pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.120
After looking for ways to break into the&nbsp;
manor, Dr Barden finally finds a way in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:46.400
through the basement. He quietly descends from&nbsp;
outside and walks forward. In the dining room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.320
Peter informs everyone that Linda has not&nbsp;
moved for a significant amount of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.440
Shepard puts the guilt on him because he was&nbsp;
the one who stabbed her. Bevans checks for vital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.880
signs, then announces her death. They all get&nbsp;
devastated after Bevans gets her out of the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.200
Cal then chooses to whip Travis enough to&nbsp;
incapacitate him, making him eliminated from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.880
game. While Shepard and Bevans talk about the next&nbsp;
round, Lucas causes a distraction and everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:16.000
except Amy attempts to escape the room. Iris stabs&nbsp;
one of the men with the ice pick; this bids her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.280
time to leave the room. Cal advances on Shepard to&nbsp;
strike him, but gets shot in his failed attempt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.720
After Shepard shoots and kills Cal, the others&nbsp;
surrender. Iris runs to the basement while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.280
being chased by the servants. Julian finds&nbsp;
her and attempts to force himself on her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:36.320
but she stabs him with the ice pick. As she&nbsp;
sees Dr Barden, Bevans successfully kills him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.120
She loses hope, and is forced to come back to&nbsp;
the game and reunite with the remaining players.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.480
Shepard apologizes to her for his son’s behavior&nbsp;
that took place in the basement, and blames it on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.600
his lack of motherly care. The third round begins&nbsp;
with each player having thirty seconds to choose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.240
between being submerged underwater in a barrel&nbsp;
for two minutes, or an unknown task written on an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:01.120
envelope that is placed in front of them. Peter&nbsp;
takes the first turn; he chooses the envelope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.600
which requires him to light a firecracker&nbsp;
in his hand. He does not seem too scared,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:11.120
but then finds out that it is a quarter stick.&nbsp;
Bevans secures it to his hand using duct tape. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:16.560
lights it fearfully; when it explodes, it causes&nbsp;
a heart attack and he dies. Lucas also chooses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.760
the envelope over the barrel. The card shows a&nbsp;
drawing of an eye; the option forces him to slit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.960
open his own eyeball with a blade. If he refuses&nbsp;
to do so, Shepard will have him killed, so he&nbsp;

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.760
does the dare and survives. Iris chooses the&nbsp;
barrel; she will be submerged in it for two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.360
minutes as Bevans holds her head steadily.&nbsp;
She dramatically thinks of her brother as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:40.560
motivation to survive. She struggles excessively,&nbsp;
but she makes it through. Lucas reveals that her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.120
unpicked card would have dared her to have all of&nbsp;
her teeth extracted. She is partially relieved to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:50.240
get past this round. Amy then chooses her card&nbsp;
and learns that she must be submerged underwater&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.720
for four minutes; she has a fear of being&nbsp;
underwater, but she has no choice but to obey.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.920
Bevans did not give her enough time to be ready,&nbsp;
so she drowns, while the others painfully watch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:06.720
Amy eventually stops moving, and Bevans lays her&nbsp;
down. With only Iris and Lucas in the final round,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.680
Shepard makes them sit facing each other. After&nbsp;
flipping a coin to know who gets to choose first,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.240
Iris is given the choice to either shoot and&nbsp;
kill Lucas to win the game, or spare him, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.520
would result in both walking away empty-handed.&nbsp;
After some hesitation, Iris gathers the courage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:26.480
to shoot Lucas in the chest, killing him. The&nbsp;
men in the room applaud as Iris covers her ears.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.840
Shepard announces her as the champion. He gives&nbsp;
her a bag full of money which is more than enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.320
to pay for her brother’s treatment, and pay&nbsp;
off all her debt as well. He explains that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.360
a donor has already been found for her brother&nbsp;
in Romania. When Iris arrives home, she cleans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.240
herself and takes a moment to let everything sink&nbsp;
in. She then discovers that Raleigh has taken his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.160
own life by drinking an excessive amount of&nbsp;
medication while she was out. He could not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.720
handle the fact that he is a burden any longer.&nbsp;
The sight of her lifeless brother devastates her;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.960
she starts crying after realizing that there&nbsp;
was no point in participating in Shepard’s game.
