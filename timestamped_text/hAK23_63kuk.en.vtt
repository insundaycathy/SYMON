00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.779
Welcome back guys, to Cinema Summary
today's film is a neo-noir about a

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.420
real messed up court case and it's
accused murderer

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.080
this is Primal Fear

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.300
this guy here a Chicago defense attorney
Martin Vail

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.210
a real slimeball of a lawyer who loves the
limelight and is really good at getting

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.720
his clients out of court using legal
loopholes in the system maybe by chance

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.740
or a higher plan he sees a news report
about the arrests of Aaron Stampler an

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.189
altar boy from Kentucky with a severe
stutter who was accused of brutally

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.750
murdering the beloved Archbishop Rushman!
Vail decides then and there to be the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.960
altar boys lawyer pro bono,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.900
that's lawyer
talk for "I'm-a-do-this-for-free"

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.920
Vail's meeting with Aaron in the county jail
leads him to believe that Stampler is

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.680
innocent

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.640
"There was someone else in that
room Mr. Vail."

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.760
"There was a.. third person?"

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.820
"Yes, sir."

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.587
"Did you tell the police this?"

00:00:52.587 --> 00:00:53.600
"Yes, yes I did."

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.060
Though the prosecutor, a lawyer who

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.579
is trying to get Aaron convicted Janet
Venable is none too happy.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.500
Doesn't help that she is Vail's old girlfriend.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.040
Vail and his team investigate into leads that

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.229
will help them get Aaron free of the
case. Snooping around at Aaron's old

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.340
apartment has one of Vail's assistants
find a photo of a girl, Linda and have a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.980
brief scuffle with another altar boy
that Aaron knew named Alex.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.220
The main move by Vail is to get psychiatrist Molly
Arrington to evaluate him to make the

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.120
case against Aaron weaker. Their first
meeting has Aaron hint at being abused

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.243
by his dad and that Aaron has blank
spots in his memory.

00:01:26.243 --> 00:01:27.299
As the trial begins

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.170
Vail discovers that powerful civic
leaders, people of power who are supposed

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.320
to help the city and including the
corrupt state's attorney John

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.100
Shaughnessy have lost millions of
dollars in tearing down old buildings

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.150
and making new condos kicking people out
who used to live there as result

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.960
Only to have the archbishop put a stop to
this plan, stopping any construction work

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.560
around certain church lands. A lot of
people weren't happy with that so the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.960
Archbishop got lots of hate mail and
death threats

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.100
The second meeting between Aaron a psychiatrist reveals that Aaron

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.149
and Linda were together and having sex

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.729
though in Aaron's words one day she just
disappeared.

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.509
Vail with his assistant trap Alex and
confront him for information

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.229
Alex tells them that he was looking for
a tape which has a recording of the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.420
Archbishop's sermon featuring Alex, Linda
and Aaron doing 'sex stuff' at the command

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.090
of the Archbishop.
This all leads to Vail making a search

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.379
of the Archbishop's apartment where he
finds the VHS tape of Stampler being forced

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.819
to have sex with Alex and Linda this isn't a
good thing introducing this evidence

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.420
would make the jury feel sorry for the
boy but this gives a motive as to why

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.290
Stampler killed the Archbishop meaning
that the prosecutor Janet can get

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.800
this kid convicted and sent to jail.
Vail needs answers pronto so he meets with

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.480
Stampler and accuses Stampler of lying.
The kid can't catch a break and

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.020
something changes...

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.820
"You little sissy, you
make me sick!"

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.840
the way he talks, the way he acts

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.500
Aaron is not talking anymore

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.920
No, instead a violent psycho named "Roy" is

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.900
who confesses to murdering the
Archbishop and whatever the hell just

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.780
happened stops when Roy goes away and suddenly

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.319
becomes shy innocent Aaron again. 
This is an example of one of those blank

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.459
spots in Aaron's memory.
The psychiatrist examining Stampler is

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.329
convinced that he has disassociative
identity disorder caused by years of

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.989
abuse at the hands of his father since
he can't enter an insanity defense

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.750
during a trial this is absolutely
useless for Vail

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.880
Now people with disassociative identity disorder

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.080
or multiple personality disorder have

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.470
different personalities, like another
person inside of them. The memory loss that

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.889
happens is because one of the
personalities is in control and the

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:26.860
other one isn't.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.260
So if you don't remember
watching this then uh

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.580
you know someone's got a problem.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.080
Now like I said before
Vail is a slimeball and he's damn good

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.329
at his job so he leaves a trail of clues
about the Archbishop's pedophilia and

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.280
Stampler's other self, all to set up his master plan.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.000
The cherry on top is him sending the VHS tape to Janet the Prosecutor

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.360
knowing she'll know he sent it and will use it as evidence as proof of motive

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.320
Can't be helped that Shaughnessy and her boss are pressuring

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.120
her to not reveal the information later

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.079
Later, Vail puts Stampler on the witness stand
and gently questions him about the abuse

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.919
he suffered at the Archbishop's hands
and Janet just starts grilling him

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.540
during the cross-examination so badly
that Stampler turns into Roy and in

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.859
front of everybody, grabs her, threatening
to snap her neck if anyone comes near

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.400
him he is stopped by the courthouse
guards and rushed back to his holding

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.449
cell. The judge dismisses the jury in
favor of a bench trial and then fights

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.359
Stampler not guilty by reason of
insanity sending him to a

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.160
maximum-security mental hospital instead.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.360
Nice job, Vail!

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.360
Oh and Janet gets fired for losing the case and allowing the

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.430
Archbishop's crimes, which both the
Catholic Church in the City Council had

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.990
been trying to hide for the past ten
years, is now revealed to everyone

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.200
Vail visits Aaron in his cell and tells him
that his case has been dismissed

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.680
Stampler says he recalls nothing of what
happened in the courtroom having once

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.080
again 'lost time' (blank spots).

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.000
Just as Vale leaving Stampler asks him

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.960
to tell Miss Venable that I hope her
neck is okay. Wait a damn second!

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.470
Vale confronts him and Aaron reveals that he
had faked a multiple personality

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.250
disorder this whole time. No longer
stuttering he brags about having

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.180
murdered Archbishop Rushman as well as Linda

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.300
when Vail asks "there never was a Roy?"

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:11.020
Stampler replies "There never was an
Aaron, counselor."

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.680
a stunned Vail, his belief in the goodness of all people now broken

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.000
realizes just what the hell he let happen.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.840
Walks away as Stampler taunts him from his cell

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.580
