00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.880
A posthumous message from the previous M&nbsp;
leads MI6 agent James Bond to carry out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.680
an unauthorised mission in Mexico City on the&nbsp;
Day of the Dead, where he stops a terrorist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.280
bombing plot. Bond kills Marco Sciarra,&nbsp;
the terrorist leader, and takes his ring,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.840
which is emblazoned with a stylised octopus&nbsp;
before stealing a helicopter to escape.&nbsp;

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.280
Upon his return to London, Bond is suspended from&nbsp;
field duty by Gareth Mallory, the current M, who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.520
is engaged in a power struggle with Max Denbigh&nbsp;
(whom Bond dubs "C"), the Director-General of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.560
new, privately backed Joint Intelligence Service&nbsp;
formed by the merger of MI5 and MI6. C campaigns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.600
for Britain to join the global surveillance&nbsp;
and intelligence initiative "Nine Eyes", and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.440
uses his influence to close down the '00' field&nbsp;
agent section, which he believes is outdated.&nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.160
Bond disobeys M's orders and travels to Rome to&nbsp;
attend Sciarra's funeral. He saves and seduces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.920
Sciarra's widow, Lucia, who tells him Sciarra&nbsp;
belonged to an organisation of businessmen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.120
with criminal and terrorist connections. Bond&nbsp;
uses Sciarra's ring to infiltrate a meeting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.720
to select Sciarra's replacement, where he&nbsp;
identifies the leader, Franz Oberhauser.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.240
After hearing Oberhauser give the order for the&nbsp;
"Pale King" to be assassinated, Bond is pursued&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.680
across the city in his Aston Martin DB10 by the&nbsp;
organisation's assassin, Mr. Hinx. Eve Moneypenny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.080
informs Bond that the Pale King is Mr. White, a&nbsp;
former member of the organisation's subsidiary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.600
Quantum who had fallen afoul of Oberhauser.&nbsp;
Bond asks her to investigate Oberhauser,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.480
who was presumed dead 20 years earlier.
Bond locates Mr. White in Austria,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.600
where he is dying of thallium poisoning. He&nbsp;
tells Bond to find and protect his daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.760
psychiatrist Dr. Madeleine Swann, who will take&nbsp;
him to L'Américain in order to locate Oberhauser;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.680
Mr. White then commits suicide. Bond confronts&nbsp;
Swann and rescues her from Hinx and his forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.000
The pair meet Q, who links Oberhauser to Bond's&nbsp;
previous missions, identifying Le Chiffre, Dominic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.560
Greene and Raoul Silva as agents of the same&nbsp;
organisation, which Swann identifies as SPECTRE.&nbsp;

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.400
Swann takes Bond to L'Américain, a hotel in&nbsp;
Tangier, and they discover that Mr. White left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.360
evidence directing them to Oberhauser's base&nbsp;
at a crater in the Sahara. Taking a train to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.680
remote station, Bond and Swann encounter Hinx, who&nbsp;
gets ejected from the train in the ensuing fight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.480
and later they are escorted to Oberhauser's&nbsp;
base. Oberhauser reveals that SPECTRE has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.520
funded the Joint Intelligence Service while&nbsp;
staging terrorist attacks around the world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.200
creating a need for the Nine Eyes programme.&nbsp;
In return, C will give SPECTRE unlimited access&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.720
to intelligence gathered by Nine Eyes, allowing&nbsp;
them to anticipate and counteract investigations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.920
into their operations. Bond is tortured as&nbsp;
Oberhauser discusses their shared history:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.600
after Bond was orphaned, Oberhauser's father,&nbsp;
Hannes, became his temporary guardian. Jealous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.800
of his father's affection for Bond, Oberhauser&nbsp;
killed his father, staged his own death,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.720
adopted the name Ernst Stavro Blofeld and&nbsp;
went on to form SPECTRE and target his foster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.000
brother Bond; he reveals that he is ultimately&nbsp;
responsible for several tragedies in Bond's life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.240
such as the deaths of M and Vesper Lynd. Bond and&nbsp;
Swann stun Blofeld by setting off an explosive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.440
wristwatch in his face, and the two escape to&nbsp;
London to prevent Nine Eyes from going online.&nbsp;

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:49.840
In London, Bond and Swann meet M, Q, Bill Tanner&nbsp;
and Moneypenny with the intention of arresting C.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.360
Swann and Bond are separately abducted by SPECTRE&nbsp;
operatives, while the rest of the group proceed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.880
with the plan. After Q succeeds in preventing&nbsp;
Nine Eyes from going online, a struggle between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.200
M and C ends with C falling to his death. Bond&nbsp;
is taken to the ruins of the old MI6 building,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.880
scheduled for demolition after Silva's bombing.&nbsp;
Blofeld—still alive, but now scarred over his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.320
right eye—tells Bond that he must escape before&nbsp;
explosives are detonated in three minutes' time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.800
or die trying to save Swann. Bond finds Swann and&nbsp;
they escape by boat as the building collapses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.200
Bond shoots down Blofeld's helicopter,&nbsp;
which crashes onto Westminster Bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.640
Blofeld survives and manages to&nbsp;
crawl away from the wreckage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.160
only for Bond to confront him at gunpoint.&nbsp;
Blofeld dares Bond to kill him, but Bond refuses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.000
and instead leaves him to be arrested by M; he&nbsp;
reunites with Swann and the two leave the bridge.&nbsp;

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.680
The next morning, Bond collects the repaired Aston&nbsp;
Martin DB5 from Q and drives away with Swann.
