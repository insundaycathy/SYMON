00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.600
It's a zombie apocalypse.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.920
You're stuck in your
apartment with no way out

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.840
and the WiFi doesn't work.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.280
Do you think you're gonna survive?

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.400
Because I don't.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.560
In this video, I'll be
breaking down the mistakes

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.960
made in "#Alive," because
there is no way anyone

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.120
should have survived
this zombie apocalypse.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.840
(soft music)

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.560
Joon-woo wakes up

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.240
to find his family is out of the home.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.000
So he does what he always does

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.400
live streams and plays
games with his friends.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.880
Except they tell him to
get off and watch the news

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.640
because everywhere in Korea,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.400
people are attacking each other

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.960
and a state of emergency
has been declared.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.240
Okay first things first,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.840
this guy is obviously a gamer.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.160
So he might have some in-game
knowledge about surviving.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.960
Gamers may be cowardly in real life

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.000
but their gamer instincts

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.840
could go a long way in an outbreak.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.240
Already Joon-woo can see
right outside his window

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.000
how people are freaking out.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.640
Waves of people are running
out of their apartments

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.040
and already we're seeing signs of zombies.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.520
People biting each
other, leaping, running.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.280
This is all happening pretty quickly.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.080
In this specific case,
don't join the crowd.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.800
Stay behind, let them
draw as many zombies out

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.320
from your area as possible,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.920
giving you the chance to live.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.840
An opportunity later to escape

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.760
with less zombies on the loose.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.560
Also there's no time for
hugs in the apocalypse.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.920
Why do people do this?

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.520
Maybe she didn't know she would turn

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.920
but even still, run dammit!

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.680
Joon-woo decides to take
a peek outside of his door

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.160
and his next door
neighbor comes rushing in.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.800
No warning, he's just
suddenly inside the apartment

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.360
and he's begging Joon-woo to let him stay.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.200
He's brother got bit, he escaped

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.040
and Joon-woo is having none of this.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.840
He's telling this guy
to get out and go away.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.120
But he let's his neighbor stay

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.960
long enough to use the bathroom.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.480
As the guy is there though

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.920
Joon-woo hears on the news

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.240
the symptoms of zombification.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.560
Bleeding from the eyes, becoming violent,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.560
and wanting to eat people.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.160
It gets Joon-woo's thinking

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.080
and he immediately grabs a knife.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.000
As the neighbor comes out of the bathroom,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.880
Joon-woo spots a bite mark on his hand

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.800
and forces him out at knife point,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.280
but the man stops as he reaches the door.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.360
He begins to turn.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.880
Look, it doesn't take a genius

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.480
to figure out bite equals bad.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.480
So when a guy wants to stay in your house

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.800
which you obviously should never do.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.520
At the very least make
him take his clothes off

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.520
and prove he has no bites on him.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.120
Not gay if it saves your life.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.760
I mean the guy's got blood on his shirt.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.760
You might have better chances of survival

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.640
but if he won't show you,
you gotta go for the knife.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.040
Violently jerking and cracking,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.960
the new zombie rushes at Joon-woo

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.720
who gets him to like a bear hug

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.640
and pushes him out of the house.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.960
Where another zombie
beats the crap out of him.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.400
That night, Joon-woo blocks

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.760
the front door with a fridge

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.880
and tries to make a call,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.800
but he can't connect to anyone.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.440
A news report in TV suggests survivors

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.920
make sure they have
enough food for 60 days

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.320
and Joon-woo starts to
tally up what he has,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.360
though it doesn't look like

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.520
he has enough for even 10 days.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.440
Beer will tide you over for a little while

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.800
and nobody will be delivering

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.400
your favorite barbecue chicken.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.760
Once you lock down your house

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.920
the first thing to do is
ration what you have left

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.360
for as long as you can.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.480
Then devise a strategy for
getting more food safely.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.400
If you have any fruit, keep the seeds

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.000
and plant them in flowerpots.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.280
Water will soon be gone,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.680
so I'd fill all my containers and tubs

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.200
with tap water to drink.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.600
This buys me time for a
more long-term solution,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.120
or at least until it rains.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.600
Begin cardio endurance
training immediately.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.000
Gamers are not world-renowned
for their fitness.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.840
Social media is great, but
here it gets you killed.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.240
The next day he gets inspired
to check out Instagram

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.160
where people are posting,
calling for help,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.520
and telling others where they are

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.840
as calls still aren't connecting.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.880
It's time to use your tech for
survival and not for likes.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.840
The guy figures out that

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.440
by attaching his phone to a drone,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.520
he could fly it high
enough to get service.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.000
He gets a signal and it actually works.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.120
The call goes through until
he runs out of batteries.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.040
Charge your batteries first, come on man.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.840
Scouting the area is the only way to know

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.920
when and how to get out of your flat.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.200
You'll be able to use this

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.720
to observe your neighbors houses,

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.040
to pick your best future scavenging sites.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.440
It's not inconceivable
to rappel yourself down

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.800
or climb out to balconies,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.120
if you know there aren't
immediate threat inside.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.480
That night a police woman

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.680
runs through his neighborhood,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.680
drops her gun and gets bitten.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.800
Even as Joon-woo tries
to distract the zombies

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.040
he can do nothing but
watch as they take her.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.040
A dropped gun on the streets

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.880
might be enough to lure some outside

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.640
but it's a terrible idea.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.560
You have no idea how many bullets are left

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.400
so it could leave you dead.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.000
Also screaming at your windows

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.600
will piss off your neighbors,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.760
especially the ones with anger problems.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.000
How the hell did this guy even get inside?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.400
This big one somehow lumbers its way in

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.120
and it's only by hanging
from his balcony railing

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.640
does Joon-woo trick the zombie

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.240
into falling to it's death.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.840
Clever, but risky.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.280
I would have gone for the knife.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.480
There's no way to know the zombie

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.080
would have flown out the balcony

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.680
without some movie magic.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.880
It could easily have been you

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.960
lying there with your head bashed in.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.040
The best solution here is the face off,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.320
fight it, and aim for the head.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.960
He fills in the door
to make it more secure

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.040
and starts the first in a series of vlogs

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.720
recording his experiences.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.720
It's day seven, and Joon-woo learns

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.200
that the zombies infect
others through the blood

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.640
and that they keep some of their memories

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.720
like opening doors or windows.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.080
He's also desperate,

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.080
the water in his unit no longer works

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.320
and he's downing bottles
of whiskey and beer

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.920
like his liver can afford it.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.240
While some might think
this is irresponsible

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.320
we should acknowledge the stress involved.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.760
As far as solutions go,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.760
whiskey is among the best out there.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.400
We're not just staying alive,
we're trying to survive.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.560
That means a little fun can go a long way.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.360
Still this desperation
doesn't stop Joon-woo

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.120
from taking some safety precautions

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.280
by covering and taping his windows up.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.880
This might seem like a good idea

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.720
but you're taking away your ability

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.000
to observe your environment
and the zombies themselves.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.760
I would be conducting experiments

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.080
to learn more about them,
what they respond to.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.200
Are they out at night?

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.240
What are their habits?

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.880
Anything I can think of
to gain the upper hand.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.320
In a zombie apocalypse

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.280
ignorance is not bliss, it's death.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.520
On day 10, he finds
that there's a phone app

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.520
that could let him call using FM waves

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.760
but he needs a specific audio Jack

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.360
which she doesn't have.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.400
On day 15, Joon-woo gets a
voice message from his dad

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.120
but he still can get a
signal to listen to it.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.040
He hang off the balcony to get reception,

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.720
grab the attention of the zombies

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.400
who start crowding down below him.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.000
It's like dinner and a show.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.600
This gives me a great idea.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.240
Find the most indestructible
object in your house

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.920
and as much string as you can find.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.680
Shoelaces, knotted bedsheets

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.120
throw to the zombies below

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.000
aiming to crush their
heads and reel it back up.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.600
You can take them out one by one

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.040
until you've cleared as many zombies

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.160
from the area as possible.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.280
Nevermind, this is better

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.360
let's just wing this whole survivor thing.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.760
Looks like gamer strategy
flew out the window.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.320
He leaves this apartment
and when he cuts a corner

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.880
he sees his zombified
neighbor crawling around.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.120
Why does he keep shouting?

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.640
Adrenaline is good for killing

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.360
but don't use it to draw
more attention to yourself

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.040
especially if you're using it

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.800
to trash talk a zombie.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.480
And then more zombies show up

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.440
closing in on him from
both sides of the complex.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.640
He goes through the elevator

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.800
but a whole crowd of zombies fall out.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.320
Also elevators very bad idea.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.400
I hate waiting for them in normal time

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.880
during the zombie
apocalypse, I can't even.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.160
He sneaks his way back up

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.920
and runs into this blind zombie

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.640
who Joon-woo is very careful not to alert,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.880
and then slammed the door shut.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.680
Attracting the zombie,

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.840
who tries to jiggle the
handle to open the door.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.240
This zombie is impressive.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.920
No eyes, but tries the door handle.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.800
He must be the freaking

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.480
Albert Einstein of zombies or something.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.080
On day 20 the power plants
in the city blow up.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.720
Everywhere buildings
are losing electricity

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.680
and Joon-woo decides to finally give up.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.040
He tries to go out like
Epstein by hanging himself,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.080
but as he's choking someone
shines a laser on him.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.520
He wriggles out of his noose

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.160
and sees directly across
from his building,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.680
who is pointing the laser.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.720
This chick is Yoo-bin,
who is honestly a bad-ass.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.200
She's very well-prepared
to survive with supplies,

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.200
a good sense to ration what she has,

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.840
and she's even set up a
trap in front of her door

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.520
in case something comes in.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.760
She has also been scouting
the various floors

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.800
in Joon-woo's apartment

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.560
spotting which ones are full zombies,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.600
and which ones aren't.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.800
They tell each other their names

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.640
and Joon-woo seems to
think she's pretty cute.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.320
A note on the dating scene

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.720
during the zombie
apocalypse, there isn't one

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.960
but when cute girls start
paying attention to you,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.800
it's best to keep things professional.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.160
Emotions cloud your judgment.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.040
So intimate relationships
are not recommended

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.520
but if you are this bad at surviving

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.960
that's all the hope you've got.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.800
She sees that Joon-woo is starving,

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.640
so she tries tossing over a rope

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.560
which absolutely fails.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.400
This rope falls to the streets

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.760
but Joon-woo uses his
drone to fly over a cord,

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.960
and now they're able to send food

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.760
and goods to each other
from apartment to apartment.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.040
The thing is, Yoo-bin

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.800
has sort of screwed herself over

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.880
because that rope that she tried to throw

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.280
gets spotted by a firefighter zombie.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.080
Which in any other zombie
apocalypse is no problem

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.280
but zombies here retain
some of their memories.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.040
Now this rope is connected to a table

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.320
and because it's being pulled,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.640
it violently knocks out Yoo-bin.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.640
A climbing zombie is definitely a first

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.560
but it's not the time to be impressed.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.040
Your future ex-girlfriend
is in serious trouble

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.640
and now's the time to figure out

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.800
how to ruin everything fast.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.080
Joon-woo does everything he can

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.680
to distract the firefighter.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.040
Shouting, throwing bottles

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.320
and he ends up using his drone

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.160
which the firefighter breaks.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.520
The drone is great thinking.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.520
It perfectly combines what you're good at

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.320
and what you can use

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.800
to immediately influence a situation.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.720
But I would have gone one step further

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.240
and attached a knife to the drone.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.160
It might not be fast enough to stab it

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.400
but it would give your new
friend a fighting chance

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.920
if she didn't have a weapon.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.920
It's by sheer luck that
Yoo-bin gets up in time

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.840
to cut off the firefighters hand

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.760
sending it plummeting to the ground.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.960
Joon-woo decides to gear up

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.040
and go scavenging for
food and other things.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.960
Breaking into his next
door neighbor's house,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.200
which is filled with food, walkie-talkies,

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.840
mountaineering gear and
of course a dead body.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.080
Joon-woo checks to see who the body is

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.120
and it's a random woman, which is weird

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.520
since his neighbor's brother was infected.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.200
So where's he?

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.800
As soon as Joon-woo finds this out

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.800
the zombified brother attacks him,

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.040
and it's only thanks to
some quick thinking and luck

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.320
that Joon-woo gets out.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.680
Sharing a walkie-talkie
and Nutella with Yoo-bin.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.440
The next day they notice that the zombies

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.080
are suddenly running through
both apartment complexes.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.040
They don't know why.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.960
As Yoo-bin goes to grab her hatchet

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.760
she accidentally knocks over a table.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.360
The whole conga line of zombies

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.760
make their way to a room
but they get distracted

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.680
as Joon-woo calls the landline

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.440
of the unit next to Yoo-bin's.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.880
The ringing of the neighbor's phone,

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.560
drawing away the zombie horde.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.080
Calling your neighbor's phone is smart

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.560
but it's life or death riding on one idea.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.800
Herds are a problem you
can't solve in the moment.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.440
Your only option is to
hide and draw no attention

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.400
but they can be avoided

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.400
with some organization and planning.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.640
The best advantage is
that you are in a building

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.080
with sealable entrances.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.680
If you could start by clearing your floor

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.960
and work with reliable neighbors,

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.160
to clear the building slowly,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.160
it's a realistic way to
take back the building

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.520
and barricade the main entrances.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.440
But if it's just too daunting a task

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.360
it's still worthwhile
to create sound traps,

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.120
to distract zombies away from you.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.640
Pots and pans work well for this.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.840
Lower them to the floor below

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.600
attached to a string and pull it

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.280
when a distraction is required.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.960
They both decide that
now is the only chance

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.960
to get to the eighth floor and gear up.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.440
Joon-woo tries to coordinate
and come up with a plan

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.840
but Yoo-bin pulls a mission impossible.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.680
Sliding down a rope from her balcony

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.080
and making a mad dash
to Joon-woo's apartment

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.080
and she does an amazing job by the way.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.440
She's bobbing and weaving,

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.040
beating the crap out of any zombie

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.240
with her climbing acts.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.160
But her ankle gets caught by a zombie

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.680
and she barely grabs the pistol

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.960
that's been left out here,

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.800
as Joon-woo comes down to help her.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.000
Jumping into a parking lot
of zombies is a terrible idea

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.400
but if you must, don't try to kill them.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.360
All survival now depends on
invasion, to move forward

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.280
and out of the growing cluster of zombies

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.960
where you can easily be trapped,

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.800
if spent hacking away at one.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.080
Football players would do
well, golfers would not.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.560
The two survivors run back
into Joon-woo's building

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.880
and take the elevator to the eighth floor.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.280
The zombies stampede into the lobby.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.680
Upstairs, the doors of
the apartments are locked

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.880
and a whole mob of the
undead finds the two humans.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.080
The two of them desperately

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.280
try to unlock the apartments

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.640
and are saved by this man

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.160
who drags them inside his unit.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.720
He shares with them food and water

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.520
and tells them supposedly
there are teams of soldiers

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.360
flying around the city to rescue people,

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.600
and there should be one
arriving sometime soon.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.880
Great news for everyone

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.200
if they're actually going
to make it out alive.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.360
Yoo-bin and Joon-woo do
everything right here.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.880
They wait until the guy drinks the water

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.080
to see if it's dangerous

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.160
and then they asked for canned goods,

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.240
which would have signs
of being tampered with.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.960
Honestly, I don't think
I'd do anything differently

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.520
but how exactly did the
guy poisoned the food?

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.840
This guy not only didn't
have a lease in this unit

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.480
but he drugs and zip ties
Joon-woo and Yoo-bin,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.720
as he intends to feed them to his wife.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.160
No, she's not a cannibal

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.080
she's a zombified freak on a leash,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.000
who the man locks in a nursery room.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.240
There is no way she's getting out of here

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.920
but Joon-woo is able to wake up

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.600
and threaten the man with the gun.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.600
He tries again to let Yoo-bin out

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.000
but the man instead let's go to the leash

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.320
letting his zombified wife attack Yoo-bin

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.960
who's screams go totally silent.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.320
The kidnapper unlocks the door

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.440
to find out what happened,

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.480
only to find his wife

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.320
being pushed out the door by Yoo-bin.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.360
The zombie immediately
latching onto her husband,

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.320
biting and nibbling him
as he apologizes to her

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.200
but not the two people he
just tried to kill, classy.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.520
Yoo-bin uses one bullet

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.440
to take out both of them
and alerts the horde.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.000
Shooting a gun in a zombie
apocalypse is dangerous

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.600
but if you had to use the gun,

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.760
it would have been smarter
to just shoot the guy.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.840
We're obviously not gonna
convince him to stop

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.000
if there's more than one
bullet left in the gun

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.080
shoot the lock off and
forget about the key.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.360
Every second is precious

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.880
if you're trying to save your girlfriend

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.960
from imminent face munch by zombie.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.320
She begs Joon-woo to take her out

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.080
and he agrees just about ready

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.760
to blow her mind with his piece,

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.640
when he hears what
sounds like helicopters.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.040
Immediately the two survivors

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.360
rush to the rooftop, tearing past zombies

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.800
and trying to slow down the mob

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.080
but by the time they get up
there, no one is waiting.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.680
Now they're well and truly dead

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.920
as zombies break through
the door and bum-rush them.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.960
There was no escape

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.120
and the gun just ran out of amour.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.720
There is no way out,

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.920
except as you probably
figured out by now, there is.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.920
A helicopter of armed soldiers

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.440
shows up out of nowhere,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.960
taking the two survivors on board,

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.520
where Joon-woo begins to
receive a signal on his phone

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.920
and finds out his family are still alive.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.400
Joon-woo is just one of
many Koreans who were saved

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.000
as everywhere throughout the city,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.920
survivors are posting to social media

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.840
about where they are and in turn,

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.840
soldiers are coming to rescue them.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.760
And here I thought
social media was useless.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.920
Who knew that it could save your life,

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.880
but what do you think?

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.200
Do you agree with my
theories or do you disagree?

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.040
Let me know with a comment down below.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.040
With that said thank you
so much for watching.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.320
