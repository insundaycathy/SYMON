00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.200
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to explain&nbsp;
a drama and sci-fi film called "The Beyond."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.960
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.
In London, Gillian, a senior member of Space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.120
Agency, the biggest astronomical institute in the&nbsp;
world, is having an interview about her life and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.560
work. Her daughter joins the interview,&nbsp;
and she tells the interviewer how proud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.480
she is of her mother. Gillian suddenly gets a&nbsp;
phone call from the agency, and the interview&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.240
is cut short as she needs to rush to work.
Footage from the International Space Station&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.440
is then shown. The recording is from one of the&nbsp;
astronauts, Jim Marcell. He heads out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.200
station for a spacewalk and repairs equipment&nbsp;
outside of the station. They suddenly start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.440
hearing interference in the radio transmission,&nbsp;
and Jim reports seeing strange lights. Other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.040
astronauts see it but indicate that there are no&nbsp;
expected astronomical anomalies that could explain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.160
what they’re seeing. The lights intensify, and the&nbsp;
station starts vibrating. Jim tries to hurry back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.040
inside, but Jim’s transmission suddenly cuts off.
Back on Earth, Gillian explains the recorded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.400
footage and says that satellites worldwide&nbsp;
experienced the same thing at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.920
Unfortunately, Jim was never&nbsp;
found and is presumed dead.&nbsp;

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.200
Charles, the chief of mission control, mourns his&nbsp;
dear friend's passing. A team is now analyzing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.040
footage from the space station frame by frame&nbsp;
to figure out what happened to Jim. They still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.080
have no clue what the strange anomaly is.
Alex, the head of exploration missions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.760
talks about the anomaly, saying that it has&nbsp;
appeared several decades ago but disappeared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.560
before they could get more information.&nbsp;
Jessica, a cosmologist, is brought in due to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.280
her expertise in gravitational waves. They found&nbsp;
that anomaly emits a form of gravitational wave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.400
something that shouldn’t be possible.
The scientists have given the anomaly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.320
the nickname “The Void.” Alex explains that the&nbsp;
void is similar in appearance to the remnants of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.960
the supernova, but due to its proximity to Earth,&nbsp;
they know it’s not an exploded star. They’ve also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.080
detected a short-burst radio wave transmitted&nbsp;
at a specific 1,420 megahertz frequency.&nbsp;

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.400
An astrophysicist from the University of&nbsp;
Astrophysics, Jakob, tells a story about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.160
radio astronomers who discovered the signal.&nbsp;
It was detected years ago and was dubbed the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.400
“Wow signal.” Astronomers have been trying to&nbsp;
locate the source of the signal ever since.&nbsp;

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.400
Curious to learn more about the void, the&nbsp;
scientists send reconnaissance probes into it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.400
In the control room, the scientists watch as&nbsp;
a probe slowly makes its way into the void.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.480
As the probe enters the void, it loses its&nbsp;
signal. Fortunately, they’ve prepared for this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.840
and Charles reveals that the probe was&nbsp;
transmitting real-time footage into high-speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.920
servers on Earth. They managed to capture a&nbsp;
short glimpse of what’s on the other side.&nbsp;

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.320
At a meeting, Gillian presents the images from the&nbsp;
probe. They observe matter entering and exiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.320
the void, which leads them to conclude that the&nbsp;
void could be a wormhole. What they need to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.920
now is what’s on the other side of the void.
By sending more probes into the void,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.280
they get better images and discover another&nbsp;
planet on the other side of the void.&nbsp;

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.560
Jessica theorizes that the void could be&nbsp;
a sort of first contact with intelligent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.240
life from the other side, and Alex expresses&nbsp;
his concern saying humanity neither has the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.720
capacity nor the resources to investigate further.
The scientists then debate about their next move.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.440
Gillian wants to send astronauts into the void,&nbsp;
but Charles strongly objects, saying they can’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.840
risk more people. Gillian acknowledges this but&nbsp;
says they can’t keep sending more probes as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.000
probes can’t give them enough information, and&nbsp;
they lose all communication with probes sent in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.440
She stresses the need to be in contact&nbsp;
with something that crosses into the void.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.680
Alex agrees, saying the void could be the most&nbsp;
significant discovery in humanity’s history.&nbsp;

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.600
They eventually agree on initiating a full&nbsp;
mission into the void. Gillian says the mere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.040
existence of a potentially habitable planet&nbsp;
on the other side is too important to dismiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.040
Professor Jakob is highly pessimistic&nbsp;
about the mission and thinks it will fail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.040
He argues that the human body cannot endure the&nbsp;
stresses of traveling through a wormhole. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.840
recommends using more probes or robotics instead.
After a while, the void suddenly starts emitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.200
a strange dark smoke that clumps together into&nbsp;
thousands of spheres in the skies around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.160
world. Panic surges through the masses, and even&nbsp;
the Space Agency has no clue what to make of it.&nbsp;

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.600
Over the past few weeks, Gillian and her team&nbsp;
have found that the void had been emitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.080
invisible waves around the same time the dark&nbsp;
orbs formed. These waves have grown exponentially,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.000
and simulations suggest that the void&nbsp;
would soon manifest a massive cosmic storm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.160
They believe that when the storm reaches Earth,&nbsp;
it will bathe the planet in a massive cosmic wave.&nbsp;

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.240
Near a forest, armed personnel set up a&nbsp;
base underneath the dark orb. While all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.400
this is happening, the space agency cooperates&nbsp;
with the U.S. military to create a humanoid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.440
powered by an astronaut's preserved brains.
Alice, a synthetic engineer, explains the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.920
Human 2.0 project. A prosthetic with the&nbsp;
same organic makeup as a human will act as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.160
a vessel for the astronauts' consciousness. In&nbsp;
the lab, Alice opens up a robotic human’s head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.440
compartment that will house the brain. She&nbsp;
explains the material inside the suit has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.600
millions of tiny neuro-fibers that will allow the&nbsp;
brain to move the body. She compares the empty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.760
humanoid to a computer without a hard drive.
For the following days, Gillian and her team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.760
interview candidates for the mission. They're&nbsp;
informed that the transfer to Human 2.0 is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.760
permanent. Jessica is asked if she'd be&nbsp;
willing to participate, but she declines,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.960
thinking her capabilities are inefficient and&nbsp;
saying she doesn't have the guts to do so.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.560
Space Agency then gathers candidates&nbsp;
and has them undergo physical,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.840
mental, and emotional exams to determine&nbsp;
if they're fit for the mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.440
Only the best of the best will be chosen&nbsp;
to act as ambassadors for the human race.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.720
Dr. Kuresh Patel explains the science behind the&nbsp;
transfer. The suit will allow humans to live much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.280
longer. However, there are still limitations&nbsp;
as the mind can deteriorate over time. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.880
brain will be connected to an artificial spinal&nbsp;
cord that will allow mind and body connection.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.000
One of the two candidates is Carl Roberts, who&nbsp;
shows exemplary cognitive abilities. Carl is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.640
disabled, unable to walk, but he’s excited as&nbsp;
he'll soon have a perfectly working body again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.120
Alex likes Carl; he commends his passion and&nbsp;
evident desire to take the next step for humanity.&nbsp;

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.200
In the transplant facility, Carl’s face is&nbsp;
scanned. This will be used to make an exact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.760
copy of his face that will be put on the&nbsp;
Human. 2.0. The suit itself is made from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.600
military-grade graphene woven together to&nbsp;
create an impenetrable and flexible shell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.520
The eyes use nano-based optics that’ll allow&nbsp;
perfect sight for any lighting conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.640
A breathing mechanism is integrated&nbsp;
for heat regulation, also acting as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.960
a familiar feature for the host. Lastly, a&nbsp;
tailored compound is injected into the suit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.840
which will provide the brain resources&nbsp;
it needs to function and maintain itself.&nbsp;

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.480
The spacecraft that will carry Carl has been&nbsp;
modified to be as light and fast as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.560
All the technology needed to keep a human&nbsp;
alive is removed from the ship as Human 2.0 is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.640
self-sustaining. Sockets will then be connected&nbsp;
to the humanoids, monitoring their conditions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.800
and feeding information to the brain.
Alex focuses on alien interaction. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.080
has manufactured a hard drive containing all&nbsp;
there is to know about Earth in hopes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.520
when they contact the alien lifeforms,&nbsp;
they can communicate and befriend them.&nbsp;

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.080
Back in the transplant facility, Dr. Kuresh,&nbsp;
and his team prepare Carl for the procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.120
The entire process will take about three&nbsp;
days, and he'll have to be injected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.200
with a cocktail of anesthetics throughout.
In his final interview, Carl reminisces about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.280
his past. He becomes emotional when he talks&nbsp;
about the most important person in his life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.440
his father. He dedicates his sacrifice&nbsp;
for him, and he drifts off to sleep.&nbsp;

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.800
The search to find meaning behind the&nbsp;
dark sphere’s existence continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.880
The space agency prohibits any violence toward the&nbsp;
orbs, not until they find out how it's connected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.120
to the void. There are hundreds of spheres&nbsp;
worldwide, with more appearing each day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.120
The findings show that the spheres are oddly in a&nbsp;
formation as if they're preparing for something.&nbsp;

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.720
Three days after the start of the transplant,&nbsp;
Dr. Kuresh breaks the unfortunate news of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.840
Carl’s death. Carl’s brain couldn’t fuse with the&nbsp;
artificial spinal cord. His biological makeup was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.000
not compatible with the organic material in the&nbsp;
suit. Everyone is in dismay with the outcome,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.480
but the search for another candidate continues.
To prevent another loss, Alice configures Human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.560
2.0. She plans to introduce organic&nbsp;
cells from the candidate and inject it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.240
into the material inside the suit beforehand,&nbsp;
increasing the chance of a connection to form.&nbsp;

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.560
Meanwhile, Alex suggests sending robot soldiers&nbsp;
to the void as their time is running out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.760
However, Gillian doesn't want alien&nbsp;
lifeforms to view humans as a threat.&nbsp;

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.360
Scientists figure out that the employees&nbsp;
in the agency have undergone thorough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.280
health-related tests for their safety from the&nbsp;
dangerous materials present in the facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.880
With this, they find three candidates with a&nbsp;
precise biological makeup that’s compatible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.240
with Human 2.0. One of the three is Jessica.
The next day, Jessica visits Gillian to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.840
about her doubts. She agrees that her knowledge&nbsp;
will be helpful in the mission's success,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.840
but the permanent transfer to a robot body&nbsp;
frightens her. Gillian assures that her family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.080
will be taken care of if she doesn’t make it.
After careful consideration, Jessica finds the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.400
courage to accept the responsibility. Alex tries&nbsp;
to change her mind, saying there are still two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.200
other possible candidates. However, Jessica is&nbsp;
sure that she’s the most qualified out of them.&nbsp;

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.800
During his interview, Alex voiced his concern&nbsp;
about Jessica’s inability to lead such a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.880
critical mission. Gillian counters his opinion,&nbsp;
saying that Jessica's thirst for knowledge and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.560
ability to look further than what the eye can&nbsp;
see makes her more than competent to lead.&nbsp;

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.760
Days after the transfer procedure. Jessica awakens&nbsp;
as a new woman. Her brain accepts the vessel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.680
marking their first success. Gillian and&nbsp;
her colleagues observe Jessica; her face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.800
exudes happiness as her friend is now reborn.
Jessica survived but is far from stable. She still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.640
hasn't grown accustomed to her new environment,&nbsp;
finding difficulty talking and performing basic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.720
motor skills. Alice reassures her that the team&nbsp;
is working on fixing her speech and that she'll be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.600
fully operational soon enough. Jessica can finally&nbsp;
speak; she feels the same and, at the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.360
different. Her entire consciousness and&nbsp;
identity transferred successfully, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.680
final obstacle is her physical rehabilitation.
The day of the launch arrives, and a robot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.640
soldier accompanies Jessica on the spacecraft. The&nbsp;
rocket lifts off, leaving Earth’s atmosphere. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.040
link between mission control and Jessica has been&nbsp;
established, and they get access to what she sees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.520
The spacecraft enters the void. Jessica&nbsp;
describes her surroundings on the transmission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.760
Jessica describes the void as beautiful, but&nbsp;
as they get near, the pressure gets stronger.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.440
Her readings suddenly go off the charts,&nbsp;
and the void starts distorting everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.920
Jessica’s ship enters the void, and mission&nbsp;
control loses signal. Jessica is on her own,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.920
and the only thing everyone can do now is to pray.
Gillian hopes that they’ll return within a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.840
year. However, she also prepares for the&nbsp;
possibility of them not returning at all.&nbsp;

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.320
A week after the launch, Jessica’s craft&nbsp;
reappears, and radars detect it falling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.880
into the Atlantic Ocean. No one predicted them&nbsp;
to return in such a short period. In the ship,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.480
they found Jessica alone, with no signs&nbsp;
of the robot soldier's whereabouts.&nbsp;

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.240
Mixed opinions circulate within the space&nbsp;
agency. Gillian believes the mission is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.080
success while Alex deems it to be a failure.&nbsp;
He further states that this could be a warning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.640
from the aliens. Meanwhile, Jessica is in an&nbsp;
unconscious state while being quarantined.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.800
They have no idea when or if she'll wake up.
With the technology embedded in the suit, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.800
find out that several years' worth of memories are&nbsp;
recorded in Jessica's brain despite her being gone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.400
for only five days. The team processes the data,&nbsp;
translating Jessica’s memory into video. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.720
they have difficulty producing a clear feed.
The situation regarding the dark orbs escalates,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.280
and the military grows restless. They start firing&nbsp;
at the sphere, but the spheres are unaffected,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.000
seemingly absorbing everything&nbsp;
the military is throwing at it.&nbsp;

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.160
Jessica wakes up suddenly, but only for a moment&nbsp;
as the process of collecting memories delays her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.640
recovery. Gillian desperately wants answers, so&nbsp;
she asks the unstable but awake Jessica about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.200
events in the void. She tells them that the robot&nbsp;
soldier disappeared from the craft in an instant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.120
He eerily floated away as if something had&nbsp;
abducted him. Then a flash of light exploded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.080
from his arm. The ship then crashed into a planet.&nbsp;
She traveled the surface, touching the rocks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.560
the dirt, and the flowers. She encountered dark&nbsp;
smoke just like the one in Earth's skies. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.800
then got transported into a white room, and the&nbsp;
shadow took a different form and approached her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.120
Jessica saw Jim Marcell, and Jim kept saying&nbsp;
to her that everything was going to be okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.880
Cryptic messages were transferred to her&nbsp;
mind, and that's all Jessica remembers.&nbsp;

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.800
Gillian and the space agency cannot believe&nbsp;
the information presented to them. If what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.440
Jessica says is true, then the alien lifeforms&nbsp;
may be peaceful. Alex remains pessimistic and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.280
doubts the credibility of Jessica's statements,&nbsp;
saying that with the alien's advanced technology,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.520
they could've easily altered her memories.
Later, timelapse footage shows several celestial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.080
bodies disintegrating. White smoke appears to&nbsp;
envelop them before the celestial bodies crumble.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.640
The International Space Station informs the Space&nbsp;
Agency of incoming fragments crashing into Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.080
The dark orbs start moving,&nbsp;
enveloping the planet in a dark mist.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.720
It functions as a protective dome that intercepts&nbsp;
the falling debris. At the agency, they celebrate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.120
as they watch the smoke protect the planet.
Gillian and Alex realize how wrong they were.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.440
The fear of the unknown blinded&nbsp;
them as the entity they thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.440
was a threat turned out to be their savior.
Jessica finally recovers to a stable state,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.800
allowing for her memories to be displayed&nbsp;
clearly. The shadows told her that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.080
saved them because they saw the hard drive&nbsp;
about humanity that Jessica brought with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.920
The shadows deemed humans worthy of being&nbsp;
saved despite their impurities. They then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.080
left and said that they’d return at another time.
Jessica says that everything that’s been happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.080
is all part of a cycle created by the aliens&nbsp;
to purify the universe and keep it stable.&nbsp;

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.800
On another day, Jim Marcell is detected in the&nbsp;
Arizona desert. Military helicopters rescue and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.800
bring him to the space agency. They tried to&nbsp;
ask him about his experience on the other side,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.080
but he has no recollection of it.
The void and the smoke disappear,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.760
but the agency starts noticing strange&nbsp;
occurrences above the Earth’s atmosphere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.160
Remnants of the void form a swirling cloud of gas&nbsp;
and dust that flourishes into a planet. This new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.760
planet renders the laws of physics and science&nbsp;
obsolete as this was thought to be impossible.&nbsp;

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.560
The planet is deemed habitable. Not only that,&nbsp;
Alex describes it as being custom-built for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.360
humans. They refer to the planet as Earth-Two.
After Earth's struggle to develop a plan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.600
they finally send numerous humanoids to colonize&nbsp;
the new planet. The void has given humanity a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.280
second chance in the form of a new planet.&nbsp;
Everyone hopes that this can act as a lesson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.040
for humanity to do better and ultimately&nbsp;
prove that their existence is worth saving.&nbsp;

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.640
12 months after the void’s disappearance,&nbsp;
Gillian narrates that she feels as if the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.800
void hasn’t left and that the aliens must still&nbsp;
be observing them. Space Agency has sent out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.000
the first manned expedition to Earth-Two,&nbsp;
hoping that the first generation would help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.120
prepare the planet for the next generation of&nbsp;
humans that would call Earth-Two their home.
