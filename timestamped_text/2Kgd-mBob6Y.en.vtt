00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm guessing that he's now at this
 

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.670 align:start position:0%
so i'm guessing that he's now at this
location<00:12:44.240><c> he</c><00:12:44.399><c> did</c><00:12:44.560><c> mention</c><00:12:44.959><c> it</c><00:12:45.040><c> in</c><00:12:45.200><c> episode</c>

three to sam and bucky
 

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.790 align:start position:0%
three to sam and bucky
so<00:12:47.279><c> that</c><00:12:47.360><c> would</c><00:12:47.519><c> give</c><00:12:47.760><c> him</c><00:12:47.920><c> a</c><00:12:48.000><c> clue</c><00:12:48.480><c> that</c><00:12:48.720><c> he</c>

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
so that would give him a clue that he
 

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.269 align:start position:0%
so that would give him a clue that he
was<00:12:49.040><c> there</c><00:12:49.760><c> carly</c><00:12:50.000><c> reaches</c><00:12:50.399><c> out</c><00:12:50.480><c> to</c><00:12:50.639><c> sarah</c>

which includes threatening her
 

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.870 align:start position:0%
which includes threatening her
that<00:12:54.959><c> we</c><00:12:55.120><c> do</c><00:12:55.360><c> see</c><00:12:55.519><c> her</c><00:12:55.760><c> struggling</c><00:12:56.160><c> with</c><00:12:56.639><c> sam</c>

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
that we do see her struggling with sam
 

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.310 align:start position:0%
that we do see her struggling with sam
and<00:12:57.040><c> bucky</c><00:12:57.279><c> then</c><00:12:57.440><c> meet</c><00:12:57.600><c> up</c><00:12:57.760><c> with</c><00:12:57.839><c> her</c>

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
and she asks them to join forces but
 

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.150 align:start position:0%
and she asks them to join forces but
they<00:13:01.360><c> turn</c><00:13:01.600><c> it</c><00:13:01.760><c> down</c>

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
they turn it down
 

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.910 align:start position:0%
they turn it down
and<00:13:02.240><c> thus</c><00:13:02.560><c> this</c><00:13:02.800><c> sets</c><00:13:03.040><c> them</c><00:13:03.279><c> on</c><00:13:03.440><c> a</c><00:13:03.519><c> collision</c>
