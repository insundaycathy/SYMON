00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.120
Welcome to Slash Forward. In this episode, we’re&nbsp;
going to try real hard to cover the events that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.960
unfold in Wes Craven’s 1991 film The People Under&nbsp;
the Stairs. The effort comes from the fact that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.080
I estimate approximately 5.8 billion individual&nbsp;
events take place over the course of these 102&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.320
minutes. Imagine wanting to avoid an eviction&nbsp;
from your home while also being financially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.640
incapable of getting your mother treatment for her&nbsp;
cancer. After reaching the end of your rope, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.880
finding yourself willing to do anything, you’re&nbsp;
offered the chance to improve your situation from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.160
thin-slicing a single bean for dinner to Scrooge&nbsp;
McDuck-style swimming in piles of money because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.120
you’re so flush with cash. All you have to do&nbsp;
is commit a simple burglary - happens every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.880
Sounds like a great deal, but what if you&nbsp;
inadvertently stumble upon a sealed off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.320
house of horrors owned by a couple of freaks who&nbsp;
give off strong sibling-spouse vibes? I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.600
as a 13-year old, I’d imagine it&nbsp;
would be pretty unnerving for you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.600
but you’d be in there with frickin Ving&nbsp;
Rhames! So, I don’t know, how do you think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.240
you would stack up against Gimp Daddy? Leave a&nbsp;
comment to let me know and, as always, feel free&nbsp;&nbsp;

it supposedly helps out a lot. Let’s get to it.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.000
We open on a voiceover of a tarot reading, and&nbsp;
things are really not looking that good. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.600
then transition to the recipient of the reading,&nbsp;
Poindexter aka Fool, attempting to relieve himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.720
of his ignorance and wishing he could do more to&nbsp;
help his sick mother. Not to pile on too much,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.520
but he’s then surprised to find a man in&nbsp;
the house - Leroy, his sister Ruby’s friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.920
who then sits him down to inform him that they’re&nbsp;
scheduled for an eviction tomorrow. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.080
they’re three days late on rent and the owners&nbsp;
are looking for any pretense they can use to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.920
bounce them from the property so they can&nbsp;
tear it down. Leroy loves to help but,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.800
since nothing in life comes easy, he offers&nbsp;
Fool the chance to earn the money he needs.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.600
We get a little more context around this after&nbsp;
transitioning to the landlord and lady - Daddy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.480
enjoying his supper of meat and bone, and his&nbsp;
trad-wife Mother, who confirms through commentary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.640
that they are looking to build some higher-rent&nbsp;
condominiums on their various properties.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.960
The next morning, as Fool returns to his home&nbsp;
in the scummiest slum building on the block,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.720
it becomes apparent why Leroy insists&nbsp;
to Ruby that bringing her young brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.520
under his employ is his best prospect for making&nbsp;
that cheddar, which is what the kids call money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.920
He drives this home by sneeringly remarking&nbsp;
not only that their mother’s cancer is easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.560
treatable for anyone who has the funds, but that&nbsp;
the target of his larcenous desires happens to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.640
the shitbag landlords who own the building.&nbsp;
You see, he happened upon a piece of mail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.000
at the liquor store they own that had the&nbsp;
landlord’s home address, and the letter’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.800
contents expressed an interest in purchasing&nbsp;
the recipient's collection of golden coins.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.120
Back at the freakhouse Mother dresses Alice,&nbsp;
her slave daughter, and does her best to teach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.240
some manners. She seems to pass the exam, until&nbsp;
Mother notices a fork is missing. The nature of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.560
their relationship is elucidated when mommy&nbsp;
wonders if she’s gonna have to smack a hoe!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.360
But Alice gets an assist via the vent from a&nbsp;
strange hand. Alas, the danger has not been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.520
fully navigated as Daddy then comes home with a&nbsp;
tension headache from the stress of his liquor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.960
store being robbed. He seeks relief in the beating&nbsp;
of Alice while the wall occupant moans in anguish.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.440
Meanwhile, Leroy cases the joint from the outside&nbsp;
and sends Fool in to get some information about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.760
the interior. With no response up front, he&nbsp;
slides around to the side door. But only when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.000
he starts messing with the landscaping does&nbsp;
Mother emerge… in order to slap him with an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.960
instant rejection that she upholds even in the&nbsp;
face of the hard sell and bathroom request.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.600
He reports back that they have screens and&nbsp;
padlocks on all windows, but he has no info on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.240
inside, because he couldn’t get in. Unwilling to&nbsp;
do a job without an appropriate amount of intel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.120
Spencer decides to take a crack&nbsp;
at sweet-talking his way in.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.880
He suits up and approaches the house,&nbsp;
insisting that he has to check a meter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.120
inside that she doesn’t even know about,&nbsp;
and that as a gasman, he has a legal right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.640
to come in. This convinces her to acquiesce,&nbsp;
providing him the access he so richly desires.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.800
But while he’s putting in work, we learn that&nbsp;
Leroy is concerned that Spence may try to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.280
this opportunity to cut him out of the job.&nbsp;
This fear is reinforced when Mother leaves by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.400
herself shortly after, implying that Spencer is&nbsp;
inside the house completely alone. In a panic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.800
he pulls fully into the driveway to see if they&nbsp;
can scope out what’s going down. On the way in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.520
Fool has some doubts about committing his first&nbsp;
felony. But since he’s inside, he’s technically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.080
already done it, so what difference does it&nbsp;
make now? Inside they find locks everywhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:27.760
and heavy doors. However, with just a little&nbsp;
effort and the appropriate angle Gross.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.080
They are immediately attacked by a dog, and it&nbsp;
won’t stop no matter how much Fool begs it. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.640
do manage to give the good boy the slip, and&nbsp;
lock themselves inside for safety. As they get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.600
their bearings, a noise from upstairs draws their&nbsp;
attention. It’s a very tense situation, which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.160
obvious from their acting. So Leroy forges ahead&nbsp;
on his own while Fool waits in the living room.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.400
However, a curious noise draws Fool to the&nbsp;
basement door. He peers through and sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.600
Spencer’s clipboard. So, he unlocks&nbsp;
the door and goes down the stairs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.800
but only until he hears another strange noise&nbsp;
but, apparently, he kind of is, because he lets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.120
the threat of being deemed a chickenshit -&nbsp;
which he imposes upon himself - compel him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.520
to head back into the basement. He takes a look&nbsp;
around and mostly finds old building supplies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.440
and sporting goods, but then he finds a tube&nbsp;
TV that’s still working. When a dust plume&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.520
threatens to aggravate his allergies, he turns&nbsp;
to leave and trips over Spencer’s dead body.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.720
He recognizes that Spencer is gripping a gold&nbsp;
coin in his cold, dead hand right before something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.200
drags him toward the wall. Fool pulls him back,&nbsp;
only to discover that his hand has been munched&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.360
upon. Then it dawns on him that the TV was&nbsp;
there for the entertainment benefit of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.440
people under the stairs, which is not a metaphor.&nbsp;
The mysterious moaner then jumps out to introduce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.000
himself and Fool makes for the door. He is&nbsp;
released by Alice, who disappears into the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.560
Before Fool can pursue her, Mother and Father&nbsp;
return so he runs upstairs to warn Leroy.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.120
When he finds him, he’s laying in the hallway,&nbsp;
ass to the wind. Turns out, he’s listening very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.080
carefully to a strange sound wafting through the&nbsp;
ducts. Fool warns him of the owners’ return and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.120
Spencer’s apparent death by fear, so they run down&nbsp;
double quick to confirm they’re still barricaded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.760
in before trying for the front door, which they&nbsp;
find to be humorously electrified. As Prince&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.800
works on busting his way in, Leroy convinces Fool&nbsp;
to stand out as bait so he can beat off the dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.040
But, when he arrives, they learn that Prince&nbsp;
doesn’t like the tender meat, and when Leroy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.360
prairie dogs to see what’s happening he gets&nbsp;
clamped down. Fool tries to tug him to safety,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.560
reaching the knob and letting the&nbsp;
electricity flow through their bodies.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.440
They rush back upstairs to hide,&nbsp;
and Leroy finds a good spot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.600
but just for him, and tells Fool to shove&nbsp;
off right before lockdown is initiated and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.760
Daddy begins to clear the upstairs. The&nbsp;
wall creeper pops out, startling Leroy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.040
into the hallway where he is shot many times,&nbsp;
satiating the psychopathic couple’s blood lust.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.560
Fool creeps out and watches as&nbsp;
they tap dance on ya boi’s corpse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.200
and when he returns to the hall he’s been gifted&nbsp;
sight and led toward safety. Behind the vent he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.920
essentially finds a whole second house with&nbsp;
a pathway out. When he emerges in an adjacent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.800
hallway he finds Alice standing meekly in&nbsp;
a bathroom they hopefully no longer use.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.440
After introductions Fool discovers she has no&nbsp;
knowledge of the outside world, because there’s no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.320
way out of the house. Despite the failure of many&nbsp;
others like him, he is determined to escape. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.320
further explains that the people under the stairs&nbsp;
were all prospective brothers who couldn’t live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.480
up to the standards set for them, so they were&nbsp;
mutilated and cast away. When the moaning starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.360
back up, she confirms that is Roach - a cellar&nbsp;
boy who escaped into the walls and is hunted by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.080
big Daddy...mostly when his moaning interrupts&nbsp;
gimp time, which he takes personal offense to.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.920
Daddy has to place a bookmark in his&nbsp;
progress, because police arrive at the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.680
Turns out the van in their driveway was&nbsp;
identified as possibly being related to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.040
recent liquor store robbery. Fool tries&nbsp;
to get their attention from upstairs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.600
but no sound escapes. Outside they claim the van&nbsp;
just happened to be there when they got home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.280
and they saw a couple of men walking down&nbsp;
the street. The officers go to scope out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.280
the rest of the neighborhood, leaving the&nbsp;
evidence behind and unsecured, so they help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.000
themselves. This reveals the likely presence&nbsp;
of a boy in the house who smells delicious.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.600
Inside, Prince has decided to settle&nbsp;
for what he can get and chases Fool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.840
into a room where he is repelled with a falcon&nbsp;
punch. Daddy then tries to blast his way in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.160
but gets his skull caved in. Then Roach pops&nbsp;
out and grabs Fool before dipping out. He’s led&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.600
through the back halls with Prince in hot&nbsp;
pursuit. They ultimately shake their tail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.000
by distracting him with a toy and sending him&nbsp;
down a chute that Roach had built in his free&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.240
time just in case. This ejects him right&nbsp;
out to where Mother and Daddy are located,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.320
and the homemade plushy indicates that the&nbsp;
filthy little boys have gotten to Alice.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.680
Sure enough, they do emerge in her room&nbsp;
where the new friends get to know each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.880
other through intense, sustained eye contact. This&nbsp;
is because Roach’s bad part was his smart mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.400
so they cut out his tongue, which is why&nbsp;
he can’t talk good. When the parents bust&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.360
in and see what these little wall rats have&nbsp;
been up to, Mother lays down a final verdict

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.720
Literally as they offer Fool a quarter to help&nbsp;
them tidy up the place. Then they toss his ass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.920
in as Mother supervises Alice as she cleans&nbsp;
up the blood while also losing her damn mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.240
When she’s finished, Alice is put to bed&nbsp;
and informed of their intent to kill Fool.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.200
Downstairs we find that Daddy likes it raw, but&nbsp;
is also incredibly wasteful. There’s still a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.080
of good meat on that torso. He then sends Fool&nbsp;
into the pen before leaving. But, in a twist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.160
the people under the stairs turn out to be&nbsp;
superstitious ghouls - retreating at the sight of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.200
Leroy’s apparent rebirth. Turns out it was just&nbsp;
Roach foolin’ on them to facilitate an escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.640
Once they are safely tucked away inside the&nbsp;
furnace - a strange sentence to utter - Fool sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.200
that Roach didn’t make it out of their altercation&nbsp;
unscathed, and also that he has some of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.840
golden coins. He gives them in exchange for Fool’s&nbsp;
promise to help get Alice out of here, and then he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:33.200
expires. Since it’s bad luck to break a promise to&nbsp;
a dead man, Fool begins clawing his way upstairs.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.600
Prince’s exasperated attempts to get at him&nbsp;
distracts Daddy long enough for Fool to pop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.280
out in Alice’s room and rupture his nutsack (bust&nbsp;
his nut) before scurrying back into the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.640
Daddy attempts to solve this problem&nbsp;
by using Roach to warm the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.160
sending a comforting smoke billowing&nbsp;
softly through the ductwork. This prompts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.320
the young escapees to bust out, which&nbsp;
has to be hell on the HVAC efficiency.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.080
Then they make their way through as quietly&nbsp;
as possible to try to avoid getting shot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.200
When they hear Prince coming again,&nbsp;
Fool decides it’s time to take a stand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.320
and gets into an unlikely wrestling match with a&nbsp;
dog that’s his own size. The noise allows Daddy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.040
to locate them and start probing the wall with his&nbsp;
bayonet, which eventually finds purchase...inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.920
Prince’s body, but since that tactic has never&nbsp;
worked before, he’s too overcome with excitement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.640
and dances a little jig for mama. But she insists&nbsp;
on seeing proof with her own eyes, and they lament&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.120
the results as the kids make it to the attic -&nbsp;
the one room in the house with an open window.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.480
Fool suggests jumping into the&nbsp;
koi pond below. Alice is hesitant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.600
however, and this results in them&nbsp;
getting split up when Daddy runs in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.480
forcing Fool’s hand and forgetting himself in&nbsp;
his zeal by firing off his gun in open air.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.560
Back at home Fool and Ruby get confirmation&nbsp;
that the gold is enough for both their rent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.840
and their mom’s operation - after&nbsp;
they trade them in for cash.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:51.600
Then the elder relays some spicy rumors&nbsp;
about Mother and Daddy brother and sister!?

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.440
After a bit, Fool takes a moment to make&nbsp;
proactive amends with his mother for what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.240
he must do next...step outside to a payphone&nbsp;
to call the police and report a case of abuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.400
But when the police arrive, everything is cleaned&nbsp;
up and there aren’t even any kids around. Plus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.960
the lovely owners are just so damn charming.&nbsp;
After the officers leave, the pair resets the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.200
house and goes to get ready for bed. Along the way&nbsp;
Mother expresses concern about the police leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.160
the back door open so long, risking someone&nbsp;
escaping. But not expecting an infiltration.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.680
Fool selects himself a nice, hefty&nbsp;
bludgeon and creeps upstairs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.920
inching toward the sound of evening prayers.&nbsp;
But they were goofin’ on him. Gimp Daddy jumps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.400
out and Fool gouges his eyes the way he likes&nbsp;
before blasting Mother’s uterus into her throat.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.800
They chase him downstairs where he made like&nbsp;
he got away, but his intent was never to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.040
Instead he ventures up through the chimney and&nbsp;
releases Alice from the inside. He arranges to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.920
meet her at the special window. Before leaving, he&nbsp;
informs Alice that she has no ties to her parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.320
as they are siblings who kidnapped her when she&nbsp;
was young. She reciprocates by informing Fool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.240
that the pond has been drained and there&nbsp;
are now bombs wired up all over the joint.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.280
Thinking quickly they head to the&nbsp;
roof and work to attract attention,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.520
using Daddy’s eagerness to harm them as an&nbsp;
opportunity to brick him in the face. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.400
the pair Donkey Kong’s Mother, herniating a disc&nbsp;
in her C6 on their way down to the basement. Fool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.800
tells Alice how to get out from here, and circles&nbsp;
back to take care of some unfinished business.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.400
On her way out, Alice is confronted.&nbsp;
Empowered by the truth she finds her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.960
voice and sass-talks her mother. Convinced&nbsp;
the boys have despoiled their little girl,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.160
Daddy is given the green light to&nbsp;
kill them all. As the search begins,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.800
they hear someone riling the basement boys. When&nbsp;
he goes to check it out, he gets drawn down upon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.120
but manages to hit the stairslide and turn the&nbsp;
tables. Mother is distracted by a knock at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.400
door, which she answers to find Ruby there to do&nbsp;
an activism...but they’re really busy right now.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.320
Now Daddy’s really going to do it, for real&nbsp;
this time - until the Morlocks blind him with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.240
their flashlights. Then there’s another knock at&nbsp;
the door from someone claiming to be the police,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.880
responding to reports of gunfire. But it’s&nbsp;
those dang activists again and this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.040
they brought the whole community. Regardless,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.920
Mother prepares to bust but is thwarted&nbsp;
when Alice drops in and smashes her face.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.320
Downstairs, through some careful maneuvering, the&nbsp;
cast offs use Fool to unlock the coop and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.640
drag him in to provide unexpected protection.&nbsp;
While Daddy tends to another head injury,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.280
Fool bridges the alarm on the embalming machine&nbsp;
to open its door and access the riches inside.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.360
Upstairs they get all separated again so Alice&nbsp;
can have a showdown with Mother, and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:16.000
really work through some stuff. Unfortunately,&nbsp;
their closure is thwarted when the folks under&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.320
the stairs become the folks at approximately stair&nbsp;
level. In her panic, Mother rounds a corner and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.120
runs right into Alice’s knife. She then becomes&nbsp;
a victim to her own desire to help these wayward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.200
young men. They toss her into the basement and&nbsp;
when Daddy sees that they’re not in the pen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.920
he becomes concerned about his stash. He goes to&nbsp;
check the vault where Fool engages in a standoff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.680
daring him to make a move. When&nbsp;
he does, he blows him...sky high.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.280
The money erupts out into the night air,&nbsp;
gently floating down to the people as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:47.200
ghouls wander off into an unknown world, in what&nbsp;
could be viewed as a sort of mutant Rumshpringa.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.720
I have a lot of history with People Under&nbsp;
the Stairs, and also a lot of thoughts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.320
sort through. My first experience with&nbsp;
this movie occurred during a sleepover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.160
with a friend when I was a young lad. His&nbsp;
older sister and her friends had rented&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.680
one of the Faces of Death films along with&nbsp;
this one. I remember hearing all kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.360
crazy crap coming in from the other room,&nbsp;
and it left a lasting impression about how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.200
creepy and twisted this movie was despite&nbsp;
the fact that I didn’t actually see it.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.200
When I did see it for the first time as an adult,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.040
I was somewhat put off by the cornier&nbsp;
elements of the movie. It was not at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.600
all what I expected. It was truly anchored by a&nbsp;
creeptastic performance from Mother and Daddy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.760
but then had a bunch of peripheral elements that&nbsp;
just didn’t match up with the tone, I thought.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.000
Having watched it again, I think I have more of&nbsp;
an appreciation for the film, and also a better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.760
understanding of where I think it went wrong.&nbsp;
There was something about the overall combination&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.920
of elements that diluted the final effect. I&nbsp;
think the film, overall, would have worked well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.160
if it was creepy and humorous or cheesy while&nbsp;
allowing the overall theme and structure of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.880
story to imply the overarching message they were&nbsp;
trying to achieve. Coming out and directly saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:50.080
it weakens its impact and also adds a separate&nbsp;
layer that just doesn’t work, because the cheesy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.880
activism clashes with the self-aware cheesiness&nbsp;
of the slapstick portions, if that makes sense.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.120
Overall it felt like there was something here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.120
but it was presented with a degree of naivety&nbsp;
that you don’t expect from Wes Craven, the master&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.360
of horror. If it had more of a Last House&nbsp;
on the Left or The Hills Have Eyes vibe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.200
I think it would have worked much better. It seems&nbsp;
like most of my complaints fall under a single,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.920
broader category, which is that this project&nbsp;
overall comes across as unpolished. I’m going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.920
to give some examples here, but also want to&nbsp;
go into detail about one part in particular.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.000
So, here are some examples of parts that didn’t&nbsp;
seem to fit well in terms of how everything was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.640
laid out - the music works really well in some&nbsp;
areas, but is really grating and out-of-character&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:33.360
in others. The end credits song also really&nbsp;
anchors this movie to a particular time period,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.560
dating it unnecessarily. The idea that Spencer was&nbsp;
scared to death? Why? Leroy laying on the floor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.160
and ignoring Fool calling out to him, because&nbsp;
he was too focused on listening to the vent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.720
was just weird. The ending back and forth also&nbsp;
strains suspension of disbelief. There were too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.560
many pieces set up that had to be addressed to&nbsp;
get the characters into position. For instance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.480
there was an entire crowd of people outside,&nbsp;
but doing nothing to help. They also made a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.800
point of showing how Ruby ends up outside and&nbsp;
cut off so they can get Alice alone with Mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.320
but this completely glosses over the fact&nbsp;
that Grandpa Booker had been there as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:08.840
but then disappeared. There was also some strange,&nbsp;
but funny ADR included throughout the movie .

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.560
Some of these elements point to something I’ve&nbsp;
brought up before around directors creating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.960
believable scenarios in their movies by actually&nbsp;
working through it in real time without direction,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.800
to verify if it’s plausible. I’ll illustrate&nbsp;
what I mean through the nut-buster scene.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.160
We have established that the antagonists are&nbsp;
at the point where they just want to kill.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.160
In this scene, Daddy is in Alice’s room all&nbsp;
worked up and violent. In a final attempt to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.240
help get them out of there, Fool pops out of&nbsp;
the vent to physically confront Daddy. A child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.200
runs across a room to confront a grown man who&nbsp;
is intent on harming him, and is able to freely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:44.000
unload on his gonads without repercussion before&nbsp;
retreating to the other side of the room. He then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.720
pauses here as Daddy lunges for him, but lamely&nbsp;
side steps, resulting in Daddy face planting into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.200
the wall and basically taking himself out. All of&nbsp;
this scripted nonsense could have been avoided by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.800
taking the time to set up the scenario and&nbsp;
let the actors play through it naturally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.760
to see if it made sense. This is especially&nbsp;
important when you have kids taking on adults.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.480
Another quick example is from&nbsp;
the ending sequence in Halloween:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.320
Resurrection where the protagonist is&nbsp;
stuck in a burning shed with Michael Myers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.760
She would love nothing more than to get away, oh&nbsp;
but she has some cords and an audio mixer on her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.080
Nothing about this looks believable. Have&nbsp;
the actress try to get up, if she can do so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.800
easily, you need to make some changes to your set&nbsp;
piece. If, like so many things in life, you want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:28.000
her escape and rescue to rely on the presence of&nbsp;
a bo-staff wielding Busta Rhymes, then make it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.880
really seem like she can’t get up unless Busta is&nbsp;
there to explode Michael’s sac with a live wire.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.720
This lack of preparation along with the other&nbsp;
points of sloppiness I mentioned before are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.960
what I mean by the film feeling unpolished. If&nbsp;
you’re not careful, things like this can take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.600
your audience out of the moment, remove any sense&nbsp;
of danger and also possibly diminish the presence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:50.320
of your antagonist. Just to clarify, I don't&nbsp;
think this necessarily makes the movie bad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.560
or that this is a bad movie. And there’s&nbsp;
a good chance the things I pointed out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.640
imbue the movie with a nostalgic charm for&nbsp;
people who saw it when it first came out.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:13.840
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;
my donors, memorialized in the hall of headshots.
