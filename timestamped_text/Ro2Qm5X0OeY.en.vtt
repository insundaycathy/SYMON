00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.650
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.390
Today, I'm going to explain a horror and thriller
film called “Eden Lake."

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.670
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.670
Watch out and take care.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.519
&nbsp;
A nursery school teacher named Jenny Greengrass

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.929
works at the local daycare and is fond of
kids.

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.130
She has a boyfriend named Steve Taylor.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.560
While waiting for her to end class, he looks
at the ring he plans to propose to her inside

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.560
his car.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.480
They excitedly plan on having a trip to the
countryside, where Steve plans to have a romantic

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.480
proposal.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.550
The drive is long, and the sun even sets before
they could arrive.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.579
Steve is unsure of the way, making him rely
on the G.P.S.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.050
Before arriving at a pub, they notice that
the locals do not practice proper road etiquette

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.289
and are rude.&nbsp;

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:40.420
&nbsp;
The following day, they arrive at Eden Lake,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.600
a gated community in the middle of the woods.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.780
The place used to be a public park before
real estate took over.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.480
Deeper into the woods, Steve and Jenny finally
see a majestic view overlooking the whole

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.480
town.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.119
They grab their bags to find a spot where
they could chill.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:58.429
A young and timid boy named Adam gathers insects,
and Jenny approaches him to say hello.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.729
However, the boy is reluctant to talk to them
because they are strangers, so they continue

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.059
to look for the lake.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.469
The couple arrives at a serene lake, where
they plan on having a good time.

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:08.909
They bask in the sun while cuddling with each
other.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.079
Not long after, two boys arrive to drive Adam
away, who is also by the lake.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.380
Jenny feels sorry for Adam after being bullied
by his peers, given that she is also a teacher.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.439
She closes her eyes to take a nap while basking
in the sun when a Rottweiler barks at her.

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.619
Jenny gets frightened by the sight of the
big and unfriendly dog, which is at a dangerous

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:25.960
distance from her.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.240
Their relaxation is disrupted because of the
delinquent teenagers that have overtaken their

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.579
peaceful spot.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.460
When Steve goes for a dip, the dog barks at
Jenny once again, so he confronts the teenagers

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.460
about it.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.649
He asks the group to turn their music down,
but they refuse to do so.

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.729
Instead, their leader, Brett, disrespectfully
claps words back.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:52.810
Other members are Cooper, Reece, Ricky, Harry,
and Paige.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.060
Steve stubbornly decides that he would stay
put, enduring their loud music and obnoxious

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.420
dog, than be "bullied" by them into leaving.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.020
One of them even checks Jenny out using binoculars,
so she covers herself out of being uncomfortable.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.920
Before the unruly teenagers leave, Brett flashes
his private parts.&nbsp;

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.289
&nbsp;
Steve sets up the tent while Jenny gathers

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.090
wood for their overnight stay.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.709
She hears rustling noises from a distance
but disregards them.

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.180
The couple enjoys their time in the campfire
that night, but Jenny still notices the sound

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.590
coming from the woods.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.290
She lets Steve know about it, but he assures
her that it’s nothing to be concerned about.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.680
While having an intimate moment together,
the noises still bother Jenny, so Steve goes

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.150
outside to look.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.819
After some time, he stops answering Jenny's
calls which makes her a bit scared, but Steve

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.409
just plays a prank on her.

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.610
In the morning, they realize that insects
have infested their food, and they have no

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.180
choice but to grab food someplace else.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.989
Upon leaving, Steve runs over an empty bottle
that the teenagers left behind, but he manages

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.080
to fix the tire, and they now set off for
town.&nbsp;

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.830
&nbsp;
When they arrive, the teenagers pass in front

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.830
of them on their bikes.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.019
A bit annoyed, Steve loses his cool, so he
tries to follow them but is unable to keep

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.019
up.

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.810
They visit the diner where Steve asks the
waitress about the group of kids, but she

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.180
only laughs at them.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.800
He asks if she knows the parents of the kids
by any chance, but she gets strangely defensive

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.500
and says, “not my kids."

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.160
After their breakfast, Steve spots several
bicycles outside a house and thinks it belongs

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.439
to the teenagers.

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.240
Curiously, he stops the car, and Jenny pleads
with him not to make the situation worse as

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.530
it is not worth it.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.150
However, he is determined to teach the kids
a lesson.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.680
The house is open, so he enters uninvited
to check if anyone is home.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.590
In a matter of minutes, the owner arrives,
who also happens to be Brett’s father.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.860
He gets into a foul mood after calling for
his son, thinking that he is inside the room.&nbsp;

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.110
Steve manages to narrowly escape through the
window before the owner sees him.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.900
He hurries to the car, and Jenny drives back
to the lake after the thrilling incident.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.390
They swim together in the lake, and Steve
decides to go scuba diving while Jenny sleeps

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.519
on the shore.

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.000
When he gets back, finding the perfect time
to propose to Jenny, they realize that their

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.300
bag containing their phone, wallet, and car
keys is missing.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.090
They hurriedly run to the car and find out
that it's gone.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.200
Without any choice, the couple decides to
walk to town on foot.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.250
Steve becomes more agitated as they walk farther,
with a growing desire for revenge.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.750
They avoid collision with their car as the
group drives it recklessly in the woods.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.119
Brett stops for a brief second, only to smirk
at the couple.&nbsp;

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:02.720
&nbsp;
At night, they see the group by a campfire

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.910
unsupervised by any adults.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.159
Steve approaches to demand the return of their
belongings, but they deny having any idea

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.480
of their whereabouts.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.720
In a timely manner, Steve hears his ringtone,
which is the moment he loses his cool.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.780
He attacks Brett, but the other knife-wielding
members bring him down.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.250
During the brawl, Brett’s dog gets mortally
knifed.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.949
Brett throws the keys while grieving the death
of his dog.

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.850
Jenny grabs the keys, and they run to the
car.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.260
The group decides to run after them and throw
rocks at the car, which stops because of a

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.260
slope.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.170
The group approaches the vehicle to attack
the couple; they break the lights and the

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.500
windows, but Steve manages to drive away.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.670
The darkness and the unclear driveway cause
the car to crash into a pile of woods.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.620
Steve gets trapped because of a branch; Jenny
tries to help him but is unable to move it.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.720
Jenny is forced to run for help because of
Steve’s injuries and entrapment.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.320
She hides upon hearing the group and spends
the night there.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.130
Meanwhile, Brett tracks down Steve and forces
himself inside the car by breaking the window.&nbsp;

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.310
&nbsp;
At daybreak, Jenny sees Steve’s shoes, suspecting

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.780
that he is in danger.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.890
She is highly concerned about her boyfriend.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.700
She follows the tracks and finds him tied
with barbed wire, all bloody and injured.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.660
She panics as help is far away, and the signal
is terrible.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.780
Brett and his friends are responsible for
torturing her boyfriend.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.800
Steve begs the kids to let him go, but Brett
is insistent on getting revenge for his dog.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.920
Harry attempts to calm Brett and encourage
him to let Steve go, but he only receives

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.450
a sermon from their leader.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.040
Brett commands to put some cuts on Steve as
Paige documents the torturous moment.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.860
The group takes turns inflicting harm on Steve,
causing more wounds on him.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.110
Jenny watches the whole incident and is helplessly
crying as she hides.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.090
She realizes that they are about to kill him,
so she uses the Bluetooth on her G.P.S to

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.460
connect with Steve's phone.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.520
She calls 9-1-1 to get help, but Brett notices
and gets under the impression that Jenny must

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.760
be close by.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.110
It allows Jenny to reveal herself and let
the group chase her while Steve has the chance

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.020
to free himself despite the pain.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.330
The teenagers ride their bikes through the
forest chasing her, but she manages to evade

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.720
them by using a log to make their bikes crash.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.460
She gets away and runs to Steve’s rescue
when she comes across a small mobile home.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.960
A radio phone lies inside the home, but it
is too out of her reach.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.290
She struggles to reach for it as the teenagers
get to the place as well.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.750
Without any present hiding place, Jenny manages
to climb to the roof and hide before one of

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.560
the members could get a hold of her.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.150
Ricky goes back to where they tied Steve and
is surprised to know that he had fled.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.790
He informs Brett, so the group is on the run
again, but this time, to look for Steve.&nbsp;

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.780
&nbsp;
As Steve opens the car door, the safety alarm

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.020
goes off, causing a noise loud enough for
everyone to hear.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.940
Alerted by the sound, the group finds out
that one of their targets is near the car.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.290
Jenny finally reunites with Steve after almost
being hit by him, thinking that she is one

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.500
of the members.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.700
She helps Steve run as far as they could,
but his wounds look fatal.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.910
They end up in a small cabin where she attempts
to nurse his injuries, but he is sure that

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.440
his wounds will be the end of him.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.730
While attending to Steve’s wounds, Jenny
finds an engagement ring.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.080
Meanwhile, the group tracks down the cabin,
and as they open it, they only see the first

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.630
aid kit with Steve’s blood all over the
place.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.720
Jenny manages to hide under the cabin, submerged
in water.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.400
She holds Steve, who is now in a very critical
condition, hearing the teenagers come up with

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.810
a plan to get them.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.840
After the group flees, she drags Steve’s
body on land, where she lays him down.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.030
Jenny dramatically says yes to his proposal
before running for help.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.610
She accidentally steps on a big spike—she
screams because of the extreme pain and catches

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.070
the group’s attention.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.260
She crawls to a hidden space to remove the
spike that is deep on her foot, but she has

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
no choice but to endure the pain.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.860
She lays down for a second to regain her strength
when she sees someone standing by.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.710
Adam finds her and decides to walk with her
to safety.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.310
Jenny tries to borrow Adam’s phone, but
he refuses to lend it to her despite her desperate

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.310
pleas.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.240
It reveals that Adam’s intention to help
is completely the opposite.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.650
He has texted the group of their whereabouts,
putting Jenny in great danger.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.020
One of the members knocks her unconscious.&nbsp;

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.790
&nbsp;
Jenny wakes up in horror, seeing herself tied

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.090
to a tree beside Steve’s lifeless body.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.280
They plan on burning them, but some of the
members are hesitant about doing so.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.950
Jenny’s fears are coming closer, leaving
her without any course of action.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.760
Brett forces Adam to light a match and throw
it onto the tree drenched in gasoline.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.300
According to Brett, Adam will be accepted
in the group when he lights them on fire.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.140
Tired of feeling left out and bullied, he
follows their condition.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.200
Steve’s body is burned first, while Paige
films it.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.870
In a sinister way, Brett gets giddy at the
sight of it and jumps in celebration.&nbsp;

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.570
Adam tries to flee the scene, but the members
get a hold of him at that instant.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.230
Because of the fire, the rope tied to Jenny
slowly burns—this gives her a perfect chance

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.230
to run away.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.210
Brett tries to get to her, but she holds a
torch against him.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.770
She pours over the gasoline and burns the
ground to stop Brett from running after her.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.830
Adam is used as bait for Jenny to come back,
but she ignores his cries for help.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:20.040
Upon running further, she witnesses Adam being
burned alive by Brett and his group.&nbsp;

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.540
&nbsp;
Jenny continuously finds her way out with

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.200
a trail map after breaking a glass that secures
it.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.430
As she hears the group come nearer, she hides
in a trash bin despite the disgusting smell.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.080
She endures the unpleasant scent for the sake
of survival.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.500
She sees two members outside, looking for
any signs of her, but they eventually go away.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.639
Jenny exits the bin and gets a piece of broken
glass for self-defense.

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:41.320
She sees Cooper from a mirror and stabs him
on the neck.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.690
As he bleeds to death, Jenny holds him, realizing
that Cooper was attempting to help her escape.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.149
Regret fills her mind; never in her life did
she think that she could harm anyone, much

00:08:49.149 --> 00:08:50.689
more a kid.

00:08:50.689 --> 00:08:52.459
&nbsp;
That night, the group finds Cooper’s lifeless

00:08:52.459 --> 00:08:55.210
body, which triggers them to seek vengeance
even more.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.759
The sight of it throws Brett into more rage,
as Harry cries beside Cooper and blames their

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:00.220
leader for everything.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.959
He begins to call someone on his phone, prompting
Brett to beat him despite his cries, and he

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:05.600
eventually dies brutally.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.110
Paige runs off, terrified by Brett's seemingly
uncontrollable behavior.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.990
Meanwhile, Jenny finally reaches the road,
where a car passes by.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.420
She stops in the middle and begs the driver
to let her in, so he does.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.240
Jenny finds out that the driver is actually
the brother of Ricky, who is one of the members.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.819
She panics and steals the van while he calls
for Ricky.

00:09:22.819 --> 00:09:26.720
In a fit of vengeful rage, she runs over Paige
intentionally without any remorse, causing

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.329
the teenage girl to die.

00:09:28.329 --> 00:09:31.980
To avoid collision with another car, she makes
a turn, and ends up crashing the van into

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.769
a fence at a backyard party, and collapses
after asking for help.&nbsp;

00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:37.420
&nbsp;
Jenny gains consciousness and sees middle-aged

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.010
strangers comforting her.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.060
She realizes that she is in Brett’s house
after seeing his childhood pictures on the

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.060
wall.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.029
Unfortunately, the people in the room are
also the parents of the members of the group

00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:47.879
who terrorized her and Steve.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:51.070
To escape from being around them, Jenny goes
to the bathroom after saying that she feels

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.070
sick.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.660
Meanwhile, a commotion is happening outside
after the parents recognize the van that Jenny

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.660
crashed.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.300
In case of anything bad, she gets a hold of
a razor, while Brett’s father forces her

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.319
to open the door.

00:10:01.319 --> 00:10:04.379
She just stands back, causing the parent to
kick the door open.

00:10:04.379 --> 00:10:07.220
She sees Brett outside the door before one
parent attacks her.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.189
The kids have convinced the parents that Jenny
and Steve are responsible for the death of

00:10:10.189 --> 00:10:11.649
some of the members.

00:10:11.649 --> 00:10:15.069
Jenny begs them to call the police, but they
all plan to make her pay for what happened.

00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:18.550
Brett’s father commands him to go upstairs
while they deal with Jenny, who is now fearful

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.870
for her life.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:23.100
Jenny realizes that the group’s parents
are just as psychotic and murderous as their

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.379
kids, and they protect them from prosecution.

00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:28.910
She gets dragged outside by the parents while
Brett closes his room to block her screams.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.170
He smirks at himself in the mirror before
putting on Steve’s sunglasses.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:36.070
He then continues to delete the footage from
Paige’s phone to hide any evidence.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.399
What was supposed to be a happy trip ended
up in a tragic event, as the two lovers never

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:40.959
even started their journey to marriage.&nbsp;
