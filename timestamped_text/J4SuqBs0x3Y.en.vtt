00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.920
in 1890s london igor worked as a clown for a&nbsp;
traveling circus due to his hunchback which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.680
makes him not be able to walk properly everyone&nbsp;
treats him poorly but igor is very smart and draws&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.200
beautifully detailed pictures of human anatomy in&nbsp;
his spare time a night a medical student victor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.040
frankenstein attends a circus performance while&nbsp;
performing in london an aerialist named lorelei&nbsp;&nbsp;

the circus and too good to be around these people&nbsp;
after sometimes victor comes to liberates igor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.800
the circus leader witnesses this and calls for&nbsp;
the most of the circus performers to chase them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.680
one dies in the process and they escape back at&nbsp;
his town home also laboratory victor deduces that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.280
the hunch on igor's back is a cyst he drains it&nbsp;
and puts igor in a harness to correct his posture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.200
igor can stand for the first time in his life&nbsp;
victor descends to his basement laboratory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.080

posters the men are wanted for murder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.840
turpin tells alastair he believes neither&nbsp;
igor nor victor killed the circus performer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.680
however over the past several months a mysterious&nbsp;
man matching victor's description has been buying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.600
and stealing animals parts all over london turpin&nbsp;
a devout man believes victor is up to something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.680

the authorities are looking for a hunchback clown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.720

by preserving the eyes in a conductive liquid and&nbsp;
attaching them to electric wires he can reanimate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.800

lungs victor takes him to a high society soiree&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.120
while victor is discussed with his friends igor&nbsp;
sees lorelei at first she does not recognize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.880
him but when she does she greets him warmly she&nbsp;
now masquerades as the mistress of a gay baron&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.880
victor interrupts their reunion&nbsp;
and behaves rudely towards lorelei&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.000
although he intrigues her by talking about the&nbsp;
reversal of death at the end of the night victor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.840
warns igor about becoming too close to lorelei&nbsp;

purchased from zoos thanks to igor's innovations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.400
victor now believes he can reanimate gordon by&nbsp;
charging him with electricity igor's confusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.000

and finnegan victor's snobbish wealthy classmate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.000
initially victor cannot resuscitate&nbsp;
gordon much to finnegan's sneering delight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.000
lorelei looks disgusted by the proceedings when&nbsp;
victor beats his equipment however the machinery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.960

and tries to attack lorelei he escapes the room so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.080
igor chases him through the building eventually&nbsp;
igor corners gordon in a hallway but turns around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.120
to attack igor and when the two topple over&nbsp;
the banister about to plummet to their deaths&nbsp;&nbsp;

townhouse he commends them for the experiments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.640
and commissions them to create another one but&nbsp;
this time victor wants to resurrect a human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.600
igor wants nothing to do with finnegan but victor&nbsp;

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.120
turpin and victor clash over god and religion&nbsp;
victor disdains turpan's christianity and part on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.440
very bad terms the next day igor meets lorelei for&nbsp;
a walk through she tells him how uneasy victor's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.440
experiments make her she believes victor goes too&nbsp;
far igor finds it difficult to chastise victor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.280
because he believes he owes everything he has&nbsp;
become to victor lorelei disagrees igor agrees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.800
he will speak to victor when he returns to the&nbsp;
townhouse he meets mr frankenstein victor's father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.800
him tell victor that now he has ruined his&nbsp;
own life as opposed to that of his brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:54.000
mr frankenstein's insults devastate victor and&nbsp;
igor decided not to voice his concerns instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.720
he snaps victor out of his melancholy by&nbsp;
pointing out that his sketches of prometheus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.720
the reanimated corpse are too small in order to&nbsp;
make a reanimated body that can sustain a charge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.640
they need to build a very large human victor's&nbsp;
enthusiasm returns he and igor believe that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.920
if they put two hearts and two sets of lungs&nbsp;
into prometheus and revive him via lightning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.520
they can reanimate him igor sees victor's pocket&nbsp;
watch and asks if it belonged to someone he loved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.760
victor and igor work feverishly on building&nbsp;
prometheus one night igor goes to a dance&nbsp;&nbsp;

sneaks inside and tells victor they need to run&nbsp;&nbsp;
