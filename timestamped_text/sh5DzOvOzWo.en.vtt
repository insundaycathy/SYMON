00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.720
Welcome to Slash Forward. Imagine, if you&nbsp;
will, that you lost some family members&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.920
due to a terrible tragedy, but that their remains&nbsp;
were never recovered. Through extensive searching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.280
at your own personal cost you not only locate&nbsp;
them, but find that despite being children alone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.000
in the woods, they are still alive. Do you think&nbsp;
you would have what it takes to nurture and raise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.960
them through their recovery and subsequent&nbsp;
development? If so, would you still feel as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.040
confident if they had taken on the mannerisms of&nbsp;
a feral ghost woman and forgone all social norms?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.480
Today we’re going to learn how to do just that&nbsp;
through the training vehicle that is the 2013 film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.800
Mama. It was produced by Guillermo&nbsp;
Del Toro, but actually directed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.400
Andy Muschietti whose story intertwines folklore&nbsp;
with a story grounded in reality. Do you think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.480
he lived up to Guillermo’s expectations? Let&nbsp;
me know what you thought in the comments below&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.800
and if you enjoy the video, hitting the like&nbsp;
button would help me out a lot. Let’s get to it.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.680
We open on radio exposition describing a&nbsp;
market crash pursuant to an office shooting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.560
at a holding company where one of the senior&nbsp;
partners, Jeff Desange, went missing. We then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.600
find Victoria and Lilly waiting patiently as&nbsp;
footsteps pound down the hall. Their father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.120
Jeff bursts in and rushes them out of the house,&nbsp;
sans mommy. They’re going nowhere in particular,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.440
but Jeff really wants to get there fast,&nbsp;
leading to an inevitable loss of control.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.560
Back at the house we find his brother Lucas and&nbsp;
the police a few steps behind in the confusion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.920
and the picture comes into resolution as the radio&nbsp;
now confirms that Jeff Desange was the shooter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.560
and that the target of his ire was his&nbsp;
estranged wife who is confirmed dead.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.960
Now fleeing on foot they find reprieve in&nbsp;
an abandoned cabin that was named after a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.160
font - oh, uh, partially abandoned. Jeff starts a&nbsp;
fire to help the girls settle into their new life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.040
in the country, and then goes to engage in his&nbsp;
midafternoon meltdown. This is interrupted when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.320
Victoria sees a woman outside who’s not on the&nbsp;
ground. He doesn’t hear this, however, because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.320
he’s consumed with exploring ways to assuage his&nbsp;
guilt. He settles on keeping the girls from harm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.600
by mortally harming them, but is diverted by a&nbsp;
dark entity. In the night, as they wait patiently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.800
and wonder how they will survive, they’re provided&nbsp;
a single cherry. That should tide them over.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.920
Flash forward five years to Lucas in his apartment&nbsp;
coordinating an ongoing search effort for his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.400
brother’s remains. When his girlfriend Annabel&nbsp;
comes out to join him, they discuss the fact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.680
that the hired searchers’ last paycheck bounced&nbsp;
because Lucas has spent all his money searching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.480
for dear Jeff. Not realizing, of course, that&nbsp;
he attempted to kill his own children. Luckily,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.960
since they’re already out there, he’s still&nbsp;
got the boys on the hook for now. Even more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.760
lucky - when Ron goes to take a leak, he&nbsp;
rolls a Yahtzee in the form of Jeff’s Benz.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.800
He and Burnsie head deeper into the wilderness&nbsp;
and find the abandoned cabin, entering cautiously.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.880
There is clear evidence inside of the presence of&nbsp;
children at some point, due to the wall drawings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.520
thousands of cherry pits and, of course,&nbsp;
the two feral children who confront them.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.640
The successful rescue is considered generally&nbsp;
good, except it really cramps Annabel’s rock and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.320
roll lifestyle. Regardless, she supports Lucas&nbsp;
as he visits Dr. Dreyfuss, who warns that while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.840
Victoria is showing signs of recovery, Lilly may&nbsp;
have been too young to be normalized for polite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.440
society. Lucas goes in delicately and finds the&nbsp;
girls to be very quick and agile, and he tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.960
win over Victoria with a new pair of specs like&nbsp;
a proper English lass. They form a bond as he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.560
is the spitting image of Jeff and, of course, she&nbsp;
doesn’t know that daddy had intended to kill her.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.120
Ninety days later Dr. Dreyfuss gives a positive&nbsp;
report as they’re making good progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.080
He explains that they survived by creating an&nbsp;
imaginary guardian they call mama who cared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.120
for them and fed them cherries. He recommends a&nbsp;
transplant into a loving home. But we also learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.760
this hearing is a debate with their maternal&nbsp;
aunt Jean vying for custody of the girls.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.480
Dr. Dreyfuss does wonder whether Lucas and&nbsp;
Annabel are serious enough about parenthood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.880
to convert to a sufficiently clean lifestyle&nbsp;
to care for the girls. But on the other hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.640
Jean lives on the other side of the country,&nbsp;
and the Dr. wants to keep the girls close so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.360
he can leach off that clout. Buuuut, if they&nbsp;
agree to stay in a house the uni keeps for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.480
research purposes and provide him unlimited&nbsp;
access, they can win his recommendation. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.560
soon they’re reassuring Jean that they&nbsp;
intend to honor her visitation rights.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.920
Dreyfuss starts right in with the&nbsp;
questioning. Victoria claims Mama&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.520
showed her in a dream how a woman&nbsp;
escaped from a psychiatric hospital,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.800
fleeing into the wilderness with&nbsp;
her baby before jumping off a cliff.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.800
After Annabel breaks up with her band,&nbsp;
putting her musical aspirations behind her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.840
they all converge on their new home.&nbsp;
Annabel seems eager to set some clear rules&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.240
oh, thanks. And then they go to the backyard,&nbsp;
which has been outfitted with some sweet boxes and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.200
a dachshund. Then they enjoy a simple dinner, each&nbsp;
in their own way, before turning in for the night.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.760
Soon thereafter Dr. Dreyfuss goes to research&nbsp;
some medical records and see if he can find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.680
evidence of a patient like the one&nbsp;
Victoria described. Luckily he runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.040
across a very helpful clerk who points him&nbsp;
to the 19th century case of Edith Brennan.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.800
Just so we all know the situation, we’re&nbsp;
brought back to the house where the girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.880
engage in some crafts and synchronized&nbsp;
humming. Then, when putting away laundry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.240
Annabel nearly walks in on a game of tug of&nbsp;
war that involves Lilly and not Victoria.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.520
Later on, during a jam sesh, there’s an electrical&nbsp;
disturbance accompanied by some strange noises.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.160
It may have just been Lilly acting like a little&nbsp;
freak, but Annabel is left shaking like a leaf.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.040
Although, it’s really nothing that a&nbsp;
little smoochin’ can’t cure, I’m sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.640
But a figure in the mirror takes her out&nbsp;
of the mood. Lucas goes to investigate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.400
but finds the girls fast asleep.&nbsp;
Insistent that she didn’t imagine it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.920
she sends him off to check downstairs. Along the&nbsp;
way he finds a strange, creeping fungus expanding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.120
across the wall. The inky darkness eventually&nbsp;
gives birth to a moth before something else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.560
instigates an involuntary moonsault over the top&nbsp;
rope into a bellybuster across the staircase.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.360
Despite taking a good bump, he winds up&nbsp;
in the ICU in a hopefully temporary coma.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.880
Then Dr. Dreyfuss casually strolls in to&nbsp;
nonchalantly make it seem like it would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.240
only natural for Annabel to&nbsp;
take over care of the girls.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.200
At home, again, we have no signs of entry or&nbsp;
theft, which means the police are powerless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.120
to do anything. So she settles into&nbsp;
bed and promptly has a nightmare.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.680
Lilly’s there, natch, but she’s snapped&nbsp;
awake by strange moanings in the dark.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.080
The next day we learn that the girls are coping&nbsp;
with this tragedy by talking to the walls and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.800
making elaborate crafts. Jogging a memory,&nbsp;
Dreyfuss goes back to his earlier tapes where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.920
there was a similar doll that the girls claimed&nbsp;
was made by mama. He also notes that Victoria has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.560
an unnerving way of looking past his shoulder&nbsp;
toward the ceiling. He then gets a voicemail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.040
from the friendly clerk at public records to&nbsp;
let him know that she made a new discovery.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.680
At the house, they’re all having a pretty chill&nbsp;
evening, even though Annabel gets suspicious that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.840
they’re goofin on her. Then everyone goes&nbsp;
to bed, but mama almost immediately comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.440
out of the closet for gametime. The girls&nbsp;
start up their synchronized humming again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.680
which wakes Annabel, and she is disturbed&nbsp;
when they’re joined by an unexpected bass.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.280
She whips the door open and shames the girls&nbsp;
for having a good time. Unable to shake the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.520
feeling that there was someone else with&nbsp;
them, she approaches the closet. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.520
when Victoria pleads with her not to&nbsp;
open it, she respects their privacy.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.160
She visits with the Dr. to discuss her&nbsp;
concern that someone is coming to visit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.120
them in the night. He plays some video of their&nbsp;
humming to confirm if it’s the same song. It is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.400
but she insists it was tuned to a much lower&nbsp;
register. This leads the Dr. to suggest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:44.160
dissociative personality disorder - he believes&nbsp;
Victoria is mama as a means of coping. Seeing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.920
Annabel is disturbed by this, he reassures her&nbsp;
that it’s a treatable condition and that she’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.640
safe. I mean, what can a nine year old with a&nbsp;
knife do to an adult while she’s sleeping anyway?

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.000
Later at the archives, the Dr.&nbsp;
is guided to another file she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.360
found regarding the Edith Brennan matter - it’s&nbsp;
box of physical remains, so that’s cool. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:11.200
she educates ya boi on the secrets of the&nbsp;
occult She is such a tremendous help here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.640
and she suggests there is some sort&nbsp;
of wrong that needs to be righted.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.400
Back with the girls, Lilly is still popping&nbsp;
out of boxes and making weird noises,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.800
and Annabel gets a whiff of mama. And then at&nbsp;
the hospital we are shocked to discover that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.040
despite her age, mama is a straight up&nbsp;
hacker. She helps Lucas by giving him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.000
a vision that directs him toward the cabin,&nbsp;
followed by a grand mal seizure. Hey, thanks!

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.560
The family visits now that Lucas is awake, and&nbsp;
they all share their longings of reuniting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.880
The visit is spent sharing pictures and&nbsp;
nibbling on nearby moths. But at home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.040
Victoria has become morose. She’s softening&nbsp;
toward Annabel and doesn’t want her to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.520
hurt due to mama’s jealous streak. Then Jean&nbsp;
arrives, because she gets the girls on Thursdays.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.320
Understanding that Annabel is not a natural mother&nbsp;
figure, she tries to leverage this by enticing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.760
her to let her have the girls for a few days so&nbsp;
she can go rock out and do some drugs. Instead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.960
Annabel runs her off, but only after ruling&nbsp;
her out as a suspect in the mystery of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.320
baritone hummer. Of course, Jean’s a bitch,&nbsp;
so she goes straight to her car to call CPS.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.720
Annabel tries to loop Lucas in on these events&nbsp;
so he’s in the know, and he lets slip that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.560
girls are the most important thing to&nbsp;
him, complicating their relationship.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.200
Sometime later Victoria has another hypnosis&nbsp;
session where the Dr. gets right into asking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.600
about mama. He’s told she lives in the walls, but&nbsp;
doesn’t get much more than that. He insists on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.880
trying to ascertain her true identity, leading to&nbsp;
an emotional outburst and another wall apparition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.960
He tries to mask his fear and scoot out of there&nbsp;
like nothing’s wrong, but he knows he’s on to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.200
something big. Through narration of his session&nbsp;
notes, we learn he believes he’s found some sort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.240
of doorway and intends to acquire the evidence&nbsp;
needed to prove this extraordinary discovery.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.040
That evening mama decides to show Annabel some&nbsp;
scenes relating to the circumstances surrounding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.520
her flight from the hospital, pursuit through&nbsp;
the woods and escape at all costs mentality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.720
This pushes her into another dream in which she&nbsp;
becomes mama’s small spoon before she fully wakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.120
up. Meanwhile, in the girls’ room, Lilly wants&nbsp;
Victoria to come with her and mama, but she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.960
chooses to stay behind. As a result, Lilly escapes&nbsp;
too late and finds mama has already left the area.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.360
Because, concurrently, Dr. Dreyfuss has&nbsp;
arrived at the cabin, at night of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.120
and mama has some haunting to do. He&nbsp;
finds the gateway and calls out to mama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.360
hoping to open a dialogue with her. He&nbsp;
claims to be able to provide what she needs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.160
but soon learns that she’s not&nbsp;
really interested in all that.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.800
The next morning, Annabel wakes up and discovers&nbsp;
Lilly shivering in the bushes. Maternal instincts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.440
kick in and she rushes her inside to try to warm&nbsp;
her up with some jiu-jitsu. After a struggle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.000
the warm touch of a corporeal mommy&nbsp;
finally breaks through her feral ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.440
But, that’s not good in&nbsp;
terms of the jealousy issue.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.560
Victoria then whips up a quick spaghetti breakfast&nbsp;
as Annabel tells Lilly to head downstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:58.480
But then a devastating revelation. She&nbsp;
peers into the closet and finds the doorway,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.640
but is interrupted before finding more.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.480
Her first instinct is to consult with&nbsp;
Dr. Dreyfuss, but she can’t seem to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.160
reach him. So she drives to his office&nbsp;
and finds his assistant to be somewhat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.920
frazzled by his disappearance. Taking&nbsp;
advantage of the lack of supervision,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.080
she hops into his office and swipes his&nbsp;
box of records. As she’s doing that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.720
Lucas starts feeling an intense itch to get&nbsp;
his ass over to Clifton Forge, which he does.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.560
Once they get back to the house, we see that&nbsp;
the box had the doctor’s whole damn laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.960
It reveals his thirst for fame and fortune as&nbsp;
she finds a draft of the book about mama that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.360
he’s working on. She also finds a recording of&nbsp;
the therapy session explaining mama’s origins,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.080
which matches her dream. In this expanded version,&nbsp;
we learn that mama and the baby were separated on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.400
the way down, and she had been wandering the woods&nbsp;
looking for her until she happened upon the girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.040
who assuaged her sadness. The human remains&nbsp;
that were filed away are actually of the baby.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.880
A little later, Victoria attempts to comfort&nbsp;
Annabel and tells her that she loves her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.480
While outside mean Jean rolls up looking to get&nbsp;
some sweet evidence she can turn over to CPS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.560
Upstairs the girls are playing when they hear&nbsp;
something. They go downstairs and find mama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.440
but Victoria recognizes that she’s mad, which&nbsp;
sends them scurrying. Hearing the ruckus Annabel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.520
comes to check on them, but her appearance&nbsp;
only exacerbates the rage. So mama chases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.880
her down and tackles her. The girls are like:&nbsp;
Moooom, stop suckin on backs, it’s embarrassing!

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.960
Their empathy gives her pause, and Jean’s&nbsp;
presence downstairs distracts her fully.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.840
Jean is shocked to find immediate evidence&nbsp;
of substandard housekeeping. Victoria arrives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.480
at the kitchen and finds aunt Jean twerkin’&nbsp;
like crazy, apparently now a vessel for mama.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.440
When Annabel wakes up, the girls are gone.&nbsp;
Thinking quickly she grabs the remains and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.040
heads to Clifton Forge. She calls Lucas&nbsp;
along the way, but can’t reach him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.040
but then he shows up in the road and then&nbsp;
they find the cabin. Inside is Jean’s husk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.720
but no sign of the others. They head out back&nbsp;
and find their way to the cliff where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.560
ladies are just hanging out. In an attempt&nbsp;
to extricate the girls from her custody,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.480
Annabel distracts mama with her&nbsp;
actual child’s desiccated remains.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.760
This rejuvenates her to a significant degree,&nbsp;
until Lilly snaps her back into reality. To&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.400
reclaim her prize she gives Lucas’s heart a&nbsp;
little squeeze and tosses Annabel aside like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:08.000
a sack of potatoes. Unwilling to let go, the two&nbsp;
factions tentatively arrive at a split agreement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.960
through which mama will retain custody of Lilly&nbsp;
and Victoria will remain with the living. Mama&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:19.600
and Lilly then recreate that fateful event and,&nbsp;
upon impact, turn into some moths, so that’s cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:25.600
Ultimately, it is very sad but also, it’s not&nbsp;
like Lilly really fit in very well anyway.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:31.040
Wow, did we just watch the same movie two weeks&nbsp;
in a row? And they were both released in 2013!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.440
Not to imply that they were copies or anything,&nbsp;
but just to say it’s interesting how strongly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.440
implanted some of these tropes are in our&nbsp;
collective storytelling minds. You can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.080
basically take the same framework and repackage&nbsp;
it, and it hits in a completely different way.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.880
I did enjoy Mama more than Dark Skies. I&nbsp;
think it had more mood and style throughout,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.280
and a slightly more concrete set of rules to&nbsp;
help carry us through the story. Obviously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.760
being so similar, both films fall short&nbsp;
in some of the same ways. So, rather than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.000
reiterate everything I said about Dark Skies,&nbsp;
I’m going to try to expand on my prior critiques.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.240
I think movies like this run a risk in becoming&nbsp;
preoccupied with the general concept of the film.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.720
When I said the movie feels like lots of little&nbsp;
things happening, I meant that it felt as though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.840
the filmmakers came up with what they thought&nbsp;
would be a really interesting and creepy premise.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.640
Thinking about how the premise could be used, they&nbsp;
then came up with a series of different scenes or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:22.800
events that could illustrate how the danger being&nbsp;
presented works in the cinematic universe. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.120
they have to develop some sort of story to&nbsp;
stretch around it, hoping to pull everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.840
together while keeping the audience’s suspension&nbsp;
of disbelief within reasonable boundaries. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.640
end result can feel somewhat disjointed and&nbsp;
is typically identified by movies having a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.760
strong start, somewhat muddled middle and often&nbsp;
confusing or dissatisfying endings. Although,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.200
to the credit of this particular&nbsp;
movie, it was at least interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.240
Recent films like The Woman in the Window and&nbsp;
Things Seen and Heard suffer the same weaknesses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:55.120
but are also kind of boring. Mama and Dark&nbsp;
Skies, on the other hand, are worth the time.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.280
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;
my donors, memorialized in the hall of headshots.
