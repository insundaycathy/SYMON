00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.760
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.160
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of&nbsp;
the 2014 British-American science fiction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.640
psychological thriller film called 'Ex Machina'.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.760
The film is written and directed by Alex Garland.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.040
Ex Machina follows the story of a&nbsp;
talented programmer who is asked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.640
by his CEO to give the Turing test&nbsp;
to an intelligent humanoid robot.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.800
Warning: there will be spoilers&nbsp;
ahead, so please proceed with caution.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.640
Caleb Smith, a programmer for the prominent search&nbsp;
engine firm Blue Book, wins an office lottery for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.480
a one-week visit to the CEO's opulent, secluded&nbsp;
house. Nathan lives alone in a contemporary home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.640
near a waterfall and rising hills, with&nbsp;
the exception of a servant named Kyoko,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.760
who, according to Nathan, does not understand&nbsp;
English. Nathan tells Caleb that he has created&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.680
a female humanoid robot named Ava with artificial&nbsp;
intelligence. Nathan, after asking Caleb whether&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.080
he is familiar with the Turing test, informs&nbsp;
Caleb that he wants him to decide if Ava is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.960
truly capable of thought and awareness despite&nbsp;
the fact that she is manufactured. Furthermore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.200
if Caleb forgets that Ava is not human during&nbsp;
their daily sessions, the test will pass.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.520
Ava has a robotic body but&nbsp;
human-like features such as her face,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.440
hands, and feet. She is imprisoned in her solitary&nbsp;
chamber. Caleb is enthralled with Ava, but after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.480
attempting to discuss Ava's technological design&nbsp;
with Nathan, Nathan requests that Caleb only tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.600
him how he 'feels' about her. Caleb develops&nbsp;
feelings for Ava during their conversations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.760
She appears to share similar emotions and&nbsp;
shows a desire to explore the outside world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.680
Ava informs him that she can cause&nbsp;
power shortages that momentarily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.240
disable the monitoring system used by Nathan to&nbsp;
monitor their conversations, allowing them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.440
converse discreetly. When the power goes out, the&nbsp;
building's security system locks all the doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.560
Ava informs Caleb during one of the outages&nbsp;
that Nathan is a liar who cannot be trusted.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.680
Caleb is increasingly suspicious of Nathan's&nbsp;
drinking, narcissism, and sexual behaviour&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.960
with Kyoko and Ava as the vacation develops.&nbsp;
He discovers Nathan's plan to improve Ava by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.840
erasing her memories, including encounters with&nbsp;
Caleb, and so 'killing' her existing personality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.480
Caleb takes Nathan's security card after&nbsp;
pushing him to drink until he passes out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.800
in order to get access to his room and&nbsp;
computer. Caleb sees frightening film of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.360
Nathan interacting with earlier android models&nbsp;
after modifying part of Nathan's programming,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.640
and realises that Kyoko is also an android.&nbsp;
Caleb returns to his room, anxious that he may&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.360
be an android, and slashes his arm open with his&nbsp;
razor to check his skin, proving that he is human.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.800
Ava turns off the electricity at their next&nbsp;
meeting. Caleb discloses Nathan's plans for her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.240
and Ava begs Caleb for assistance. They devise&nbsp;
a plan: Caleb will get Nathan drunk again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.760
and reconfigure the security system to&nbsp;
unlock the doors instead of locking them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.800
during a power outage. Caleb and Ava will leave&nbsp;
together after Ava turns off the electricity.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.200
When Nathan declines to have a drink&nbsp;
with Caleb, his strategy is compromised.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.200
Nathan tells Caleb that he used a&nbsp;
battery-powered camera to record&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.520
Caleb and Ava's last private chat,&nbsp;
as well as Caleb cutting himself. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.680
claims Ava has just pretended to like Caleb&nbsp;
in order for him to assist her in escaping.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.280
This, he claims, has been the actual test all&nbsp;
along, and by skillfully manipulating Caleb,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.120
Ava has proven genuine intellect. Ava then turns&nbsp;
off the electricity. Caleb says that he believed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.120
Nathan was spying on them and had changed the&nbsp;
security system the day before when Nathan was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.640
unconscious, deactivating the closed door on&nbsp;
Ava's cell. Nathan knocks Caleb unconscious and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.640
goes to intercept Ava after watching her flee&nbsp;
her imprisonment on the surveillance camera.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.040
Ava stabs Nathan with the assistance of Kyoko, but&nbsp;
in the process he destroys Kyoko and injures Ava.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.800
Ava enters Nathan's private chamber&nbsp;
and fixes herself while he bleeds out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.080
She then uses fake skin from Nathan's previous&nbsp;
android versions to disguise her mechanical look.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.720
She disguises herself as a human lady by wearing a&nbsp;
wig, a dress, and high-heeled shoes. As she exits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.600
the institution, she walks past the room where&nbsp;
Caleb is now confined, but ignores his screams,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.760
proving her manipulation of Caleb,&nbsp;
as Nathan suspected. Ava flees the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.520
prison and is picked up by the helicopter&nbsp;
that is supposed to transport Caleb home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.520
When she arrives in an unfamiliar&nbsp;
city, she slips in among the crowds.
