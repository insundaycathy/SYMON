00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.200
if you heard menacing claps coming from the&nbsp;
depths of an almost abandoned cruise ship trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.720
to lure you into darkness so that you can be&nbsp;
tortured by the spawns of evil what would you do

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.280
well you go check it out of course like this young&nbsp;
girl right here no she did not survive this night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.640
in case you have pondered about her plot armor&nbsp;
because it wasn't very thick now in this video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.280
we follow the characters of this bollywood movie&nbsp;
called bhoot look at the mistakes they make and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.280
figure out better ways on how to survive and beat&nbsp;
the ghosts in bhoot which is funny because boot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.280
means ghost in hindi lol anyway a rich family&nbsp;
rented a cruise ship to celebrate festivities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.760
the bad thing was this ship was haunted so&nbsp;
they have disappeared and probably became&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.600
part of the ship themselves at least that's&nbsp;
how the story goes for now this is mr p&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.600
our main guy he's a policeman and the&nbsp;
subject of our gentle judgments here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.240
he has lost both his wife and his daughter&nbsp;
in a tragic accident a few years ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.880
for which she somewhat was responsible later&nbsp;
more to that his mental health is not really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.000
good so just keep that in mind as a police officer&nbsp;
our character is currently investigating a human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.040
trafficking operation when he's looking for any&nbsp;
signs of human abduction on this large vessel he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.160
comes across a container filled with young women&nbsp;
that were meant to be shipped to who knows where

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.240
it's a heartbreaking moment but good job p now&nbsp;
they collectively escape and our character is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.520
celebrated the hero the day after however here&nbsp;
is where things get interesting during the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.480
night two curious things happened first when our&nbsp;
character p arrived at home he quite literally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.360
hallucinated his daughter and had a full-blown&nbsp;
conversation with her which freaked me out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.400
because this either implies that he is mental&nbsp;
or he is just imagining things for the sake of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.960
his trauma management now the second relevant&nbsp;
event that has occurred was the arrival of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.640
huge vessel later called the ghost ship that has&nbsp;
stranded on the local beach in mumbai no signs of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.880
any life on it the next day our duo p and his&nbsp;
partner Riaz are put onto this case their job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.000
figure out what this ship is doing here and get&nbsp;
it off the coast asap but before that can happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.800
a lovely couple thinks it is a good idea to go&nbsp;
on the ship for an adventure the following night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.440
the weird thing is they don't even bother to live&nbsp;
stream that on twitch which i find stupid because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.320
if you risk your life just like that then at least&nbsp;
you should try to make some money off of it no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.120
anyway both of them get onto the ship and&nbsp;
start their exploration apparently it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.240
well known that this ship is haunted hence why&nbsp;
they decided to explore a fatal mistake the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.600
hides herself in a closet to give her boyfriend&nbsp;
the shock of a lifetime and it somehow worked

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.080
but not quite why in god's name would you go&nbsp;
on a haunted ship hide yourself in a tight and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.120
rusty wall closet call your boyfriend and then&nbsp;
pretend you're a ghost i don't think that's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.080
very smart idea it might be fun with a team&nbsp;
of people filming stuff and back each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.320
up but a lovely couple that split up to creep&nbsp;
each other out i don't think so bad idea well i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.920
guess this was the last time we have seen them&nbsp;
at least in human form if you know what i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.800
now the next day our policemen are on the ship&nbsp;
as well trying to find hints of what happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.000
p and Riaz have to find something or else they're&nbsp;
done for now they decide to split up and p goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.800
to explore the interior now this ship is massive&nbsp;
in fact you will need a map if you don't want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.440
get lost and let's not talk about productively&nbsp;
scanning this ship on your own terms because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.720
that's impossible if this was me i would not have&nbsp;
touched this ship with a 10 foot pole i would send&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.800
in a squadron of my men while i puff a cigarette&nbsp;
outside on the deck and i don't even smoke anyway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.240
p goes through the ship floor by floor room&nbsp;
by room until he enters this one and for some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.880
reason he checks underneath the bed and finds a&nbsp;
puppet that he for some reason wants to collect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.640
it seems like his daughter had the same version&nbsp;
which is obviously a bit strange he tries to grab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.520
the puppet but he can't reach it it seems like&nbsp;
she gets pulled away every time he reaches out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.120
when he picks up a pole to lengthen his reach&nbsp;
and goes for another attempt the puppet is gone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.240
now doubting his sense of reality he is creeped&nbsp;
out until the sound of the puppet goes off again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.160
but this time she lies behind him now as we&nbsp;
know he frequently hallucinates so was this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.600
his mind playing tricks or was this for real you&nbsp;
see many people with these issues face the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.560
problems right they experience hallucinations&nbsp;
that are as real as experiences can get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.320
making it almost impossible to distinguish between&nbsp;
reality and hallucinations so a happening like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.640
this one isn't an easy one to digest so what&nbsp;
i would do after this experience is this okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.160
i would not go back in the best case this place&nbsp;
triggers hallucinations in me that are not good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.960
because it reminds me of my traumatic childhood&nbsp;
or whatever and in the worst case this place is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.400
haunted and a ghost will attempt to rape me so&nbsp;
either way it's it's a bad thing to go back right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.440
but what if it's too late what if having been&nbsp;
there once is enough to have you being haunted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.120
as well well then you better call some haitians&nbsp;
and get that curse off of you best believe when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.720
our characters tries to rejuvenate with a good&nbsp;
night of sleep unfortunately this is what happens

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.600
the frame of his late wife and daughter crashes&nbsp;
down the creepy puppet from before is suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.600
in his hands and for some reason he hears his&nbsp;
dead girl's voice screaming for his name this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.840
creepy if this was me i would freak out the next&nbsp;
day p goes back to the ship with his partner he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.720
hasn't confessed anything about what happened but&nbsp;
seems to understand that going back there alone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.080
would be a mistake he looks for hints and&nbsp;
signs and collects various items in that room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.040
when they leave again he loses Riaz on his&nbsp;
way out when he tries to find his friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.440
he comes across a perfectly fine room with nice&nbsp;
furnishing no dust it's just in perfect condition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.080
he is weirded out he flicks out his phone&nbsp;
and shoots a few pictures just to be sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.440
is this for real or is his mind playing tricks&nbsp;
again now when he goes to the balcony to check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.960
for more hints he is surprised by a fat orange&nbsp;
overall wearing dude that storms out and falls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.240
over the railing but after taking a look there&nbsp;
is no one there until he turns around and is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:41.520
attacked by the same guy implying that this is a&nbsp;
ghost as well but things get even stranger when he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.720
visits riaz he is hesitant to share his story&nbsp;
and let's be honest okay i would hesitate to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.440
most people would this isn't something that you&nbsp;
would freely share whenever you like it what he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.480
does though is he takes out his phone and wants to&nbsp;
show riaz the neat room that he has found on board&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.840
thinking the conversation will automatically shift&nbsp;
into what he wants to share anyway the crazy thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.520
though is that the room on his photos is as rotten&nbsp;
as every other room on this ship which wasn't the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.600
case when he took them obviously if he was on&nbsp;
edge before imagine how this dude is feeling now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.800
at the same time Riaz's wife feels that something&nbsp;
isn't right she calls p and takes him to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.680
principal yoshi a scientist that develops&nbsp;
electronic gadgets like our character p he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.480
too has lost his family due to an accident&nbsp;
some time ago based on that she thought it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.760
might be a good idea for them to get to know each&nbsp;
other however when they meet this is what happens

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.720
the emf device goes off obviously implying&nbsp;
supernatural presence what would cause me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.320
to grab the next bottle of salt and draw&nbsp;
a circle while mumbling exorcism lines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.400
i have picked up from the winchesters&nbsp;
they just brush it off as a malfunction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.040
amateurs let's see what happens next remember the&nbsp;
couple that was stupid enough to explore the ghost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:05.280
ship well the girl's body was found on the beach&nbsp;
the day after this causes a nationwide outcry and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.400
our characters are exceedingly put under pressure&nbsp;
to get rid of that large ship they decide to visit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:16.240
the owner of the vessel who somehow looks like a&nbsp;
buddha with a rolex to negotiate the removal of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.320
the ship they double the fines and threaten him as&nbsp;
well but he doesn't budge he doesn't care however&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:28.560
when p asks why the engine room is shut the guy&nbsp;
seems concerned he acts as if there was something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.600
hiding in there that should be kept locked in he&nbsp;
then tells that the ship is haunted and that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:39.120
doesn't want anything to do with it now p finally&nbsp;
considers that the strange happenings around him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.280
might have been triggered by his visits&nbsp;
and the contact with a puppet from before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.840
his negative state due to the loss of his family&nbsp;
might be the reason why only he is haunted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:53.120
and not riaz himself ghosts are easier to haunt&nbsp;
people with depressions and other mental maladies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.320
that is if you believe in such things of course&nbsp;
now during the following night we finally find out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.200
how his family died when they went to river&nbsp;
rafting he ignored his wife's concerns about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.240
the dangers unfortunately he convinced his wife&nbsp;
thoroughly that it was safe and that he would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.760
keep her and their daughter safe she really wanted&nbsp;
to skip that adventure but was convinced otherwise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:19.120
in the end the boat flipped and both his wife and&nbsp;
daughter drowned after having been carried away by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:25.520
the strong current considering that it's no wonder&nbsp;
that he keeps hallucinating strange things right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.160
now after waking up from another nightmare he&nbsp;
does what everybody would do okay he dresses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.600
up gets ready and gets on his way to the ship&nbsp;
in the middle of the night without any backup&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:41.280
why would you do that right and why would he do&nbsp;
that waking up at 2am um i don't know it doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.000
make sense especially waking up from a nightmare&nbsp;
in which you got screamed at by your dead family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.360
bleeding from their eyes jesus dude that's kind&nbsp;
of ridiculous but let's go with that for now

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.760
it doesn't take a minute being on that ship&nbsp;
until he already starts hearing strange sounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:07.280
he follows the sounds but almost falls into his&nbsp;
death he eventually wakes up lying on the floor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.560
of the engine room at least he made it this far he&nbsp;
quickly realizes that he is in trouble and tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:18.240
to contact his friend but he can't get a signal&nbsp;
duh as he tries to find a way out good luck with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.800
that he hears some menacing claps that the young&nbsp;
girl at the beginning of this movie heard as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.920
not a good sign like a rat and a maze he has&nbsp;
no clue where to go he makes it up a couple of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:34.320
ladders passes a few rooms but doesn't really get&nbsp;
very far remember this isn't just a haunted ship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:40.240
it's also abandoned meaning pretty much everything&nbsp;
in here is old and rusty and frankly dangerous to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.040
walk on i mean from a rational standpoint this&nbsp;
should have been reason enough to stay away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:50.480
at the same time though riaz has figured out that&nbsp;
something might be wrong he looks out for p but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.120
can't find him at home he randomly checks out the&nbsp;
beach because apparently that's where people go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:01.040
when they vanish but p isn't there obviously&nbsp;
now meanwhile p is still trying to escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.360
something is behind him he can just&nbsp;
barely make it to the upper floor and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.760
finally he's just facing one more&nbsp;
door until he is under the sky again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:15.360
he tries to break out but it's no luck at the&nbsp;
same time the ghosts are getting closer and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.840
we all knew this was coming he is standing&nbsp;
off the clapping ghost of the haunted ship

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.120
i see two options here either you&nbsp;
surrender in which case you will likely die&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.280
or you run up to that __ smack her with&nbsp;
your flat hand screaming you can't see me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.600
but the choice is yours i know what i would do&nbsp;
what would you do either way just before she can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:45.280
pierce our main character with her supernatural&nbsp;
power the door next by blasts open and riaz comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.560
for rescue at this moment he too can finally&nbsp;
see the ghost and realizes that his friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:56.160
isn't completely crazy just a little bit maybe now&nbsp;
they run through the door somehow make it out in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:02.880
seven seconds only jump into the sea and are safe&nbsp;
for now obviously there is something going on with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:09.520
this ship the question is what is it if he goes&nbsp;
over the footage of the ship once again by now we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.720
have found out that this footage captured the crew&nbsp;
that was working on the ship many years ago by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:20.240
analyzing the footage he comes across a guy in an&nbsp;
orange overall that makes the same clapping sound&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.800
that is heard when the ghost is attacking&nbsp;
this makes him curious what is the connection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.920
between this dude and the strange events he&nbsp;
also concludes that the footage was captured&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.400
by the mother of the kid who was celebrating&nbsp;
her birthday in the beginning of this movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.360
who was lured into the darkness when he presents&nbsp;
all of this to his team they quickly conclude&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.080
that the ghosts they have seen might actually&nbsp;
not be a ghost but a possessed human instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.520
in fact it might be the three-year-old kid from&nbsp;
the beginning just older now of course they decide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.920
to search for survivors that were actually&nbsp;
part of the crew before the haunting began&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.320
but it turns out that the whole crew has&nbsp;
mysteriously committed suicide three years after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:04.000
they were captured because of smuggling charges&nbsp;
just one name wasn't mentioned and that name was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.760
vandana who surprisingly is meera's mother as&nbsp;
well when they find her this is what happens

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.000
surprised that her daughter is still alive&nbsp;
she starts telling our guys the whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.280
story basically she was a captive on this ship&nbsp;
and was continuously abused by the captain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.680
who was a notorious smuggler they would smuggle&nbsp;
all sorts of things and everyone who tried to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.240
come clean would be murdered by him vandana here&nbsp;
eventually fell in love with the guy who wore the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:39.200
orange overall in the footage before he tried to&nbsp;
expose all wrongdoings of the captain but before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.480
he could do that two things happened first vandana&nbsp;
got pregnant with his baby although the captain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:50.080
believed it was his and thus stopped abusing her&nbsp;
and he before he could expose anything got caught&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:55.520
and tortured before he was killed implying it&nbsp;
is his ghost that has been haunting this ship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.920
ever since his murder and it was also him who&nbsp;
lured meera into the darkness and possessed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:05.680
her in the beginning of this movie because she&nbsp;
is his child now that everything makes sense i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.880
think it is time to beat the ghosts and that&nbsp;
is exactly what our character is plan as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.680
vandana has hinted that the secret room lies&nbsp;
somewhere inside the ship claiming if we want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.560
to stop this curse we need to find that room&nbsp;
when they arrive at the ship for some reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:26.480
they tell the only person who knows where to go&nbsp;
to wait outside because it's too dangerous for her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.440
i don't know what's more dangerous than getting&nbsp;
lost inside a haunted ship but whatever now it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:37.360
doesn't take 5 minutes until the first l is being&nbsp;
taken they get to the first ladder on their way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:43.840
the engine room yoshi gets down safely but&nbsp;
when p is about to climb down this happens

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.080
he is smacked with a tele-hook and crashes down&nbsp;
violently hitting the ground with his back but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:58.560
don't worry okay because crashing down 35 feet or&nbsp;
12 meters in this movie doesn't mean the end nope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:03.280
because he gets up again with a light concussion&nbsp;
and is ready to finally fight the spawns of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:08.000
evil meanwhile Riaz being stuck up&nbsp;
here makes his first ghostly encounter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.320
however he is able to react quickly and escapes&nbsp;
for now at the same time the two guys downstairs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:19.920
contact vandana with their walkie-talkies but&nbsp;
unfortunately can't get a stable connection going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.200
this leads her to decide that it's time for her to&nbsp;
enter the building as well but not before we get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:31.520
some cliche scenes where she sees her little girl&nbsp;
running away from her in slow motion how sweet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.560
the boys are finally reaching the engine room&nbsp;
however to get to the secret part the room must be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:43.040
opened from afar which vandana since she's entered&nbsp;
is able to activate with the perfect timing thank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:49.600
you the doors open and both dudes can enter the&nbsp;
last room of the dungeon what they plan is this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:55.040
they want to find the bones and burn them nothing&nbsp;
special i know but that stuff tends to work when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:01.920
facing ghosts so fair play unfortunately though&nbsp;
both of them have no fuel at hand because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:07.680
lost the cans when p got knocked down however riaz&nbsp;
who has successfully escaped the ghost upstairs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:13.280
has figured that out and activates some sort of&nbsp;
magic device that allows diesel to flood the exact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:20.080
same room where p and yoshi are intending to burn&nbsp;
the bones sometime good old luck is all you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:25.680
or some movie magic whatever before they're able&nbsp;
to light up the room they were attacked by meera&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:31.280
which causes yoshi to lose consciousness before&nbsp;
she can finish them off vandana joins as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:38.800
family reunion meera leaves and vandana meets up&nbsp;
with p however when he touches her her memories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.360
rush through his mind showing him the truth that&nbsp;
it was her who actually killed her daughter's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:49.360
father and that it was her that actually caused&nbsp;
his whole drama here great just at that moment the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:55.280
last boss joins he quickly kills off vandana&nbsp;
and is about to kill the other guys as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.920
but before that can happen p releases the&nbsp;
machinery causing the bones of our target&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:05.920
to fall into the diesel-infested waters a last&nbsp;
fight breaks out but in the end by throwing an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:11.440
axe across the map and hitting the metal bar&nbsp;
in a perfect angle causing sparks to go loose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:17.840
p is able to light up the water and the bones burn&nbsp;
in a bright light therefore p is able to defeat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:24.960
the boss and peace can finally be restored however&nbsp;
this isn't the end my friends because what would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:31.200
a cliche ghost movie be without a twist that's&nbsp;
right p adopted meera and now they're enjoying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:38.560
themselves eating pasta and enjoy themselves&nbsp;
damn this was a weird movie and frankly while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.520
the acting was solid it didn't quite hold up&nbsp;
for me what do you think well this wasn't the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.000
worst movie i have ever watched i wonder what&nbsp;
the worst movie is that you have ever watched&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.920
