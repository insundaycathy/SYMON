00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.180
If a reckless scientist created a virus that
turned you into a zombie vampire determined

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.560
to destroy humanity, what would you do?

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.471
I know i’m going in reverse order with this
one, but I'll have the How to Beat the Darkseekers

00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:14.380
video coming out soon.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.570
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
the Darkseekers, see if we can make better

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.089
decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat
Dr. Neville and the survivors in, I am Legend.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.869
If you think you have a better way, let me
know in the comments!

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.740
We start out following the remaining Darkseekers
surviving in Manhattan, 3 years after being

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.860
infected with the Krippin Virus.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.590
The virus has altered their bodies and minds
significantly at this point, so we need to

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.200
better understand their physiology and psychology
in order to make reasonable recommendations.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.270
Physically, the Darkseekers are formidable.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.550
Their bodies constantly release adrenaline,
which increases strength and speed due to

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.480
the extra blood and oxygen flow to muscles,
it dilates pupils for better night vision

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.010
and focus, as well as quickens reflexes.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:13.969
Their main weakness is their severe intolerance
to UV radiation, which is fatal within seconds.

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:22.060
Mentally, the Darkseekers are a bit all over.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.640
At first glance, it seems like they are mindless
killing machines determined to destroy what’s

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.859
left of humanity.

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:32.939
But later in the movie, when one of the Darkseekers
replicates a snare trap that Neville previously

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.899
used against them, and successfully baits
Neville into it, it shows that the Darkseekers

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.340
can learn, replicate, strategize, and plan.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.520
In the alternate ending, the Alpha Darkseeker
and his tribe let’s Neville live after he

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.109
returns his wife to him.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:54.780
This reveals that the infected have the social
capacity to form hierarchies and relationships,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.909
as well as make peace with enemies.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.590
The Darkseekers didn’t seem to be able to
use weapons, drive vehicles, or use complex

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.909
tools, so despite them being smarter than
we thought, they still aren’t even remotely

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.889
at a human intelligence level.

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:10.439
In the book, it’s more varied and complicated.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:15.250
Neville finds a woman in broad daylight and
forms a romantic relationship with her, only

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.099
to find out she was actually a Darkseeker
sent to spy on him.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.629
She reveals to Neville that when the dead
were infected, they were reanimated into mindless

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:24.900
killing machines.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.310
But when the living were infected, those that
didn’t immediately perish retained much

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.230
more of their human characteristics and intelligence.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.420
She also reveals that they had developed medication
that diminishes the worst of their symptoms,

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.349
which might be why she was able to deceive
him so well.

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.170
The novel Darkseekers ultimately capture,
jail, and execute him for his crimes against

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.799
their species.

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.470
Before Neville’s life is ended, he finally
realizes that from their perspective, he was

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.140
the evil one for murdering and experimenting
on thousands of them in an attempt to find

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.140
a cure.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.750
Since we’re talking about the 2007 movie,
but also since this would be boring if they

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.269
only had the intelligence of a hyena, let’s
assume we’re dealing with the enraged neanderthal

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.490
or early homosapien variety of Darkseekers.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.349
They can use some tools, learn by observation,
possess relatively long-term memory, have

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.350
limited speech and language, some social structure,
the ability to domesticate and cooperate with

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.200
animals, are minimally innovative, and are
carnivorous predators who can hunt well.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.730
One day, you're huddled up with your fam,
catching some z’s, and some dude busts in

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.359
with his gat and guns down your bro who's
having a midnight snack, then abducts your

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.670
girl before riding off into the sunset in
his supercharged stang.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.690
What would you do?

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:55.200
It’s gonna get dark here for a bit, sorry.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.590
According to the National Criminal Justice
Reference Service, the survival rate for abductees

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.730
at different time periods is not good.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:11.900
Abductees not found within 1 hour have a 44%
chance of being dead, 74% within 3 hours,

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:19.220
91% within 24 hours, and within 7 days, are
almost guaranteed to be dead.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.190
Considering they are dealing with an armed
man, who’s probably been abducting, experimenting

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.720
on, and killing other Darkseekers for years,
you already know this.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.500
You could throw a tarp over your head and
bum rush Neville right then and there, but

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.139
he’d just blast you with his AR-15 before
you could get close.

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.030
Your Darkseeker girlfriend will probably be
dead by the time you find Neville.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.610
If you can find her within a few days, there’s
a slight chance she’ll still be alive.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.289
But unfortunately it’s more likely that
you’re only going to get revenge for her

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:49.289
murder.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.729
Neville takes off after abducting your girl.

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.250
You need to hunt this guy down asap.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.139
Problem is, he only comes out during the day
where there’s an abundance of the sunlight

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.930
which kills you in seconds.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.539
You don’t know where this guy lives, but
you've probably seen or heard him roaming

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.580
around on the daily, so it’s safe to say
he lives around here.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.069
Still, Manhattan’s a large area.

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:11.720
First thing, round up your crew.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.180
If you’re going to find a needle in a haystack,
you need a lot of scouts, and you need to

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.460
start communicating with other Darkseekers
around the city.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.360
Dr. Neville already ran the numbers in the
movie.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.539
Based on infection rates, fatality rates,
and the percentage of the population that

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:31.630
was immune, there are roughly 588 million
Darkseekers in the world.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:39.930
In 2007, there were around 1.5 million people
living in Manhattan out of 6.6 billion worldwide.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.470
Manhattan made up 0.0002 of the world's population.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:51.080
That means well over 120,000 Darkseekers are
surviving in Manhattan with Neville.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.710
Since Manhattan was ground zero, this number
is probably higher.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.350
Maybe over the years some died along the way
from starvation, but there would’ve been

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.250
a lot of humans, corpses, food, and animals
to eat.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.270
There are 262 city blocks in Manhattan, so
there are roughly 5-600 Darkseekers residing

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.030
in every city block of Manhattan.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.289
Someone had to have spotted Neville returning
home.

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:19.170
Maybe nobody knew where he was, they were
too afraid of Neville, or they just can’t

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:26.180
communicate very well.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.699
How else could you find him with just your
squad?

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.099
You could use your domesticated darkseeker
dogs to track him down as well.

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:37.319
In the movie, Darkseekers had an enhanced
sense of smell, to the point that Neville

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:41.110
had to use vinegar to block his scent trail
up to his house.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.050
While darkseekers cooperating with infected
dogs seems odd, if we’re assuming they have

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.509
the intelligence of Neanderthals or early-homosapiens
it’s actually realistic.

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:58.159
According to National Geographic, early homo-sapiens
and Neanderthals did form dog-human alliances.

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:02.419
This was because the dog’s could track and
find the prey better than humans, and the

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:07.080
humans could kill it from a distance, avoiding
a risky close encounter for the dog.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.569
All you’d need is for the infected dog to
get a whiff of something Neville encountered,

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:16.800
like the music store, pier, golfing spot,
etc., then start tracking the scent.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.199
You could also have the dog track the scent
of your girl, which may be stronger considering

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:22.750
nobodies taking showers.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:29.140
An uninfected bloodhound can track a scent
up to 130 miles away, that’s ten times as

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.550
far as Manhattan is long.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.629
The Discovery show’s Mythbusters proved
that a bloodhound could pretty much track

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:40.949
your scent down no matter what you did, meaning
Neville’s vinegar wouldn’t have done shit

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:43.729
to stop a KV infected dog from finding him.

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:48.699
If you had domesticated a KV infected dog,
you should employ them to track Neville down

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:50.439
as soon the sun goes down.

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:52.650
They’d likely find Neville within the night.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:58.009
It’s also distinctly possible that you don’t
have KV infected dogs that you’ve domesticated

00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:01.689
and trained to track humans down, what could
you do then?

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:03.780
Neville isn’t being stealthy.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.099
Maybe he was at the start of the outbreak,
but the combination of complacency and mental

00:08:08.099 --> 00:08:12.430
decline has caused Neville to be very obvious
about his movements and patterns.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:17.699
He’s driving a gas-guzzling truck with the
windows down blasting Bob Marley, and that’s

00:08:17.699 --> 00:08:23.070
when he’s not ripping through town in a
bright red supercharged V8 Shelby Mustang,

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.690
blasting his rifle at deer.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:40.539
Those sounds are gonna carry and echo through
the lifeless city.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:44.690
But just hearing him go for a cruise around
town or golfing won’t help you find his

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:45.690
home though.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.530
You’d want to go to the top of the tallest
buildings in Manhattan to scout and observe

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.200
his movements during the day.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.960
The Empire State Building, One World Trade
Center, and Central Park Tower are good ones

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.329
to start with as they will give you varied
vantage points over all parts of Manhattan.

00:09:00.329 --> 00:09:04.790
During the day, the intense UV can bounce
off of surfaces and get reflected into your

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.790
eyes.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:10.680
Given our vulnerability to UV rays, and that
due to the adrenaline dumping into your body,

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.700
your pupils will be fully dilated as well,
you could be blinded by looking out of windows

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.860
during high noon.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.360
I’d say that wearing polarized sunglasses
with UV protection would work, but that may

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.940
be asking too much from the Neanderthal brained
Darkseekers.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.810
It might be more reasonable to recommend that
you scout from the top of the buildings when

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:29.950
the sun is low.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:34.380
To better hear his movements without the window
barrier, you could use tarps to pitch a tent

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:39.120
on the rooftop while wearing lots of clothing
to eliminate the UV exposure.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.920
Since he wouldn’t want to be out past dark
where he’s most vulnerable, listening and

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.930
watching for where he is driving at sundown
would give us a general location.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:52.760
I’d wager that he lives in the residential
areas with less of a dense population of Darkseekers

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.260
around, as well as smaller, more securable
buildings.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.490
He wouldn’t want to be in an apartment building,
because there is no way to secure all the

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.490
entrances.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:06.851
This means either Upper West Side, Upper East
Side, Greenwich Village, East Village, or

00:10:06.851 --> 00:10:08.130
somewhere similar.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.839
He might even live in New Jersey, or one of
the other boroughs, but that should be the

00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:17.139
easiest thing to cross off by observing from
the building tops if he crossed the bridges,

00:10:17.139 --> 00:10:19.100
or based on which bridges were blown.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.940
I’m not sure if the Darkseeker’s brains
retained enough grooves and folds to understand

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.680
this, but simply tracking his movements would
be enough to locate him.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.930
From the tower tops, it’s likely you would
see him at the South Street Seaport pier everyday

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:37.170
at the bottom of Manhattan, golfing off the
USS intrepid in the middle of Manhattan, and

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:42.450
possibly driving up to the The Metropolitan
Museum of Art to fish nearer the top of Manhattan.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.839
The Darkseekers wouldn’t know the names,
but they’d know the locations.

00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:49.620
We’d see that he didn’t cross any of the
intact bridges.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.950
Most importantly, with time, we’d see or
hear his vehicle coming from and returning

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:58.440
to somewhere in the Greenwich Village region
at sundown.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:08.240
Then, it’s just a matter of hiding out in
closer and closer buildings until you’re

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.889
pretty much on top of him.

00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:12.931
It shouldn’t take more than a few days for
this whole process, maybe a week.

00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:19.050
Like we said earlier, your girl that Neville
abducted is likely dead by this point, but

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.269
there isn’t really a faster way to find
him as far as I can tell.

00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:26.730
To narrow down where his actual home is, you
can search for his truck at night.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:30.860
It should be one of the only ones without
weeds growing on it and clear windows.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.680
It’s likely he parked his truck close to
where he lives, and wouldn’t use any underground

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.829
parking because it’s too dangerous with
the lack of sunlight.

00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:42.920
Once you find his car, hide in one of the
nearby buildings and see which apartment door

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.620
he comes out of the next morning.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.660
Once you know his exact apartment, you can
figure out how to get to him.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:54.130
You need to tread with caution and scout him
out to see his weapons, setup, patterns, etc.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.760
Even though you could overpower him toe to
toe, he’s got an immense firepower advantage,

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.300
wielding weapons that you aren’t capable
of wielding.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.730
He’s also inherently smarter than you.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:08.540
He’ll routinely check the condition of any
defenses he’s constructed, like his IEDs

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.839
and UV lights in the park, which you’ll
now know about by scouting him out.

00:12:12.839 --> 00:12:16.820
You might not know what they are exactly,
but you could reasonably guess it’s harmful

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.820
to you.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.740
Time is of the essence, so skipping this step
is probably necessary if you want any chance

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.180
of finding her alive.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.250
If you watched my TAU video, you know where
i’m going.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:32.279
I’d recommend having you and your darkseeker
crew sneak into the unsecured adjacent apartment

00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:37.800
at night, then in the morning when he leaves,
break into his house from within the building,

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.970
save your girl, then and lie in wait.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.860
When he comes back home at sundown, he won’t
know that anything is wrong.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:53.500
As soon as he opens the door, jump him.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.060
That should be game over.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.630
There are a few other methods and strategies
you could try too.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:03.070
You could use clothing to cover yourself from
UV rays and attack him during the day, but

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.490
it’s unwise and risky.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:08.269
1 clothing mishap when you’re chasing or
fighting him and you’re dead, and during

00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:09.810
the day he’s always armed.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.980
I’m not sure how it would help, but you
could use the sewer system to travel by day

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.140
if need be.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:20.270
If this happened in the winter with recent
snow, tracking him would be incredibly easy.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.709
All you have to do is find and follow the
truck tires or footprints.

00:13:23.709 --> 00:13:39.529
You could try to use traps, like in the movie,
but it’s a bit risky.

00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:43.800
When the Alpha Darkseeker trapped Neville,
they almost got him, but they did get lucky

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.370
that Neville was there at the right time,
hit his head knocking him unconscious, then

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.450
stuck himself with his own knife.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:54.880
If Neville got snared midday or didn’t get
knocked unconscious, he’d have gotten out

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.199
of the trap in time.

00:13:56.199 --> 00:14:00.639
In either of those circumstances, he will
realize you're more intelligent and threatening

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:04.110
than he previously thought, and he’ll be
more on guard.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:08.690
Their trap partially works, causing the death
of his dog, but Neville does escape.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:22.810
The next night, it appears that Neville is
sitting at his desk on the pier.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.870
It should’ve been obvious that it’s a
trap.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.399
You know that this guy will not be out at
night chilling on the pier when he’s most

00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:31.470
vulnerable, and if he is, he’s got plans
for you.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.910
Don’t engage him.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:37.640
You need Neville alive, so he can take you
back to his home where he took your girl.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.120
If you kill him, or cause him to suicide himself
with a grenade, you’ll never find her.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.329
Just wait until he goes home and then kill
him.

00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:48.970
The Alpha almost captures Neville alive, but
another survivor rescues him.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:57.220
Luckily for us, she accidentally leads the
Darkseekers back to his home.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:01.740
The frontal charge while screaming is scary,
no doubt, but it’s incredibly dangerous

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.690
because now this dude knows you’re coming.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.490
This guy probably has defenses set up.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:10.500
Attacking from the rear of the building, the
rooftop, or breaking through the adjacent

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.040
building is safer, because there is more cover.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.840
This hasty charge cost them a lot of lives.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.670
Eventually, they corner Neville in the basement,
where he pulls a grenade out.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.800
This is hard to counter because the darkseekers
might not understand it’s a grenade.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:34.300
It’s safe to say they don’t, so them getting
blown to pieces was unavoidable.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:40.790
To make it interesting, say you, the Alpha
Darkseeker, did recognize it as a m67 fragmentation

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:45.199
grenade from a barely accessible memory of
before the outbreak when you played call of

00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:46.509
duty too much.

00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:50.759
You should back off immediately and find a
new plan, because confronting Neville will

00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:53.230
just cause him to bomb you and your girl.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:57.510
Once Neville let the grenade spoon fly, all
hope of saving your girl is gone.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:02.740
The grenade fuze is activated, and in 4 seconds
anything within 5 meters will be destroyed.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.389
According to Quora, here’s what you should
do.

00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:07.350
Dive behind nearby cover immediately.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:11.771
If you can pull a table over then do it, but
if you need to take a step to reach the table,

00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:12.771
forget it.

00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:15.200
Lay face down with your feet toward the explosive.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.440
Cross your feet at the ankles to avoid exposing
more sensitive areas.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.310
Cover your head with hands, and use your forearms
to cover your ears.

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:27.940
Lastly, open your mouth slightly to equalize
any pressure from the blast concussion.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:32.790
Yah I know, there’s no way the darkseekers
would know this either, but it doesn’t matter

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:37.210
anyways because after Neville dived into your
horde of darkseekers, he will be shocked when

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:41.930
the grenade doesn’t make a bang and he’s
still alive, because the grenade was an inert

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.060
dummy grenade as indicated by the blue spoon.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.459
You can now get your revenge, and your girl
can be saved.

00:16:48.459 --> 00:16:52.790
Sure she has a barely working cure in her
system, but it’s likely it doesn’t work,

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:57.899
the virus mutates infecting her again, or
her constant exposure to you reinfects her.

00:16:57.899 --> 00:17:00.880
Let’s recap how things could’ve gone down
differently.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.660
To be honest, they shouldn’t have let a
threat like Neville live as long as he did.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.800
They should have hunted him down and killed
him the first chance they had, especially

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.610
when he was abducting them left and right,
preventing this whole situation from happening.

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:17.760
Killing Neville earlier on would’ve prevented
you, your wife, and your friends from dying

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.010
and prevented a cure from falling into the
uninfected’s hands.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:25.670
Anna and Ethan would’ve gone to Vermont
to the survivor group and survived either

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:26.670
way.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:30.700
The Alpha Darkseeker got lucky that his trap
worked on Neville, that Neville lost it mentally

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.690
and his rescuer led them back to his home,
and that his darkseeker girl was still alive.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:39.110
None of these things were reliable or probable.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:43.420
Their plan seemed to be working, but their
hastiness led to a confrontation where Neville

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:48.000
fragged everyone, with Anna and Ethan being
the only survivors.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.380
Realistically, if Neville abducted your girl,
well, it’s likely she’d be dead before

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.140
you could find her, even with all our strategies.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.700
With our help, the Alpha Darkseeker could’ve
prevented his death and a lot of darkseeker

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.320
casualties by sneaking into Neville’s home
when he left in the morning.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.700
I’d say that we could ultimately beat Dr.
Neville, but just not in time to save your

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.700
girl.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.960
Thanks for watching, and remember, if the
evil man that invaded your domicile started

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.790
rigging shit up, and put a juicy blood vial
on a blanket at the entrance with ropes and

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:22.970
pulleys all around it, just ignore it, ok,
it’s obviously a trap.
