00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Hey everyone...

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.807
Welcome back to Movie Recap.

00:00:04.807 --> 00:00:06.812
Today I'm gonna show you a movie called,

00:00:06.812 --> 00:00:07.738
Traffik.

00:00:07.738 --> 00:00:10.918
It is a 2018 American thriller film directed and written

00:00:10.918 --> 00:00:13.325
by Deon Taylor and starring Paula Patton.

00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:16.748
The movie is about a romantic getaway turns into&nbsp;a nightmare

00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:19.946
for a couple after a group of bikers begin to harass them.

00:00:19.946 --> 00:00:21.653
Let's start...!

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.041
The film opens with a young woman dancing&nbsp;in a nightclub.

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:38.392
She is approached by a man and agrees to leave with him.

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:41.040
She is later&nbsp;abducted and stowed away in a trailer.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.000
In the next scene, we are introduced to Brea.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.722
She is a journalist for the Sacramento Post.

00:00:47.722 --> 00:00:50.599
She is upset to find that a rival journalist is

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:52.552
covering a major scandal story

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.607
that she had been trying to get published.

00:00:54.607 --> 00:00:59.040
Brea confronts her boss&nbsp;Carl, who says her story is just a fluff piece.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.520
Later that evening, Brea goes out for a&nbsp;birthday dinner with her boyfriend John&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.419
and their friends Darren and Malia.

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:10.246
Darren&nbsp;ruins a whole surprise that John had planned

00:01:10.246 --> 00:01:12.902
for Brea in which he was set to take her on a&nbsp;romantic

00:01:12.902 --> 00:01:15.045
getaway in the California mountains.

00:01:15.045 --> 00:01:17.806
The ladies then go to the bathroom where&nbsp;Brea thinks

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:21.841
that John might propose, but she says she is just not ready for that.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.251
John surprises Brea with a car he built

00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:28.932
in&nbsp;his shop as they head off on their vacation.

00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:30.643
They stop at a gas station

00:01:30.643 --> 00:01:34.640
where Brea enters the&nbsp;bathroom and meets a scared-looking woman named Cara.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.405
She tells Brea "Sure feels a lot like the&nbsp;Fourth of July",

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:41.697
before a brutish biker guy comes in ordering Cara to hurry up.

00:01:41.697 --> 00:01:43.087
Outside the station,

00:01:43.087 --> 00:01:45.761
another biker is bugging John about his car

00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:48.674
and asks racist questions like if he's a ball&nbsp;player

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:50.920
or if he worked in the prison auto shop.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.355
John tells the guy he doesn't want trouble,

00:01:53.355 --> 00:01:55.381
leading the biker to spit on his car,

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.909
and John responds by punching him in the face.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.082
The biker&nbsp;pulls out a knife as his buddies surround John,

00:02:01.082 --> 00:02:04.542
but Sheriff Marnes intervenes and keeps the&nbsp;bikers away.

00:02:04.542 --> 00:02:07.499
John and Brea leave the station.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.760
On the road, one of the bikers&nbsp;starts to follow John and Brea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.198
John speeds up and stops to cause the biker

00:02:16.198 --> 00:02:18.771
to swerve off the road and roll down a hill.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.685
Back at the station, the bikers'&nbsp;leader, Red,

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:26.655
chastises his goons for drawing attention to themselves

00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:28.861
and&nbsp;failing to get their hands on Brea.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.333
The couple arrive at their vacation house

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:35.268
and spend the afternoon together in the pool.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.320
Their evening is disrupted when Darren&nbsp;and Malia make an unannounced visit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.502
despite Darren making Malia believe

00:02:44.502 --> 00:02:46.109
that&nbsp;John was cool with it.

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.590
The couples hang out until Darren gets a phone call letting him know

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.010
that an athlete he represents just got jailed.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.107
He does coke to relieve himself.

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:57.225
They then&nbsp;hear a ringing sound coming from Brea's bag.

00:02:57.225 --> 00:02:59.564
She finds a satellite phone in her bag

00:02:59.564 --> 00:03:02.563
and she&nbsp;realizes that Cara slipped it into her bag.

00:03:02.563 --> 00:03:04.753
Thinking about her 'Fourth of July' comment,

00:03:04.753 --> 00:03:06.900
Brea figures that it's a pass-code.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.947
It works and they unlock the phone.

00:03:08.947 --> 00:03:12.567
They find hundreds&nbsp;of pictures of battered women posing for ads,

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:16.150
making the couples realize that this is part of a&nbsp;trafficking ring.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.078
Brea decides to call the police,

00:03:18.078 --> 00:03:20.651
but Darren stops her by bringing up the fact

00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:22.822
that John and Malia hooked up long

00:03:22.822 --> 00:03:24.909
before they knew either Brea or Darren.

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.240
Malia is pissed at&nbsp;Darren's behavior and she leaves him for good.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.013
Moments later, there is a knock at the door.

00:03:32.013 --> 00:03:35.512
Brea&nbsp;answers to find Cara there asking for her phone back.

00:03:35.512 --> 00:03:40.077
Brea offers to help, even as Cara angrily&nbsp;demands the phone back.

00:03:40.077 --> 00:03:43.680
She runs away as John, Brea, and Darren attempt to follow,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.860
only to see&nbsp;Red and the bikers turn on their headlights.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.241
Cara runs to Red and says she didn't get the phone&nbsp;back,

00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:51.765
and he shoots her in the head.

00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:54.483
The three run back into the house where Darren demands

00:03:54.483 --> 00:03:55.996
that they give up the phone.

00:03:55.996 --> 00:03:58.975
He even takes out a gun to make Brea give it to him.

00:03:58.975 --> 00:04:01.431
He goes outside to hand the&nbsp;phone back,

00:04:01.431 --> 00:04:05.157
until he sees Malia's bag and realizes the bikers have her.

00:04:05.157 --> 00:04:09.216
He tries to make a deal with&nbsp;Red to give the phone back in exchange for Malia,

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:11.684
but Red knows that the phone has been opened

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:13.327
and they have been compromised.

00:04:13.327 --> 00:04:15.221
Darren tries to pull the gun on them,

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:19.031
but the bikers stab him&nbsp;repeatedly before Red shoots him in the head.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.419
John and Brea escape the house through the&nbsp;garage

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.289
as they are pursued by the bikers.

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.067
The couple runs into the woods

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:31.078
where the&nbsp;racist biker from earlier tries to corner them.

00:04:31.078 --> 00:04:32.748
He attacks John with a knife,

00:04:32.748 --> 00:04:35.078
but Brea&nbsp;whacks him with a large branch

00:04:35.078 --> 00:04:37.259
before John gets the knife and stabs him,

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.039
and Brea&nbsp;finishes him with a whack to the face.

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:44.857
The couple run to a cabin where an old man&nbsp;lives.

00:04:44.857 --> 00:04:47.119
He lets them inside to use the phone,

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:51.203
and Brea asks to use the computer so that she can&nbsp;send a message to Carl,

00:04:51.203 --> 00:04:53.749
along with the pictures of the trafficked women.

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:54.824
Unfortunately,

00:04:54.824 --> 00:04:57.314
another&nbsp;biker arrives and shoots the old man

00:04:57.314 --> 00:04:59.506
to death before attacking the couple.

00:04:59.506 --> 00:05:03.108
The computer is&nbsp;destroyed before Brea's message can go through.

00:05:03.108 --> 00:05:04.336
The biker fights John

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:07.954
and shoots him in&nbsp;the side before Brea stabs him in the back.

00:05:07.954 --> 00:05:10.439
John manages to take the gun from the biker

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:13.095
and&nbsp;shoot him in the head, but his wound is fatal.

00:05:13.095 --> 00:05:15.677
He tells Brea he got the biker's car keys

00:05:15.677 --> 00:05:18.349
and&nbsp;reaffirms his love for her before dying.

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.226
Brea then finds an engagement ring that John was planning&nbsp;to propose with,

00:05:22.226 --> 00:05:23.840
and she wears it for him.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.509
Brea goes outside to try and start the car,

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.739
but Red and the last biker find her.

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:31.036
Before they can take her,

00:05:31.036 --> 00:05:33.982
Marnes arrives with a&nbsp;deputy after John called them.

00:05:33.982 --> 00:05:34.647
However,

00:05:34.647 --> 00:05:37.495
Marnes turns out to be part of the trafficking&nbsp;scheme,

00:05:37.495 --> 00:05:40.417
which she proves by shooting and killing the deputy.

00:05:40.417 --> 00:05:43.698
She berates Red and the biker for&nbsp;manhandling the girls

00:05:43.698 --> 00:05:45.045
since they are products,

00:05:45.045 --> 00:05:47.853
as well as not deleting the evidence on the&nbsp;phone.

00:05:47.853 --> 00:05:50.241
They sedate Brea and take her away.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.624
Brea wakes up in a hidden location with the other&nbsp;trafficked women,

00:05:54.624 --> 00:05:55.917
including Malia.

00:05:55.917 --> 00:05:58.851
Brea confirms to her that John and Darren are dead.

00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:00.259
Red and his&nbsp;goon enter.

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.191
He tells Brea he is keeping her all to himself.

00:06:03.191 --> 00:06:05.744
Brea responds by sticking a nail in his&nbsp;neck

00:06:05.744 --> 00:06:08.109
before she starts bludgeoning him to death.

00:06:08.109 --> 00:06:12.197
The biker attacks Brea, but Malia&nbsp;overdoses him with his sedative.

00:06:12.197 --> 00:06:16.251
Brea promises she will come back for&nbsp;Malia before going to get help.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.836
Brea walks out of the woods and finds herself&nbsp;near another gas station.

00:06:22.836 --> 00:06:27.293
She walks there in view of the other patrons who see how badly&nbsp;beaten she looks.

00:06:27.293 --> 00:06:30.766
She enters the store and asks the clerk to call the police.

00:06:30.766 --> 00:06:34.171
Brea swipes a&nbsp;phone from the counter and calls Carl for help.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.866
After dark, Marnes arrives for Brea.

00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:40.263
She orders&nbsp;her outside to arrest her.

00:06:40.263 --> 00:06:44.722
Brea asks Marnes if she takes any pride in trafficking women for profit.

00:06:44.722 --> 00:06:47.165
Marnes responds that everything is trafficked,

00:06:47.165 --> 00:06:49.177
and she is just part of the system.

00:06:49.177 --> 00:06:51.570
Marnes cuffs&nbsp;Brea and takes her outside,

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.908
only for a whole squad of cops to show up.

00:06:53.908 --> 00:06:57.908
Marnes is arrested,&nbsp;and the cops rescue the trafficked women.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.547
In the final scene back in Sacramento,

00:07:04.547 --> 00:07:06.904
Brea returns to work where Carl tells her

00:07:06.904 --> 00:07:09.821
that the trafficking ring bust will be big news&nbsp;everywhere,

00:07:09.821 --> 00:07:13.223
but that the people involved will most likely go after Brea.

00:07:13.223 --> 00:07:17.673
She simply replies,&nbsp;"Let them come" before walking out.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.974
Thanks for watching...

00:07:21.974 --> 00:07:24.267
