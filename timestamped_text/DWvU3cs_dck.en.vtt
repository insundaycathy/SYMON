00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.480
﻿If you had the ability to assimilate and&nbsp;
imitate other organisms, and another form&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.360
of intelligent life discovered and started&nbsp;
experimenting on you, what would you do?
&nbsp;

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.000
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow The Thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.840
see if we can make better decisions, and&nbsp;
ultimately attempt to beat the Humans in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.440
The Thing’s prequel. If you think you have&nbsp;
a better way, let me know in the comments!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.880

&nbsp;

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.920
Before we start following the Thing as the devil&nbsp;
on its shoulder, we need to clarify what the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.760
Thing is, how it functions, and what its abilities&nbsp;
are. Ya know, ground it in fictional reality.
&nbsp;

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.280
Just in case you didn’t realize this already,&nbsp;
I'm not a biologist, or scientist of any kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.000
Even if I was, describing what the Thing&nbsp;
is is nearly an impossible task because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.120
it’s so alien to our world. That, and it’s&nbsp;
an entirely made up creature for a movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.840
The Director, John Carpenter, even mentions&nbsp;
that they intentionally didn’t try to explain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.040
how the Thing imitates people because it brings&nbsp;
up complex, existential questions that would get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.000
in the way of a simple premise for a movie... So&nbsp;
naturally, I take on the responsibility of trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.560
to explain the unexplainable, with no canonical&nbsp;
references. Perfect. Should go swimmingly.
&nbsp;

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.640
Most people, especially the humans&nbsp;
about to be strangled by the weaponized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.160
giblets of their former friend, think the Thing&nbsp;
is just a vile monstrosity of death flesh. 
&nbsp;

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.080
With a bit of luck, wits, parkour skills, and&nbsp;
access to an old World War 2 flamethrower, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.040
can kill their Thing-friend and get an opportunity&nbsp;
to put it’s blood under the microscope.
&nbsp;

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.640
At the microscopic level, we can discover that the&nbsp;
Thing is actually just a single celled organism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.160
that imitates the cells of its host organism,&nbsp;
hiding within it, replicating more and more,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.600
and ultimately taking it over completely.
It may have originated from a virus, but the Thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.960
primarily operates at the cellular level, and&nbsp;
doesn’t exhibit typical viral behavior. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.200
lack of official documentation about the&nbsp;
Thing has spurred lots of speculation as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.920
to what type of cell it is. One thing’s&nbsp;
for sure though, it's not some dumbass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.080
paramecia you studied in middle school.
I don’t think it’s any one type of cell,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.600
because it has the ability to transform into&nbsp;
any cell it wants. I guess it shares a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.800
similarities with a stem cell in that regard,&nbsp;
but there’s something more fundamental going on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.040
within the Thing cell. It’s DNA.
I’m going to be treading into deep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.160
biological science stuff here, so i’m&nbsp;
really relying on none of you actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.200
understanding what i’m saying, or realizing&nbsp;
it’s 100% bullshit. Great, let’s continue.
&nbsp;

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.720
So there’s something different about the Thing’s&nbsp;
DNA, what does that even mean. First, a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.560
refresher on DNA. DNA is basically a data storage&nbsp;
medium within unicellular organisms that contains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.280
encoded instructions for life creation. This code&nbsp;
tells cells how to survive, how to reproduce,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.520
and when and how to start specializing into&nbsp;
specific cell types to form complex multicellular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.240
organisms with various organs, or cell&nbsp;
colonies, working in unison. Your entire body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.960
and existence basically spawned from single cells&nbsp;
following instructions encoded in their DNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.880
My point is that the same mind blowing power&nbsp;
of DNA that enabled humans to be created,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.240
is what gives the Thing its superpowers.
My speculation is that the Things transformative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.280
and imitative abilities originate from&nbsp;
it’s ability to fully edit its own DNA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.720
as well as transcribe and translate,&nbsp;
AKA read, foreign cell’s DNA. 
&nbsp;

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.960
This is unlike most species on Earth, which can&nbsp;
only edit a percentage of their RNA. Editing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.040
the RNA is like editing the small messages a&nbsp;
courier is already taking to the cell’s factory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.280
It’s not as flexible as DNA editing. But even the&nbsp;
ability to edit RNA is powerful, and might be what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.120
enables octopuses and other organisms to change&nbsp;
their shape, color, regrow body parts, adapt to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.680
changing temperatures better, etc. RNA editing&nbsp;
usually comes with the downsides of reduced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.640
DNA plasticity. Basically, short term adaptations&nbsp;
at the cost of long term evolution stunting.
&nbsp;

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.000
Editing the DNA, which the Thing can do, is&nbsp;
like editing the source code that produces the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.680
messages. Meaning it can produce any message&nbsp;
it needs to, and the RNA will carry it to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.080
cell’s factory to create what it needs. You need&nbsp;
tentacles, you got it. It’s getting cold outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.680
let’s synthesize cold‐acclimation proteins and&nbsp;
cold-activated enzymes. You need to regrow a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.080
limb you lost, cell’s will start dividing&nbsp;
and specializing in that area again.
&nbsp;

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.680
I mean, this stuff is theoretically possible with&nbsp;
artificial DNA editing humans are developing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.240
Each Thing cell basically comes packaged with&nbsp;
CRISPR’s DNA editing Cas9 enzyme and guide RNA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.120
installed, and it’s own DNA instructions and&nbsp;
molecular machinery required to use it. 
&nbsp;

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.160
Don’t ask me how the fuck&nbsp;
all this is possible.
&nbsp;

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.960
From what I’ve gathered,&nbsp;
the instructions, or code,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.520
that a unicellular Thing executes is this:
1. Locate a foreign living cell and determine if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.120
it is suitable prey using chemical sensing.
2. Morph a sharp pronged crown which can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.800
used to pierce the prey cell’s membrane.
3. Lyse the prey cell while extracting and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.560
encoding the prey cell’s DNA template within its&nbsp;
own DNA, which is what it can use to adapt to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.360
different situations and environments.
4. Imitate the prey cell by expressing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.000
genes encoded in the prey cell DNA&nbsp;
template location of its own DNA.
&nbsp;

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.840
5. We don’t see how the Thing&nbsp;
cell’s reproduce, but I’d imagine it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.720
undergoes cell division via mitosis.
6. Coordinate with other Thing cells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.040
using chemical sensing, and specialize&nbsp;
into other cell types as needed.
&nbsp;

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.280
Each new cell would repeat the same 6 steps.
As hard as it may be to believe, this is basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.680
all the Thing is at the cellular level. 6 simple&nbsp;
steps encoded into the DNA instructions of a cell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.600
Instructions any single cell can process.
Why do the Thing cells follow these instructions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.400
why is their primary strategy imitation?&nbsp;
I think it’s actually a pretty genius&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.640
strategy for a single celled organism.
For all of you who have played Command and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.520
Conquer, think of it like this. Why spend&nbsp;
all your resources building your own base&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.880
to fight someone else, when you can just send&nbsp;
an engineer into their barracks, take it over,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.280
create more engineers, and take over the&nbsp;
rest of their base without a shot fired.
&nbsp;

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.040
You generate their intelligence, assimilate&nbsp;
their knowledge, commandeer their resources,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.960
all without a giant conflict. Killing is&nbsp;
destructive. I’m also no historian, but from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.040
my quick scan of Genghis Khan, part of his success&nbsp;
could be attributed to his assimilatory military&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.640
strategies. Instead of destroying other armies,&nbsp;
he would capture and incorporate them into his own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.720
military which he could use for further expansion.&nbsp;
This strategy enables a small nuisance to become&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.720 --> 00:08:35.120
an extinction level threat very quickly.
Back to how the Thing can quickly become an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:41.120
extinction level threat to humans. Even ignoring&nbsp;
how powerful an assimilatory strategy is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.560
the strengths of an imitation strategy are also&nbsp;
apparent considering the asymmetric warfare the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:52.640
Thing cells are engaging in. Thing cells imitating&nbsp;
foreign cells will avoid detection and attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.760
both from the host organism’s relatively&nbsp;
massive innate and adaptive immune responses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.360
as well as more sophisticated attacks that&nbsp;
intelligent multicellular organisms create,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.200
like vaccines or surgery. It’s stealth renders&nbsp;
trillions of white blood cells impotent when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.240
faced with even 1 Thing cell. Thing cells&nbsp;
can lyse and replicate within the host&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.600
organism almost completely uninhibited.
This process most likely wouldn’t be painful,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.720
and the victim wouldn’t know what was happening.&nbsp;
Your own human cells carry out similar processes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:31.280
of killing, dying and reproducing. One million&nbsp;
cells in your body die every second without you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.600
noticing. Hell, you wouldn’t even feel sick&nbsp;
and your immune system wouldn’t even notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.320
Maybe you’d notice that your fillings fell out&nbsp;
of your teeth, but at most you’d only have a few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.760
seconds or minutes to be alarmed at this, because&nbsp;
the assimilation process takes about 10 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:52.000
The average human body has about 30 trillion&nbsp;
cells. If you got infected by even 1 thing cell,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.520
at around 10 seconds to lyse, replicate,&nbsp;
and divide, it would only take 45 doublings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.680
for that thing cell to assimilate all&nbsp;
the 30 trillion pieces of you.
&nbsp;

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.960
Once the victim is completely&nbsp;
lysed and replicated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.240
things get interesting. No pun intended.
See, the DNA within thing cells doesn’t just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.640
lyse and replicate a host perfectly.&nbsp;
Once the entire organism is assimilated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.280
the DNA in thing cells instructs them to&nbsp;
specialize and start altering the biology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.560
of the host organism to give it the necessary&nbsp;
intelligence, knowledge and behavior to ensure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:29.920
further survival and infect other organisms. 
At the end of the prequel movie, the dog thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.960
somehow knows to avoid the gun-toting Lars, and&nbsp;
knows how to find other research stations that are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.400
100 miles away, this suggests that the Dog-Thing&nbsp;
had more intelligence than just a dog. 
&nbsp;

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.840
My theory is that the thing produces intelligence&nbsp;
within any organism it inhabits by generating as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.480
advanced of a nervous system as it can. It&nbsp;
wouldn’t just create a massive brain though,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.560
because 1, that would kind of ruin&nbsp;
the whole imitation thing, and 2,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.520
doing so would take away resources that the host&nbsp;
body needs to function properly. This is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.480
likely limited by the maximum intelligence that&nbsp;
the Thing cells had ever assimilated prior.
&nbsp;

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:10.000
In a human host, the thing may only restructure&nbsp;
the brain and alter the neurochemistry. In a dog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.800
it may generate additional brain matter as well.&nbsp;
In a colony of thing cells that were instructed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.440
separate from the main thing organism, like&nbsp;
one of those spider limbs, that cell colony&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.320
will have to develop pretty much all the systems&nbsp;
an independent organism would need to survive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:30.080
like a mouth, brain, legs, etc. How does the&nbsp;
DNA know to instruct cells to specialize in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:35.040
fashion? I’d imagine like all cells, they&nbsp;
coordinate with neighbor cells and gossip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.240
information around. Once the cells understand&nbsp;
their resource limitations and current cell types,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.280
they can begin to restructure based on encoded&nbsp;
instructions in the DNA to create forms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.440
relevant to these resource constraints.
The Dog-Thing knowing about other research&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.560
stations, as well as Sandors-Thing knowing how to&nbsp;
transform himself back into an alien pilot form&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.200
capable of connecting to the neural bio ports&nbsp;
of the spaceship necessary to operate it, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.680
Blair-Thing knowing how to rebuild a spaceship, if&nbsp;
you could call it that, all suggest that the Thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.960
is capable of storing, transferring, or generating&nbsp;
massive amounts of knowledge. From what I can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:14.480
tell, there are a few ways to go about this.
The Things can all use forms of communication&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.360
native to their hosts. Like writing and talking&nbsp;
to share information as a human-thing. It’s the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:25.200
lowest bandwidth but most discreet.
They could fuse together and use tendrils&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:30.480
to directly transfer knowledge to one another&nbsp;
similar to how separate slime molds can conjoin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.120
to transfer learned behavior to each other. If&nbsp;
it can meld it’s Thing brain with a human brain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:40.560
it could access all their information, and control&nbsp;
both the minds and the bodies simultaneously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.760
like how an Octopus has 9 brains, with a&nbsp;
central brain controlling 8 other mini brains.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:51.280
The advantage is that the Thing becomes smarter,&nbsp;
as it can directly process both brain information.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.720
Higher bandwidth but it’s.. less discrete. I think&nbsp;
the humans might be shocked when they figure out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.360
Suzy and Brad are now physically conjoined.
Both of these methods are sufficient for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.480
telling other things about your plans for world&nbsp;
domination, but not highly complex blueprints for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:12.320
reorganizing your matter into other life forms or&nbsp;
operating and engineering alien spaceships.
&nbsp;

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:19.120
The answer may lie in the most unassuming of&nbsp;
all places. Those same tiny strands of DNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.920
Remember when I said DNA was a data storage&nbsp;
medium that contained all of the encoded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.440
instructions for how to create your body.&nbsp;
Yah. DNA can store a lot of data.
&nbsp;

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.480
Humans are currently exploring using DNA&nbsp;
for data storage because it has a storage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.440
density of around 10^19 bits per cubic&nbsp;
centimeter. To give you perspective,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:45.120
at that density, all the world’s current data&nbsp;
storage needs for a year could be well met by a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:51.520
cubic meter worth of DNA. Anything from simple&nbsp;
‘Hello World’ messages to Bitcoin private keys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.240
could be encoded. The Thing can pretty much encode&nbsp;
countless Noah’s Ark’s worth of instructions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.920
and life templates in it’s cell’s DNA. DNA is&nbsp;
also incredibly stable over time, as has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:08.000
demonstrated by the complete genome sequencing&nbsp;
of a fossil horse that lived more than 500,000&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.080
years ago. Storing data within DNA also does not&nbsp;
require much energy, and it can be replicated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:20.240
error-free, endlessly. I mean, the DNA in each&nbsp;
human cell is around 3 billion digits long and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:26.080
has to be copied every time a cell divides, which&nbsp;
occurs nearly 2 trillion times each day.
&nbsp;

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:31.200
It makes sense that with its ability to edit&nbsp;
its own DNA, it would also use it for storing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.440
transferring, and populating host brain&nbsp;
matter with its accumulated knowledge.
&nbsp;

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.320
The thing would still need to retain most of the&nbsp;
host's biology though. Compromising memories,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:45.360
personalities, behaviors, emotional triggers,&nbsp;
and anything else central to the host’s identity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:50.160
could cause it to blow it’s cover. If the Thing&nbsp;
discarded a host human's memory of watching a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.480
football game with his friends last night, and&nbsp;
those friends brought it up the next morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.040
the Thing would start to come&nbsp;
under intense scrutiny.
&nbsp;

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:02.640
While avoiding detection is a priority, survival&nbsp;
and assimilation is the priority. So whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:07.360
the thing assimilates will necessarily have&nbsp;
altered biology to make the host aggressively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:13.200
and intelligently spread the disease. Similar to&nbsp;
how Toxoplasma Gondii can alter the physiology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.400
of its host, changing it’s mentality, behavior&nbsp;
and physical prowess to guide it towards other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.200
organisms, which it can then spread to.
It might also help us to understand what the host&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:29.600
thinks and feels, how it’s mindset changes, how&nbsp;
it becomes a Thing. Like we talked about earlier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:35.360
getting assimilated by Thing cells isn’t a painful&nbsp;
experience if you inhale some Thing cells. Getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:41.200
shived by sharpened intestines is a different&nbsp;
story, that’s painful as fuck. 
&nbsp;

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.720
What the victim may experience is the feeling of&nbsp;
an epiphany with the restructuring of the brain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.280
and any knowledge piped in from other Things,&nbsp;
the shifting of their mood with the changing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:59.200
neurochemistry, urges forming from alterations&nbsp;
to their endocrine system. The victim may feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.920
more connected to the cells in their body, which&nbsp;
can now edit their DNA to adapt to different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.960
situations and threats. They will still be able&nbsp;
to understand human emotions and perspectives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:14.320
but they won’t feel human nor share empathy&nbsp;
for humans. The core biology of who they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.360
are is fundamentally being lysed and developed in&nbsp;
accordance with the survival instructions of Thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:25.040
cells. Swallowing a drop of Thing cells would&nbsp;
be like swallowing the red pill in the Matrix,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:30.720
which changes your entire viewpoint, and alienates&nbsp;
you from everything you once knew or held dear.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.120
A Thing pill would turn an organism&nbsp;
into a psychotic copy of themselves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.320
an evil twin that disposed of the original.
All this is necessary because if the Thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.560
cells perfectly imitated, say,&nbsp;
Saul from Pineapple Express,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:52.400
you’d just end up with a dumb, forgetful,
Thing that sat on the couch watching trippy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.200
YouTube videos all day. The Thing cells would&nbsp;
still infect and replicate other humans Saul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.840
puffed and passed too, but it wouldn’t be&nbsp;
aggressively conspiring against the human race.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.000
This isn’t optimal because the Thing&nbsp;
would no longer ‘want’ to spread,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.040
but it’s cells would still be trying to assimilate&nbsp;
other cells they came into contact with. 
&nbsp;

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:17.120
Eventually other humans would realize that Saul is&nbsp;
basically causing the deletion and replication of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:22.640
other humans, and they would eliminate him. 
You could argue that this Saul-Thing is the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.840
person if no alterations occurred, but this&nbsp;
gets into those existential questions John&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:32.320
Carpenter talked about, like the Ship of&nbsp;
Theseus and the Chinese Room. Knowing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:38.240
all their cells were lysed, the DNA extracted&nbsp;
and imitated, I would think the Thing’s DNA is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:44.560
the master of the host organism now, that ‘it’ is&nbsp;
the organism now. Personally, I wouldn’t take any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:50.640
chances and I’d incinerate the Saul-Thing. 
While alterations are necessary, the Thing cells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:57.040
wouldn’t want to alter the host biology too much.&nbsp;
Overt abnormalities caused by severe biological&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:03.440
alterations, like making the host body flood it’s&nbsp;
arteries with Jack3d’s OG formula causing it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:09.040
go apeshit on everyone, could blow it’s cover and&nbsp;
other organisms would detect and destroy it. 
&nbsp;

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:14.640
The Thing is almost like a much more efficient,&nbsp;
covert, and menacing version of the spores and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:20.240
Pod People from Invasion of the Body Snatchers,&nbsp;
with one key distinction. Transformation.
&nbsp;

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.680
What makes the Thing truly terrifying, is its&nbsp;
ability to weaponize giblets and reorganize it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.800
biomass to adapt to different situations.
Most of the early assimilation process,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:36.480
coming from a single cell to assimilating an&nbsp;
entire organism is based on DNA instructions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.480
but transformations seem to be&nbsp;
influenced consciously.
&nbsp;

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.680
I don’t think the Thing is consciously telling&nbsp;
each cell what to do, that would be ridiculous.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:50.480
Instead, I think it’s more of the Thing’s&nbsp;
nervous system sending generalized commands,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:56.000
or environmental changes which the cells&nbsp;
reorganize around. Same as a human brain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.760
processes sensory stimuli, and converts that&nbsp;
stimuli into electrical signals which travel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:06.720
all throughout the body, causing chemicals&nbsp;
called neurotransmitters to be released which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:12.080
perform some type of magic which results in your&nbsp;
body's cells reacting and fulfilling your request.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.640
It’s all very scientific stuff. 
This does have a semblance of basis in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:22.720
our reality. When studying Octopuses and&nbsp;
Squid, Joshua Rosenthal, a neurobiologist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.280
mentioned that these cephalopods may edit&nbsp;
their own RNA based on things as simple as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:32.400
temperature changes, but also based on things&nbsp;
as complicated as experiences or memories.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:38.000
Indicating some form of conscious control over&nbsp;
their adaptations. So the Thing isn’t an insane,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.480
impossible organism. Okay, it is, but it’s&nbsp;
not like the fucking Hulk or Superman. Both of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:49.360
which are operating on straight up bullshit.
When the Thing is in charge of an intelligent host&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:55.600
organism, it will only consciously cause bodily&nbsp;
mutations as a last resort if it’s under attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.880
In some cases, this may be a reflexive or&nbsp;
subconscious reaction, if the Thing is severely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.800
wounded, loses its consciousness and thus control&nbsp;
over it’s cell colonies, or if the hosts biology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.520
emits too much of a fight or flight response&nbsp;
from the mimicked amygdala of a human.
&nbsp;

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:16.480
Springing tentacles out of your ass is&nbsp;
going to freak people out. Not good for you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:22.640
especially if they have flamethrowers. Completely&nbsp;
restructuring your 30 trillion cells also costs a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:28.000
ton of energy. First law of thermodynamics still&nbsp;
applies here, so if you’re gonna be transforming,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.320
you better have a pile of steak nearby.
While the Thing can definitely absorb some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:37.760
serious damage and survive extremely inhospitable&nbsp;
conditions, I think we have to remember that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.560
Thing is still a carbon-based organism, and&nbsp;
will still die if it doesn’t have energy or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:47.680
functioning bodily systems. It needs to consume&nbsp;
food, or other biomatter which it would break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:53.360
down for energy. Especially if it’s doing a lot of&nbsp;
transforming. It needs oxygen, circulating blood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:58.560
etc. Which means it can’t just disregard vital&nbsp;
organs, and it has to maintain and repair them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:03.600
if damaged. Bullets may not kill it easily, but&nbsp;
they could seriously impair the Thing by causing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.000
it to have to spend time and resources repairing&nbsp;
itself before it can be operational again. 
&nbsp;

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.560
Man, John Carpenter saying to avoid getting&nbsp;
into the biology and philosophy of the Thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.280
because it would just get in the way of a simple&nbsp;
premise was quite prescient. What’s that saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.280
never let the truth get in the way of a&nbsp;
good story. Now that I think about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.840
my channel is literally all about breaking&nbsp;
these fundamental storytelling rules.
&nbsp;

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.040
Anyways, I'd love to hear your&nbsp;
thoughts on what the Thing is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.680
At least now we have a general framework on&nbsp;
which to base our decisions and actions on.
&nbsp;

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.080
On to the movie.
We start out following the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:41.600
Thing after it had been abducted by an alien’s&nbsp;
zoological expedition and placed in storage on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:46.800
the alien spaceship for research purposes. You&nbsp;
might be thinking, why in tarnation would they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.920
bring the freaking Thing on board. Well, the&nbsp;
Thing may have been imitating a cute little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:57.280
tree bear type animal at the time of abduction,&nbsp;
leading the aliens to completely underestimate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.160
it. It doesn’t excuse the fact that the aliens&nbsp;
are pretty much as dumb as the expeditionaries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:08.080
in Alien Covenant for just tossing alien organisms&nbsp;
onto their ship carelessly. The Thing then broke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:13.040
out of it’s containment and attacked the aliens.&nbsp;
Realizing the nature of the Thing, and the immense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:18.080
danger it posed to not only their homeworld,&nbsp;
but also the rest of the galaxy, they decided to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:23.280
crash their spaceship into Earth in Northern&nbsp;
Antarctica around 100,000 years ago. 
&nbsp;

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:28.400
What I don’t fully understand is why the aliens&nbsp;
didn’t warp their spaceship into the sun if they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.774
knew they were doomed. Yes, the sun is really&nbsp;
far away. Like 100 million miles far. Even using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:33.774 --> 00:22:33.885
a futuristic laser light craft and photonic&nbsp;
thrusters along with powerful orbiting lasers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:33.884 --> 00:22:34.400
would still take about two months to reach the sun&nbsp;
from Earth according to some guy on Quora. But an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:39.760
interstellar alien species would have to be&nbsp;
using an anti-gravity propulsion system, like an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:45.360
Alcubierre Drive, which enables faster than light&nbsp;
travel. Which means warping into the sun shouldn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.320
take any time at all. Warping into the Sun isn’t&nbsp;
even the least they could do. I’ll give them the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:55.440
benefit of the doubt, maybe the fight broke out&nbsp;
and the warp drive was disabled or sabotaged,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.560
but it’s still a bitch move because even a hundred&nbsp;
thousand years ago Earth was teeming with life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:06.960
Human and not. It’s literally the only planet in&nbsp;
the solar system that has intelligent life. Hell,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.600
they could have driven their spaceship&nbsp;
into the moon which is pretty close. 
&nbsp;

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.320
Or pulled a Master Chief and overloaded&nbsp;
the ship's reactors causing a catastrophic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.760
explosion, seriously he did that&nbsp;
like 5 times in the games. 
&nbsp;

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.640
There is some speculation that the Thing was&nbsp;
a bioweapon created by the aliens, but had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:27.360
that been the case, better containment facilities&nbsp;
and procedures would have been implemented. 
&nbsp;

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.600
After the crash, the Thing left the damaged&nbsp;
ship and ultimately succumbed to the freezing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:37.440
conditions where it would be entombed in ice&nbsp;
for a hundred thousand years. The question is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:42.160
why would it leave the ship if it knew it was&nbsp;
certain death? Hell, was it even the Thing?
&nbsp;

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:49.840
We know that it wasn’t the alien pilot fleeing&nbsp;
from the Thing because the bug-like corpse the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:55.120
Norwegions found was not the same as&nbsp;
the alien form found piloting the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.720
But it could have been another non-Thing&nbsp;
creature that was abducted and stored by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:03.760
the aliens which broke free and tried to escape&nbsp;
the Thing by running into the freezing Antarctic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:11.440
conditions with nowhere else to go. I’d rather&nbsp;
freeze to death then end up like Adam Finch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:15.600
I don’t think this was the case though. 
If the Thing was ignorant of its location on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.440
planet, it may have thought that these winter&nbsp;
conditions were seasonal, that there may be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:24.320
nearby life it could hunt, in which case it would&nbsp;
attempt to journey many miles from the ship.
&nbsp;

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.560
The fact that the Thing was found near the&nbsp;
ship indicates that it knew it was hopeless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:33.840
and intentionally froze itself, so whenever,&nbsp;
if ever, someone detected the ship's distress&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.240
signal they would find it, and awaken it.
It makes sense that the Thing would know it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:43.440
hopeless, because it would have assimilated or&nbsp;
brain piped the alien pilots, uncovering their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.320
knowledge of this planet, the life that resides&nbsp;
on it, and the reason the aliens chose to crash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.120
here was because it was remote and inhospitable.&nbsp;
With most of the intelligent life inhabiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.360
Africa on the other side of the planet, and&nbsp;
a busted ship with no supplies to fix it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.520
there were no other options than to get&nbsp;
some icy cold sleep, and just wait. 
&nbsp;

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.320
For the Thing, running out into the freezing&nbsp;
conditions wouldn’t necessarily be certain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:12.000
death. Maybe it was a survival strategy.
As it lays down in the snow, the Thing’s highly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.320
adaptable cells would start producing antifreeze&nbsp;
to avoid lethal intracellular ice crystallization,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.120
as well as other adaptations present in the&nbsp;
psychrophilic templates it had stored in its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:29.120
DNA. The freezing conditions would cause cells to&nbsp;
elicit the gene expressions for these adaptations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.280
much like the cephalopods mentioned&nbsp;
earlier. Undergoing a form of natural&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.440
cryonic preservation. In this state,&nbsp;
the Thing would enter a deep sleep,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.720
until it would be awakened by the thawing of&nbsp;
the ice or it was found. It could be eons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:48.640
it could be forever. Slept is a misnomer.&nbsp;
This process of freezing reduces metabolic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.760
activity immensely, almost bringing it to&nbsp;
a halt completely. No aging would occur,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:59.360
no energy expended, no perception of time passing.&nbsp;
The reduced metabolic activity, coupled with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:04.560
stability of DNA means that once the Thing&nbsp;
is thawed, it’s game on immediately.
&nbsp;

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:09.200
In the ice it would be held in stasis,&nbsp;
waiting until those humans reproduce,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.240
evolve, gain intelligence, turn the dirt,&nbsp;
trees, and water into complex materials,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:19.040
circuits, and energy. Wait, until they spread&nbsp;
across the planet, and dare to explore the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:24.400
inhospitable location where the Thing lies. Where&nbsp;
they would find it, and their curiosity would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:29.360
drive them to awaken it and all its horrors.
The next thing the Thing know’s is it's awakening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:34.880
consciousness. Warmth flows in through a hole in&nbsp;
it’s ice coffin, where it’s alien skin is sending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:40.000
pain impulses from. It’s still frozen in place,&nbsp;
though the ice is weakening and melting. It’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.280
cells metabolic activity is firing up, breathing&nbsp;
life back into it. It might be wondering why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:51.840
it was awakening now, and into what world.
It hears a faint noise, something rhythmic.
&nbsp;

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:05.840
It then hears a loud noise, and&nbsp;
some muffled chattering. 
&nbsp;

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:13.040
Voices. These weren’t the noises of aliens&nbsp;
who came to recover their spacecraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.960
It may be the voices of those&nbsp;
bipedal organisms from Africa.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.280
The Thing must have been waiting for this&nbsp;
moment, but now that it’s finally arrived,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.440
it is struck by fear. It will know that&nbsp;
for the bipeds to find it, they must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:30.400
be sufficiently advanced and intelligent.&nbsp;
Adversaries not to be taken lightly. 
&nbsp;

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.240
As the Thing is awakened, it will&nbsp;
probably feel a pain in it’s side,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.640
recognizing that a precise hole was made into&nbsp;
its body though it is encased in ice. 
&nbsp;

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.720
This would confirm that these bipeds&nbsp;
are intelligent, as this hole was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.880
likely made with sophisticated tools&nbsp;
with the purpose of obtaining a sample&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.440
that they would use for experimentation.
All the Thing cells would have already completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:01.520
imitated the host organism, so they won’t&nbsp;
readily discover it’s assimilation abilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:06.480
Yet. A discovery of an alien organism and&nbsp;
spaceship will be communicated to the rest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:11.200
of their species though. It is only a matter of&nbsp;
time before that nature of the Thing is found out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.680
and destroyed due to the danger it&nbsp;
poses. The Thing must know this.
&nbsp;

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.160
It needs to get out of the ice so it can&nbsp;
collect intel and find out exactly what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.880
it’s dealing with in order to come up with a&nbsp;
strategy. With the ice finally weakening enough,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.840
it can use it’s alien form’s strength&nbsp;
to break out of it and escape.
&nbsp;

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:39.360
It looks like a small town, a population of&nbsp;
15-20 bipeds. Buildings are constructed from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.200
lumber and steel. There are relatively&nbsp;
sophisticated vehicles, machinery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:48.160
and tools. In order to populate this frigid region&nbsp;
and construct all of this, they would need to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.880
brought all this material in from other regions&nbsp;
of the planet. Meaning this world is potentially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.600
full of intelligent life to assimilate.
So far every organism that discovered the nature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:03.600
of the Thing has refused communion, feared it, and&nbsp;
tried to destroy it. This species is unlikely to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.400
be any different. If the Thing is to survive and&nbsp;
spread it’s good word of salvation and communion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:14.400
it needs more information about these bipeds, what&nbsp;
they know, how they think. It can’t exactly walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:19.600
up to them and say hi though, partially due to the&nbsp;
language barrier, but also partially because it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:24.320
an alien that they want to capture and kill.
It needs to find an isolated biped which it can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:29.840
assimilate unnoticed and use to hide amongst&nbsp;
the other bipeds. It’s the cellular battlefield&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:35.200
projected onto a bigger stage. Similar to how 1&nbsp;
Thing cell needs to hide amongst the host cells,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.720
1 Thing human needs to hide amongst&nbsp;
the entire human species. 
&nbsp;

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.120
The Thing finds a biped in one of the&nbsp;
machines, searching for something.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.960
As well as a quadruped. They are both&nbsp;
isolated from the rest of the bipeds.
&nbsp;

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.920
What assimilation strategy should it use though.&nbsp;
With search parties out looking for the Thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:56.640
being quick and discrete is necessary. There’s&nbsp;
no time for shoving tentacles into the bipeds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:00.400
head to brain pipe information out. 
It should assimilate the biped in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:05.200
machine first, there is more knowledge and&nbsp;
power to be gained. While one cell may take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.440
10 minutes to fully assimilate it, shoving&nbsp;
a fistful into it will take seconds.
&nbsp;

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:17.600
It should just pin it down and infect it, turning&nbsp;
it into a separate autonomous Thing organism.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:22.800
Converting an enemy to an ally. The information&nbsp;
contained within the Thing’s DNA will propagate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:27.120
throughout their body, the templates of all prior&nbsp;
assimilated life will be accessible to them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:32.000
the cellular alterations weaponizing their&nbsp;
identity, memories, personality, knowledge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.480
their very humanity against their own kind.
The Griggs thing, now a part of the Thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.400
species will know how many peoples are&nbsp;
in the camp, what each of them are like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.560
what weapons and transportation&nbsp;
they have, nearby research stations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:49.920
the status of the entire human race.
The dog is nearby too, barking loudly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.760
Griggs-Thing would know the location of&nbsp;
the nearby American research station,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:58.880
who is there, and how far it is. He would know&nbsp;
that these Norwegion researchers hadn’t radioed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:03.760
out about the alien yet because their leader is&nbsp;
arrogant and foolish. Griggs-Thing would also know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:08.960
that humans love dogs, can’t resist petting them.&nbsp;
There’s a deep bond between human and animal that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:13.920
can be exploited. Not to mention the dog barking&nbsp;
will alert the humans to its location.
&nbsp;

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.840
Griggs-Thing should then go&nbsp;
on to infect the dog.
&nbsp;

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:24.000
The dog, infected with Thing DNA, would develop&nbsp;
more complex brain structures capable of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.440
understanding Griggs-Thing. Human-dog interactions&nbsp;
are much shallower than human to human,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.320
and thus there isn’t a need to retain much&nbsp;
of its former biology, save for the four legs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.960
and fur. The latter make this form a capable&nbsp;
runner in the snow. The Dog-Thing could help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:43.360
infect others at this station, but Griggs-Thing&nbsp;
is more than capable of handling that.
&nbsp;

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:47.200
Griggs-Thing should natively communicate&nbsp;
to Dog-Thing, and tell it about the nearby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:52.320
research stations that it should run to. Thule is&nbsp;
a fictional research station, but in the movies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:58.560
the Norwegions reference Halley station, Northwest&nbsp;
where their helicopter is refueling at. McMurdo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:04.080
South where they want to take the injured Olav,&nbsp;
and an unnamed russian station 50 miles from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:10.560
them. Probably Novolazarevskaya. Based on these,&nbsp;
I'd say Thule station is the most representative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:16.320
of the Norwegion Troll station. Halley is&nbsp;
too far to run straight to, but there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:20.880
numerous research stations surrounding them to&nbsp;
the right and left that are close enough. 
&nbsp;

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:25.680
It’s currently winter in Antarctica, which means&nbsp;
most ships and flights out are cancelled until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:29.920
summer due to the darkness and extreme cold.&nbsp;
The only way out of Antarctica during this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:34.480
time of the year would be to schedule an&nbsp;
emergency C17 transport which would take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:39.600
them back to Christchurch, New Zealand, or&nbsp;
wait for the 1 winter fly in for the season.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:44.400
This might draw too much attention though.
It’d be better to wait for the austral summer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:49.440
when people are rotated out and taken back home.&nbsp;
It’s still wise to have Dog-Thing infect other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:54.080
stations in the meantime, just in case the&nbsp;
Norwegians are craftier than they look.
&nbsp;

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:59.840
Alternatively, Griggs-Thing would have knowledge&nbsp;
of birds and vast sea life. But with no blueprints&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:04.640
stored in the DNA, there isn’t a way to&nbsp;
transform into them as a means of escape.
&nbsp;

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:08.800
If the Things do get discovered, and word gets&nbsp;
out to the rest of the world resulting in their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:14.000
Antarctica-wide quarantine, hopefully it could&nbsp;
flee to the coast and assimilate some form of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.920
sea life. Not sure what the fishing&nbsp;
is like off the coast of Antarctica,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.240
but if it could grab a fishing rod, catch a&nbsp;
fish, infect it, and throw it back in the water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:26.400
well.. There is plenty of biomatter to&nbsp;
assimilate and use against the humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:32.000
I’m just imagining 3 trillion fish sprouting&nbsp;
legs and storming the beaches worldwide,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.760
which sounds less scary, and more&nbsp;
like a shitty Sci-fi original.
&nbsp;

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:39.600
Best not to get too far ahead of themselves&nbsp;
though, they need to first defeat these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:49.760
Norwegions that are trying to capture them. 
I’m going to try separating this into two parts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.760
this time, so I can get the first part&nbsp;
out faster. This part had a lot of setup,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.760
but part 2 is going to continue straight&nbsp;
to the action, and where we will figure out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:05.840
if we can really beat the humans or not.
See you guys then!
