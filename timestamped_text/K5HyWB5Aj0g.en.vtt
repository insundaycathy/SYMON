Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:07.249
Today, I’m going to show a drama, fantasy,
and mystery film called, “Homunculus.”

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:08.840
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.760
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.620
In present Tokyo, 34-year-old amnesiac Susumu
Nokoshi is a homeless man living in his car.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.180
He used to work for a successful foreign financial
company, but is now getting by through whatever’s

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.800
left in his credit card.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.090
He goes about his day in his car when a young
fellow taps on his window.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.110
It’s a medical intern named Manabu Ito.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.470
Ito offers him an opportunity to earn money
through a human medical experiment, but Nokoshi

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.130
flatly declines.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.340
The next morning, Nokoshi’s car is towed
away taking all his belongings with it.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.000
Ito appears and persuades him to join the
experiment again.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.190
Seeing no choice, he agrees.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.620
Later that night, Ito takes Nokoshi to his
medical room.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.910
They will be doing a trepanation experiment,
where Ito will drill a hole into Nokoshi’s

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.910
skull.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.239
Ito believes that people only use 10% of the
brain and so he wants to know if this improvement

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.840
will help activate the other 90%.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.200
As Nokoshi lays on the steel table, he feels
unsure, but proceeds with the experiment anyway,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.980
seeing that he has nothing to lose.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.090
The next morning, Nokoshi wakes up in his
car as if nothing has happened, but he feels

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.799
the wound on his forehead.

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.220
He goes to dinner with Ito, where he barrages
him with questions and evaluations.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.090
He bids Ito goodbye and he reminds him that
they still have six more days of observation.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.770
Nokoshi makes his way back, thinking about
his weird situation.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.020
As he’s walking, a gust of wind blows into
his right eye and he covers it, rubbing away

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.150
the dust.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.080
When he looks up with only his left eye, he’s
shocked to see the people transform around

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.160
him into different shapes, sizes, and creatures.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.759
He frantically wanders around the street with
one eye covered, terrified at the horror he’s

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:44.759
witnessing.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.280
Suddenly, he bumps into a large robot homunculus
that turns out to be a yakuza boss.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.020
The henchmen pin him to a wall as the boss
brandishes his knife.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.900
Just as the boss threatens to cut off his
pinkie, Nokoshi has a vision.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.780
He pleads with the boss to stop what he’s
doing before he cuts his own finger.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.610
The boss stops and starts trembling and crying.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.240
The henchmen are confused and let Nokoshi
go and they scutter away.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.290
Nokoshi goes immediately to Ito and tells
him about what happened and the human-monster

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.969
hybrids that he saw.

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:17.709
Ito is excited and concludes this sixth sense
as a side effect of the trepanation.

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.969
He asks Nokoshi if he can see him as a monster,
but he only says that he sees nothing because

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.900
Ito is invisible.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.660
On the third day, Nokoshi manages to get his
car back and meets up again with Ito.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.470
Ito calls the monsters “homunculus,” and
concludes that the homunculus is how people

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.470
see themselves.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.489
It’s a horrific version of them created
by deep stress and trauma.

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.400
They conduct more research by going to a brothel,
where, according to Ito, a lot of people have

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.000
deep issues and trauma.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.871
Nokoshi sees only one homunculus, a girl with
the number tag, 1775, and calls her a sand

00:02:49.871 --> 00:02:50.950
monster.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.909
They follow her to a cafe and Ito quickly
feels a strong attraction towards her and

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.739
decides to approach her.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.650
Nokoshi watches the encounter with one eye
and sees the sand being sucked by Ito’s

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.040
invisible body.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.299
The girl leaves and Nokoshi confronts a dejected
Ito.

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.709
He sees that Ito has red dots all over his
body and he quickly leaves, but not before

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.279
handing Nokoshi a cellphone that he managed
to swipe from the girl.

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.809
Nokoshi spends the night in his car going
through the girl’s phone.

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:20.569
He learns about her strict parents and the
alternate social media account that she keeps

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.769
where she posts about her sexual fantasies
and pictures of self-harm.

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.430
Suddenly, some men appear around his car.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.480
The henchmen take him to their boss, who asks
Nokoshi about what he did to him.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.519
The boss doesn’t like to feel vulnerable
so he drags Nokoshi up by the collar, threatening

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.000
him with a knife.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.459
Nokoshi then has a vision of his trauma.

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.199
It turns out that the boss accidentally cut
off his friend’s pinky finger with a sickle

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.439
while they were arguing over a toy.

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.340
He ran away and didn’t apologize to his
friend, and this memory haunted him for the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.829
rest of his life.

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.669
The boss breaks down as he recalls the memory
and his robot homunculus starts breaking apart,

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.889
revealing a fragile little boy inside.

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:03.139
The robot returns to its miniature size and
the boss, as his child self, bows down to

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.669
the floor, crying and apologizing to his friend.

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:10.089
He thanks Nokoshi, quits the yakuza and breaks
off his own pinky.

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:12.650
Later that night, the phone starts ringing.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.879
He meets up with the girl at his car.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.560
She asks for her phone and begins taunting
him.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.590
He looks at her with one eye and sees the
sand monster, but as he looks closely, it

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.889
isn’t sand at all, but rather millions of
text symbols.

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.540
He soon learns that the girl is traumatized
by her strict parents and uses sex to rebel,

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.949
taunting virgins like Ito into giving in.

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.120
But Nokoshi is no virgin and he pins the sand
monster on the seat of the car and penetrates

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.120
her.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.900
The sand-like material starts disappearing,
revealing the cuts that the girl made on her

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.930
body.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.919
Nokoshi tries to suck the blood out but she
stops him, sucking back the blood from his

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.400
mouth frantically.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.280
The sand completely disappears and the girl
returns to her normal, non-monster state.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.840
The next morning, Nokoshi is shocked to see
that he has absorbed the others’ traumas.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.460
His hand has now turned robotic and his leg
is composed of sand.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.479
He runs to the hospital where Ito interns
and is asked to wait in line.

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.410
He then sees a faceless woman.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.960
He falls back, shocked at her face, but at
the same time, he can’t help but feel like

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.419
he’s seen her before.

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.430
Ito arrives and takes him to his examination
room.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.340
He tells Nokoshi about a woman who absorbed
the homunculi too and then killed herself.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.870
Nokoshi doesn’t want to die seeing these
monsters so he threatens Ito to close the

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.419
hole in his forehead.

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.469
Ito agrees on one condition, that he tells
him what his homunculus is.

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:32.919
Nokoshi leaves and the memory of the woman
lingers in his mind.

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.410
He rummages through his car and finds a business
card signed by one named, “Nanako.”

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.909
The memory comes rushing back to him and he
remembers her from an encounter at a bar.

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.740
He remembers loving her, moving in together,
and just being with her.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.860
With his newfound memory, Nokoshi traces Nanako
back at the hospital.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.120
He approaches her and it turns out that she
has amnesia too and doesn’t remember him.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.479
To help her remember, he takes her to their
old apartment.

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.860
Together they reminisce through their old
stuff as Nokoshi fills in the empty spaces

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.129
in her memory.

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:06.350
Nanako breaks down for a moment, but Nokoshi
reassures her with a kiss.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.110
Later that night, the two make love, signaling
their reunion.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.759
Unbeknownst to Nokoshi, Ito has been calling
him all day.

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:18.819
On the sixth day, Nokoshi wakes up with Nanako
in his arms and his own homunculus gone.

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:23.090
As he hugs her, he notices the same wound
on her forehead, revealing that she had also

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.030
undergone the trepanation experiment by Ito.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.979
He drives back to Ito’s room but finds him
gone.

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.860
He ransacks his office, looking for clues,
and notices a framed family picture.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.780
His phone rings and it’s Ito.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.060
Nokoshi confronts him and learns that Ito
knew about him and Nanako all along.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.870
Ito also tells him that all the homunculus
he’s been seeing were illusions of his own

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:44.870
world.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.930
Before their call ends, Ito tells Nokoshi
that the real Nanako will remember the real

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.139
world soon and that sometimes, some memories
are better left unremembered.

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:57.960
Determined to save the love of his life, Nokoshi
searches for the drill in Ito’s office.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.819
Meanwhile, Ito arrives at their apartment,
but this time, a different woman wearing Nanako’s

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:04.319
clothes opens the door.

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.950
He smiles at her and calls her by her real
name, “Chichiro.”

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.680
Back at the office, Nokoshi drills the hole
back into his forehead.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.779
As he looks at himself in the mirror, his
ability has returned, and once again he sees

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:18.400
his robotic arm and sandy leg.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.810
Nokoshi returns to their apartment and is
shocked to see an unknown woman wearing Nanako’s

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:23.810
clothes.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.620
As he looks closely at her with one eye, the
woman’s face alternates between the stranger

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.279
and the woman he loves.

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:33.289
He begs her to tell her who she is and she
admits to killing the real Nanako.

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:36.150
As he touches her, he’s sucked into another
vision.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.860
Chichiro is driving with her boyfriend at
night and after an argument, she tries to

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.300
get out of the car.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.879
He stops her and in turn, doesn’t see Nanako
running into the road.

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:49.060
Chichiro is thrown out of the car as her boyfriend
hits Nanako and Nokoshi.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.830
Chichiro watches in horror as her boyfriend
dies instantly and sees the dead body of Nanako.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.749
In turn, Nokoshi remembers his own memories
of that night.

00:07:57.749 --> 00:08:01.150
They had an argument and he soon learns that
she had a miscarriage.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.340
She runs outside and he pursues her, but it’s
too late.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.360
They run straight into Chichiro and her boyfriend’s
car.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.710
Chichiro apologizes and tells him her real
name before she collapses.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.270
After tucking her in bed, Nokoshi faces Ito
in the living room, giving him patronizing

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.319
remarks.

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:21.999
At this point, Nokoshi feels defeated, now
with Nanako dead, he literally has nothing

00:08:21.999 --> 00:08:23.300
to live for.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.159
As Ito continues to taunt him, Nokoshi finally
reveals that his homunculus is water.

00:08:28.159 --> 00:08:32.760
At first, it seems like Ito’s invisible,
but when gets nervous, bubbles rise up from

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.949
inside him.

00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:37.459
Ito is shocked and faces him, denying his
accusations.

00:08:37.459 --> 00:08:42.529
As Nokoshi looks at him, Ito’s water figure
resembles his father and a goldfish appears.

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:46.139
He grabs Ito by the arm and sees the visions
of his real trauma.

00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:50.590
As a kid, Ito’s father kept a pet goldfish
and paid more attention to it than his own

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:51.590
son.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.070
Ito is starved with love and even colors his
skin to resemble scales.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:59.709
One day, fed up with his father’s inattention,
Ito deliberately breaks the fishbowl, leaving

00:08:59.709 --> 00:09:00.910
the fish to die.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:06.000
Meanwhile, the grown-up Ito trembles and falls
to his knees, begging Nokoshi to help him,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.690
since he’s the only one who can actually
see the real him, and that he can finally

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.820
prove to his father that he’s worth paying
attention to.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.790
Nokoshi tells him that it’s no use, the
homunculus is gone, and that they should just

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.660
look at the other person, and create their
own world.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.100
Ito breaks down crying and despite everything
he’s done, Nokoshi hugs him and comforts

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.949
him, understanding the pain of not being seen.

00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:30.899
On the seventh day, Ito drills hole into his
own forehead and stitch his other eye shut

00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:32.770
as he looks at the sunrise.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:44.980
Nokoshi gets together with Chichiro and even
though he sometimes still sees Nanako, the

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.730
homunculus is now gone.
