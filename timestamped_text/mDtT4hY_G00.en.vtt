00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.280
Hello, everybody. Welcome to my channel.Hello,&nbsp;
everybody. Welcome to my channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.520
Today I am going to explain a South African film&nbsp;
called escape from Pretoria. The film starts with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.960
the voice over of Tim Jenkin who explains the&nbsp;
status of apartheid in South Africa in 1978.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.320
The police were shooting the black protestors&nbsp;
like dogs, all democratic opposition was silenced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.280
with brut force. While the white people enjoyed&nbsp;
their peaceful life with their white only beach,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.800
the black population was perishing. Two white&nbsp;
boys, Tim Jenkin and his friend Stephen Lee,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.640
were the members of the African National Congress,&nbsp;
which wanted a non-segregated South Africa.Jenkin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.600
and Lee actively take part in the ANC’s work,&nbsp;
whose motto was to establish equal rights to all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.120
South Africans, black, white and Asians. Jenkin&nbsp;
proclaims that freedom can’t be begged, it has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.880
to be fought. Now he and Lee plant leaflet bombs&nbsp;
across the cape town spreading the message of ANC.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.120
Shortly after that, both were arrested. His&nbsp;
girlfriend, Daphne, hurriedly meets him in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.080
police station. She gives him some money and&nbsp;
asks him not to appeal against the jail term.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.000
Jenkin proudly states that he will&nbsp;
never ask mercy from fascists.The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.200
local judge scolds both of them and says the&nbsp;
government of South Africa has given them all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.440
the necessary facilities to live a peaceful&nbsp;
and prosperous life, instead of using it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.200
they are wasting it on terrorist activities. He&nbsp;
sentences Tim Jenkin and Stephen Lee to 12 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.080
and 8 years of imprisonment respectively.
Shocked at the judgement, Lee tries to escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.640
the court by jumping from the window, but he&nbsp;
gets caught again. Now both are transferred to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.240
the central jail for white political criminals&nbsp;
in Pretoria. On arrival, jail captain Schnepel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.000
welcomes them with the taunt that they are the&nbsp;
white Mandela, the most disillusioned ones.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.880
Now jail warden Mango instructs them all&nbsp;
the rules, no parcel larger than 6”X4”,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.360
no sexual activity of any kind, one visit per&nbsp;
month with prior approval, at 11 PM lights off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.520
at 5 AM bell, 7:30 AM breakfast. Jenkin&nbsp;
starts to observe all the doors and their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.720
working mechanisms from outside to his cabin.&nbsp;
There were many doors, all had different keys,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.840
his and other prisoners cabin had&nbsp;
two lock doors with the same key.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.280
DAY 1

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.720
On their first day, veteran political prisoner&nbsp;
Denis Goldberg, who was sentenced to four life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.720
terms with Nelson Mandela and Sisulu, introduces&nbsp;
himself to Jenkin and Lee. He gives a quick tour&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.400
of the prison. Jenkin asks him the weak points&nbsp;
to break out. He was planning for the escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.480
Goldberg tells him that there are&nbsp;
none, they all are political prisoners.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.000
Prisoners of conscience. They have chosen to&nbsp;
complete their term, he suggests that they do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.960
the same. The Jenkin disagrees, says he is&nbsp;
a prisoner of war and sticks to his plan.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.000
Another prisoner, Leonard Fontaine, secretly&nbsp;
tells Jenkin and Lee that he will support&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.120
them if they come up with an actionable plan.&nbsp;
Jenkin gives money to Goldberg for safe keeping.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.800
DAY 23

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.400
Jenkin thinks about escaping day and night.&nbsp;
He starts with a sketch of his cabin’s key.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.040
He decides that the best way to escape the&nbsp;
prison is to make duplicate keys of all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.680
doors from his room to the outer yard. He&nbsp;
shares his idea with Leonard who at first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.240
quashes it as the stupidest idea, but with no&nbsp;
other options available, he supports Jenkin.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.040
Jenkin says in order to make duplicate keys,&nbsp;
he has to see the key structure thoroughly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.280
The keys were always with warden mongo,&nbsp;
he used to hang them at his belt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.640
Jenkin starts observing those keys for many days,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.120
he starts drawing their structure on paper&nbsp;
at his cabin. He does it for many days.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.880
DAY 74

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.160
After observing for many days, Jenkin now&nbsp;
starts to make those keys in a wooden workshop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.000
This workshop was set up to produce&nbsp;
goods for the general public.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.400
After completing his cabin's key,&nbsp;
he secretly brings it to his cabin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.560
At night he tries to open his cabin door. To&nbsp;
his surprise and disbelief, it actually works.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.840
He feels accomplished, but his feelings live&nbsp;
for a short time as the cabin had two doors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.840
the other one can only be unlocked from outside.&nbsp;
He shares this news with Lee and Leonard. They all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.720
continue to help him to find the key structure&nbsp;
for the outer door too. It takes several days.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.480
DAY 100

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.080
At this stage, Jenkin makes&nbsp;
the key for the outer door too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.040
The news of his keys spreads like a wild&nbsp;
fire, all his fellow prisoners know about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.240
They also help him. One day during the&nbsp;
floor cleaning, Jenkin tries to test&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.720
his key from outside, it works, but due to&nbsp;
poor quality wood, it gets stuck in the key&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.400
hole. He hurriedly removes it, but he was not&nbsp;
able to turn back the hatch. In the morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.760
warden mongo sees the open hatch, and he thinks&nbsp;
this as his mistake yesterday. He ignores it.&nbsp;

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.600
Now, Leonard gets a 30-minute visit from&nbsp;
his 5-year-old son. But here prison guards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.800
canceled this meeting after a few minutes with&nbsp;
lame excuses. This makes Leonard very furious.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.040
DAY 142

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.200
Leonard was getting agitated and sick with passing&nbsp;
days. When all three were discussing how to open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.400
the outer door from the inside, Lee suggested&nbsp;
an idea with a cleaning stick. Its length was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.040
sufficient for someone to use it through the&nbsp;
window adjacent to the door. Jenkin now makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.440
an attachment to the stick which can rotate when&nbsp;
used horizontally, converting the linear motion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.880
into rotational motion. Jenkin, after many&nbsp;
attempts, successfully opens the outer door.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.120
He and Lee now hide the keys in a bottle for&nbsp;
others. In the meantime, Goldberg warns Jenkin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.320
to be extra careful in dealing. As he could&nbsp;
easily get another 25 years for escaping.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.840
He warns about a sniper who&nbsp;
recently got transferred here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.720
Goldberg assures him of all the help he could do.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.560
After a few days, Jenkin&nbsp;
makes a key for another door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.360
He shares this news with others, they think&nbsp;
that it's too risky, there are many unknowns.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.320
Jenkin now smuggles soaps, cigarettes and&nbsp;
other goods with the help from a black janitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.400
The janitor agrees to smuggle civilian clothes&nbsp;
in exchange for money. This goes on for days.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:03.200
DAY 296.Warden Mango gives a new set of&nbsp;
glasses to Jenkins, which he asked for.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.480
Now for many nights Jenkin, Lee and Leonard have&nbsp;
been trying to unlock all the doors in their way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.840
They were successful in evading the night&nbsp;
guards. One night on a routine visit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.400
a jail guard sees clusters of sweat drops on the&nbsp;
floor but fails to find out how they got there.Due&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.320
to sleep deprivation one morning, Jenkin&nbsp;
sleeps late. Captain Schnepel orders a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.000
check-up of Jenkin's cabin, he finds a small&nbsp;
wooden prototype of a key. On inquiring Jenkin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.240
lies it as a stand for his parents photos. Jenkins&nbsp;
and others continue their mission every night.DAY&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.680
404.Now all the three have successfully&nbsp;
obtained all the keys required to escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.360
They also now had a map which showed&nbsp;
the direction once they are out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.480
They meet up with Goldberg and his colleges,&nbsp;
and he requests them to join them in escaping.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.840
Goldberg refuses it, he says he is a prisoner&nbsp;
of conscience, he will suffer like Mandela and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.400
accept its consequence. Jenkin tries hard but&nbsp;
fails.In the night Jenkin, Lee and Leonard open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.280
doors one by one. They change their clothes with&nbsp;
the civilian clothes which they have smuggled.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.320
Goldberg was also not sleeping, during the&nbsp;
night he intentionally broke his room bulb.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.760
He starts calling the night guard in order&nbsp;
to distract him. Ceasing this distraction,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.440
all three successfully unlocks all the doors and&nbsp;
escape the prison. They even evade the psychopath&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.960
sniper.After going out, the carefully walks&nbsp;
across the town, then runs towards the taxi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.240
stand. Jenkin hires a black taxi driver. The&nbsp;
driver says white taxis are down the road,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.440
Jenkin tells him not to bother about it and offers&nbsp;
generous money to take them out of town.During&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.080
the morning rounds, the warden finds out&nbsp;
that three have escaped and sets the alarm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.040
The film ends with these three rejoicings in&nbsp;
their freedom.The end credits say all three have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.280
successfully crossed the border to Mozambique,&nbsp;
from there to Tanzania and then to London.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:00.320
Denis Goldberg was released after 22 years in&nbsp;
1985. The police arrested Jenkin’s girlfriend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:06.960
Daphane for nine days, she never saw Jenkin again.&nbsp;
Apartheid was over in 1992 and Nelson Mandela&nbsp;&nbsp;
