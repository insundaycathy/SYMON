but he warns jake not to visit him that day&nbsp;
because it is dangerous over the phone abe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.520
seems paranoid and frantic but this does not&nbsp;
bother jake as he knows that his grandfather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.320
is diagnosed with dementia at the street of&nbsp;
abe's house jake and shelley spot a man with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.200
white eyes in the middle of the road the man's&nbsp;
eyes are white and he gives off a menacing vibe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.920
as they make it to the house he finds out that it&nbsp;
is wholly ransacked and abe is nowhere to be found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.480
he alarmed shelly that someone broke in&nbsp;
so she goes back to the car to find a gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.480
in the nearby woods jake sees abe's flashlight&nbsp;
from a distance he comes toward it to investigate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.440
and finds out that it is completely drenched in&nbsp;
blood he goes deeper into the woods and sees his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.880
grandfather lying unconscious with his eyes&nbsp;
missing jake contacts 9-1-1 to ask for help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.520
in the middle of the call abe grabs jake's&nbsp;
arm to warn him that he should go far away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.680
before his last breath he tells jake to go to the&nbsp;
island and go to the loop of september 3rd 1943.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.720
jake is very puzzled by his grandfather's&nbsp;
words but he promises to do as he says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.320
anyway abe dies on the spot as shelley approaches&nbsp;
them a sinister looking creature emerges from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.680
behind shelley shoots but it appears that nothing&nbsp;
is there and only jay can see it after the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.880
traumatic incident jake goes to therapy for mental&nbsp;
assessment he explains to his therapist that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.240
is not sure if something is wrong with him the&nbsp;
whole situation of age death deeply confuses him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.280
this takes a toll on his mental well-being he&nbsp;
recalls the time when abe told him fantastical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.560
stories about encountering monsters and other&nbsp;
mythical creatures however jake's father frank was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.600
not too keen on the stories that abe told whenever&nbsp;
abe told stories about a group home for children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.120
managed by miss peregrine he also showed pictures&nbsp;
to jake according to abe he used to live in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.720
magical home every child in the house is unique&nbsp;
in their ways they possess strange abilities far&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.760
from human knowledge little jake asked dave&nbsp;
why he got sent to that island he explained&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.640
that it was because of monsters jake significantly&nbsp;
believed that he even shared them with his peers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.680
because of this he became a laughingstock as&nbsp;
jake grew older he stopped believing abe's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.320
stories his grandfather was deeply saddened&nbsp;
by this but understood everyone's doubts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.120
while putting things in boxes frank tells jake&nbsp;
that while abe was a good grandfather he was not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.480
a great husband and father after they drive home&nbsp;
jake's family and other relatives surprise him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.880
for his birthday he does not seem thrilled&nbsp;
and it somewhat overwhelmed him negatively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.680
instead of mingling with other people jake&nbsp;
heads straight to his room he is not entirely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.880
free because his aunt enters and gives him a book&nbsp;
from abe the book is by ralph waldo emerson which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.560
contains a postcard from miss peregrine welcoming&nbsp;
him to return her home is located in cairnham an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.080
island situated in wales his parents consult dr&nbsp;
golon about going to the island she encourages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.320
jake's parents to allow him to go there for&nbsp;
him to be able to separate reality from fantasy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.240
also to properly have closure on abe's sudden&nbsp;
death on the ferry jake and frank spot a peregrine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.120
bird just above them in abe's stories he used to&nbsp;
say that miss peregrine could turn into a bird&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.160
remembering that jake jokingly shouts and&nbsp;
introduces himself to the bird as abe's grandson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.360
they reach the island and a foggy and dull&nbsp;
atmosphere welcomes them both of them stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.560
at an old pub that also accommodates travelers&nbsp;
jake looks around the place as the owners arrive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.520
it frightens him jay convinces his father&nbsp;
to let him go to the home of miss peregrine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.520
both of them approach a group of youngsters to&nbsp;
ask if some of them could guide jake to the side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.960
of the island that he wants to see they agree&nbsp;
as frank hands them some cash dylan and worm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.840
his guides accompany jake to the place they&nbsp;
decide to take a shortcut the two make fun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.240
of jake and point in the direction of the house&nbsp;
while they wait by the road finally he sees the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.200
house and finds out that it is already in ruins he&nbsp;
returns to the pub disappointed auggie a blind man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.120
explains to jake that the germans actually bombed&nbsp;
the house on september 3 1943. he continues to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.240
that none of the children survived including miss&nbsp;
peregrine the following day jake asked permission&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.800
from his father if he could go and hang out with&nbsp;
the teenagers he met yesterday his father agrees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.360
and thinks that it is a fantastic idea given&nbsp;
that jake lacks friends but jake heads to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.320
children's home instead he looks at the pictures&nbsp;
covered in dirt and examines the area even more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.120
he sees a staircase and decides to go upstairs out&nbsp;
of nowhere he sees a silhouette of a young lady&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.960
she calls him abe this shocks jake making him&nbsp;
run downstairs he starts to notice other children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.080
peeking at him jake dashes out of the house&nbsp;
but he trips and falls unconscious he wakes up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.800
to find himself being carried by bronwyn a little&nbsp;
girl with incredible strength he then meets other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.080
children that abe told him about emma the girl&nbsp;

boy jake accuses them of being dead but they deny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.040
it he asks them if he's dead but they also say no&nbsp;
the children got into a cave where the portal is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.280
located as he exits the cave he runs to the pub&nbsp;
where they checked in however it is now filled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.960
with customers the pub manager does not let him go&nbsp;
upstairs where his staff are supposed to be jake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.360
is puzzled by what is happening as customers of&nbsp;
the pub threaten him and conspire that he is a spy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.600
out of nowhere plates and glasses of beer smash&nbsp;
the walls of the pub the peculiar children arrive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.200
and intervene to rescue jake out of there he&nbsp;
quickly realized he is stuck in the 1943 loop for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.560
now he sees warplanes overhead as the pub catches&nbsp;
fire because of olive they ride a carriage on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

surround the house jake is then brought to&nbsp;
meet miss peregrine herself she is a clever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.360
and insightful woman who gives too much attention&nbsp;
to time it's because she has the power to control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.160
and preserve it she shares her deepest condolences&nbsp;
to jake as they prepare for some cup of tea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.160

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.480

them a timid smile and returns to the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.080
emma shows jaker ability but before that he&nbsp;
ties a rope around her waist she unbuckles her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.040
metal shoes and starts levitating to put a baby&nbsp;
squirrel back in the tree jake pulls her down as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.680
she wears her shoes again emma tells jake that&nbsp;
abe used to do it for her and called it his job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.720
obviously she is deeply devastated by&nbsp;
abe's death and still has not moved on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.080
in one of the rooms jake meets enoch the boy who&nbsp;
can bring the dead back to life for a brief time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.280
he is the most intimidating among the children&nbsp;
he shows off this talent using two small skeletal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.760
puppets with tiny hearts that fight each other&nbsp;
for a short moment jake watches as the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.280
puppets have a brawl emma helps jake get ready for&nbsp;
dinner by lending him a tie and fixing it for him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.400

the air because of hugh but he wears a hat&nbsp;
to prevent it the children ask jake what the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.520
future looks like but miss peregrine interrupts by&nbsp;
saying that they should not talk about the future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.440
they all continue to eat except for claire but&nbsp;
jake encourages her to be herself she smiles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:05.440
and eats the food from behind her neck emma walks&nbsp;
out after enoch brings up even howe he left miss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:11.200
peregrine receives a phone call from young abe&nbsp;
in the living room horace's dreams are projected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.320
although it is primarily random his dreams also&nbsp;
predict the future they see a woman being wheeled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.600
away by villainous men he dreams of emma and&nbsp;
jake sharing a kiss which makes miss peregrine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.760
shut down the projector they all head outside for&nbsp;
the reset they are stuck on september 3rd 1943&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.960
during the world war ii raids moments before a&nbsp;
bomb would drop on the house and kill everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.800
they wear a mask and look at the&nbsp;
planes overhead waiting for the bomb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.360
before it could fall miss peregrine&nbsp;
sets the clock back to 24 hours earlier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.600
they cannot live outside the loop or else their&nbsp;
years will catch up to them and they will die&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.360
emma brings jake back to the cave he shows her&nbsp;
what a phone is they take a picture together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.720
meanwhile the bird then flies into the cave and&nbsp;
hits the wall emma brings it back to the home to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:02.160
be treated jake walks back and sees his father&nbsp;
looking for him all around a farmer calls them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.360
over to ask about his sheep who have all died&nbsp;
mysteriously they return to the room and jake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.920
finds a letter that abe wrote to miss peregrine&nbsp;
which warns her about someone named mr baron and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:17.120
tells miss avacet another headmistress of a home&nbsp;
peculiars to create a new loop as soon as possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.160
jake and frank head to the beach and meet&nbsp;
an ornithologist who researches rare birds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.440
this discourages frank from taking photos of birds&nbsp;
and he decides to stay in the room to sleep this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:33.280
gives jake a chance to sneak out miss peregrine is&nbsp;
treating the bird who is truly miss abbas the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.320
woman seen in horus's dream and an one brine just&nbsp;
like miss peregrine which gives them an ability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:44.400
to turn into birds jake questions miss peregrine&nbsp;
about baron but she avoids giving answers he comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:50.160
across enoch and olive enoch brings jake over to&nbsp;
victor's room bronwyn's brother who was killed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:55.520
the same creature as abe his eyes are missing and&nbsp;
enoch reanimates him like a puppet to scare jake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.000
he runs downstairs and sees the rest of the&nbsp;
children about to go for their daily walks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.680
back in the home miss peregrine visits victor and&nbsp;
gives him a motherly hug even though he is now a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.560
lifeless body emma takes jake to her secret&nbsp;
hideout which is a sunken ship deep beneath&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.760
the ocean jake thinks that emma would drown&nbsp;
but she didn't she blows him an air bubble so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.760
he could breathe underwater and then blows&nbsp;
the water out of the ship the shipwreck is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:25.680
now completely dry she brings out a box that even&nbsp;
trusted to her emma shows jake photos of palette&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:31.360
people including mr barron whom jake recognizes&nbsp;
as the man outside abe's house the night he died&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.080
she reveals that baron is the leader of bad&nbsp;
peculiars and he hunts down loops in order to kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.040
emma then tells jake that he belongs to the&nbsp;
peculiar world he denies it and says that he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.320
ordinary to convince him brings jake to watch miss&nbsp;
peregrine walk with her crossbow over by a spot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.840
with a chalk outline of a creature she is trying&nbsp;
to hunt down the beast that killed victor a tall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.320
eyeless monster similar to the one jake saw&nbsp;
in the woods emerges but it is only visible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.960
to him miss peregrine shoots the gruesome&nbsp;
creature with an arrow and it falls perfectly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.920
into the outline emma realizes that jake's&nbsp;
peculiarity is being able to see these monsters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.560
back at the house emma brings miss peregrine&nbsp;
her book to explain who these creatures are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.600
she reveals that baron and his cronies are&nbsp;
hologast a different group of peculiars that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.320
hunt the good ones to live beyond the loops and&nbsp;
live forever she continues to tell that baron&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.120
performed an experiment using miss avacet because&nbsp;
of her powers but it backfired and turned him in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.760
the other hollows into monsters they managed to&nbsp;
return to their human forms by consuming the eyes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:35.040
of other peculiars especially the children the&nbsp;
more eyes they eat the more human-like they appear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:41.200
this gives jake the realization that baron ate his&nbsp;
grandfather's eyes miss avacet awakens and has now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.560
taken her human form afraid that baron will come&nbsp;
after the children miss peregrine decides it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.280
time to leave and find a new home in lope emma&nbsp;
and jake argue because he does not want to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.560
with them to another loop he decides to go back&nbsp;
through the portal jake returns by the beach and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.360
finds frank worried sick auggie is found dead by&nbsp;
the rocks with his eyes missing as if something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:07.120
attacked him jake realizes that he has to warn&nbsp;
the peculiars his father stops him and says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.320
it is dangerous to roam around when a lunatic is&nbsp;
at large however jake run into the cave and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.840
ornithologist follows him jake hears the man&nbsp;
and the man admits that he is also peculiar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.560
he then takes the form and appearance of dr&nbsp;
golon before revealing himself to be barren&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.600
he introduces himself and continues to say that&nbsp;
he also saw jake at abe's home he turns his hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.560
into a blade and holds it to jake's throat to make&nbsp;
him do as he says while the peculiar children pack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.680
their things to transfer to another loop baron&nbsp;
forces jake to take him to miss peregrine's home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.520
miss peregrine opens the door and is&nbsp;
worried about the well-being of the children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.640
baron comes in and orders the children to come&nbsp;
to him however the children only listen to miss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.560
peregrine when she tells them to retreat for&nbsp;
their safety knowing that baron is waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.440
for his hollow friend to go after them jake being&nbsp;
able to see them is their only hope for survival&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.080
miss peregrine sacrifices herself to come&nbsp;
with baron accordingly in exchange for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:05.280
children's safety miss peregrine bids goodbye&nbsp;
to the children dramatically she asks jake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.520
to promise that he will do everything to look&nbsp;
after the children should anything happen to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:14.160
he nods and she turns into a bird so that&nbsp;
baron may catch her jake and miss avacet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.080
take the lead and help keep the children hidden&nbsp;
in darkness when the hollows decide to show up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:24.160
jake then answers the phone to hear a call from&nbsp;
young abe in 1943. abe does not know jake as he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.960
has not met him yet jay takes the time to say he&nbsp;
wished he could have been a better grandson to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:34.000
as miss avacet instructs the children what to do&nbsp;
she is pulled through a wall by the hollow the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.640
children shriek in fear jay guides the children to&nbsp;
safety and fights the hollow with miss peregrine's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.840
crossbow the hollow enters but it attacks&nbsp;
enoch after he tries to do something about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.360
jake struggles to aim correctly the hollow throws&nbsp;
enoch around the room using its long tentacles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.320
the children run to the attic as this happens&nbsp;
finally jake successfully shoots the hollow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.320 --> 00:14:00.000
down just before it gets enoch's eyes it continues&nbsp;
to follow them into the attic and bangs the door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.960
they try to go out the window as fiona controls a&nbsp;
tree so they can take refuge in it while they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:11.040
at the roof the hollow enters the attic they make&nbsp;
it to the tree safely eventually the german plane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:16.000
drops the bomb on the house killing the hollow&nbsp;
the loop then closes for good and the children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.560
can never return to that home forever without&nbsp;
knowing what to do they head to the beach and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.040
plan to leave the island all of the children&nbsp;
work together to raise emma's wrecked ship to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.760
surface so they may head over to blackpool where&nbsp;
there is another loop they use their strength and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:35.920
abilities to revive the ship successfully it works&nbsp;
and they are set for the sale emma explains that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.120
since this loop was created in january 2016 they&nbsp;
realize that they may prevent abe's death from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.840
happening if they kill baron there they show the&nbsp;
map to the rest of the peculiars and explain how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:51.520
timing is essential they are all in a race against&nbsp;
time they arrive at the pier of blackpool which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.320
is a place that is very unfamiliar to them all of&nbsp;
them go through a haunted house where the hollows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:01.280
are set to perform their experiment with miss&nbsp;
peregrine and other weinbrings jake and emma enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.160
the blackpool tower and try to lure some hollows&nbsp;
outside toward the pier emma unbuckles her shoes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.400
to catch baron's attention and reveals that they&nbsp;
manage to kill the hollow that attack their home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:16.320
they are successful at bringing the hollows to&nbsp;
the pier passersby are amazed to see emma levitate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.680
she gets stuck in one of the cable wires a train&nbsp;
is about to approach jake pulls her and saves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.800
her life one of the hollows following them gets&nbsp;
dragged by the train once the hollows reach the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:32.080
pier the peculiar children fight back they throw&nbsp;
snowballs and cotton candy at the hollows so they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:37.440
can be seen in broad daylight meanwhile enoch&nbsp;
brings some skeletons to life which chase the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.160
hollows and start slaying and fighting them this&nbsp;
all happens while non-peculiar people can see them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:48.320
the skeletons successfully bring multiple hollows&nbsp;
down in various ways bronwyn takes a horse off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.200
merry-go-round and throws it at a hollow throwing&nbsp;
him into the water people start panicking as they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:58.400
exit the amusement park all of them head to the&nbsp;
blackpool tower in hopes of saving miss peregrine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:03.040
the other children fight baron and his two&nbsp;
hollow friends emma blows a strong wind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.080
toward baron while hugh lets bees out to attack&nbsp;
the other hollows the female hollow climbs the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:13.680
bars and starts throwing knives at the children&nbsp;
as instructed by baron meanwhile enoch attacks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:20.000
but baron manages to stop him olive also tries to&nbsp;
set him on fire but he knocks her down after jake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.800
misses a shot with a crossbow bronwyn throws a&nbsp;
cinema chair at baron to distract him for a while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.160
baron manages to take the crossbow as horus&nbsp;
tries to flash a bright light at him but fails&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.240
the male hollow tries to freeze and drown&nbsp;
bronwyn under a pool of water but fiona&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:40.000
stops him by throwing seeds at him in a moment it&nbsp;
sprouts finds that wrap around and strangles him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.800
on the way to the weinbrins emma manages to bid&nbsp;
time by blowing a strong breeze toward baron again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.840
olive tries to free bronwyn but the male hollow&nbsp;
starts to freeze olive up which is her weakness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.880
enoch manages to bring an elephant puppet&nbsp;
to life and uses it to crush the hollow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.200
the female hala tries to attack the younger&nbsp;
ones but she turns to stone after the twins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.960
remove their masks and stare at her olive turns&nbsp;
frozen and ice cold enoch says his apologies for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:10.320
not being able to protect her when it looks like&nbsp;
she's dead olive is revived in response to enoch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:16.560
exhausted for giving out too much air emma stops&nbsp;
making baron able to function again jake frees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:21.440
the wine brings and angers baron the birds fly&nbsp;
freely to find and create other loops to bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.720
the children to safety emma and enoch see jake&nbsp;
but baron also takes jake's form to trick them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:32.960
now confused jake must prove that he is the real&nbsp;
one both of them take turns in talking one hollow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:38.160
appears from behind jake is able to prove himself&nbsp;
when he spots the last hollow walking behind them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.200
it attacks baron and eats his eyes thinking that&nbsp;
it was jake they managed to take the hollow down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.000
using a crossbow the children then leave board&nbsp;
the ship to stay within their loop but jake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.360
knows it means he cannot see them again one by&nbsp;
one the peculiars hug jake as they bid farewell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.640
emma tries to console jake that they will be&nbsp;
safe now that baron is gone they hug each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:04.480
and emma leaves abe checks his phone as the peer&nbsp;
changes over time and as time loops upon returning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.800
to florida jake goes by his grandfather's&nbsp;
house and realizes that he is still alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.600
he tells abe all about his experiences&nbsp;
with miss peregrine's home and the children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.800
abe gives jake his birthday present the emerson&nbsp;
book it contains a lot of money for his journey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.520
he persuades jake to go after the children as he&nbsp;
belongs there jake runs on the docks to catch up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.240
to the children's ship he finds emma and explains&nbsp;
that he went through different loops in different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.520
cities over different years he went to multiple&nbsp;
cities around the world to see her again she stops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:39.600
and kisses him as he joins them on their travels&nbsp;
miss peregrine flies overhead and stops at a tower&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.440
she finally finds the children and flies&nbsp;
over to their ship to reunite with them again&nbsp;&nbsp;
