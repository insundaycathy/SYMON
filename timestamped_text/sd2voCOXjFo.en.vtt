00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.960
Welcome back to Movie Recapped. Today I&nbsp;
will show you a comedy film from 1994,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.560
titled Dumb and Dumber. Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.400
The film opens in Rhode Island, where a limousine&nbsp;
is pulling up next to a bus stop. When the rear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.120
door window is lowered, we meet our protagonist,&nbsp;
Lloyd Christmas, who asks a girl at the stop for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.360
directions to the medical school - he's supposed&nbsp;
to give a lecture there and his driver is lost.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.360
The girl explains to him how to get there&nbsp;
with a heavy accent, which Lloyd compliments.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.920
She tells him she's from Austria, and completely&nbsp;
misunderstanding, Lloyd speaks again faking an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.480
Australian accent and slang instead. The girl&nbsp;
obviously is turned off by this so she turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.720
him down, and Lloyd pulls up the window again,&nbsp;
only to put on the driver's cap and move back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.920
to the wheel. As Lloyd gets back to the road, he&nbsp;
drives by a fast food joint where his best friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.040
Harry Dunne, is getting some food back to his van&nbsp;
- both he and the vehicle are dressed up as dogs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.440
As he hits the road too, he feeds sandwiches to&nbsp;
the dogs he's groomed. His driving gets reckless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.120
when he gets a call saying that he's late to&nbsp;
the show he's supposed to be taking the dogs to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.600
which causes the dogs to slide all over&nbsp;
the van. Meanwhile, Lloyd is arriving at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.400
a very fancy house. After parking the limo, he&nbsp;
knocks on the door in a rather obnoxious way and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.680
it's opened by his client Mary Swanson, whom he&nbsp;
immediately gets infatuated with. A moment later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.920
when both are in the limo on their way to the&nbsp;
airport, Lloyd tries to get a conversation going.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.080
Mary mentions she's going to Aspen, and Lloyd&nbsp;
comments on him and Harry saving money to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.960
their own pet shop that specializes in worm farms.&nbsp;
Mary is incredibly tense during the whole trip,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.280
which she blames on flying nerves, but&nbsp;
it's obviously a lie. Back to Harry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.160
after some very intense driving, he finally makes&nbsp;
it to the dog show, where one of the dog owners is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.880
extremely worried about her pet's looks, but Harry&nbsp;
promises he's groomed them all perfectly. When he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.840
opens the door, however, all the dogs are covered&nbsp;
in condiments. In the meantime, Lloyd and Mary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.960
make it to the airport. After giving her all her&nbsp;
bags, Lloyd offers Mary a hug, which she awkwardly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.360
takes but doesn't reciprocate. Lloyd returns&nbsp;
to his limo and Mary enters the airport, where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.360
henchmen Joe "Mental" Mentalino and J. P. Shay are&nbsp;
getting ready to pick up the suitcase Mary will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.320
be leaving near the escalator. Outside, Lloyd is&nbsp;
driving slowly in order to be able to look at Mary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.960
through the airport's glass walls, which causes&nbsp;
him to hit another car. This delay allows him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.360
to see Mary leaving the suitcase behind, and since&nbsp;
he thinks she's forgetting it by accident, he runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.680
out of the limo and enters the airport to snatch&nbsp;
the suitcase right under the henchmen's noses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.760
He then tries to take it back to Mary, for which&nbsp;
he enters the boarding area - but since the plane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.960
has already left, Lloyd falls out of the jetway.&nbsp;
Some hours later, Lloyd and Harry are returning to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.400
their apartment in a rather humble neighborhood,&nbsp;
and they've been followed by the henchmen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.960
who think they're working for someone powerful.&nbsp;
We see Mental is taking pills for his ulcer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.960
Inside the apartment, Lloyd and Harry share&nbsp;
the same news: they've both lost their jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.920
Harry asks Lloyd about the briefcase, he tells him&nbsp;
it's a love memento and that he can't get it open.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.000
Their chat is interrupted by the henchmen&nbsp;
knocking on their door, and after checking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.520
who it is through the peephole, they reach&nbsp;
the conclusion they're gas debt collectors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.680
so they take the suitcase and escape through the&nbsp;
window. The henchmen force their way inside and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.320
when they don't find the briefcase, they decide to&nbsp;
leave a message by decapitating Harry's parakeet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.000
Night has fallen by the time Harry and Lloyd&nbsp;
return to their place after spending their whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.800
day job hunting. Harry goes back to the apartment&nbsp;
with the suitcase while Lloyd goes to the store,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.960
promising to only get the bare essentials with&nbsp;
their last money. He ends up buying a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.440
knickknacks, and when he stops by a newspaper box,&nbsp;
he accidentally leaves his wallet inside while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.320
retrieving the magazine. He doesn't have change&nbsp;
to open the box again, so when he sees an old lady&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.960
passing by, he asks her to watch over his things&nbsp;
while he goes back to the store to break a dollar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.520
A moment later, he returns to the apartment&nbsp;
and tells Harry the old lady robbed him blind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.160
Harry mentions his parakeet died, and this makes&nbsp;
Lloyd snap. Tired of the dump they're living in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.960
he wants to leave and go to Aspen. Harry turns&nbsp;
down the idea when he realizes Lloyd only wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.520
to go after Mary, but after a heartfelt speech&nbsp;
from his friend, he accepts. They hit the road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.960
the next day, where Lloyd tells Harry that&nbsp;
he got some extra money from selling the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.320
dead parakeet to a blind kid. Meanwhile, back in&nbsp;
their building, the henchmen are visiting again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.160
only to find a note on the door apologizing&nbsp;
to the "gas man". This makes them think the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.840
friends are pros that have been following&nbsp;
them, because they know about Mental's ulcer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.480
They decide to follow them to Aspen. Back to Harry&nbsp;
and Lloyd, they've stopped at a diner to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.560
When Harry accidentally spills some salt, Lloyd&nbsp;
tells him it's bad luck and he should counter it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.440
by tossing salt over his shoulder. Lloyd throws&nbsp;
the entire shaker and hits a man, Sea Bass,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.920
who angrily comes over to the table and spits at&nbsp;
Harry's burger as revenge. The guys finish their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.640
meal but are still frustrated by what happened,&nbsp;
so Lloyd gets an idea. They go to Sea Bass' table&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.280
to apologize and offer to buy beers for Sea Bass&nbsp;
and his friends, which they accept. However, when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.040
they talk to the waitress, they tell her Sea Bass&nbsp;
has agreed to pay their bill and when the waitress&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.280
looks at his table, the men nod, thinking she's&nbsp;
wondering about the beers. That's enough for her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.840
to put their bill under Sea Bass' name. Shortly&nbsp;
afterward, the guys are successfully driving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.560
away from the diner as Sea Bass, his friends and&nbsp;
the waitresses try to go after them to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.720
Back on the road, Lloyd asks Harry to pull&nbsp;
over when possible because he needs to pee.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.480
Harry refuses, since he thinks that would give&nbsp;
Sea Bass the chance to catch up with them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.640
and tells Lloyd to pee into some empty beer&nbsp;
bottles - he ends up filling quite a few of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.120
A motor cop sees them drive by and follows&nbsp;
them to ask them to pull over. After parking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.000
he asks Harry for his license and notices the open&nbsp;
beer bottles, which are illegal to have in a car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.160
He tells them to hand them over and as soon as&nbsp;
he grabs one, the cop takes a sip, not listening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.640
to the guys' warnings. The taste is obviously&nbsp;
disgusting, so the cop lets them go before he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.440
retches on the road. We then cut to Aspen, where&nbsp;
Mary is chatting with her father Karl Swanson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.680
and her stepmother Helen Swanson. She doesn't&nbsp;
understand how the money she left at the airport&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.480
hasn't reached the kidnappers yet. At that moment,&nbsp;
a friend of the family arrives, Nicholas Andre.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.960
He thinks they should cancel the preservation&nbsp;
gala they were planning, but Karl disagrees:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.560
they should continue to act normally not&nbsp;
to alert the authorities and the press,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.120
otherwise the kidnappers could do something&nbsp;
drastic. Meanwhile, night has fallen on the road,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.160
Harry sleeps while Lloyd drives and daydreams&nbsp;
about Mary. He imagines himself arriving at Aspen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.920
getting together with Mary after returning the&nbsp;
briefcase to her, impressing her friends with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.000
jokes, fighting some waiters at a restaurant&nbsp;
for her honor, and taking Mary to his room to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.800
make love to her. He's snapped out of it by an&nbsp;
incoming truck that he dodges just in time. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.040
decide to spend the night at a love hotel, which&nbsp;
Harry tells Lloyd it brings back bad memories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.600
about an ex-girlfriend that left him for another&nbsp;
guy. He doesn't know whom, but Lloyd's faces tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.800
us it was him. Outside the hotel, we find the&nbsp;
henchmen. Mental is on the phone with his boss,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.520
who turns out to be Nicholas. While he talks to&nbsp;
him, a stranger keeps asking him to hurry up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.600
free the phone, so Mental punches him through the&nbsp;
booth glass before promising Nicholas he'll get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.320
that briefcase back. The next morning, the guys go&nbsp;
back to the road and find Mental next to his car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.960
pretending to be a hitchhiker while Shay hides to&nbsp;
follow them later. They accept to give him a ride,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.960
which means Mental ends up sitting between them&nbsp;
and being incredibly annoyed by their bickering,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.280
weird noises and bad singing. He's about to&nbsp;
take out his gun when the guys pick up even more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.480
hitchhikers, so Mental has no other choice but&nbsp;
to endure. Some hours later, they stop at another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.360
diner, where Mental convinces the guys to try the&nbsp;
chili papers. While they freak out over how spicy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.520
they are, Mental goes outside to call Nicholas&nbsp;
and tell him he'll kill the pair with rat poison.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.000
Then he returns to his table, where the guys&nbsp;
have secretly put a bunch of chilly papers on his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.640
burger. After discovering their possession of the&nbsp;
briefcase is a coincidence, he bites the burger,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.120
causing him to react adversely because of his&nbsp;
ulcer. Twitching on the floor, Mental asks for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.320
his pills, which Harry searches for while Lloyd&nbsp;
tries to give CPR. Harry grabs the wrong bottle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.200
however, and ends up giving Mental the rat poison,&nbsp;
effectively killing him. The guys rush out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.760
diner before the cops arrive. They talk to the&nbsp;
waitress and find out they must follow a sheepdog&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.280
car. Lloyd and Harry continue their road trip, and&nbsp;
when night falls, they stop to at a gas station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.760
While Lloyd goes to the bathroom, Harry refills&nbsp;
the gas tank and chats with Beth Jordan, who has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.320
parked next to him and is also going to Aspen.&nbsp;
He's so distracted by her that he spills gas on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.360
his legs and the floor. Meanwhile, Lloyd finds out&nbsp;
the stall he's at is used for intimacy and someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.160
arrives right in time for it: it's Sea Bass. We&nbsp;
cut back to Harry, who is still chatting with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.480
Beth and lends her a match to light her cigarette.&nbsp;
He throws the match to the floor and accidentally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.440
starts a fire on his wet pants, which makes him&nbsp;
snap at Beth, so she leaves. Harry runs to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.680
bathroom, where Sea Bass is making Lloyd fall&nbsp;
to his knees to use his mouth, but Harry knocks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.600
him out when he pushes the stall door open&nbsp;
to put his burning leg in the toiler water.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.840
Moments later, we see the police waiting for&nbsp;
them on the road to Colorado. But Lloyd has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.920
taken over the driving and he's too distracted to&nbsp;
notice he's taking the wrong turn, which at least&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.880
helps him avoid the cops. In the morning, Harry&nbsp;
wakes up and finds out about Lloyd's mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.440
They stop the van and have an argument, Harry is&nbsp;
angry because they have no money for gas or food,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.400
so he decides to leave Lloyd and walk back home.&nbsp;
Some hours later, he's suddenly approached by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.880
Lloyd riding a minibike he traded for the van in&nbsp;
town. This is enough for Harry to forgive him and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.440
climb on the bike, resuming their trip to Aspen.&nbsp;
They make it to Aspen a couple of days later and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.080
they're almost freezing. They want to return the&nbsp;
briefcase, but Lloyd doesn't know where Mary lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.960
and has no way to find out. When night falls, the&nbsp;
guys are at a park, trying to stay warm next to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.760
a fire. When Lloyd reveals he's been wearing an&nbsp;
extra pair of gloves and didn't share, Harry gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.080
angry and decides to get rid of the briefcase.&nbsp;
Lloyd fights him for it and in the struggle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.800
the briefcase falls and finally opens, revealing&nbsp;
tons of cash inside. The guys decide there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.440
nothing wrong with borrowing just a few bucks and&nbsp;
leaving I.O.U.s promising to pay them back later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.240
But they end up going crazy with the expenses.&nbsp;
They choose a presidential suite at a hotel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.480
buy a fancy car plus expensive yet ridiculous&nbsp;
clothes, and overtip the hotel employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.200
While enjoying the luxury of their room, they&nbsp;
find out about Mary and her gala in the newspaper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.760
and decide to attend. After a montage of them&nbsp;
getting groomed and buying weird suits, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.080
arrive at the gala, where they pay Nicholas extra&nbsp;
money and accidentally spray his eyes to get in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.040
After they're gone, Shay approaches Nicholas and&nbsp;
tells them those are the guys that killed Mental.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.040
Lloyd and Harry go to the bar and have a drink&nbsp;
while on the stage, Karl introduces the latest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.080
species his preservation will be housing: the snow&nbsp;
owl. After the presentation is over, they finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.560
see Mary, but Lloyd is too nervous to talk to&nbsp;
her so he sends Harry to do the talking for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.960
Harry approaches Mary and after chitchatting&nbsp;
about animals, he tries to introduce her to Lloyd,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.520
but Helen interrupts them. She's very amused&nbsp;
by his weird suit, and since Mary hasn't left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.840
the house for a while, she arranges a date for&nbsp;
her and Harry the next day. Harry accepts and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.400
goes back to Lloyd, telling him the date is for&nbsp;
him. Lloyd decides to celebrate this by opening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.440
a bottle of champagne, and the cork he shoots ends&nbsp;
up killing one of the owls. The next day, Nicholas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.120
and Shay come to the conclusion that the dead&nbsp;
owl was revenge for the parakeet and a message.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.320
Meanwhile, the guys are ready to go out. Harry&nbsp;
tries to make Lloyd change his mind about Mary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.120
and when he can't, he gives him the wrong meeting&nbsp;
place. While Lloyd goes to the hotel bar to wait,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.600
Harry joins Mary at the slopes. They get on the&nbsp;
ski lift and when he sees frost on the pole,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.840
Harry tries to lick it and gets his tongue&nbsp;
stuck on it. Back in the bar, Lloyd is starting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.920
to accept he's been stood up, so the bartender&nbsp;
gifts him a pity beer as Beth suddenly shows up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.560
and sits next to him. In the meantime, Mary pulls&nbsp;
Harry's head to unstick his tongue from the pole,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.320
then they have some fun together playing&nbsp;
in the snow. We cut to the bar again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.320
where Lloyd is getting sick of Beth's whining&nbsp;
so he asks the bartender if he knows Mary.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.320
The bartender tells him where she lives,&nbsp;
so Lloyd leaves the place to visit her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.280
Some moments later, Harry and Mary are arriving&nbsp;
at her place. She's enjoyed herself a lot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.920
so she asks Harry to pick her up tonight, which&nbsp;
he accepts. After she enters her house and Harry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.800
leaves on the car, we discover Lloyd saw it all&nbsp;
and is hurt by the betrayal. Later in the evening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.600
in their hotel room, Lloyd tells Harry he's been&nbsp;
stood up, and Harry pretends to be outraged.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.160
But suddenly he gets an idea for another lie and&nbsp;
tells Lloyd that Mary probably meant ten p.m.,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.640
not a.m. Lloyd pretends to accept this and when he&nbsp;
hears Harry is leaving for the movies, he prepares&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.600
a toast by slipping laxative into Harry's cup.&nbsp;
Harry drinks it without suspicion. Harry gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.160
in his car and drives to Mary's, already feeling&nbsp;
his stomach gurgling. Mary lets him in and asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.080
her to give him a minute, during which he cannot&nbsp;
take it anymore and decides to go to the bathroom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.800
to relieve himself of his diarrhea. Mary knocks&nbsp;
on the door and tells him the toilet is broken,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.800
but Harry panics and tells her she's just&nbsp;
shaving. While waiting for him to be done,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.960
Mary hears the doorbell and goes to open the&nbsp;
door: it's Lloyd, who has finally come to tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.800
her he has the briefcase and invites her to&nbsp;
come over to his hotel room to retrieve it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.360
Mary accepts, so she goes to tell Harry, who is&nbsp;
desperately trying to fix the toilet, that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.600
must cancel their date because something important&nbsp;
came up. Lloyd and Mary take the minibike back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.960
to the hotel. Once they make it to his room, he&nbsp;
returns the briefcase to her. Mary is very touched&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.200
by the gesture and thanks him with a kiss on his&nbsp;
cheek. After cutting to the hotel lobby to show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.920
us Nicholas and Shay have also arrived, we return&nbsp;
to Lloyd, who is practicing his love confession&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.720
while Mary is in the bathroom. When she comes out,&nbsp;
Lloyd tells her he likes her after stumbling over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.520
his words. Mary tells him his chances aren't&nbsp;
good, and after Lloyd asks her to be specific,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.520
she says he has one in a million chance -&nbsp;
this makes Lloyd think he does have a chance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.000
They're interrupted by Nicholas, who reveals&nbsp;
the kidnapped person is Mary's husband Bobby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.760
Lloyd is hurt by this but he doesn't have time&nbsp;
to complain, because Nicholas is threatening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:41.040
them with a gun. Meanwhile, in the hotel lobby,&nbsp;
we see Harry arrive and coming across Beth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.120
Back in the room, Mary is upset to find out&nbsp;
Nicholas was the one who kidnapped her husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.680
When Lloyd mentions reimbursing, Nicholas makes&nbsp;
them open the briefcase and discovers all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.640
money has been spent and replaced with I.O.U.s. A&nbsp;
moment later Harry enters the room and discovers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.640
Mary and Lloyd have been handcuffed to the bed.&nbsp;
Nicholas threatens him with the gun too and throws&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.200
him on the bed with them. While Nicholas makes a&nbsp;
phone call to buy a plane ticket, Lloyd and Harry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.120
argue over betrayals, turns out Harry had always&nbsp;
known Lloyd was the one his ex cheated on him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.320
with. Their bickering gets on Nichola's nerves,&nbsp;
so he comes over and asks who wants to die first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.840
Lloyd offers himself first, but Harry&nbsp;
jumps in and says it should be him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.080
which Lloyd accepts when he hears how much fun&nbsp;
he had with Mary. Nicholas shoots Harry and for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.960
a moment they believe him to be dead, but suddenly&nbsp;
he stands up and shoots Nicholas, though he fails.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.280
Nicholas is about to shoot again when the FBI&nbsp;
suddenly bursts into the room, lead by Beth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.720
who turns out to be an agent that has been&nbsp;
following them around pretending to be an airhead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.440
Back when she saw Harry in the lobby, she filled&nbsp;
him in and gave him a bulletproof vest and a gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:43.040
to pull off this plan. Moments later, everyone is&nbsp;
outside the hotel. Nicholas and Shay get arrested,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.280
and Mary gets to reunite with her husband&nbsp;
Bobby Swanson. While seeing them together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:52.000
Lloyd daydreams about shooting Bobby, but plays&nbsp;
nice when Mary brings him over to introduce them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
The next day, the guys are walking on the road,&nbsp;
trying to find a way home and wondering when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.560
they'll catch a break. A bus filled with gorgeous&nbsp;
girls in bikinis suddenly stops next to them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.080
the girls tell them they're looking for two guys&nbsp;
that will go with them to rub oil on their bodies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.240
while they travel around the country on a bikini&nbsp;
tour. The guys tell them they're in luck because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.480
they can find men in a town very close by,&nbsp;
the direction of which Harry points at. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.960
now confused girls leave then, and the guys barely&nbsp;
take another few steps before Lloyd realizes what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.120
they've done. They run after the bus and ask&nbsp;
it to stop, only for Lloyd to tell them Harry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.000
has pointed at the wrong way. Lloyd points in the&nbsp;
correct direction then lets the girls leave again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.840
The movie ends with the two friends&nbsp;
walking down the road, bickering.
