00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:06.109
If a military plane loaded with a biological
weapon crashed into your town's water supply,

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:07.520
what would you do?

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.949
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
the town Sheriff, see if we can make better

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:16.609
decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat
the Trixie Virus in, The Crazies. If you think

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.650
you have a better way, let me know in the
comments! If you like these how to beat videos,

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.580
consider liking and subscribing.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.609
Before we start I gotta let y’all know about
some new stuff. I just set up my merch store

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.630
with Nerd Explains logo tees and mugs, so
everyone else can identify who to team up

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.320
with if shit goes down. Us Nerd’s gotta
stick together, and before you say it, the

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.190
shirts also come with a guarantee that I won’t
cannibalize you if the food runs out. That’s

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.380
what you call, an exclusive perk.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.239
Besides the official logo merch, I made something
custom. The Bloody Banana Split. If you don’t

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.730
get it, you haven’t watched enough of my
videos. I’m going to be making more custom

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.460
designs commemorating special Nerd Explains
videos and jokes.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.129
Also, you can now flex on everyone else by
becoming a channel member and getting custom

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.470
evolving zombie badges next to your name in
the comments.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.840
Thanks again for the support guys and the
handful of gals out there as well.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.120
We start out following Sheriff David.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.360
The crowd’s having a good time at the ball
game until a deranged man stumbles onto the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.500
field with a Rossi Overland double barrel
shotgun.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.030
David tries to de-escalate the situation,
but the man doesn’t appear to be right in

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.110
the head.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:40.900
That was a quick ass draw, but let’s break
down that situation.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.950
I’m not sure what the actual protocol is
for police in this situation, but I’d imagine

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.450
you’d already have your gun unholstered
and or pre-aimed, or at the very least the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.380
holster button pre-popped for a quicker draw.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.630
My thinking is that you’d want to go wide
when walking up to him, so you ended up on

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.100
his side with no innocents behind you. Walking
up to Rory like David did potentially put

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.310
the entire crowd in the line of fire.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.679
I’d have the deputy get everyone out of
there, like actually have everyone leave the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.980
area.. then come up on Rory’s other flank,
so they both have clear lines of fire with

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.069
no nearby bystanders.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.739
It’s a small town, so David know’s Rory.
He knows he’s a drunk, but also a decent

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.200
person so he gives him the benefit of the
doubt and closes the distance to try to have

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.379
a heart to heart. This is a risky play, because
closing the distance can help you de-escalate

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.019
the situation and give you an opportunity
to grab Rory’s gun away from him, but it

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.670
also means he can shoot you more easily.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.219
In the movie David walks straight up to Rory,
and still has a crowd of innocents behind

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:48.610
him. Closing the distance in this case means
that if Rory started squeezing the triggers,

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.760
he’d take the entire load of buckshot and
his partner could kill Rory, but everyone

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.590
behind him would be safe.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.109
Another tactical error. If you close the distance,
you’d want to have your deputy on your flank

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.490
also close the distance. You don’t want
to be close and him far, because then he’s

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.670
more likely to accidentally shoot you.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.680
Realistically, at that distance Rory wouldn’t
need to shoulder the gun or aim it. He already

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.690
had it pointed at David’s chest and could
just pull the trigger.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.450
It’s a tough situation when someone already
has a gun drawn on you.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.610
You either have to distract them or divert
their weapon away from you before you go to

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.989
draw your weapon, because they could easily
kill before you got the gun out of your holster.

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.650
David was too far away to physically divert
Rory’s gun, so drawing on Rory was exceptionally

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.209
dangerous, though he didn’t have a choice.
This is why you’d want to already have your

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.040
gun up before engaging.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.500
David did have some key advantages. He perceived
that Rory was drunk or under the influence,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.159
which would slow his reaction times. He also
would have noticed that Rory’s Rossi Overland

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:54.040
shotgun has hammers on both tubes that need
to be cocked back before firing. These weren’t

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.520
cocked as far as I can tell. David’s using
a standard issue Glock, which doesn’t have

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.430
a safety that needs to be flipped off, decreasing
the time to fire. All this combined with being

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.610
the first to initiate the draw means that
Rory is unlikely to be able to get the shot

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.489
off before David. For a small town Sheriff,
this still takes a lot of skill to pull off

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.610
under stress, especially when you knew Rory
was a decent guy.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.390
They take Rory’s body back to the medical
examiner who says that the toxicology report

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.200
from his autopsy is going to take a week or
so to be completed, which like every other

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.350
movie, is long enough that whatever was causing
the problem will kill everyone before they

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.560
figure it out. We really need to improve these
toxicology report times, we never figure out

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.610
what’s going on until it’s too late.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.940
Afterwards, the sheriff goes to console the
grieving family, and it goes about how you’d

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.750
expect.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:53.500
He had a shotgun pointed at my head, but I
guess you can’t really expect a grieving

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.230
wife whose husband you blew away to think
rationally.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.530
Everyone seems to think it was just Rory being
drunk like usual, which is the most reasonable

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.470
assumption based on what they know.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.341
The next morning David shows up to the sheriff’s
office and the phones are blowing up, which

00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:15.410
is odd for such a small town of 1260 people.
He gets a call from the medical examiner who

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.030
says that Rory was actually not drunk, in
fact he had a blood alcohol level of 0.0.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.070
If he wasn’t wasted, what the hell was wrong
with him.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.810
David returns to the baseball field to try
to make sense of it all. Ben, who was at the

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:41.570
shooting, is doing the same, so David tries
to talk to him.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:56.080
Sure this is weird, but it’s still reasonable
and passable behavior for someone who also

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.900
witnessed the shooting and probably has some
PTSD.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.930
Meanwhile, David’s wife, who is the town
doctor, is examining another man who has some

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:14.510
sort of sudden onset mental illness or brain
impairment.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:26.300
What’s worrying is that the cases of mental
illness are sudden onset and occurring in

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.940
multiple people who were otherwise normal
not days ago. Again, this is a town of like

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.750
1200 people. It’s not like she’s a doctor
in a big city with tons of random people coming

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.750
in.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.380
The problem is that until this information
is gossiped around enough, everyone has a

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:46.000
fractured view and no consensus can be made
on the state of the situation. Nobody by themselves

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.200
has enough information to act, but from a
God’s eye view things are going south fast.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.020
Interestingly, whatever is happening is initially
only happening to the men. Their wives and

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.080
kids aren’t affected, and it doesn’t seem
to have spread to them.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.380
Deardra takes her husband back home from the
doctor, and later that night she notices that

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.220
the combine in their shed is turned on. Maybe
he’s just going to a little late night farming..

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.580
Yah no you’re fucked.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.470
I hope I'm not the only one who was internally
screaming at this lady to not stand in front

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.220
of the active combine with her deranged husband
on the loose.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:27.340
You’re just asking for this to happen.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.830
Combines can go about 5mph, which is like
jog speed. I’m sure she can get out of the

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.740
way if it comes at her, but what if she trips.
Why risk it.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:41.460
And she walks up closer to it. Lady, please.
Keep your hands and feet away from the spinning

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.190
blades. If you would kindly walk along the
perimeter of the shed to the side of the combine,

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.080
you will have access to the cabin where you
can discuss your issues with the operator.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.380
You just got played by your psycho husband
whose now attempting to murder your child.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:59.130
Nice. Honestly, you’re lucky he wasn’t
in the combine, or what’s left of your corpse

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.440
would be sitting in the grain tank right now.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.840
Personally, I think she should have brought
her son with her to the shed. Hear me out

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.000
because I know it seems counterintuitive.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.220
Your significant other is exhibiting severe
mental derangement all of the sudden, you

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.390
take them to the doctor, then that night you
hear the combine spinning up in the shed.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.370
You’re obviously scared enough to not want
to bring your kid into a potentially dangerous

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.890
situation. Which is why you should.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:28.000
If you go to the shed by yourself and something
happens to you, your kid won’t know what

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.089
happened and he might come to the shed to
find out and get killed, or get killed by

00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:36.039
the husband later on. If you bring him, but
keep him back a bit, he will be able to see

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:39.519
what’s going on, and you can keep an eye
on him, but he won’t be in danger as long

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:43.599
as you don’t hold his hand while you flail
in front of the active combine blades like

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:44.599
an idiot.

00:08:44.599 --> 00:08:48.879
Leaving the kid back at the house by himself
when you can’t 100% know where your deranged

00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:51.089
husband is, is a bad play.

00:08:51.089 --> 00:08:55.040
Not to mention how nuts it is to have been
planning on going to sleep in the same bed

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.180
and house as him, when you are clearly this
afraid and nervous about his mental state

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.300
and your safety.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.639
If my girlfriend suddenly started staring
at the wall all day, unaware of anything going

00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:09.579
on around her, and repeated the same phrases
over and over again, I definitely will not

00:09:09.579 --> 00:09:13.480
be going to sleep in the same bed or house
as her, and my dog will be staying with me

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.740
elsewhere.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:23.019
By now you’ve no doubt heard of the shooting
of Rory, a man who suddenly went full psycho.

00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:26.029
That shit’s going to be in the back of your
head, you’re going to be thinking that maybe

00:09:26.029 --> 00:09:28.449
the same thing is happening to your husband.

00:09:28.449 --> 00:09:32.550
She gets back to the house and finds her son,
and he takes her into a closet where he tells

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.790
her that the dad is coming after him with
a knife.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:39.570
I also want to point out that hiding in a
closet isn’t really the best spot. You have

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:44.709
nowhere to run, and it’s such an obvious
hiding spot. I remember playing hide and go

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:50.240
seek, and literally the first place you check
is the closets. You gotta get creative. I

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.459
heard about an incident where law enforcement
raided a guy's house, and they ended up finding

00:09:54.459 --> 00:10:00.120
him inside of a bed mattress. Yah they found
him, but they were U.S. Marshals, not some

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.790
psycho. I don’t think hiding inside a mattress
is a feasible or good decision either though.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.920
Like the closet, you have no escape and if
Bill decides to sleep on that bed, good luck

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.150
holding your breath all night.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:14.149
She could try to ambush him and whack him
upside the head with a flower vase, but the

00:10:14.149 --> 00:10:18.139
dude’s got a knife and if you don’t knock
him out in one hit, you’re probably dead.

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:22.520
Personally, I’d have grabbed a lamp pole,
smashed out the hallway window behind them,

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.839
aimed for the bushes, then just ran for it.
I’ve seen some parkour videos, you just

00:10:25.839 --> 00:10:27.949
gotta roll when you hit the ground. Easy stuff.

00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:33.120
Bill comes up the stairs and surprise surprise,
he found them in their super secret hiding

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.640
spot.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:42.420
Damn that got me. Wait, what’s that smell..

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.910
Yah, I have some problems with this too.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:51.079
Closet doors shouldn’t be that hard to kick
open because interior house doors are usually

00:10:51.079 --> 00:10:55.860
hollow and weak, and in their case the door
opens away from them. You could argue that

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.720
they were trying to keep a barrier between
them and him, but I’d think the strong smell

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.980
of gas would light a fire under your ass to
leave the closet.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.579
Unfortunately Deardra doesn’t seem to understand
the concept of kicking the door down and instead,

00:11:09.579 --> 00:11:14.120
jiggles the door knob like it’s just going
to magically open. I can’t stand when people

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:20.069
do that. Just jiggling the doorknob when it’s
locked, like come one, start ferociously kicking

00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:27.559
the door down. It’s your only chance. For
those curious, you kick the spot just next

00:11:27.559 --> 00:11:28.939
to the doorknob.

00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:32.899
Sheriff David shows up to the crime scene
with this wife.. Does he normally bring her

00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:37.220
on calls, because that seems super dangerous
and unprofessional. The last thing you need

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:48.450
is highly emotional people coming into the
crime scene and freaking out.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:12:00.600
Okay, by now David has to know something is
up. That’s three encounters with deranged

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.779
people who were all normal not days ago. All
now exhibiting murderous tendencies. It’s

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:09.769
like The Happening except everyone wants to
kill each other instead of themselves.

00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:14.550
Unfortunately that toxicology report is still
4-5 days away, and good luck with getting

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:18.089
Bill to do a CT scan or getting any information
out of him.

00:12:18.089 --> 00:12:22.619
Meanwhile some hunters down in the marsh find
a parachute stuck in the trees. Maybe there’s

00:12:22.619 --> 00:12:26.369
a supply crate with something cool in it.

00:12:26.369 --> 00:12:27.430
Nope!

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.869
Seems like it’d be hard to get any work
done with a guy who just murdered his wife

00:12:30.869 --> 00:12:36.149
and child staring you down like that for every
second of the day, unmoving for hours. Shit,

00:12:36.149 --> 00:12:39.740
I have trouble concentrating when my dog is
looking at me for pets.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.980
From what we can tell, it’s not transmitting
via bite, it doesn’t seem to be airborne

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.360
or contact based or the families would have
gotten it too. But there’s not enough info

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.369
to really understand what’s going on.

00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:56.269
They get a call from the hunters about the
downed pilot and go investigate it. The corpse

00:12:56.269 --> 00:13:00.970
is unrecognizable, but the uniform and insignia
is military. The medical examiner thinks this

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.180
bro’s been chilling in the marsh for a week
or so.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:08.680
There were reports of something crashing into
the marsh about a week ago too, so there may

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.720
be a downed plane somewhere nearby.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.839
The chances of them finding that plane within
the same day is unlikely, but as you’ll

00:13:16.839 --> 00:13:19.399
see later, David’s one lucky man.

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:24.920
It looks like a C130 military cargo plane
or something similar. Definitely military.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.150
Initially you’d want to send some divers
in to see what’s what. But because there

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:32.240
is a high likelihood that this is connected
with the town's events, there may be something

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.889
toxic in the water. The only safe way to investigate
the wreckage is with a HAZMAT dive team, which

00:13:37.889 --> 00:13:40.769
Ogden Marsh definitely doesn’t have on staff.

00:13:40.769 --> 00:13:45.850
A cheap alternative would be to take water
samples and pictures of the dead pilot, his

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.720
credentials, as well as the plane.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:52.950
They go to the town water person, and he confirms
their suspicions. The same water that the

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:58.699
plane is residing in, flows into their town’s
drinking water supply. Not only that, but

00:13:58.699 --> 00:14:04.250
the water reaches Rory’s house first. Rory
wasn’t drunk on booze, he was drunk on a

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.949
top-secret biological weapon.

00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:11.300
Apparently whatever was in that plane survived
the entire water treatment process and made

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.519
it into people’s home’s where it infected
them. Our water treatment processes have high

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:14.519
standards for inactivating known pathogens,
but this was a small town and the military

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:15.519
engineered this virus to withstand water treatment,
so it’s plausible it made it through.

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:16.839
This revelation carries two massive problems.

00:14:16.839 --> 00:14:21.420
The first problem is that this was caused
by the military and government, and this plane

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:26.000
crashed a week ago but there are no soldiers
or men in black to be seen. You’d think

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.610
they’d be out here within a day of the initial
crash to recover their plane that was carrying

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:31.769
god knows what.

00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:35.920
The fact that they aren’t suggests that
they are either grossly incompetent, or more

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.369
likely, they know that something really bad
was set loose and recovering the plane is

00:14:40.369 --> 00:14:45.600
the last of their worries. Right now they
are probably setting up a wide quarantine

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.500
zone around the entire town.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.399
If this situation is as severe as these raging
clues would suggest, anyone that drank the

00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:56.899
water in the past week is already infected
unless they are somehow immune.

00:14:56.899 --> 00:15:01.439
Being a small town that’s forgettable, the
military and government can still retain plausible

00:15:01.439 --> 00:15:07.190
deniability to cover up the incident, saying
that a chemical plant exploded or something.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.980
Expect roads to be blocked and the internet
and cell service to be blacked out. It might

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:15.420
seem hasty and rash, but fleeing is the only
option you have at this point.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.769
Being a government blackout, they have records
of everyone in the town and may make you disappear

00:15:19.769 --> 00:15:24.429
if you try to escape and talk. Hopefully David
had the brains to take pictures and samples

00:15:24.429 --> 00:15:28.220
which he could use as leverage or a dead man’s
switch to preserve his safety.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.399
The second massive problem is that this plane
was downed for a week, and has been flowing

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:36.899
something toxic into the town this whole time.
Water in the distribution network might have

00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:41.429
hit rory first, but it’s been a full day
since that incident and a week since the plane

00:15:41.429 --> 00:15:46.069
crashed, literally everyone in the town would
have been drinking that water by now and is

00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:51.350
infected if they can be infected. Even David
and his deputy who was sipping fresh weaponized

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:55.309
pathogens every morning are on borrowed time
unless they’re immune somehow.

00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:58.079
Doesn’t hurt to break out the bottled water
instead though.

00:15:58.079 --> 00:16:02.480
David heads out to the classic overindulged
mayor to convince him to turn off the water

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.600
supply. I think it’s pointless by now, but
it wouldn’t hurt. He gets pushback because

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.389
the lack of water would kill the crops and
the entire farm town would go bankrupt. There’s

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:16.300
no use arguing with a guy that won’t put
some clothes on to discuss something important

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.300
like this.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.579
I was just going to say that they should break
in and shut it off anyways. Any toxicology

00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:25.620
report or hard evidence would take too much
valuable time to put together and present,

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.790
and the stubborn mayor would shut it down
anyways.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:33.239
Deputy Russell locks up the lever, and notices
that Bill’s not standing anymore. I mean,

00:16:33.239 --> 00:16:37.930
no shit, who's just going to stand the whole
time. Even infected psycho’s gotta lay down

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.410
once in a while.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.839
Thankfully David stopped him from going in,
but couldn’t he have just told him to wait

00:16:44.839 --> 00:16:52.970
up. There was no need to jumpscare the poor
guy.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:59.439
I don’t know what Russ was thinking. Who
would be idiotic enough to go into a cell

00:16:59.439 --> 00:17:05.120
by themselves to check out a guy who’s infected
with the same kind of military pathogen which

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.060
potentially has led to Rory trying to murder
David, as well as Bill murdering his wife

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.809
and kid. Besides the fact that Bill might
try to murder you, your lack of PPE might

00:17:13.809 --> 00:17:16.779
expose you to the pathogen, if you aren’t
already.

00:17:16.779 --> 00:17:21.329
They correctly assess that they aren’t equipped
to deal with this man, and check his transfer

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:26.179
status. Low and behold, the internet and cell
service are out. Wonder who could that be?

00:17:26.179 --> 00:17:38.030
It’s quiet down at Ogden marsh’s main
street, too quiet.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:18:01.799
What do you do now? Well, I think 

00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:59.450
the science is clear. A 

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:04.130
military plane carrying a deadly pathogen
crashed into the drinking water that everyone’s

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:08.440
been gulping down for a week, there’s no
cell reception indicating the quarantine and

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:13.100
suppression of everyone in the town, and now
the entire town is dead ass silent.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:18.570
You’re now on a tight timeline. The infection
is clearly past the incubation period, and

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.340
everyone should be considered potentially
hostile. With the possibility of the government

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:27.470
silencing and denying this catastrophe, the
military can’t be trusted. The cell reception

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:31.380
is down, so there’s no good way to create
a dead man’s switch with your evidence.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.570
Your best bet is to get the water samples,
pictures, and credentials from the downed

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:39.870
pilot. Then go home, grab your wife, and start
walking to the nearest city, which should

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:44.899
only be a few hours away. I say walking, because
every road will be blocked by the military.

00:19:44.899 --> 00:19:47.760
You’re gonna have to avoid these unmarked
vans too.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:52.320
I know you’re a cop, and you want to start
saving everyone, but it’s too late. Sure,

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.429
there could be survivors that are immune,
but it’s highly unlikely. There is a much

00:19:56.429 --> 00:19:59.060
higher chance that you will get murdered by
a psycho.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.420
I was just going to say, get that gun un-holstered
brah, and maybe stop by the armory, load up

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.420
and get some backup.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.750
Or not. Again, investigating every sound and
abnormality is unwise. Your focus should be

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:12.330
solely on escaping with your wife and your
life. If someone is clearly in need of help

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:18.760
then go help, but wandering stores chasing
weird noises is a surefire way to get dead.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.720
This place is a hell hole waiting to erupt.
David heads into the funeral home, and quickly

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.610
discovers this.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:38.470
It’s almost as if everyone drank the water,
is infected, and has turned into a psycho

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:45.130
like you hypothesized. Dude get up or roll
over sideways god damn. You would have had

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:50.269
serious, serious problems if Russ didn’t
show up at that exact second, which realistically

00:20:50.269 --> 00:20:55.120
he wouldn’t have. And on that note, why
were you out there by yourself with no backup

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.169
with everyone turning into a version of Bill
and Rory.

00:20:58.169 --> 00:21:02.830
David finally realizes that this place can’t
be saved and it’s gonna degenerate hard

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:08.389
and fast, and goes home to warn his wife.
But she stubbornly refuses to just leave because,

00:21:08.389 --> 00:21:14.779
and I quote, she’s their doctor. What part
of everyone’s an infected murdering psycho

00:21:14.779 --> 00:21:19.240
now, you didn't get. You have no idea what
the issue is, how it’s affecting them, and

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.430
these people aren’t treatable as evidenced
by me almost being neutered by a bone saw.

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:28.330
You, can’t, do, shit. This problem is way
worse than a small town doctor can handle.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.740
I swear, some of these people are so stubborn
that you could tell them you found a nuclear

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:37.880
device with a 30 minute countdown and they’d
tell you they need to stay to treat the wounded.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.429
David apparently learned nothing from his
funeral home encounter, and heads out by himself

00:21:42.429 --> 00:21:48.570
to their shed to check it out because his
wife saw someone. Yah, it’s probably a murderous

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:52.750
psycho, like I was just telling you about.
Do you want to go give them a health exam

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:57.039
now sweetheart? No? Then let's get in the
car and go.

00:21:57.039 --> 00:22:03.190
David goes to check it out by himself, also
leaving his wife in the home by herself. Where

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:07.780
the fuck is Russ anyways, you’d think sticking
together and getting some firepower would

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:17.649
be smart.

00:22:17.649 --> 00:22:19.880
Honestly that was probably the best outcome.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:25.070
They get taken to the FEMA quarantine camps
and separated into infected vs uninfected

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:30.010
based on elevated temperatures. His wife seems
to think it’s cerebral hemorrhaging from

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:33.639
a virus. But only transferred through bodily
fluids.

00:22:33.639 --> 00:22:38.090
Looks like Judy drank too much of the water.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:50.580
I don’t know why she’s screaming no, no,
no, they are literally trying to help you.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.130
They could have just thrown you in the fenced
cage outside with everyone else.

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:59.389
David gets let out of the quarantine with
tons of others because he passed a quick temperature

00:22:59.389 --> 00:23:00.389
check.

00:23:00.389 --> 00:23:04.539
Why is it that movies think a handheld temperature
screen is conclusive enough to let people

00:23:04.539 --> 00:23:08.640
out of a quarantine zone. You’re dealing
with a town of 1200 people, it shouldn’t

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.710
be that hard to put them in a second stage
where they are more fully tested for the virus.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:18.350
They must know that there is an incubation
period from when the plane crashed to when

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:22.740
people suddenly started losing their minds
and cerebral hemorrhaging. Anyone who traveled

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:27.029
in from out of town or didn’t drink much
of the water may still be in the incubation

00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:30.570
period. Letting people leave is idiotic.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.980
Not too mention, you’d probably want to
see if any of the uninfected had generated

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.029
antibodies to the virus.

00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:46.330
Meanwhile his wife is in the hospital with
a front row seat to the unfolding chaos outside.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:56.000
Damn David pulled a Jason Bourne movie. This
guy is way too good to be a small town Sheriff.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.970
As for why that guy can leave his wife, well,
for starters it’s a quarantine due to a

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:05.409
deadly pathogen outbreak, and maybe it’s
a good idea to leave her in the hands of medical

00:24:05.409 --> 00:24:09.030
professionals who understand the pathogen
better and can help her.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:13.100
Also, maybe because he’s an overweight accountant
and you’re an athletic Sheriff who's way

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:17.430
better skilled and equipped for the job. Did
you honestly think he was going to ninja onto

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:22.260
the bus, sneak past all the soldiers, fight
off all the crazies, find his wife, and escape

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:27.269
the city alive. He would 100% have gotten
him and his wife killed.

00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:32.320
Welp, the military quarantine was overrun
by a couple guys in a truck. The military

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.500
doesn’t even try to regain control, and
they all hop in their choppers and bounce.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.740
Solid work guys.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:42.289
I guess I understand that with everyone running
the gates and scrambling like it’s 2 fast

00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:45.870
2 furious, you need to reestablish a wider
perimeter.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:50.659
On one side, now you can ‘rescue’ Judy
and there won’t be any soldiers there to

00:24:50.659 --> 00:24:55.570
stop you, but on the flipside, now you gotta
deal with the crazies and bandits which are

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.540
arguably more dangerous.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.669
Before going in to save his wife, David goes
back and grabs his six shooter while Russ

00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:06.190
grabs the shotty. David doesn’t know that
the camp was overrun yet, so i’m not sure

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:11.730
what his plan is. Does he really think he’s
going to wave his 38 special revolver at the

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:15.330
soldiers, sweep his gal off her feet and ride
into the sunset?

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.620
Things aren’t looking good back at the hospital.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:22.450
There’s really no time to try to Houdini
out of the restraints, he’d just kill you.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:27.020
Honestly, staying quiet and acting dead is
her best shot at this point. Which she doesn’t

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:45.100
do in the slightest. Judy close your fucking
eyes and turn your head back.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:49.600
Stop squirming and crying for Christ's sake,
he’s obviously targeting the alive looking

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.600
people.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:55.760
David saves her ass just before she gets the
rake. Everybody in this movie has exceptional

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.760
timing.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.251
On their way out, Russ mentions that he was
only a little further downstream from the

00:26:00.251 --> 00:26:05.140
contaminated water supply than Rory was. I
really doubt that has much to do with the

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:09.750
probability of infection. Everyone had been
drinking that water for a week. If you were

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:14.389
going to get it, you would’ve already gotten
it. Incubation times and immunity may vary

00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:16.610
though so you can’t know for sure.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:20.620
Walking in the middle of the street is really
dumb, you should be moving cover to cover

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:25.610
slowly and deliberately, checking all the
areas before moving. Making sure you’re

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:27.000
always close to cover.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.220
They find an operational truck that wasn’t
booted by the military, but it’s owned by

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:35.659
the infected hunters from earlier. Looks like
the hunting’s been good. It’s best to

00:26:35.659 --> 00:26:40.960
let them pass, not only do they outnumber
you, and hunters are usually pretty good shots,

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.419
but trying to drive out of the city is dangerous
and hopeless.

00:26:44.419 --> 00:26:49.250
The military is going to have every road blocked
off, be very trigger happy and paranoid, and

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:54.330
not likely to take any chances now. The best
bet is to walk it to the next city.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:59.370
Judy’s employee, Becca who they also saved,
runs off into a nearby house in search of

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:04.850
her boyfriend. David wants to stay on track
and leave Becca, but Judy convinces him to

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:09.640
help her find her boyfriend. Judy’s argument
was that David came back to save her, so why

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.779
is he not trying to save Becca and her boyfriend
too.

00:27:12.779 --> 00:27:18.029
Well, he saved you because you're his wife,
not some chick’s new boyfriend that she’s

00:27:18.029 --> 00:27:23.179
only known for a month. Little bit of a difference.
The second reason is that he’s either infected

00:27:23.179 --> 00:27:27.700
in which case he’s dangerous, or he’s
not infected but he’s super paranoid, in

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.840
which case he’s also dangerous. The third
reason is that the amount of people in your

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:37.809
group is growing too big, and you can’t
trust Becca or Scotty to not be idiots.

00:27:37.809 --> 00:27:42.840
David concedes, and complies with his wife’s
wishes and tries to find Becca’s boyfriend,

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.850
who nearly blows their brains out.

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:49.350
How did the military not see them wandering
in the open. Seems like the military set up

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:53.549
the wider perimeter and are now trying to
hunt the infected and re-establish the quarantine

00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:54.899
medical camps again.

00:27:54.899 --> 00:27:58.750
Eventually they are going to search the barn
too, so if you can’t sneak out the back

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:02.200
you better put the guns down, get on your
knees, put your hands up, and yell that you

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:08.030
are unarmed and not infected.

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:16.700
Well that was dumb. What the hell did you
think you were going to do. They told you

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:20.049
to stop and you kept sprinting at them like
a crazy person.

00:28:20.049 --> 00:28:24.629
This kind of shenanigans is why I was stressing
to keep your group small and with trusted

00:28:24.629 --> 00:28:29.150
people. Adding people you don’t know just
increases the chance you’re going to get

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.870
aCharlie wildcard like scotty.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:37.770
Instead of surrendering, Russ and David opt
to abduct one of the soldiers. Bold move,

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.840
and way less likely to go your way than you
think.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:45.269
Realistically, soldiers would not be clearing
houses and barns by themselves. There would

00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:50.059
be an entire squad pouring in and clearing
all the angles. Especially in such a hostile

00:28:50.059 --> 00:28:51.840
situation such as this.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.299
David interrogates the soldier, asking him
what the heck they are doing. I think it’s

00:28:56.299 --> 00:29:01.320
obvious. They are clearing sectors of the
quarantine zone and assessing people for infections.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.090
Just like Judy, they found that Scotty’s
mom potentially had the virus and were going

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:10.649
to quarantine and try to treat her. She unnecessarily
ran, so they shot her. Her son then ran at

00:29:10.649 --> 00:29:15.690
them and was repeatedly told to stop which
he didn’t, so they shot him too. All pretty

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.570
reasonable actions given the stakes and circumstances.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:23.519
Do you really think they tell grunts exactly
what’s going on anyways.

00:29:23.519 --> 00:29:28.730
David convinces the soldier to report an all
clear, and fortunately he doesn’t rat them

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:37.370
out. This is also highly unlikely.

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:42.360
Not really, he just said he was told to always
keep his mask on or he could get infected.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:47.510
Like all the doctors and soldiers from earlier,
it’s standard procedure to wear PPE to protect

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:52.710
against bodily fluids and potential transmission
vectors. I mean it could be, and you should

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:55.940
take those precautions, but it’s not proof
that it’s airborne.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:00.049
They sneak back over to their home to grab
some supplies and the old Police cruiser.

00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:04.919
They still think they can drive out of town,
wow. David’s spidey senses should have been

00:30:04.919 --> 00:30:06.690
tingling at the sight of their car.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:12.010
It was booted by the military like all the
other cars, which suggests the military was

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:16.741
there. But why was it burned and shot up too?
Something must have happened here. Someone

00:30:16.741 --> 00:30:21.570
must have been here that caused an altercation.
You can’t be sure that nobody is here and

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:24.710
that your home is perfectly safe to wander
around.

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:29.679
Like I've been stressing this whole movie,
they need to stay together. You don’t need

00:30:29.679 --> 00:30:34.759
to split up and gather supplies either, you’re
driving an hour down the road tops. And you

00:30:34.759 --> 00:30:39.720
especially don’t need to take a trip down
memory lane by yourself. Well, I guess she

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:54.720
isn’t really by herself.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:20.269
Children's music playing in the apocalypse
is always a red flag. David was really lucky

00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:25.330
he was able to get his fingers under the rope
around his neck before the crazy cinched it.

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:31.460
If he hadn’t, he’d have been lights out
in seconds.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:36.249
Actually it wasn’t, he killed Rory with
a Glock 19. And how would you even know, you

00:31:36.249 --> 00:31:40.590
weren’t at the baseball game nor where you
close enough to see what gun he actually had.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:45.379
And if you were observant and saw David around
town, you’d know that he likely used the

00:31:45.379 --> 00:31:51.070
same pistol that he duty carries every day,
which is the Glock 19. It’s not like a Glock

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:56.909
versus a Smith and Wesson M&amp;P here, it’s
a magazine fed recoil operated pistol versus

00:31:56.909 --> 00:32:03.149
a near snub nose revolver. But maybe I'm being
a little pedantic given the situation and

00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:07.500
her being crazy and all.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:22.020
Russ had to have heard that. It’s a good
thing the psycho’s are dumber than our protagonists.

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:36.220
The 

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:40.080
throat grab with the knife in your hand is
always cool as hell, I do think he should

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.980
have then picked her up and throat slammed
her to the ground while delivering a one liner.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:48.620
It’s just a wasted opportunity. David didn’t
really have a choice, but the throat shank

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:53.690
would have contaminated his blood with the
virus from her bodily fluids. Hopefully he’s

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:58.090
got an immunity or something, or else he’s
gonna become one of them in a few days.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:02.580
Little Billy grabs the gun and just before
he can get the shot off on David, Russ comes

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.410
in with the clutch snipe.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:08.100
That was cool and all, but was beyond dumb
from a tactical standpoint.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:13.510
I counted a full minute from Peggy firing
a round off and Russ sniping the kid. It should

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:17.710
have taken him maybe 20 seconds to grab his
shotgun and come up to the room.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:22.840
Let’s back up a bit so I can try to understand
Russ’s thought process. He heard a gunshot

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:28.539
ring out in the upstairs room of the house,
grabbed the scoped rifle instead of the shotgun,

00:33:28.539 --> 00:33:33.101
then went outside and stood around for a full
minute trying to see something through a window

00:33:33.101 --> 00:33:34.860
that has curtains over it.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:40.090
If David’s situation went down any other
way, the altercation occurred in another room,

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:44.100
or the infected kid was a couple feet to the
left or right of the window, Russ wouldn’t

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:48.529
have had a shot and David would be dead. Not
too mention that there were curtains over

00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:53.710
the window, and the kid’s hair and clothing
is fairly similar to Davids. He easily could

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:55.830
have mistaken David for the kid.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:34:00.590
Becca then beats Russ to the room and just
rushes inside, which is also stupid because

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:04.039
they don’t know if the room is actually
safe or not. She seems to have a habit of

00:34:04.039 --> 00:34:05.610
running off impulsively.

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:10.000
When Russ finally makes it into the room he
has the hunting rifle in hand. I just don’t

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.720
get why he didn’t bring the shotgun instead.

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:29.730
I can’t argue with double tapping the infected
to make sure they’re dead. The crazies have

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:33.210
shown to be devious and play dead like Bill
in the jail cell.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:37.369
David’s wife thinks Russ is showing symptoms
of infection because he double tapped Peggy

00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:41.869
and Curt. I’m starting to get a little annoyed
with Judy. She went off on her own in the

00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:46.260
apocalypse which endangered everyone else,
and now she’s complaining that Russ saved

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:50.510
their lives and ensured that the attackers
were fully dead so they didn’t get attacked

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:51.819
again? That’s rich.

00:34:51.819 --> 00:34:55.730
They get the old Police cruiser working and
start making their way out of town, but Becca

00:34:55.730 --> 00:35:00.200
starts coughing a lot. Russ rightly brings
up how dangerous it is to be in the car with

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:05.290
someone coughing everywhere, and guess who
defends Becca. Mrs. Russ might be infected

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:10.050
because he saved our lives in a way I felt
was too aggressive, Judy. What’s with the

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:12.260
hypocritical two-faced bullshit.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:16.480
Their argument is interrupted by an AH-64
Apache attack helicopter.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.940
I know it’s an understatement, but that
is a huge, huge problem.

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:27.420
This specific helicopter is carrying an M230
30mm chain gun with 4 rocket pods carrying

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:34.990
a total of 76 M151 Hydra 70 unguided rockets
which have a fragmentation radius of 50 meters,

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:39.849
all of which are linked up to one of the most
advanced sensor and targeting systems in the

00:35:39.849 --> 00:35:44.690
world, flown by pilots who are experts at
recon, tracking, and eliminating things like

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:46.060
moving vehicles.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:49.760
My point is that mashing the pedal has got
to be one of the dumbest things you could

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:55.450
think to do. You aren’t outrunning or outmaneuvering
it, nor can you hide from it. Your only chance

00:35:55.450 --> 00:36:00.450
at survival is to stop, get out, and put your
hands up. Sure, they might kill you, but they

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.780
will definitely kill you if you run.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:08.230
David says screw all of that, and pulls into
the car wash to remove his 5 wanted stars.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:14.309
I bet he really fooled the Apache pilot. That’s
like Anakin thinking spinning is a good trick.

00:36:14.309 --> 00:36:18.890
Turns out the car wash wasn’t such a good
idea. Becca shouts that she saw someone, and

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:23.210
all the machinery spins up and starts pulling
their car along the car wash tracks.

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:28.010
Tactically, inside a car is a bad place to
be fighting from, especially one in the middle

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:32.609
of a car wash with no clear sight lines. If
any of the infected has a firearm and runs

00:36:32.609 --> 00:36:36.270
up on them, the car doors and windows won’t
stop any of the bullets.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:40.460
As soon as Becca said she saw someone, the
lights came on, and David couldn’t get the

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:44.270
car operational, they should have gotten out
of the vehicle and retreated back towards

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:48.930
the entrance and found some cover. Then they
could clear the building on their terms from

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:53.500
a much stronger position, and recover their
vehicle once the threats are eliminated.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:58.060
This scene in Sicario demonstrates this well.
Once out of the car, they can create open

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:02.960
sight and fire lines, flank the enemies, and
use more solid forms of cover like the engine

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.109
blocks of other cars, and can retreat if they
need to.

00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:10.230
If they’re going to stay in the vehicle,
at least have Becca and Judy crunch down and

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:14.650
get as low to the floor as possible to clear
the lines of fire for Russ and David.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:19.420
The chaos and confusion causes Russ to start
blasting at nothing. Not only does he waste

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:23.860
ammo and empty the shotgun before he actually
has a clear shot, he sticks the barrel out

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:29.660
of the car way too far and loses the shotgun.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:33.300
Just before they make it out becca gets a
hose wrapped around her throat and hung from

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:42.160
the ceiling. For being complete psycho’s,
they’re actually pretty clever.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.670
Looks like they’re walking now. Apparently
down the middle of the road because they have

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:51.059
the collective memory capacity of a Goldfish..
Which is actually a lot longer than 3 seconds,

00:37:51.059 --> 00:37:55.190
but i’m trying to make a point here. This
is the same road that the Apache helicopter

00:37:55.190 --> 00:38:00.130
was patrolling, which blew up your car. Yes,
an Apache could probably find them walking

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:04.230
in the fields, but they’re a lot less likely
to be spotted in a field than on the highway

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:09.160
the Apache is patrolling. Even forgetting
the Apache, military and government vehicles

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:13.720
will likely have checkpoints and be transporting
soldiers and equipment on these roads.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:18.430
So far they’ve only been able to avoid the
military on sheer luck, which just ran out.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:22.819
David walks out into the middle of the road
and tries to stop the oncoming agency van

00:38:22.819 --> 00:38:27.510
so they can steal it, but Russ goes Wildcard
too and Spike traps it.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:31.920
Spike traps don’t really cause cars to flip
like that, but sure.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.109
Under interrogation, this guy reveals that
people were getting infected with a bioweapon

00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:42.360
called Trixie, a Rhabdoviridae Prototype with
a 48 hour incubation period. They engineered

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:47.170
this virus as a weapon that could be used
to destabilize enemy nations. He says that

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:52.109
the plane carrying the bio weapon was being
transported to a disposal facility in Texas

00:38:52.109 --> 00:38:57.170
to be incinerated and destroyed, and that
this whole thing was a giant accident.

00:38:57.170 --> 00:39:02.390
My question, if why wasn’t the pathogen
secured in a black box type container which

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:07.470
is crash proof, fireproof, etcetera? That
would have prevented this entire mess.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:12.470
The World Health Organization and American
Society for Microbiology lists guidance and

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:18.069
regulations for the transport of infectious
materials. From reading their document, I

00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:22.570
wouldn’t say it’s ‘blackbox’ level,
but it’s close. There is a triple packaging

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:27.609
system with limitations on the quantity that
can be transported at one time. This triple

00:39:27.609 --> 00:39:32.950
packaging ensures that if the leakproof primary
receptacle is compromised there is another

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:38.170
layer that will absorb the pathogen which
is also contained in a leakproof container,

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:42.900
with a final rigid outer layer protecting
them all from external damage. This should

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:47.520
have stopped any infectious substances from
surviving the plane crash, especially since

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.930
the plane seemed to be intact so it didn’t
hit the ground with enough force to fragment

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:52.980
and rupture itself.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:57.920
I’m also suspicious why a government agent
is being so forthcoming about the existence

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.859
of a top secret bioweapons program, you’d
think they’d have a cover story or mention

00:40:02.859 --> 00:40:07.590
that it was just a naturally occurring virus
that they were researching and disposing off.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:12.510
However, what he’s saying sounds truthful
and plausible. It’s unlikely to be an domestic

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:16.869
bioweapon experiment, because there are plenty
of third world countries that the U.S. can

00:40:16.869 --> 00:40:21.119
test the pathogen on where they would have
more control over the virus and plausible

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:25.900
deniability if they lost control of it. I’m
not advocating this, just saying.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:30.520
The U.S. has dedicated facilities for chemical
weapons disposal, the preferred method of

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.770
disposal is incineration, and the preferred
method of transportation is a non-stop flight

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:40.150
with a military aircraft. Ogden Marsh just
happened to be unlucky enough to have the

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:43.260
flight make an unexpected stop in their water
supply.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:49.210
I mentioned the U.S’s protocol for chemical
weapons disposal, because there’s no available

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:55.309
information on how the U.S. disposes of biological
weapons. Reason being, technically production

00:40:55.309 --> 00:41:02.080
of biological weapons is in strict violation
of the 1972 multinational Biological Weapons

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.080
Convention.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:08.110
This is more bad news for them, because if
news got out about the Trixie Virus, it would

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:12.700
cause major problems and destroy any trust
with other nations who would then start their

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:19.180
own bioweapons research and development programs.
Let’s be real though, the BWC is all theatrics

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:24.520
and I bet a significant percentage of participating
nations are secretly developing them already.

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:29.319
The problem is that the government has a real
incentive to silence any survivors and destroy

00:41:29.319 --> 00:41:35.190
any evidence this virus exists, aka David’s
crew. They need to keep walking towards the

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:42.050
next city so they can distribute their evidence
like we planned earlier.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:50.470
Okay, maybe Judy was right about Russ. They
correctly try to take the guns away from him,

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:53.450
but Russ has a backup pistola which he pulls
on them.

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:57.260
With Russ’s declining mental condition,
they can’t afford to allow him to have the

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:01.970
guns for much longer, so David confronts Russ
and is able to get close enough to disarm

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:02.970
him.

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:06.700
Most people don’t understand that once someone
is within arms reach of you, they can hit

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:12.180
you or grab your gun faster than you can physically
react. Which is why you never hold a gun out

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:40.150
like that within arms reach of someone who
might try to take it.

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:44.369
Pretty sad bro moment, obviously they were
long time friends, and Russ still has the

00:42:44.369 --> 00:42:48.640
capacity to know he’s done for, but he still
wants to hang out with them a little while

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:49.640
longer.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.470
I say sure, as long as he’s not within arms
reach or behind you. But if they get into

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:57.790
a situation where they need to stealth it,
David’s gonna need to let him go.

00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:02.410
Eventually they run into a military checkpoint,
and Russ volunteers to take one for the team

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:06.080
to distract the soldiers so David and Judy
can make it across.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.869
I’m confused as to why they all can’t
just walk further down the road where there

00:43:09.869 --> 00:43:11.250
isn’t a checkpoint.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:15.829
There also is no reason to give Russ your
gun, he can distract them perfectly fine unarmed.

00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:22.400
And he emptied the gun as well, seriously,
there was no point in giving him the gun.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:28.180
He could have caused them to shoot just by
acting like he was going for a gun or making

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:29.330
a finger pistol.

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:34.230
David and Judy successfully sneak past the
military checkpoint and arrive at a gas station

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:38.710
where they try to find supplies and a truck.
Man, wouldn’t it be nice to have that gun

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:39.710
right now.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:44.210
You would think they would have learned by
now that splitting up only causes problems.

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:49.280
On Judy’s adventure, she finds truckloads
of dead bodies and bullet casings, this information

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:53.900
doesn’t really change much, they already
knew the military has gotten paranoid and

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.310
trigger happy.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:44:06.380
He’s not, he’s providing solutions while
you complain and moan, but by all means, let's

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.930
just sit here and wallow until someone comes
and kills us.

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:15.349
Judy finally comes to her senses and they
split up yet again. David has the important

00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:20.150
task of gathering supplies and finding an
operational vehicle with keys, while Judy

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:25.119
has the important task of having a sit and
pouring a fresh glass of water.

00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:29.410
The only explanation for their stupidity is
that they are infected and losing their minds

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:33.910
too. I don’t know how you could be so nonchalant
when almost every location you’ve been to

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:39.640
has had homicidal maniacs, paranoid survivors,
or hostile soldiers at it.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:44.370
Yep, psychos are here too. Get a w eapon.
Come on. There ya go.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:48.020
Hopefully you can fake dead better than in
the hospital from earlier. I bet you’re

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:52.190
really regretting splitting up right about
now. Oh they both decided to hide in the room

00:44:52.190 --> 00:45:00.020
full of dead bodies, perfect.

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:07.869
I really wish people would shut the fuck up
while someone else is doing an important task.

00:45:07.869 --> 00:45:11.730
That’s like the third time she’s done
that to him. He knows it’s urgent, he’s

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:15.790
always known that. Don’t start stressing
him out even more while he’s trying to figure

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:16.790
it out.

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:20.670
David figures the corpse they pulled out of
the driver seat probably has the keys and

00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:26.230
gets ambushed when he tries to snag them.
Realistically, an AR15 round would sail through

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:30.619
that door like a hot knife through butter
and Judy would be very dead right now.

00:45:30.619 --> 00:45:34.830
You know when the guy you are fighting takes
a good wrench to the face and barely flinches,

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:37.069
you’re going to have a bad time.

00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:41.369
Judy was able to get into the back of the
cabin to avoid the rifle rounds and then take

00:45:41.369 --> 00:45:44.119
the crazy by surprise with a solid headshot.

00:45:44.119 --> 00:45:48.190
David finishes the other infected guy off
by flicking his zippo at him like a classic

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:52.369
action hero, and they haul ass out of town
in the semi. On the radio there’s some kind

00:45:52.369 --> 00:45:57.010
of countdown being broadcasted. I think we
can safely assume that it’s nothing good.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:01.089
The fact that it’s on a broad channel going
to all soldiers in the area indicates that

00:46:01.089 --> 00:46:07.619
they are trying to evacuate the area before
they hit it with a bomb or something.

00:46:07.619 --> 00:46:24.030
Well that’s certainly more than just a bomb.
It’s likely a plane mounted B61 Mod 7 340

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:29.190
kiloton strategic nuke, which is in service
currently. This nuke should be survivable

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:33.160
with the distance they covered in the truck.
Considering they may have gotten a mile or

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:38.859
so out of town, this would have put them outside
the fireball, heavy blast damage radius, and

00:46:38.859 --> 00:46:43.240
radiation radius, but like what occurred in
the movie, they were still inside the moderate

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:47.900
blast damage radius which easily could have
flipped their truck. They are also inside

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:52.150
the thermal blast radius, but the truck provided
some protection against it.

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:56.261
I didn’t think the situation was bad enough
to require a freaking nuke. I don’t see

00:46:56.261 --> 00:47:01.660
how they can keep a domestic nuclear strike
a few hours away from a major city under wraps

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:02.660
anymore.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:06.890
The satellite caught David and Judy walking
towards Cedar Rapids, and initiated another

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:11.850
quarantine zone. It’s not really clear if
they were initiating the quarantine zone because

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:15.819
of David and Judy, or because Cedar Rapids
was contaminated as well.

00:47:15.819 --> 00:47:20.119
I have a hard time believing it was because
of David and Judy. They already caught them

00:47:20.119 --> 00:47:31.530
on satellite, they’d just need to swing
an Apache by and hit them with the chain gun.

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:34.010
Not much of a happy ending, but it would solve
the problem.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:38.210
It also wouldn’t be caused by the water
supply being contaminated, because the Cedar

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:42.390
Rapids river flows south through the fictional
town of Ogden Marsh.

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:48.140
It’s likely some other people already made
it there. Again with how self-limiting this

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:52.950
virus is, because it’s not airborne and
the hosts show incredibly obvious signs after

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:58.819
2 days and are dead after 3 more days, it’s
not really that much of a problem, as long

00:47:58.819 --> 00:48:03.359
as you don’t crash another plane filled
with Trixie into Cedar Rapids water supply.

00:48:03.359 --> 00:48:07.850
Post credits they show a news reporter saying
that there was a chemical plant explosion

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:12.740
in Ogden Marsh which caused the fireball.
To be fair, chemical warehouse explosions

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:19.319
can be absolutely massive, but seriously doubt
you could cover up a domestic nuclear explosion.

00:48:19.319 --> 00:48:23.530
At the very end of the news report, it cuts
to David who turned into a crazy because of

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:27.960
his knife wound contamination. Just kidding
I don’t know if it’s him, but Cedar Rapids

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:31.180
is now under siege from the Trixie crazies.

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:32.410
The movie ends.

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:37.460
Let’s recap who would have lived or died
if the characters made the best possible choices.

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:41.869
If the government followed its own guidance
and regulations, the Trixie Virus shouldn’t

00:48:41.869 --> 00:48:45.960
have escaped the triple packaging. Even if
it did, there shouldn’t have been enough

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:50.140
of it to infect the entire town. In this case,
nobody would have died.

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:54.810
If we accept that the virus made it out of
the plane and into the water supply, well,

00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:59.319
at that point everyone would be dead. If it
wasn’t for their immense amount of luck,

00:48:59.319 --> 00:49:04.130
the virus should have infected them from drinking
the same water for a week, the soldiers should

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:08.260
have gunned them down for breaching the quarantine,
the Apache should have disintegrated them

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:13.600
with Hydra rockets for trying to run in a
1973 ford police cruiser, and the crazies

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:16.330
should have killed them for splitting up and
being oblivious.

00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:20.950
I think with our guidance, the military could
have packaged the virus properly, and we could

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:23.309
have beaten the Trixie virus from The Crazies.

00:49:23.309 --> 00:49:28.220
Thanks for watching, and remember, at the
first sign of an apocalypse, run for it and

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:32.690
leave everyone else behind, they’re probably
already dead.
