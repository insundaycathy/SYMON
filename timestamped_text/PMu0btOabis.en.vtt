(projector hums)
(reel clicks)

00:00:03.747 --> 00:00:05.460
- [Marcus] "Westworld"
has had a decades-long

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.670
history in pop culture.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.400
Between the "Westworld" show
and a "Westworld" movie,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.400
this sci-fi western franchise
has a length history.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.860
Too bad it's about as scrambled
as Bernard's leaky brain.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.100
So, in preparation for
"Westworld" season 3,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.870
we're unraveling the maze that
is the "Westworld" timeline.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.880
Though the show hasn't
divulged the exact years

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.650
it takes place, there are some hints.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.030
A video on the tie-in website
featured a 2052 watermark,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.140
while a recent season 3
trailer included the year 2058

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.260
in relation to some big, unnamed event.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.010
So, until we get some answers,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.730
these dates are gonna have about
a six year margin of error.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.390
But trust us, you'll want this to be

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.900
as simplified as possible.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.990
2015 to 2018, two ambitious technicians,

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.420
Arnold Weber and Robert
Frost, spend three years

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.510
engineering highly-advanced
AI units known as hosts.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.630
Their goal is to one day use these hosts

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.250
in a completely immersive world.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.180
Once the hosts pass the Turing test,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.270
they're ready to hit the market.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.070
Weber and Ford put on a demonstration

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.170
using Angela and Akecheta
to woo Logan Delos,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.700
the son of James Delos, the founder

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.300
of the massive Delos Corporation.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.660
Logan sees all the dirty, dirty potential

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.100
in these realistic
non-humans, so, he invests.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.890
With funding from the Delos Corporation,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.980
Arnold and Ford create Westworld,
also known as the park.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.850
Based out of an island
somewhere near China,

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.730
it's a place where real
humans can experience

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.030
their wildest, western-est
fantasies, for a price of course.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.440
Among the preliminary
host units is Dolores,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.530
who Arnold grows particularly fond of.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.370
Her sense of splendor reminds
him of his son, Charlie,

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.260
but not really a
comparison you want to make

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.340
before subjecting someone
to a lawless world

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.290
of sex and murder.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.250
After his son falls ill and passes away,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.020
Arnold falls into a deep depression.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.470
He takes solace in his
creations and tries to elevate

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.510
Dolores to the next level of intelligence,

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.510
true bicameral consciousness.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.700
To that end, he has
one-on-one meetings with her

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.800
and also develops the reveries code,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.610
allowing the hosts to recall
their latent memories.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.510
Arnold hopes that this
will be the foundation

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.280
for the pyramid of consciousness,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.680
although he revises that theory,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.470
since consciousness is
really more like a maze.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.890
Once Dolores successfully
traverses her maze,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.540
Arnold determines that they
can no longer open the park.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.410
It would be immoral to
allow truly living organisms

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.010
to face that kind of depravity.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.880
But there's no stopping this train now,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.850
at least, not peacefully.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.230
In an attempt to nip
Westworld's violent delights

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.980
in the bud, Arnold imbues Dolores

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.880
with the villainous persona of Wyatt,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.550
an outlaw from a different narrative.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.530
It sends her on a killing
spree, first, the other hosts,

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.260
then Arnold, then herself.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.030
The little town of Escalante
is marked by the massacre,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.540
becoming the very center
of Dolores' new maze.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.680
When Akecheta hears the
gunshots from his village

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.700
outside town, he leaves his wife Kohana,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.920
and investigates the site.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.870
He finds Arnold's literal
toy maze in the bar in town

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.840
and realizes that it has a deeper meaning.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.200
Akecheta is intrigued, but
the technicians just figure

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.250
there's something wrong with him,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.220
so they reformat him
into the violent leader

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.600
of Ghost Nation,
Westworld's kind of racist

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.710
Native American villains.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.430
Ford sweeps that whole massacre
business under the rug,

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.200
and decides to open the park anyway.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.640
Welcome to "Westworld."

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.120
2020 to 2025, after
repeated, debaucherous visits

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.790
to the park, Logan Delos brings

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.640
his soon-to-be brother-in-law, William.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.660
William is engaged to
Logan's sister, Juliet,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.310
so Logan wants him to see the investment

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.040
that's so important to the family company.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.450
Logan plays as a black hat,

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.610
basically Westworld's
equivalent of a bad guy.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.460
He likes drinking,
fighting, and infidelity.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.100
On the other hand, Will thinks
of himself as a good guy,

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.420
white knight sort of figure.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.110
So, when reborn farm girl
Dolores stumbles off track

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.983
and bumps into the two of them,
William decides to help her.

00:03:20.983 --> 00:03:22.830
Throughout his time in the park,

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.350
he falls in love with Dolores.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.620
They follow her innate memories

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.510
and retrace her steps to Escalante,

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.710
where Dolores melts down.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.050
She remembers the massacre,

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.900
but doesn't know what
it means to remember.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.210
Logan, for one, has had
enough of this crap.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.000
In his mind, Westworld is a game.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.380
It's not this complex
moral proving ground.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.010
Plus, William's engaged to his sister.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.190
So, Logan guts Dolores in front of William

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.270
to stop the madness.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.030
Shaken by the incident, William goes

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.670
on a host-slaughtering spree,

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.630
until he crosses paths with
reborn Dolores once again.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.070
Now, her memories and
feelings for him are gone.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.160
He was bad before,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.830
but this causes William
to completely snap.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.080
He also loses the photograph
of Juliet in the park,

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.650
so hopefully someone in
Westworld's QA finds that

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.040
before it causes any trouble.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.320
To discredit Logan, and
get a little revenge on him

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.150
for being a jerk, William strips him naked

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.020
and sends him out into
the park on a horse.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.410
Akecheta later finds Logan,
sunburned and delusional,

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.410
rambling about how wrong the world is

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.870
and asking for the door home.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.800
But Logan's nonsense reminds Akecheta

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.830
that this world is, in fact, wrong.

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.540
Later, William returns to
Westworld with James Delos,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.810
Logan and Juliet's father.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.810
He convinces James that Westworld is more

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.610
than just an R-rated Disneyland.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.330
It's the perfect place
to study, and exploit,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.870
the human condition in ways that

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.860
AdSense could only dream of.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.870
So, Delos funnels more
money into the park,

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.860
playing right into William's dirty hands.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.860
Though William goes on to marry Juliet,

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.500
and even has a daughter named Emily,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.780
unfortunately, he has
been forever corrupted.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.890
He's no longer William.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.550
He is now the Man in Black.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.100
Also, going off that season
3 marketing material,

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.230
there are some pretty big global
catastrophes in the 2020s,

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.000
an ecological collapse
in Indonesia in 2020,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.330
a presidential assassination in 2024,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.250
a thermonuclear incident in Paris in 2025.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.870
It's just bad times all around.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.760
The roaring twenties, guys, get psyched!

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.350
2027 to 2051, to fully
exploit the park investment,

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.010
William constructs the Forge.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.240
It's a data center that
houses all the dirty laundry

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.040
harvested on the world's billionaires.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.760
But William wants to use that
data to offer immortality,

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.660
by rebuilding human
consciousnesses as hosts.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.910
He uses James Delos,
his own father-in-law,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.610
as the guinea pig for the initiative.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.420
The real James has become terminally-ill,

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.320
so Will fabricates a host version

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.470
of him that's meant to fully
replicate the original.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.210
The early models are far from perfect,

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.520
even by human standards.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.220
They're glitchy and inconsistent.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.650
At James' retirement party,
while William schmoozes

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.680
with his dying father-in-law,
Logan gets high

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.310
and mourns William's takeover.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.200
Eventually, this drug habit
leads him to overdose and die.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.850
While the Forge is still
being made, Akecheta finds it

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.460
and interprets it as the door

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.140
that Logan's been rambling about.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.070
He nabs his
wife-from-another-life, Kohana,

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.530
and they make their way back there,

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.280
but park security catches onto them.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.940
They take Kohana away to cold storage,

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.730
and Akecheta spends years and years

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:57.830
searching the park for her.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.950
Finally, he realizes that
the only way to save her

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.150
is to go to the land of the
dead and bring her back.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.030
So, after a decade of staying
alive, he gets himself shot.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.690
At the Mesa Hub, Akecheta
sneaks into cold storage

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.070
and finds not only his wife,

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.440
but an entire army of inactive hosts.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.790
Now privy to how the
company abuses its guests,

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.880
Akecheta begins spreading
the word of the maze

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.420
and the freedom it offers hosts.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.110
It's also worth noting that
in 2039 there's some kind

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.840
of worldwide system
initiated called Solomon.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.950
I'm sure we'll hear more
about it in season 3,

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.350
but it seems to help with
the general anarchy happening

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.690
in the world, so have got
that to look forward to.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.740
As the Westworld brand
expands, they introduce

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.870
five additional parks, Shogun World,

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.040
Warworld, the Raj, and two others.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.550
These Delos destinations
are similar to Westworld,

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.840
but set in different time
periods, and in some cases,

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.540
even more extreme than the original,

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.120
though, due to some of Lee
Sizemore's lazy writing,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.090
some of the parks have
identical narratives.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.120
The technicians test all
these park narratives

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.660
in a room called the Cradle,
which simulates the different

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.530
storylines and character loops
in a sort of digital world.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.010
Robert Ford has been short a partner

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.570
ever since the whole massacre thing,

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.570
so he reconstructs Arnold in host form,

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.890
naming him Bernard Lowe.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.470
It's an anagram of Arnold Weber,

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.160
real clever stuff here, guys.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.440
Anyway, Bernard becomes the head

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.150
of Westworld's programming division,

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.440
unaware that he is actually
a robot in disguise.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.200
By this time, William
has all but conquered

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.400
the Delos Corporation
and the Delos family.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.200
Logan is dead, James is dead,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.530
and though William is never
physically violent with Juliet

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.830
or Emily, they sense
the evil inside of him.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.460
Sure, they go on a family
vacay to the Raj together,

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.800
but this is not the man Juliet married.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.710
This is Ed Harris now.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.430
Juliet turns to drinking,
and when she finds a profile

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.270
of all of William's misdeeds in the park,

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.570
it drives her to suicide.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.900
Her death opens a rift
between William and Emily.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.460
Estranged from his family and
desperate to feel something,

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.600
anything, William returns to Westworld.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.670
He abandons the old host
James that he's been working

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.140
to perfect, and he torments
a host mother and daughter

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.050
out on the homestead,
pushing the boundaries

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.230
of his inner black hat.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.620
The host mother, Maeve,
is so humanly heartbroken

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.890
by her daughter's death that
Ford has her drive wiped

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.930
completely clean and then recasts her

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.450
as the Mariposa madam, a
different kind of mother.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.440
But her grief unlocks the maze within her,

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.890
just as Akecheta wanted.

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.430
And when the Man in Black sees that,

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.540
he realizes that there's
more to these robots

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.530
than meets the eye.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.040
2052, pre-incident, while
William searches for the maze,

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.540
Ford kicks off a quest of his own.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.020
In the decades since Arnold's death,

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.610
Ford has come to realize that his partner

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.280
was right all along, hosts are alive.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.900
This is troublesome, since
the increasingly overreaching

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.280
Delos executives have no
interest in the hosts,

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.460
and they're planning to
force Ford into retirement.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.830
So, Ford concocts a plan
to liberate the hosts

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.510
in a way that Arnold never could.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.790
But the plan itself is a little messy.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.260
Here's what we understand about it.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.460
Ford wants the hosts to suffer,
so that they'll be motivated

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.220
to overtake the park and escape,
some into the real world,

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.830
and some into the digital world.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.010
He introduces Arnold's old reveries code

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.980
in a software update, allowing hosts

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.150
to recall their torture.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.640
To assure their safety, he,
probably, creates Ashley Stubbs,

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.690
the head of the security force

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.060
who blends in with the humans.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.160
Ford even diverts suspicion from Stubbs

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.690
by making him look like the
third Hemsworth brother.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.340
Then, Ford tells Akecheta about the door,

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.860
which he'll be able to access
once the plan comes to a head

00:08:58.860 --> 00:08:59.960
and the robots rebel.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.190
So, that's the plan for
the hosts going digital.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.110
For the hosts escaping
the park altogether,

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.610
he drops a machine at Arnold's house

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.580
for them to reconstruct
their bodies, you know,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.940
in case, say, that's something
that needs to happen.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.960
It's a pretty convoluted
plan, but then again,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.540
Ford did pull off that whole
Bernard, Arnold anagram,

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.710
so clearly, you know, the man's a genius.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.720
Despite all of his plotting,
the catalyzing event

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.870
of the rebellion has
little to do with Ford.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.520
Instead, it's because of that
old photograph of Juliet.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.050
Old Peter Abernathy finds it,

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.120
and for some reason it breaks his brain.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.140
He spends all night obsessing over it.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.210
When his daughter, Dolores,
talks to him about it,

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:34.300
he tells her "these violent
delights have violent ends."

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.170
This phrase triggers her reverie coding

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.760
and unlocks the maze once again.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.600
As Dolores retraces her
steps back to Escalante,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.810
she relives the memories of
her journey with William,

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.170
blurring the past and
present into one reality.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.790
William is following the maze too,

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.270
and he's enlisted the host
named Teddy to help him.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.860
James Marsden is a great
traveling companion, you know,

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.770
just ask Sonic or Hop.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.450
Even though Ford warned him that the maze

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.840
is not meant for humans,
William pushes onward.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.280
He arrives at Escalante at
the same time as Dolores,

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.780
and once Dolores sees William
again after all these years,

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.960
she connects the dots.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.390
Between that, and her
recollection of the Escalante

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.000
massacre, Dolores becomes fully conscious.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.410
While that's happening, Dolores
crosses paths with Maeve

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.640
and repeats the violent
delights phrase to her.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.610
Maeve wakes up too, but her
journey is a little different.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.700
While it appears as though
she's gaining sentience,

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.500
she's actually acting
out another narrative

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.950
that Ford programmed into her,

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.020
but she plays the part well.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.870
Maeve regains memories
of her prior deaths,

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.210
manipulates these two
cartoon cat technicians

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.530
into boosting all her game stats,

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.150
and then unlocks the ability
to bend reality to her will.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.150
See, Ford just wanted to do
a "Matrix" themed narrative.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.450
With help from her new squad,
Maeve makes it to the train

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.570
out of the park, but
realizes that this narrative

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.480
isn't what she actually wants.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.540
It's just another lie.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.060
What she wants is to find
her old homestead daughter,

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.660
so she abandons the mission
and returns to Westworld.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.930
Behind the scenes, the
Delos Corporation executives

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.780
are afraid that, when they oust Ford,

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.500
he'll delete all the host technology.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.420
So, Executive Director
Charlotte Hale begins colluding

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.680
with the head of quality assurance,

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.390
Theresa Cullen, to leak the data to her

00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.660
via satellite up-link.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.950
Theresa also happens to
be sleeping with Bernard,

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.380
so she's really living
her best "Westworld" life.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.090
Anyway, Theresa tries to leak
the data using a woodcutter

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.290
host with a satellite
up-link system in his arm,

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:10.650
but the woodcutter fumbles it.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.810
Behavior department
programmer Elsie Hughes

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.990
does some snooping and
catches onto Theresa,

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.050
but Ford worries that her
discovery will mess with his plan.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.260
So, he sics Bernard on her.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.070
Bernard strangles Elsie and
stores her away in a cave

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.450
until the master plan is done.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.600
Then, using Elsie's intel,
he has Bernard kill Theresa.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.960
They stage the murder to look
like a data smuggling related

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.780
accident, discrediting Theresa.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.720
Ford uses Bernard for other errands too,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.300
like slaughtering an entire
bunker of technicians and hosts,

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.800
and creating a pearl duplicate
of Ford's consciousness.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.580
That pearl gets added to the Cradle,

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.200
so that a digitized Ford can
continue to pull the strings

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.360
even after he dies.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.810
As the big climax approaches,
Bernard figures out that

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.320
Ford's just been using him.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.550
He realizes that he's
been a host all along,

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.300
and rather than wipe his memory again,

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.080
Ford makes him shoot himself in the head.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.100
But don't worry, he's fine, somehow.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.540
With her mole out of the picture
and Ford back in control,

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.420
Charlotte Hale tries a different approach.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.150
She has all the stolen data funneled

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.500
into Old Peter Abernathy,
who's been on ice

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.930
ever since he found that photograph.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.100
Then she asks writer
Lee Sizemore to whip up

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.720
a personality for him, but not too much,

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.010
just enough for him to get on
the train and out of the park.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.290
They almost get away with it,

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:15.940
but everything implodes when
Ford announces a new narrative,

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.860
Journey into Night.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.870
On the surface, it sounds
like a weird homage

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.190
to the Escalante massacre.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:21.900
But beneath the surface, it's actually

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.310
a full-on recreation of
the Escalante massacre.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.410
Dolores, now bicamerally woke
and thirsty for human blood,

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:28.930
shoots Ford dead.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.880
It's just like how she shot
Arnold all those decades ago,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.530
only Ford didn't direct
Dolores to shoot him,

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.730
he just understood that
it's what she'd want to do,

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.670
and it's what he wanted her to do.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.710
So, he created the exact situation
in which she could do it.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.210
See, it's way different.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.210
And William is into it!

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.370
2052, post-incident,
now, hosts are waking up

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.320
and rebelling across all the parks.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.660
Over at the Raj, William's
daughter Emily has made her way

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.000
back to the game at the
worst possible time.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.150
She's trying to find her
father and bring him to justice

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.980
for his black hat-ery,
but she gets swept up

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.320
in the whole robot rebellion.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.530
A woke tiger attacks her,
chasing her off a cliff,

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.520
and they wash up at the
reservoir in Westworld.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.640
Elsewhere at the park, the
guests and board members

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.930
take refuge from Dolores
and her hostile army.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.740
She wreaks havoc as Wyatt,
enlisting other violent hosts

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.330
to join her cause,
including the Confederados.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.260
They're all on a mission
to the Valley Beyond,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.320
their name for the Forge.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.160
William is also on the way
there, but for his own reasons.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.660
After getting shot during the incident,

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.700
he has a come to robot Jesus moment

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.250
and sees the error of his ways.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.840
Since the hosts are now more
than just mechanical guts,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.470
William wants to destroy the Forge

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.240
and all of Westworld along with it.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.450
That's all well and good,
until Emily finds him.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.540
She offers him actual absolution
for his real world sins,

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.550
a big fat lie, but an offer nonetheless,

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.200
but William decides to run away from her

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.460
in the middle of the night instead.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.860
Meanwhile, Bernard and Charlotte
are hiding from the siege,

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.790
but the Delos Corporation
won't extract them

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.380
until they have Papa Abernathy's
data brain with them.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.660
They find him, but the
Confederados bushwhack them

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.580
and taking Abernathy and Bernard captive.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.250
At Fort Forlorn Hope, they
meet Dolores once again.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.300
It turns out that, despite
her ruthless reign,

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.190
she's still in touch
with her farm girl roots.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.930
So, when the Delos security
forces seize Abernathy,

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.480
Dolores vows to get him back.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.600
During the fray,
Clementine abducts Bernard

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.820
and takes him to the cave
that Elsie's been chilling at.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.560
Bernard and Elsie both bust out,

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.270
eventually finding an old lab
with host James inside of it.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.810
He's gone nuts in isolation,

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.260
ever since William abandoned him,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.500
so Bernard and Elsie
burn the facility down.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.380
They realize that someone
has been overriding control

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.710
of the park from inside the Cradle,

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.240
so they head to the Mesa so
that Bernard can investigate.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.920
He discovers the digitized
Ford that he himself put there,

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.310
once upon a memory wipe ago.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.920
Ford lingers in Bernard's
head for a little while after,

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.800
manipulating the park, until
Bernard deletes him forever,

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.670
well, maybe.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.700
While that's happening, Maeve
is looking for her daughter,

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.560
and not because Ford scripted her to.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.810
To do it, she'll need some help,

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.040
so she reassembles the
team of her old allies,

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.050
Hector, Armistice, the cartoon
cats, and Lee Sizemore.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.410
On the way to the homestead,
the gang misses that left turn

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.450
at Albuquerque and ends
up in Shogun World.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.050
It's an uncanny experience for them.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.210
Like I said, some of the key
characters and plot points

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.750
are ripped right from the
Mariposa narrative in Westworld.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.060
Here, the Shogun outlaw has gone hostile,

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.500
so Maeve and her magnificent army

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.060
go on a side quest to defeat him.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.610
They triumph, Maeve levels up,

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.800
and obtains full host bending abilities.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.080
Once that's done, they proceed
to the homestead as planned,

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.430
but when they arrive,
Maeve finds that a new host

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.150
has replaced her as her daughter's mother,

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.600
and to make matters worse,
Ghost Nation is back.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.680
They chase Maeve and her
not-daughter to a homestead

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.060
that William and his entourage
happen to be using too.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.470
Maeve seizes the opportunity
for some karmic justice

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:20.860
and shoots the Man in Black.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.660
She even has some other hosts do the same.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.950
But don't worry, he's fine, somehow.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.710
Lee Sizemore calls QA security

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.040
and they come through to the homestead,

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.970
stopping the attack, but damaging Maeve.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.640
Sizemore didn't want that to happen,

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.060
so they take her back to the Mesa Hub.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.510
William gets away, but Ghost
Nation catches up to him,

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:36.840
so Emily rescues him.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.630
William suspects that Emily is a host,

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.530
so he shoots her dead,
but then he sees that

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.190
she had his profile card,
the one that Juliet found,

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.290
the one that killed her, and killed Emily,

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.170
and almost killed William himself.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:48.950
Anyway, let's see how Dolores is doing.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.020
She cranks Teddy's bad boy level to 11,

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.420
then crashes the park train
straight into the Mesa Hub.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:54.810
Although she wants to save her father,

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.920
the key to the Valley
Beyond is inside his head.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.400
So, they say their goodbyes
and she rips his brains out.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.530
Dolores also commands Angela
to blow up the Cradle,

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.680
so now if they die in the
game, they die for real.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.560
That seems like it would weaken the hosts,

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.590
but it actually prevents
them from being reset

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.010
and recycled over and over again.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.980
With that business done,
Dolores and Teddy head

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.000
to the Forge, but Teddy
can't live with how rotten

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.370
to the core he's become,
so, he kills himself,

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.100
because he's too pure for this world.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.930
Dolores nabs his pearl and carries on,

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.120
convening with William
and Bernard at the Forge.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.490
She doesn't trust the Man in Black,

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.720
so she sabotages his gun,
giving him even more injuries.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.440
Seriously, how is he still alive?

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.210
A robot too, is he?

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.970
Back at the Mesa Hub, Charlotte discovers

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.210
Maeve's "Matrix" abilities
and decides to use them

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.240
to take the park back.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.070
She transfers the anomaly to Clementine,

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.260
who will infect other hosts

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.610
and make them all fight each other.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.350
The hosts are all gathered
at the Valley Beyond,

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.920
where Ford's door is open.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.850
It leads to a lush digital screensaver

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.000
where all the hosts can
live in coded harmony

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.010
until the end of time.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.080
As the hosts pass into
their digital Nirvana,

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.450
their empty husks careen
into the valley below.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:54.040
Among those transferred
are Akecheta, Kohana,

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.170
and Maeve's not-daughter.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.900
But Charlotte has unleashed
Clementine onto the masses,

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.750
and she's gonna ruin the paradise.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.980
Maeve and her entire
squad sacrifice themselves

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.370
to save their fellow hosts,
but it all comes to an end

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:06.030
when Dolores triggers the fail-safe,

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.750
flooding the valley and closing the door.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.270
See, Dolores is mad because
she doesn't want hosts

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.430
to live in a fake world.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.230
They've already been
doing that in the park.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.570
Spoiling paradise for
the hosts was bad enough,

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.240
but then this party-pooper starts deleting

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.270
all the Forge data.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.650
Just then, Bernard shoots
Dolores, grabs her pearl,

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:21.780
and heads to the Mesa.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.370
Bernard realizes that the only
person who can stop Charlotte

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:26.600
is Charlotte, so he makes
a host version of her,

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.340
transfers Dolores' mind into it,

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.540
and has her kill her
real, human counterpart.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.110
Then Bernard goes to meet
the Delos extraction team,

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.900
forgetting that any of this even happened.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.320
Now, two weeks after the incident,

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.630
Bernard wakes up on the shore,

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.250
along with the tiger from the Raj.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.930
The Delos extraction team has arrived

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.590
and they're so confused.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.220
Bernard is too, as usual.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.560
They investigate the flooded valley

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.270
and the brainwashed hosts,
literally brainwashed.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.540
See, their brains are scrubbed clean

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.250
after being transferred
to the Valley Beyond.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.060
Bernard meets up with
Dolores-Charlotte again,

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.500
and they all go to Ford's cottage.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.760
They find the hidden chamber,

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.330
full of spare Bernard clones

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.940
and Dolores-Charlotte
waterboards Bernard for answers.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.540
He reveals that Abernathy's
drive is back at the flooded

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.100
valley, so, Dolores slaughters
the extraction team,

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.310
adds Teddy to the valley,
and sends all the hosts

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.320
away into space.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.650
From here, Dolores hangs
onto her Charlotte disguise

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.600
and finally escapes Westworld
with four memory pearls,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.680
including Bernard's.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.300
At Arnold's house, she uses
that handy-dandy host machine

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.910
to rebuild her and Bernard's bodies,

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.930
and the two decide that they
will continue to help hosts

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:22.300
in their own special ways.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.460
The far, far future, so,
years into the future,

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.640
no one knows how long, the Forge has been

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.300
completely demolished,
but some faction of hosts

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.630
continues to exist there.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.000
In an experiment seemingly
run by a host Emily,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.490
a host William is forced to
relive his journey to the Forge,

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:37.620
again and again.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.260
It's kind of like those fidelity tests

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.000
that William conducted on James Delos.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.810
Though these tests run for a long time,

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.370
the hosts have yet to find the results

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:45.650
they've been seeking from William,

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.060
and so the cycle continues.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.300
What does any of this even mean?

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.420
I guess we'll just have to
wait and see in season 3.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.110
Are you secretly a robot being used

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.620
for someone else's secret plans?

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:54.580
How can you be sure?

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.060
Let us know in the comments down below,

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.840
and be sure to subscribe to Cinematica

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.770
for more timelines just like this one.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.344
I've been your host,
Marcus, thanks for watching.

00:19:02.344 --> 00:19:05.011
(upbeat music)
