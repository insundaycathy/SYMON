00:00:05.148 --> 00:00:06.364
hey what's up guys

00:00:06.556 --> 00:00:10.396
today I'll show you a science fiction comedy film, "Virtuosity"

00:00:10.716 --> 00:00:13.148
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:19.228
in the city of Los Angeles, Parker and his colleague are tracing down a serial killer

00:00:19.356 --> 00:00:21.724
at a restaurant in the virtual reality world

00:00:22.364 --> 00:00:24.284
where they locate the suspect SID

00:00:24.412 --> 00:00:28.764
the most Sadistic, Intelligent, and Dangerous VR killer throughout the history

00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:33.628
after a fierce gunfire the colleague is caused into shock

00:00:34.396 --> 00:00:37.148
while SID wants to take a hostage for cover

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.964
Parker kills the hostage and shoots SID

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.972
however, as Parker walks closer 

00:00:43.164 --> 00:00:47.196
he only finds that the hostage being shot dead is actually his colleague

00:00:48.028 --> 00:00:50.908
right at that moment, SID makes his attack from nowhere

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.940
and controls Parker with his fingers piercing through Parker's wound

00:00:55.516 --> 00:00:57.180
meanwhile, in the real world

00:00:57.308 --> 00:00:59.612
Parker and his colleague suffer great pains 

00:00:59.996 --> 00:01:01.916
due to the overload to their nerve system  

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.372
In fact, this is a virtual reality system 

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:10.236
which is developed for the police to train their employees in fighting against the criminals 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.844
but unexpectedly, some unknown technical issue happens to the system

00:01:15.036 --> 00:01:17.084
resulting in the death of the colleague

00:01:17.852 --> 00:01:21.692
because of that, the project superior orders to shut down the project

00:01:22.204 --> 00:01:23.868
Dave is very frustrated 

00:01:23.996 --> 00:01:27.772
for he makes lots of efforts in developing the whole VR training system

00:01:28.348 --> 00:01:30.396
although Parker survives the accident 

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.444
he is cuffed up again by the police

00:01:32.828 --> 00:01:35.452
as Parker unveils the tricks used by SID

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.948
and is about to show the evidence in the computer

00:01:38.204 --> 00:01:40.700
Dave however, stops him immediately

00:01:41.212 --> 00:01:46.076
not long after that, Dave accuses virtual SID of the murder in the virtual world

00:01:46.396 --> 00:01:50.108
because he actually knows SID has changed the nerve system parameters secretly 

00:01:50.428 --> 00:01:53.116
which exactly causes the death of a policeman

00:01:53.692 --> 00:01:57.468
SID, who seems to enjoy the feeling of his first killing however

00:01:57.724 --> 00:02:00.796
only responses in indifference to the accusal

00:02:01.244 --> 00:02:05.596
he even goes further and proposes Dave release him out of the virtual world

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:09.820
it's revealed that Parker is actually a former police officer 

00:02:10.012 --> 00:02:15.004
but was found guilty and sent into prison due to his private execution of a gangster 

00:02:15.196 --> 00:02:17.180
who killed his wife and daughter

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.724
he's just taken out temporarily from jail to join the VR training project

00:02:22.364 --> 00:02:26.140
on the other side, in rage and disappointed by the aborted VR system

00:02:26.332 --> 00:02:28.572
Dave chooses to accept SID's proposal

00:02:28.764 --> 00:02:31.196
and attempt to free SID out of the VR world

00:02:31.836 --> 00:02:34.716
he then seduces the technician with a horny lady program 

00:02:34.844 --> 00:02:39.132
and makes the technician believe that he can bring the horny lady to the real world 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.332
by having its personality implanted in a physical body

00:02:42.908 --> 00:02:46.044
believing that he's gonna meet the programed sexy lady in the real world soon 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.716
the technician bites the bait and starts to download her personality

00:02:51.228 --> 00:02:55.196
while Dave however, takes the chance to exchange her personality chip with SID's

00:02:55.388 --> 00:02:58.460
as a result, SID is brought into the real world

00:02:59.036 --> 00:03:03.324
as he forms its physical body, he kills the shocking technician immediately

00:03:03.452 --> 00:03:06.460
before appreciating such a masterpiece of himself

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.900
after knowing that the virtual serial killer SID has escaped out of the virtual world

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:16.828
the police negotiate with Parker on the hunting mission in exchange for his freedom

00:03:17.532 --> 00:03:20.220
with that promised, Parker takes the mission 

00:03:20.796 --> 00:03:24.444
but to avoid his escape, the police have him implanted with a tracker

00:03:24.636 --> 00:03:29.564
not long after that, Parker and the assistant set out to the crime scene directly

00:03:29.756 --> 00:03:34.300
where he notices that SID commits the crime by copying the way from other murderers

00:03:35.004 --> 00:03:38.844
they head to Dave's house later for more personality details about SID

00:03:39.356 --> 00:03:42.300
they find out that SID is built with a self-learning program 

00:03:42.492 --> 00:03:46.076
which enables him to mimic many different personalities of criminals

00:03:46.204 --> 00:03:49.852
surprisingly even the one who killed Parker's wife and daughter

00:03:50.492 --> 00:03:53.116
on the other hand, SID wanders to a local bar

00:03:53.244 --> 00:03:57.084
where he attempts to enjoy the mass killing before the camera and the public

00:03:57.532 --> 00:04:00.028
right then, Parker shows up and shoots SID 

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.140
causing some damage to his body

00:04:02.716 --> 00:04:07.388
SID runs away from the bar and skillfully gets rid of the hunters chasing behind 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.164
on the second day, while learning of the news from the television 

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:14.940
SID becomes to admire himself in such a masterpiece just done 

00:04:15.324 --> 00:04:18.332
right now, he really enjoys the bloody killing before the public

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:21.980
later based on the subsequent personality analysis

00:04:22.172 --> 00:04:24.796
Parker knows that SID may have headed to the wrestling show

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.460
so he rushes there 

00:04:27.164 --> 00:04:31.260
while during that time, SID surrounds himself with the crazy audience at the stadium

00:04:31.388 --> 00:04:33.500
and it turns out he lits up the whole show

00:04:33.692 --> 00:04:35.804
by throwing a guy down to the stage badly

00:04:36.124 --> 00:04:37.916
and kidnaps a girl before the camera

00:04:38.108 --> 00:04:40.860
trying to challenge Parker, who's coming for him

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.468
right at that time, a security guard shows up and blows his arm off

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:47.836
but it can never stop SID

00:04:48.092 --> 00:04:52.572
who just jumps to the stage and starts to enjoy the cheer-up from the fanatical audience

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:55.004
however, noticing Parker shows up 

00:04:55.132 --> 00:04:57.692
SID has to stop his fanatism and runs away

00:04:57.884 --> 00:05:00.572
intending to play the hide-and-seek with Parker 

00:05:01.148 --> 00:05:04.860
later on a train, SID kidnaps an innocent girl and kills her

00:05:04.988 --> 00:05:08.572
but he tricks the public to believe that it's Parker who shoots the girl

00:05:08.828 --> 00:05:11.516
causing Parker to be arrested by the coming police

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.508
seemingly satisfied by his success in humiliating Parker in that way

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.620
SID then vanishes by the train 

00:05:19.388 --> 00:05:21.884
trying hard to argue that SID sets him up though

00:05:22.076 --> 00:05:25.212
Parker however, could not find anybody to believe him

00:05:25.468 --> 00:05:28.540
but right after Parker is confined into the police car

00:05:28.732 --> 00:05:30.588
SID sets him free intentionally

00:05:30.844 --> 00:05:33.084
for SID has got addicted to the bloody show 

00:05:33.276 --> 00:05:36.092
and never wants the game to be finished so soon 

00:05:36.668 --> 00:05:41.084
he even tells Parker that the tracker implanted in his body is actually toxic

00:05:41.404 --> 00:05:43.964
intending to keep Parker alive for the following game

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.276
with his life in great danger, Parker explains to the assistant that SID sets him up

00:05:49.596 --> 00:05:51.068
upon knowing the truth

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.628
the police director rushes to the control center

00:05:53.756 --> 00:05:57.148
destroys the computer before the toxic tracker is activated

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.388
and saves parker's life finally

00:06:00.156 --> 00:06:04.188
but not long after that, SID escalates his terror attack on innocent people

00:06:04.444 --> 00:06:08.924
he kills all of the staff of a TV station and takes control of it

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:11.996
Parker and the assistant make their way to the station

00:06:12.188 --> 00:06:15.836
where the assistant however, learns that SID has kidnaped her daughter

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:19.420
as Parker rushes through the bullet rain into the building

00:06:19.676 --> 00:06:23.068
the assistant happens to see Dave, the developer of SID

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.460
she threatens Dave to tell her where's her daughter

00:06:26.588 --> 00:06:30.044
but to no avail, because even Dave never knows SID's plan

00:06:30.748 --> 00:06:32.540
after getting into the broadcast center

00:06:32.668 --> 00:06:35.036
Parker shoots SID with heavy gunfire 

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.084
which slows down his escape

00:06:37.724 --> 00:06:42.140
the two then confront each other and fall into a fierce bloody dogfight 

00:06:42.588 --> 00:06:47.516
eventually, Parker manages to overpower SID and bashes him into the glass

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.884
with his body sliced into pieces though

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:53.916
SID however, absorbs the glass fiber to recovers his body soon

00:06:54.044 --> 00:06:56.028
and holds Parker's neck tightly 

00:06:56.348 --> 00:06:58.396
attempting to suffocate him to death

00:06:59.164 --> 00:07:00.636
right at that critical moment

00:07:00.828 --> 00:07:04.476
Parker manages to pull out his personality chip behind his head 

00:07:04.732 --> 00:07:09.084
which suddenly shuts down SID and stops his body from recovering

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:12.284
meanwhile, the assistant takes Dave there

00:07:12.412 --> 00:07:16.764
who just warns that she can never rescue her daughter after SID is destroyed

00:07:16.892 --> 00:07:19.580
but luckily, Parker figures out a plan

00:07:20.796 --> 00:07:22.396
they enter the virtual world later 

00:07:22.524 --> 00:07:23.932
where they find SID 

00:07:24.124 --> 00:07:26.172
who's believing that he's still in the real world

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.412
SID kills Parker easily

00:07:28.604 --> 00:07:30.972
feeling exciting as the final winner of the game

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.300
he turns arrogant and even tells the assistant 

00:07:34.428 --> 00:07:36.156
where her daughter is confined

00:07:36.668 --> 00:07:39.548
but upon seeing Parker comes alive before him again

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.132
SID realizes that he has been sent back to the virtual world

00:07:43.772 --> 00:07:46.844
at the time when the assistant is taken off-line however

00:07:47.036 --> 00:07:49.660
Dave takes a chance to kill the police director 

00:07:49.788 --> 00:07:51.580
attempting to free SID

00:07:52.284 --> 00:07:55.356
fortunately, right before SID regains control 

00:07:55.548 --> 00:07:58.172
and is about to kill Parker in the virtual world

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:01.500
the assistant wakes up and kills Dave instead

00:08:02.076 --> 00:08:04.764
once off-line from the virtual world

00:08:04.892 --> 00:08:07.836
Parker takes out SID's personality chip immediately

00:08:09.372 --> 00:08:13.852
at the end of the story, the police save the daughter and set Parker free, as promised 

00:08:14.428 --> 00:08:19.804
while the personality chip of the demon SID is thrown onto the street and torn into pieces

00:08:21.276 --> 00:08:23.644
this's Daniel CC movie channel, Bye
