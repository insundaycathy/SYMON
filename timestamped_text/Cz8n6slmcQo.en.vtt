Welcome back to Mrs Rundown, in todayâ€™s video I&nbsp;
am going to be recapping the events of Kick-Ass,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.120
a 2010 Comedy/Action film. Spoilers ahead!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.160
Dave Lizewski is an ordinary teenager&nbsp;
who lives in Staten Island, New York.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.200
Inspired by comic books, Dave plans&nbsp;
to become a real-life superhero.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.440
He purchases and modifies a scuba diving&nbsp;
suit, and arms himself with batons.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.280
During his first outing, he gets stabbed and&nbsp;
then hit by a car. After recovering, he gains a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.320
capacity to endure pain and enhanced durability&nbsp;
due to having some bones replaced with metal.&nbsp;

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.320
In his absence from school, a rumor spreads&nbsp;
that he is gay. As a result, his longtime crush,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.440
Katie Deauxma, immediately attempts to become&nbsp;
his friend. Unhappy with the misunderstanding,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.040
Dave nevertheless appreciates the&nbsp;
opportunity to get closer to Katie.&nbsp;

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.240
Dave returns to crime-fighting and gains notoriety&nbsp;
after saving a man from a gang attack. Calling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.320
himself "Kick-Ass", he sets up a Myspace&nbsp;
account where he can be contacted for help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.640
Responding to a request from Katie, he confronts a&nbsp;
drug dealer, Rasul, who has been harassing her. At&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.000
Rasul's place, Kick-Ass is quickly overwhelmed&nbsp;
by Rasul's thugs. Before they can kill him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.080
two costumed vigilantes, Hit-Girl and her father,&nbsp;
Big Daddy, intervene, easily slaughter the thugs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.120
and leave with their money. After coming home,&nbsp;
Dave realizes he is in over his head, and plans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.560
to give up crime-fighting. However, Hit-Girl&nbsp;
and Big Daddy pay him a visit and encourage him.&nbsp;

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.240
Big Daddy's real identity is Damon&nbsp;
Macready, formerly an honest cop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.240
Framed by Mafia boss Frank D'Amico, he was&nbsp;
jailed. His wife committed suicide, leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.440
behind his daughter Mindy. Against the protest of&nbsp;
his former partner Marcus Williams, Damon trains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.920
himself and Mindy as preparation for getting&nbsp;
revenge on Frank. They have been undermining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.240
Frank's operations by raiding his warehouses,&nbsp;
robbing his money and destroying his drugs.&nbsp;

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.320
Frank believes Kick-Ass is responsible&nbsp;
for the attacks and targets him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.920
though he accidentally kills a party entertainer&nbsp;
who is dressed like Kick-Ass. Frank's son, Chris,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.440
suggests a different approach. He poses as a new&nbsp;
vigilante, "Red Mist", and befriends Kick-Ass.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.960
He plans to lure Kick-Ass into Frank's lumber&nbsp;
warehouse and unmask him. However, they find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.080
the warehouse on fire and Frank's men dead. Red&nbsp;
Mist retrieves a hidden camera he earlier placed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.400
in the warehouse, and sees recorded footage of Big&nbsp;
Daddy killing the men and burning the warehouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.120
Red Mist and Kick-Ass part ways. D'Amico watches&nbsp;
the footage and learns of Big Daddy and Hit-Girl.&nbsp;

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.080
Following the event, Dave&nbsp;
decides to quit being Kick-Ass.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.040
He reveals his identity to Katie, and clears&nbsp;
up the misunderstanding about him being gay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.880
She forgives him and becomes his girlfriend.&nbsp;
However, Red Mist contacts him again, and tricks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.080
him into revealing Big Daddy and Hit-Girl's&nbsp;
location. At one of Big Daddy's safe houses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.400
Red Mist shoots Hit-Girl out of a window, and&nbsp;
Frank's men capture Big Daddy and Kick-Ass.&nbsp;

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.520
Frank intends to have his thugs torture and&nbsp;
execute his captives in a live Internet broadcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.800
While Kick-Ass and Big Daddy are being beaten&nbsp;
by Frank's gangsters, Hit-Girl, having survived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.520
the shooting, storms the hideout and kills all&nbsp;
of the gangsters. During the fight, one thug&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.360
sets Big Daddy on fire. Big Daddy and Mindy say&nbsp;
a tearful farewell before he dies of his burns.&nbsp;

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.040
Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl resolve to defeat Frank&nbsp;
D'Amico once and for all. Hit-Girl infiltrates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.680
Frank's headquarters and kills numerous guards and&nbsp;
henchmen before running out of bullets. When she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.080
is cornered by the thugs, Kick-Ass arrives on&nbsp;
a jet pack fitted with miniguns and kills the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.160
remaining thugs. Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl then take&nbsp;
on Frank and Red Mist. Kick-Ass fights Red Mist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.360
which results in them knocking each other out.&nbsp;
Frank overpowers an exhausted Hit-Girl. Before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.240
he can kill her, Kick-Ass regains consciousness&nbsp;
and blasts Frank out of the window with a bazooka,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.720
killing him. Dave and Mindy retire from&nbsp;
crime-fighting; Marcus becomes Mindy's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.760
guardian, and she enrolls at Dave's school.
Meanwhile, Chris D'Amico sits in his father's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.080
office, dressed in an upgraded suit. Facing&nbsp;
the camera, he says, "as a great man once said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.040
wait'll they get a load of me,"&nbsp;
before firing a gun at the screen.
