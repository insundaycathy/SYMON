00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.640
Welcome Back fellow Movie Lovers. Today we Recap&nbsp;
the latest Amazon Prime Movie ‘The Tomorrow War’&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.760
featuring the talented Chris Pratt. So Buckle up,&nbsp;
Beware of spoilers and join us on our Journey in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:21.360
to the Future to save mankind’s very existence!
The Tomorrow War Starts with Dan Forester (Chris&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.600
Pratt), a former soldier now science teacher&nbsp;
who’s at home watching the Final of the 2022&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.640
FIFA World Cup, when an anomaly interrupts&nbsp;
Brazil’s last minute winning attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.920
The mesmerising anomaly spits out not aliens,&nbsp;
but soldiers from 30 years in the future,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.280
bringing with them the devastating news that&nbsp;
Mankind is about to wiped from existence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.120
the only thing that can stop this from&nbsp;
happening is the people of the present.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.440
It turns out WE are the Worlds Last Hope.
Through news reports it’s pointed out that only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.080
50% of the military qualify to assist in the fight&nbsp;
in the future, and because of this a worldwide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.320
draft will be called, signing up civilian’s form&nbsp;
all around the globe to ‘Jump’ in to the future to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.960
assist the war, and though conscription only lasts&nbsp;
for 7 days, less than 20% of those that jump will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.080
ever return from fighting the WhiteSpikes.
While sleeping, Dan is woken by his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.000
daughter having a nightmare that her&nbsp;
family will be drafted into the War,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.200
oh how right will she turn out to be!
It turns out everyone is devastated that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.160
World will in less than 30 years be destroyed,&nbsp;
so while teaching his class, Dan turns to his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.600
class for a discussion to talk about anything. No&nbsp;
one wants to speak except for ‘Martin’ who loves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.440
talking about volcano’s! He knows everything&nbsp;
about Volcano’s! I wonder how this will affect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.200
things later in the movie….. It’s then Dan&nbsp;
receives a message as he’s about to be drafted.&nbsp;

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.440
While being tested for his Draft (this&nbsp;
is done by strapping him to a machine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.200
and having him prodded and poked), Dan finds&nbsp;
out that he is due to die in 7 years’ time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.400
and because his children have already been&nbsp;
born he is made eligible to be drafted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.400
He then has a teleportation device pinned in to&nbsp;
his Arm, which will allow him to time jump to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.520
future and back after his 7 days of conscription&nbsp;
comes to an end, but only if he is still alive.&nbsp;

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.840
From here Dan returns home to break&nbsp;
the devastating news to his family,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.280
if he tries to evade the draft his wife or&nbsp;
daughter will be forced to take his place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.080
Still trying to keep his wife happy he visits&nbsp;
his estranged father, who himself has PTSD from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.920
Vietnam and abandoned his son when he was young.&nbsp;
Though able to remove the device, he doesn’t,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.360
and Dan is forced to return home to say his&nbsp;
goodbye to his family, his daughter the most.&nbsp;

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.480
At training, they are given 7 days to train&nbsp;
in preparation, but are not allowed to see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.640
enemy in which they are likely to face. But the&nbsp;
good news there is no rigorous training, and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.160
can all basically wear whatever they want!
It’s here we meet a few new characters from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.480
Charlie the quirky best friend who&nbsp;
is not cut out for fighting to Dorian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.280
who is about to jump and start his 3rd tour!
But unfortunately, after less than 24 hours of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.200
basically no training at all, an alert comes&nbsp;
through from the future to let everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.160
know that The Last Research Centre in Miami Beach&nbsp;
is about to fall and every soldier is needed.&nbsp;

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.640
During the jump though a malfunction happens&nbsp;
and those that jump are dropped 100’s of feet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.640
in the sky! Luckily for Dan and 20+ others&nbsp;
they land in a pool on top of a skyscraper!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.440
Don’t worry, don’t think too much about&nbsp;
it and you will find yourself enjoying it!&nbsp;

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.680
Upon landing the team is immediately&nbsp;
contacted by a Colonel Who directs them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.840
on their mission to save he ‘team’ of scientists.
Dan leads the way through the destroyed streets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.360
but when they arrive at the test Lab the team&nbsp;
has been killed but their bodies are still there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.520
meaning the Whitespikes are coming back. After&nbsp;
collecting some test Tubes they head out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.200
it’s here they encounter their first Whitespike.&nbsp;
After a tough encounter they are to rendezvous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.320
for pickup, but at the last second the convoy&nbsp;
is attacked, leaving Dan and a small group to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.720
find their own way out of Town.
After several sacrifices Dan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.000
Charlie and Dorian manage to escape, passing&nbsp;
out before waking up at a Command Station!&nbsp;

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.640
It’s here Dan finds out why Dorian keeps jumping,&nbsp;
he has terminal Cancer and has less than 6 months&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:43.040
to live and wants to die on his own terms.
It’s here Dan meets the Colonel who was guiding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.280
them through Miami Beach, who turns out to be&nbsp;
no other than Dan’s now 30 years older daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.720
Colonel Muri Forester. Though it’s not the&nbsp;
happiest of Reunions as Dan finds out in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.280
his future, he was to run out on both&nbsp;
his wife and daughter before his death.&nbsp;

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.840
After the unhappy re-union Dan joins his&nbsp;
daughter on a dangerous mission to capture a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.480
Female Whitespike, they are bigger and&nbsp;
deadlier than the males and attract&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.880
all the males to her. It’s here Muri informs her&nbsp;
Dad that she’s brought him back for a reason,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.280
one she will tell him when he needs to know.
During the mission to capture the Female,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.360
Muri finds herself in danger and&nbsp;
Dan trying to become Dad of the year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.800
jumps in to the Females pit to save his&nbsp;
daughters life, before they quickly escape,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.920
she then proceeded to tell him how hard it was&nbsp;
for her to see him die when she was only young.&nbsp;

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.400
Back at their water base with the female&nbsp;
Whitespike, Muri and Dan use the time to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.440
create a toxin that will kill the creature&nbsp;
with one injection! This does allow for Dad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.640
and Daughter bonding, while Dan realises how&nbsp;
he’s more like his father than he realised.&nbsp;

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.080
Just as they create a toxin that&nbsp;
will kill off the creatures,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.400
thousands upon thousands of Males swarm the base,&nbsp;
all while Dan only has a short while till his tour&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.080
of Duty is up and he’s pulled back to present.
Its now Muri tells her dad the reason she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.160
brought him here, to help create the toxin and&nbsp;
take it back to kill the Aliens before the war&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.840
ever happens, saving the World in past but&nbsp;
stopping the future from ever happening.&nbsp;

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.320
As the Aliens swarm the base, Dan is trying to buy&nbsp;
enough time till he’s pulled back to the present,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.620
in the fight though Muri is&nbsp;
mortally wounded and as she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.480
is dragged to her death, Dan is pulled away.
He arrives back in the present a broken man, as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.880
well as Charlie and Dorian who have both survived!
The future has been destroyed, the time travel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:45.280
machine will no longer work, the future&nbsp;
is over…Dan re-unites with his family as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:51.200
broken man and the film ends with hope that&nbsp;
they can use the toxin to save the world…….&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:59.120
Oh wait your telling me that isn’t how it&nbsp;
ends? There’s still 40 minutes left? Ok Ok!&nbsp;

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.560
Dan and his wife realise the Aliens reached&nbsp;
earth years before they actually attacked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.360
and through science and Martin the&nbsp;
volcano Kid, they know where they are!&nbsp;

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.960
Dan not getting help from the Government as the&nbsp;
world is in a crisis, finds both Charlie and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.480
Dorian, and with the help of his own father and&nbsp;
those from the future who are stuck in our time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:26.480
head to where the Alien ship crashed years before.
After finding the ship and not wanting to wait&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:32.880
for help, they find their way inside, realising&nbsp;
the Aliens are a weapon of another Alien race.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.520
As they start to inject the toxins the&nbsp;
Whitespikes start to wake up, Dan gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.800
out of the ship to where both his father and&nbsp;
Charlie have just let a female Whitepsike escape,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:51.200
all while Dorian and the others go out in a&nbsp;
blaze of glory destroying the ship and all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.040
aliens except for the one that got away.
Dan and his father hunt down the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.840
before she lay an egg and after&nbsp;
nearly dying 278 times manage to kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:10.560
the last female Whitespike saving the World!
The government take the credit for saving the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:17.760
world as Dan’s father meets his granddaughter,&nbsp;
and they all lived happily ever after.&nbsp;

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.920
Overall, The Tomorrow war is an enjoyable action&nbsp;
film mixed with brilliant visuals and a good bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:30.000
of humour. As long as you switch your mind off&nbsp;
to the inconsistencies and many of the paradoxes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.560
you will have an enjoyable time! Though at just&nbsp;
over two hours is possibly a bit on the long side!&nbsp;
