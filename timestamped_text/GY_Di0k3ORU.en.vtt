00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.430
Hello everyone, this is Mr. Brain Junkie here,
and today we'll be talking about a fantasy

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.540
action film called 47 Ronin, be ready for
some spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.580
A long time ago in ancient Japan, a boy named
Kai who was rumored to be raised by the demons

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.700
fled from the forest and was eventually found
by Lord Asano.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.270
The man decided to adopt him as he sees great
potential in the boy, and the lord allowed

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.789
him to live amongst the samurais, even though
it was a great taboo.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.539
Kai grew closer to the lord's daughter Mika,
and eventually they begin to love each other,

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.480
but only showed their affections in secret.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.470
Soon, the boy grows up to be a very capable
man, who accompanies his lord on hunting expeditions.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.170
He advices the Lord's right hand man, Oishi
to stay and trap their prey as he noticed

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.880
something wrong with the creature,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.430
but the samurai refuses to listen to someone
of such low ranking and orders the men to

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.430
move ahead.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.000
Suddenly, a giant beast charges towards the
people and knocks the lord onto the floor.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.800
Oishi sees this and orders everyone to kill
the monster right away.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.100
The creature goes on a rampage and destroys
everything in sight, while the scouts chases

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.150
after it closely behind.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.840
The men attacks the creature with arrows and
tries to surround it, but nothing seems works

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.570
as the monster begins tossing the samurais
like ragdolls, sending them flying off their

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.570
horses.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.750
After causing the party tremendous damage,
the creatures tries to escape by running off

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.950
into the forest, but a samurai named Yasuno
chases after it as Kai follows them closely

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.290
behind as well.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.410
the samurai tries to attack the monster using
his sword, but gets knocked off his horse

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.810
in the process.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.689
The giant creature turns around and sees the
attacker on the floor and charges towards

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.300
the man in fury.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.530
Kai sees this and runs towards the sword.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.750
He grabs the blade and stabs the heart of
the monster using the creature's momentum,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.110
which eventually kills it as the monster crashes
to the ground.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.229
Kai takes out the blade from the creature
and offers it back to the samurai, but Yasuno

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.740
is offended by the act, being saved by a half
breed who has no rank.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.060
Lord Asano arrives and sees the creature defeated,
thinking that it was the samurai who slayed

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.090
the beast.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.739
He gives Yasuno the honor of being his champion
in the upcoming tournament, and cheers in

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.720
the name of their country, believing that
fortune is on their side.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.359
As the men begin to leave, Oishi notices that
Kai's hands are full of blood, suggesting

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:19.730
that he's the true slayer of the beast.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.220
Kai also notices something strange as he sees
a white fox with different eye colors and

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.829
speculates that the attack may have been orchestrated
by a higher power.

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.549
It turns out that the man's speculations are
correct as the fox begins transforming back

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.859
into a witch who calls herself Mizuki, and
informs her lord Kira that Asano is still

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:38.859
alive.

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.260
Meanwhile, Lady Mika has grown up to be a
beautiful woman, and she quickly goes to the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.029
returning party, after hearing that there
were injuries in the hunting expedition.

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:52.620
After seeing that her father is well, the
woman quickly inquires about the injured men,

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.689
but Asanno knows that his daughter only cares
about the well being of Kai.

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.780
The woman quickly goes to the isolated house
which Kai lives in, and sees that the man

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.099
she loves is injured from the fight.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.090
She tries to help Kai with his injuries, but
the man thanks her and quickly tells her to

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.390
go back to her father, as the woman cannot
be seen with someone of such low rankings.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.060
At night, The Shogun arrives at the province
of Ako for the festival that's about to take

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.060
place.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.279
Kai watches from afar and notices Mizuki amongst
the concubines of lord Kira and recognizes

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:27.489
the color of her eyes, being the same as the
fox he saw earlier.

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.969
He immediately goes to Oishi's resident and
warns the samurai about the witch, who may

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.879
endanger the lord's life,

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.459
but the samurai ignores Kai's warnings just
like before, as he doesn't respect the opinions

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.859
of someone who was raised by the demons.

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.519
The next day, Lord Kira arrives in the kingdom
and greets Asano, complementing about the

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.129
beauty of the province,

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.230
but their relationship quickly becomes strained
when the man disrespects the lord by showing

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.239
rude behaviors when he started flirting with
lady Mika.

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.969
They sit together and begin watching the tournament
as Kira brings out his champion for the fight.

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:04.829
The huge man begins walking towards the stadium
and towers over everyone, as the audience

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.900
watch in amazement at the sheer size of the
fighter.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.340
At the same time, Yasuno sees the witch in
her animal form and falls victim to her magic.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.979
Kai rushes towards the samurai and realizes
that the man can no longer compete.

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.250
In order to save his lord from disgrace, the
main character puts on the samurai armor and

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.500
covers his face so that he may replace Yasuno
in the tournament.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.730
After both fighters bow towards the lords,
They draw out their swords and prepare for

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.730
combat.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.100
The giant samurai begins attacking Kai with
a furry of slashes and knocks the man backwards

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.729
with incredible strength.

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.979
They continue to fight and Kai manages to
land multiple hits on the opponent,

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.520
but eventually breaks the Katana on the giant's
armor and get knocked away from the ring,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.530
losing his helmet in the process and revealing
his true identity.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.940
The Shogun stops the fight and walks towards
the ring, only to see that Kai is a half-bred

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.129
who's clearly not a samurai.

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:01.530
He immediately orders to kill the man, but
Mika rushes in to protect her lover while

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.840
lord Asano begs the Shogun to spare the man's
life.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.889
The ruler walks away in fury and the samurais
from Ako are forced to strip away Kai's armor

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:15.900
and begins beating him continuously for embarrassing
their lord until the man falls unconscious.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.259
realizing that Asano is mentally conflicted
from the embarrassments, Mizuki conjures a

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:22.539
spider using Kira's blood.

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.460
She secretly goes to the old man's room at
night and poisons him using the creature's

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.560
venoms, causing the lord to hallucinate and
see his daughter being defiled by Kira.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.930
The man charges into his rival's room and
cuts him with a sword, waking up everyone

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.169
as they try to stop Asano from killing the
lord.

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.800
As a result of attacking the guest inside
his own palace, the Shogun sentences Asano

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.240
to die, but allows him to keep his honor by
comiting Seppuku, as the lord's family watches

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.560
in tears.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.120
After Asano's death, The Shogun announces
that Mika would be married to Kira in order

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.699
to mend the conflicts between the two houses,
but only gives her one year to mourn for her

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:00.990
father's death.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.790
The ruler also forbids Oishi and his men to
take vengeance against Kira, and tells them

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.270
that they are now Ronin without masters, leaving
their fate in the hands of the lord.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.389
Kira immediately banishes the samurais from
the province of Ako, and takes Kai away as

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:19.080
a hostage and slave, while Mika watches in
despair.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.349
He then imprisons Oishi and throws him into
the cells, trying to break the man's will

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:24.949
for revenge.

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:29.710
One year later, Kira's men takes the samurai
out from the underground prison and throws

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.310
him on the streets, while his wife and son
takes him into shelter immediately.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.090
He learns that everyone has left the province
and that Kai was sold as a slave.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.009
Oishi promptly tells his son to prepare the
horses and rides day and night until they

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:44.840
reach the Dutch Islands.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.560
He walks into the fighting arena and sees
that Kai is fighting against a monstrous opponent

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.180
who tries to kill the man with every blow.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.120
However, kai quickly gains the advantage and
slices the monster across the stomach, before

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.449
decapitating the creature and winning the
fight.

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:04.879
Oishi tries to talk with Kai, but gets attacked
immediately as the main character blames him

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:06.439
for the Asano's death.

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:11.120
Their fight continues until Oishi mentions
that lady Mika is being held against her will,

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.819
and the two begins fighting the slave masters,

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:18.069
eventually escaping the area together after
burning the place down.

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:22.469
Oishi explains to Kai that lady Mika will
be forced to marry Kira in a week of time,

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:26.819
and he plans to unite with all the Ronins
in order to save the girl and avenge their

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:28.029
master's death.

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:32.400
They ride to a secret location where all his
previous comrades have gathered,

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.319
and explains that he plans to assassinate
their lord's murderer, when Kira leaves the

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:40.099
castle to gain blessings from his ancestors
for the upcoming marriage.

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:44.629
He tells one of the samurais to find out the
exact date that Kira plans to leave in order

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:46.809
to organize their assassination properly,

00:07:46.809 --> 00:07:50.449
while he goes with the rest of the men to
gather available weapons.

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:55.419
They arrive at the nearby town, only to find
that it's heavily guarded by Kira's men, making

00:07:55.419 --> 00:07:57.969
it impossible to purchase any swords.

00:07:57.969 --> 00:08:03.059
At night, Kai tells Oishi that there's another
way to get weapons for the samurais, but the

00:08:03.059 --> 00:08:08.419
mission requires them to venture into the
sea of trees amongst the demons known as Tengus.

00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:12.939
With no other choice, the Ronins ride for
the Tengu Forest and Kai brings them in front

00:08:12.939 --> 00:08:14.849
of a giant Buddha statue.

00:08:14.849 --> 00:08:20.180
He tells everyone to wait outside except for
Oishi who accompanies him to meet the demons.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.309
They enter the cave and Kai tells the samurai
that he mustn't draw his sword no matter what

00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:26.039
happens inside.

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:30.039
The two sees numerous monks kneeling in front
of the Buddha statue and the main character

00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:32.529
tells Oishi to wait for him here.

00:08:32.529 --> 00:08:37.130
Kai arrives inside a smaller cave where a
blade is put in the center of the room, while

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.620
another demon walks towards him welcoming
his return.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.790
The creature questions why the main character
is helping those men outside, when they treated

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:49.340
him so poorly from before, but Kai replies
that they are good men and that their goal

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.540
is just.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:55.260
The demon continues to demoralize the man
by stating that the world offers him nothing,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.950
and that he'll never be with Mika in this
life time,

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:02.019
but Kai accepts this with humility and vows
to find her in the next life.

00:09:02.019 --> 00:09:06.440
Seeing the man's resolve, the demon tells
him to take the sword if he can, and both

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.750
of them flys towards the blade using their
magic,

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:13.400
but Kai manages to retrieve the Katana before
his master and wins the battle between the

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.400
two.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.780
At the same time, Oishi turns around and sees
that his men have entered the temple despite

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.570
his orders, and Yasuno draws the sword after
seeing the demons on the ground.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:28.060
The creatures began attacking the samurais
and killing them one by one using their magic

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.810
which makes them impossible to strike.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.960
Oishi sees this and is tempted to draw his
sword, but remembers what Kai has told him

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.810
before and manages to restrain his actions
until every one of the samurais are killed.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:44.820
It turns that everything was hallucinated
by Oishi as part of the test that the Tengus

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:50.290
have placed on him, and numerous Katanas appear,
indicating that he's won the battle of will.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.560
They leave the forest after taking their new
weapons and arrive at the farm house where

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.839
the Ronins are hiding out.

00:09:56.839 --> 00:10:01.690
Oishi is notified by one of his samurais who
found out that Kira is leaving for the shrines

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:06.120
tonight, which prompts him to gather all his
men in order to assassinate the lord.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.480
They slowly approach the area filled with
hay and sees the silhouette of their target

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.670
in front of a shrine, only guarded by two
men.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.930
The person turns around, and the samurai is
shocked to see that it's the witch, who attacks

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:22.339
them with fire and burns the entire area,
surrounding them in flames.

00:10:22.339 --> 00:10:26.060
The men are ambushed by numerous arrows and
killed one by one.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.899
The giant Golem appears as well and butchers
the Ronins as they run for their lives.

00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:35.250
The group goes back to the farmhouse in defeat,
and Oishi questions hopelessly about what

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.339
to do next

00:10:36.339 --> 00:10:40.839
while Kai tries to reassure his comrade that
not all is lost and that they still have the

00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:43.290
weapons and the elements of surprise.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:48.120
The next morning, Kai sees a group of wedding
performers heading towards Kira's castle and

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.389
realizes the opportunity that's presented
in front of them.

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:55.959
They stop the performers and take their costumes,
planning to disguise themselves in order to

00:10:55.959 --> 00:10:58.670
move closer to assassinating the lord.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:03.649
At night, the samurais manage to avoid detection
from Kira's guards and make it into the fortress

00:11:03.649 --> 00:11:04.709
without suspicion.

00:11:04.709 --> 00:11:09.899
Lord Kira takes lady Mika and plans to finally
have their wedding and gaining control of

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:11.579
Ako in the process.

00:11:11.579 --> 00:11:16.019
They sit in front of the stage and begin enjoying
the show as the samurais perform at crowd

00:11:16.019 --> 00:11:18.209
in order to distract the soldiers.

00:11:18.209 --> 00:11:22.670
The Ronins take this opportunity to retrieve
their weapons and invade the area, ambushing

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.589
and killing off the guards without detection.

00:11:25.589 --> 00:11:29.829
Oishi continues to perform on stage as he
moves closer to the lord, taking the blade

00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:32.089
that was hidden and charges in for the kill,

00:11:32.089 --> 00:11:36.290
but his attack was prevented by an arrow from
the guards, and the people run in fear as

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:38.199
they become aware of the assassins.

00:11:38.199 --> 00:11:43.280
The Ronins began attacking the soldiers as
Kira runs away, taking Mika into the castle

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.079
from the flying arrows.

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:49.480
The giant golem charges towards the men, but
gets engulfed by the exploding trap that the

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.310
samurais have placed which turns him into
pieces.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:57.149
Kai begins chasing after Kira along side Oishi
as they cut down numerous incoming soldiers

00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:58.760
trying to stop the two men.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:04.069
Mika manages to escape her captor and runs
the other way, while Kira abandons everything

00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:06.400
in order to save his own life.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.640
After disposing the guards, Oishi runs towards
the lord while Kai goes to save the princess.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.070
Mika makes it outside the building and into
the courtyard as she finally sees her lover,

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.930
and they run towards each other as they finally
embrace.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:24.149
Their reunion is cut short when a ghostly
kimono flys in front of them through the air

00:12:24.149 --> 00:12:28.709
and lands on the ground, transforming into
the witch, who plans to kill both of them.

00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:33.040
The woman walks closer towards the couple
and begins transforming again, revealing her

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.259
true form which resembles a massive dragon
that levitates in the air.

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:42.160
The creature attacks Kai furiously, but the
man is able to defend himself and strike back,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.839
causing the monster to retreat temporarily.

00:12:44.839 --> 00:12:49.800
Kai tells Mika to hide behind the walls, while
he prepares to battle the dragon to the death.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.040
At the same time, Oishi finds Kira inside
the neighboring room and begins attacking

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.810
the man through the walls.

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.840
He enters the room and continues to hit at
the enemy, knocking the man to the floor as

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.540
Kira desperately tries to defend himself.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.920
Oishi tackles Kira and sent both of them crashing
through the walls.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.959
He throws the lord onto the floor and continues
to kick the man with anger, eventually disabling

00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:13.310
him and grabs him from behind.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.540
Oishi takes the blade that his lord used to
commit suicide, and stabs Kira in the heart.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:22.640
He then cuts the man's head off in a single
strike and brings it outside to his comrades,

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.710
showing them that they have won the battle.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:28.670
The soldiers all surrender at the sight of
Kira's death, and the Ronins look up at at

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:32.829
their leader, realizing that they've finally
avenged their lord's honor.

00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:37.510
Meanwhile, Kai continues to fight the dragon
by striking its face, causing the monster

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.730
to throw the concrete pillars at the man in
frustration.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:45.150
The creature then summons a stream of flames
towards Kai, as the warrior splits the elements

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.610
with the blade, rendering the dragon's magic
useless.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:53.480
Kai begins to attack the monster offensively
by slashing it continuously, forcing the creature

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.970
back to a corner.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:59.190
He tries to stab the dragon, but it grabs
onto the man's katana and throws him in the

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.720
air away from the sword.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.379
The monster then begins to target Mika as
it roars furiously towards the woman, but

00:14:05.379 --> 00:14:09.940
Kai manages to use the Tengu's magic and takes
the blade from floor while rushing towards

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.150
the dragon.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:15.250
Kai jumps into the air and stabs the creature
through the head, causing it to tumble to

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.389
the floor and scream in pain.

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:21.910
The monster then begins transforming back
into Mizuki as the woman dies while taking

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.310
her last breath.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:27.850
The Ronins walk out of the castle as the enemy
soldier all kneel before them and lay down

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:29.839
their weapons in submission.

00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:33.980
The samurais head back to Ako and they are
finally able to honor their lord in front

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:38.009
his grave, by offering the dagger that killed
Kira as tribute.

00:14:38.009 --> 00:14:42.980
The Shogun is notified of Kira's death and
sentences every one of the Ronins to die,

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.639
but he allows them to regain their honor by
committing Seppuku just like their lord, as

00:14:47.639 --> 00:14:52.029
they showed honor by avenging their master
while following the way of Bushido.

00:14:52.029 --> 00:14:56.690
Mika watches in sadness as Kai and the other
men prepare to go through the ritual, and

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:00.649
cries knowing that she'll never see her lover
anymore in this life.

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:04.709
She stares on the bridge and looks into the
distance, remembering Kai's promise to look

00:15:04.709 --> 00:15:08.200
for her in their next life together.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.050
