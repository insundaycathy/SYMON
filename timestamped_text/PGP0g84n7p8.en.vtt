00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.969
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:06.049
Today I'm going to explain a post-apocalyptic
drama film called "The Road."

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:07.500
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.240
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.490
A mysterious cataclysmic event has killed
off almost all of the animals and crops on

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.490
earth.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.260
Most of the structures of civilization have
collapsed, and people have now resorted to

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.450
extreme measures to survive.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.949
A man and his young son, whose names are unknown,
must make their way through the crumbling

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.289
cities to scavenge for food and supplies while
avoiding cannibalistic gangs.

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.200
While traveling through desolate roads, the
Man recalls how the catastrophe affected the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.320
world and its remaining population.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.590
When the disaster struck, the clocks stopped
at 1:17 and there was a flash of bright light

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.570
followed by mild quakes.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.120
He seemed to have given up on keeping track
of the dates, and he can only guess that it's

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.680
already October.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.180
The Man surmises that all the trees will soon
fall as the world gets darker and colder.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.980
He has observed that most people on the roads
are refugees carrying their carts and armed

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.070
gangs scavenging for food and fuel.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.949
He remembers that in just a year after the
cataclysm, wildfires occurred followed by

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.620
deranged chanting.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.270
Some of the people have now turned to cannibalism.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.730
Apart from hunger, cannibalism has become
one of his worst fears.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.220
He tells his son stories of courage and justice
to help him stay alive.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.830
As they search for supplies on an abandoned
farm, the Boy sees some hanged corpses.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.070
The father explained to him those were the
remains of people who had taken their own

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.070
life.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.380
The Man later shows his Boy a revolver loaded
with two bullets.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.040
He tells the Boy that those two bullets are
for both of them.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.720
He then demonstrates to the Boy how to use
the gun on himself.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.450
In a flashback, the Man's Wife relaxes by
the piano while preparing something to eat.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.780
After taking a few bites, she was suddenly
startled when she sees her water breaking.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.910
She hesitates to give birth, believing that
the child would only suffer due to the world’s

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.130
dangerous conditions.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.080
Her husband ignores her objections and tells
her to keep pushing until she starts giving

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.080
birth.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.310
She screams as she pushes the infant out of
her womb.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.000
While resting in a car, the Man was suddenly
jolted awake by the sound of engines approaching.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.020
The Man and the Boy quickly hide in the woods
as a gang of armed men arrives, but they were

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.290
soon discovered by a gang member taking a
leak nearby.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.300
The Man threatens to shoot the gang member
if he calls out for his friends.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.770
However, a sudden noise from a truck distracts
the Man, allowing the gang member to grab

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.770
the child.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.530
The Man shoots the gang member in the head,
carries away his unconscious son and hides

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.840
deep into the woods until the following day.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.490
When they went back for their belongings,
the Man noticed what appears to vital organs

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.440
and the severed head of the gang member that
he killed.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.250
In another flashback, the Wife points out
to the Man that they only have two bullets

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.250
left.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.190
She regrets that she had not taken her own
life when they had more ammunition.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.980
She fears that the cannibalistic gangs will
eventually catch them and abuse them before

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.600
they get killed and eaten.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.210
The Wife tells the Man that she should stop
listening to him and just go ahead and shoot

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.610
herself.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.330
The Man pleads with his Wife to stop thinking
about giving up, but she doesn't want to keep

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.300
living just to survive.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.120
The Wife stressed that she wants to take their
son with her, noting that other families have

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.530
done the same.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.160
She walks away from the Man and proceeds to
give the Boy a bath.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.400
As the Man and the Boy get back on the road,
he advises his son to steer clear of bad guys.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.240
He warns the Boy that there are not many good
guys left.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.570
The father tells his son to keep carrying
the fire with him and assures him that they

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.760
are still the good guys despite what happened
with the gang member.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.900
During a rest stop, the Boy tells his father
that he wishes he's still with his mother.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.570
The father then asks the Boy whether he wishes
that he was also dead.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.070
When the Boy said yes, he told him that they
should both stop thinking about his mother.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.990
While the Boy slept, the Man went to a bridge
to throw away his wallet containing a picture

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.569
of his wife.

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.050
While attempting to get rid of his wedding
ring, the Man recalls how he begged his Wife

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.709
to stay with him.

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.550
Despite his pleas, The Wife was determined
to leave and even refused to say goodbye to

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.800
their son.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.910
She just asked the Man to keep the Boy warm
and head south.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.500
She walks out of the house, leaving her husband
and child behind.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.520
The Man recalls that his Wife died in the
darkness.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.860
The Man and the Boy started heading south
to find a more suitable place to live.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.340
They come across a large house on the way,
so they decide to check it out after seeing

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.740
that it's empty.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.530
While investigating the kitchen, the Man sees
a padlocked door on the kitchen floor.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.650
He goes out to find an axe and uses it to
break the lock.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.320
They both go down to the cellar to find starving
and mutilated people begging them for help.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.840
When they start running away, a man goes after
them.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.310
They manage to get back upstairs and block
the door with a table.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.080
As soon as they try to leave the house, they
see the occupants arriving.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.790
They hide in the bathroom while the residents
enter the house.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.490
The father urges his son to take the gun,
but the Boy refuses.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.460
When he hears one of the occupants approaching,
he points the gun to his son's head to keep

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.090
the boy from ending up like the people in
the cellar.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.610
All of a sudden, the occupants hear loud banging
sounds coming from the kitchen floor.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.410
As the occupants ran to investigate, the father
and son make their escape through the window.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.170
They hide from the occupants until it gets
dark.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.340
As the Boy slept, the Man hears screams coming
from the place.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.360
He tries to cover up the Boy’s ears to keep
him from hearing the horrible sounds.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.610
When he stops hearing any noise, he wakes
the Boy up and they quickly leave.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.820
The father and son make another stop to eat
the remaining piece of food they have left.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.690
After eating the last bug, the Boy asks assurance
from his father that they’d never eat a

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.460
human being no matter how hungry they are.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.230
The Man points out that they’re already
starving at the moment, and they still wouldn’t

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.230
eat anybody.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.930
Feeling satisfied by his father’s response,
the Boy affirms that they’re the good guys

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.130
because they’re carrying the fire.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.550
The two get back on the road and stop by the
house where the Man grew up.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.330
He recalls the Christmas holidays he spent
in the house, but the Boy discourages him

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.730
from reliving those moments in his head.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.070
While waiting outside the house, the Boy sees
another boy in a building across the street.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.940
The other child runs away as soon as the Boy
sees him.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.170
The Boy runs after the child, but the Man
stops him.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.530
They continue their journey with the Boy,
disappointed that he didn't get to see the

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.650
other child.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.710
The Man tries to console his son, noting that
the Boy wants to see other children when they

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.330
arrive at the coast.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.060
He told the boy that he once had friends of
his own, but they are all gone.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.990
The pair had begun to starve after running
out of food.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.980
The Boy asks his father if they’ll die all
of a sudden.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.590
The Man explains that it will take a while
before they die of starvation.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.870
The Man feels that he is slowly dying, so
he tries his best to prepare his son to survive

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.430
on his own.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.620
While resting at an empty house, the Man finds
a piano.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.449
As he removes the cover, he starts to cry
as he remembers how his Wife played the instrument.

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.270
He plays a few notes and tells the Boy that
his mother played the piano very well.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.650
The child says he doesn’t remember it at
all.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.220
The father and son decide to leave after finding
nothing else inside.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.150
However, fortune had struck when the Man discovers
a hatch while walking through the backyard.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.800
When they went down to investigate, they saw
that the bunker is filled with food that could

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.770
keep them well fed for years.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.020
They stay in the bunker and make it their
home, but they were soon forced to leave it

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.380
after hearing strange noises above.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.680
The Boy thought the noise came from a dog.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.500
The Man concludes that the bunker will soon
be discovered and it will no longer be safe

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.500
for them.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.400
They loaded whatever they can into a cart
and continued heading south.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.760
As they make their way to the coast, they
see an older man walking ahead of them.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.169
Realizing that the older man poses no threat,
the Boy asks the Man to give him some food.

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:14.240
The Boy hands him a can of food and watches
him eat.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.310
The father insisted that the older man cannot
come with them, but he invited the older man

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.310
for dinner.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.419
The older man reveals that his name is Ely
as they continue their journey.

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:27.770
After having dinner, Ely and the Man started
talking about the Boy. Ely thought that he

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.510
had seen an angel when he first laid eyes
on the child.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.260
He reveals that he once had a child of his
own and never thought he'd ever see a child

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.320
again.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.320
When the Man asks Ely what happened to his
own son, the older man refused to talk about

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.520
it.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.040
Later on, Ely explained to the Man that he
always expected a catastrophe to happen.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.680
He had seen the warning signs, but he contended
that there was nothing he could do to prepare

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.800
for it.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.610
When the Man asked if he ever wanted to die,
Ely said that dying is a luxury that he could

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.100
no longer afford to ask for in these dangerous
times.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.470
The next day, the Boy is still trying to convince
the father to help Ely as they go their separate

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:02.470
ways.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.650
The Man insists that they’ve done enough
for him and suggested that the Boy would have

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.850
more time to think about their own situation
when they run out of food.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.919
The Boy reminded his father of his advice
to watch out for bad guys, then points out

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:14.830
that Ely clearly wasn’t bad.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:19.139
The two decide to stash away their cart in
the woods to check out some huts nearby.

00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:23.550
As they come close to the houses, the Man
sees a collection of skulls on the ground.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.300
When they turn back, they witness a woman
and a child being chased by a group of cannibals.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.350
The woman drops to the ground and gets caught.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.200
They hear the woman scream as they run deep
into the woods to escape from the gang.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:39.169
A strong earthquake occurs as they run through
the forest, causing some large trees to fall.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:43.450
They take cover behind one of the fallen trees
to avoid being hit by the others.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.540
The Man's health has been slowly deteriorating,
but they keep moving towards the coast despite

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.560
his condition.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.980
They soon arrive at the beach, but the Boy's
excitement quickly turned into disappointment

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.319
when they see its shores' filthy condition.

00:08:55.319 --> 00:08:59.540
The Man sees a shipwreck close to the beach,
so he swims toward it, hoping to find some

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.920
supplies.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.819
He leaves his son to look out for their things,
but the Boy soon falls asleep.

00:09:04.819 --> 00:09:08.069
As the Boy slept, a man with a knife walks
towards their tent.

00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:11.149
The Boy wakes up to find that all their belongings
are gone.

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:15.129
The Man gets back to the shore with a flare
gun he took from the shipwreck.

00:09:15.129 --> 00:09:19.940
The Man quickly chases after the thief, carrying
and dragging the Boy along with him.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.399
When they catch up to the thief, the Man threatens
to shoot him.

00:09:23.399 --> 00:09:27.490
The thief refuses to give back the cart, but
he quickly changes his mind after hearing

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.959
the Boy begging his father not to kill him.

00:09:29.959 --> 00:09:33.350
The Man asks the thief to throw his clothes
and shoes on the cart and leaves him naked

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:34.949
on the road.

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:39.720
On their way back to the beach, the Boy convinces
his father to go back and help the thief.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.220
When they get back, the thief is gone, so
they leave his clothes and a can of food on

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.639
the ground.

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:48.839
The father and son continue on their journey,
and they soon arrive at a ravaged street.

00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:52.439
The Boy sees a can with a bug inside and becomes
fascinated with it.

00:09:52.439 --> 00:09:55.579
He shows it to his father just before the
bug flies away.

00:09:55.579 --> 00:09:58.630
As they watch the bug fly, an arrow shoots
past them.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.980
They quickly take cover, but the Man gets
hit in the leg.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.649
Before the archer shot another arrow at them,
the Man shoots a flare gun through the window

00:10:05.649 --> 00:10:07.730
where the projectile came from.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.579
The Man staggers to get inside the building
to see who shot the arrows.

00:10:11.579 --> 00:10:15.579
When he opened the room, he finds a woman
weeping over a man hit by his flare gun.

00:10:15.579 --> 00:10:19.839
The Man asks the woman why they were following
him, but the woman insisted that the Man and

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:22.915
his son were the ones who were following them.

00:10:22.915 --> 00:10:27.009
The Man leaves the woman and tends to his
wounds before they continue heading south.

00:10:27.009 --> 00:10:31.110
As the Man's health continue to deteriorate,
he decides to leave their belongings behind

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.989
and set up camp on the beach.

00:10:32.989 --> 00:10:36.079
In his sleep, the Man dreams about being with
his wife.

00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:40.069
When he realizes that he will die soon, he
tells his son to continue going south on his

00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:41.069
own.

00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:44.829
The Man advises his son to always keep the
gun with him and never let anyone take it

00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:45.860
from him.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.540
The son tells his father that he wants to
go with him, but the Man insisted that he

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.389
must keep living and find the good guys.

00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:56.920
After covering his father with the blanket,
the Boy takes the gun and puts it in his pocket.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.230
He walks along the shore and sees a stranger
approaching him.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:04.619
He takes out the gun and points it toward
the stranger as the man gets closer.

00:11:04.619 --> 00:11:08.790
The stranger asks the Boy about his father
and tells the child to come with him.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:13.249
He convinces the Boy to put the pistol down
and explains the choices that he has to make.

00:11:13.249 --> 00:11:17.649
The stranger tells the Boy that he can either
join him or stay on the beach with his father.

00:11:17.649 --> 00:11:21.089
He tells the Boy to stay off the road if he
decides to go on his own.

00:11:21.089 --> 00:11:24.970
The Boy asks for assurance that the stranger
is "one of the good guys," but the man says

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.579
he can only take a chance.

00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:31.209
The stranger further reveals that he has two
children with him - a boy and a girl.

00:11:31.209 --> 00:11:33.939
He assures the Boy that he doesn't eat people.

00:11:33.939 --> 00:11:36.940
The Boy asks the stranger if he is carrying
the fire.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.970
The stranger didn’t know how to reply, but
he eventually said yes when the Boy pressed

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.779
him for a response.

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:46.389
After being convinced by how the stranger
answered his questions, the Boy asked if he

00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:47.389
can go with him.

00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:51.399
He says one last goodbye to his father and
walks toward the stranger, who is now joined

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:53.250
by a woman and two children.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.999
The woman explained that they have been following
him and his father for a while.

00:11:56.999 --> 00:12:00.549
She says that she has been worried about him
but they no longer have to worry about anything

00:12:00.549 --> 00:12:02.179
now that they're together.

00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:05.970
The Boy takes a look at the other children
and notices a dog with them.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:17.329
Feeling reassured that he is in good hands,
the Boy agrees to join them.
