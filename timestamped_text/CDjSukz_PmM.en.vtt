00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:07.743
hey what's up guys

00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:11.919
today I'll show you a psychological thriller film: "Would You Rather" 

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:14.799
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.271
to care for her sick brother, Iris has to give up her study and return to her hometown

00:00:20.463 --> 00:00:22.671
she works hard and saves up for several months

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:26.175
but she still can't afford the cost of his treatment for leukemia

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.439
one day she goes to meet her brother's attending doctor 

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:33.711
because he said there is a chance that she might get a reduction of the medical expenses

00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:35.439
when she arrives at the offices

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:39.135
the doctor introduces her to a local philanthropist called Shepard

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:41.679
Shepard is going to hold a game in his manor

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:44.751
he offers Iris a deal: if she can win the game

00:00:44.847 --> 00:00:48.687
he will pay for her brother's treatment and find a bone marrow donor for him

00:00:48.783 --> 00:00:51.327
knowing the doctor is a beneficiary of the game

00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:53.679
Iris becomes really interested in it

00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:55.839
but Iris still finds it a bit odd

00:00:55.983 --> 00:00:58.623
to play it safe, she doesn't agree immediately 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.735
she needs more time to think about it

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.231
at night, while having dinner with her brother

00:01:03.327 --> 00:01:08.319
she receives a call from the restaurant and is told her application for the job is rejected

00:01:08.463 --> 00:01:10.047
Iris is very upset

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:13.743
thinking of her brother, she agrees to join the game eventually

00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:18.783
in Shepard's view, Iris doesn't have anyone to count on and she is desperate

00:01:18.927 --> 00:01:21.423
which makes her a perfect contestant for the game

00:01:21.663 --> 00:01:24.495
while the doctor doesn't think Iris is suitable for the game

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:29.391
Iris lies to her brother, telling him she is not coming home tomorrow

00:01:29.727 --> 00:01:33.999
the following evening, a black car takes Iris to Shepard's manor on time

00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:37.935
when she enters the house, she sees 7 people are waiting there

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.439
the contestant Lucas and Angry Hair come up and welcome her

00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:43.935
they helpfully introduce other people to Iris

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.303
before the game starts, Shepard warns his son not to ruin the game

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:53.439
after the son promises his father perfunctorily, they come to the dining table together

00:01:53.487 --> 00:01:57.759
before the game starts, the bald butler asks them to hand in their phones and keys

00:01:57.855 --> 00:01:59.871
then takes them to a dining room

00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:03.231
during the dinner, Shepard learns that Iris is a vegetarian

00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:06.735
he offers her $5000 to have one bite of the steak

00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:10.143
at first, Iris feels humiliated and refuses 

00:02:10.287 --> 00:02:14.271
he then offers her $10000 to eat the steak and foie gras

00:02:14.463 --> 00:02:16.383
this time Iris compromises

00:02:16.623 --> 00:02:19.839
Shepard is happy to see Iris compromises her principles

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.767
when Shepard sees the old man doesn't drink

00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:24.207
he asks him why

00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:29.487
the old man tells him he used to be an alcoholic and he has been sober for 16 years

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:34.095
he had an accident many years ago because of drinking and he doesn't want to recall it

00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:38.799
Shepard offers him $10000 to drink the glass of wine before him

00:02:38.895 --> 00:02:40.719
the old man seems annoyed

00:02:40.863 --> 00:02:43.215
Shepard then gives him another option

00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:47.151
if he drinks the whole bottle of wine, he can get $50000

00:02:47.343 --> 00:02:48.927
the old man is tempted

00:02:49.023 --> 00:02:51.951
he doesn't like Shepard, but he really needs the money

00:02:52.095 --> 00:02:54.831
so he swallows his pride and drinks the wine

00:02:55.023 --> 00:02:59.823
now people realize Shepard takes pleasure in using money to manipulate people's choices

00:03:00.015 --> 00:03:02.655
Shepard doesn't care how uncomfortable the guests are

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.271
he then explains the rules by taking the man in a nice necktie, a war veteran, as an example

00:03:08.463 --> 00:03:12.000
when the necktied veteran is offered the choice to kiss either the smelly Iris 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.725
or the horny gambler attached with a sparse beard (Sparse Beard)

00:03:14.725 --> 00:03:18.700
he has to make a choice. otherwise, he will be considered eliminated

00:03:19.253 --> 00:03:20.933
so that is how the game is played

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:23.477
the contestants are given options by Shepard

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.261
if they refuse to choose, they will lose

00:03:26.453 --> 00:03:30.101
if they are incapable of continuing the game, they will be eliminated

00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:32.021
each round there is a time limit

00:03:32.165 --> 00:03:36.341
they have to make their decision in 15 seconds, or they will be eliminated too

00:03:36.725 --> 00:03:39.749
by the end of the game, there will be only one winner

00:03:40.037 --> 00:03:43.349
Shepard tells them if they change their mind, they can quit now

00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:45.989
the old man stands up and wants to leave

00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:49.109
but as he looks at the money on the table, he sits down

00:03:49.397 --> 00:03:51.077
the game officially begins

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.437
Shepard's butler presents them with an electric shock machine

00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:56.925
the old man realizes this is not right

00:03:56.925 --> 00:04:00.725
just when he attempts to leave, he is shot dead by the bald butler

00:04:00.917 --> 00:04:03.029
other people didn't see this coming

00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:05.237
they are all panic, but nobody dares to leave

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:07.637
they have to stay and play the game

00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:10.517
in the first round, there are two contestants

00:04:10.805 --> 00:04:13.925
they have to choose between shocking themselves or the other person

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.669
Angry Hair, Lucas, and Iris choose to shock themselves

00:04:17.717 --> 00:04:20.453
while the rest choose to shock the other person

00:04:20.597 --> 00:04:22.085
the first round finishes

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.533
Shepard lets the contestants have a break

00:04:24.677 --> 00:04:29.621
when the group is having a discussion, Shepard's son proves them with disrespectful remarks

00:04:29.813 --> 00:04:33.077
the necktied veteran stands up and retorts upon him

00:04:33.317 --> 00:04:36.629
in the son's eyes, they just come here to get his family's money

00:04:36.773 --> 00:04:39.509
so they are in no position to talk about morality

00:04:39.653 --> 00:04:41.621
soon the second round begins

00:04:41.765 --> 00:04:45.749
people find that the necktied veteran seems to become Shepard's target of punishment

00:04:45.845 --> 00:04:50.693
in this round, everyone has to choose either to stab the person next to them with an ice pick

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.141
or whip the necktied veteran 3 times

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:57.413
they all choose to whip the necktied veteran, who looks gay a little bit

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:00.149
the necktied veteran is badly injured in the back

00:05:00.245 --> 00:05:03.461
the rest of the contestants suffer great mental pressure

00:05:03.605 --> 00:05:06.425
the necktied veteran passes out because of the pain

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:09.922
Sparse Beard chooses to stab the old lady, who is paralyzed

00:05:10.066 --> 00:05:15.106
for he knows if he stabs the necktied veteran one more time, the necktied veteran may die

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.378
however, Sparse Beard hits the old lady's femoral artery by accident

00:05:19.522 --> 00:05:22.690
he hurries to dress the cut under the guidance of others

00:05:22.786 --> 00:05:24.178
the game continues

00:05:24.322 --> 00:05:28.018
the old lady stabs in the thigh the girl with long whipping hair (Whipping Hair) as revenge

00:05:28.066 --> 00:05:30.178
who shocked her in the previous round

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.634
Whipping Hair is angry, and she hits the old lady back

00:05:33.778 --> 00:05:36.850
then, Shepard allows Whipping Hair to stab anyone

00:05:37.042 --> 00:05:41.602
hearing this, Whipping Hair walks towards Iris, who has been protected by others

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:44.914
out of jealousy, she stabs Iris in the waist

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.506
Iris huddles herself up because of the pain

00:05:47.602 --> 00:05:50.194
in the meantime, worrying about Iris's safety

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.698
the doctor comes to Shepard's manor with a weapon on his own

00:05:53.842 --> 00:05:57.346
as the winner of the last game, the doctor is familiar with this place 

00:05:57.442 --> 00:05:59.506
and evades the security guard easily

00:05:59.602 --> 00:06:02.338
he slips into the basement and enters the manor

00:06:02.626 --> 00:06:05.458
Sparse Beard finds that the old lady has passed out

00:06:05.602 --> 00:06:10.546
the bald butler checks on the old lady and realizes she dies of losing too much blood

00:06:10.786 --> 00:06:12.562
then he takes her out of the room

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:15.922
Shepard blames the old lady's death on Sparse Beard

00:06:16.162 --> 00:06:18.178
now it is Angry Hair's turn

00:06:18.322 --> 00:06:21.874
he chooses to whip the poor necktied veteran because of his gay look

00:06:22.018 --> 00:06:27.586
after that, the necktied veteran is removed from the game for he is dying and incapacitated

00:06:27.826 --> 00:06:33.538
while Shepard is talking to the bald butler, Lucas indicates Iris run away in a low voice

00:06:33.634 --> 00:06:37.522
suddenly, Lucas and Angry Hair stand up and cause distraction

00:06:37.714 --> 00:06:40.402
Iris runs out of the dining room with the ice pick

00:06:40.594 --> 00:06:43.234
when cornered, Angry Hair bursts into anger 

00:06:43.474 --> 00:06:46.450
but didn't expect Shepard would take out a gun and shoot him

00:06:46.594 --> 00:06:50.818
now Angry Hair is dead, and the rest are controlled by Shepard again

00:06:51.058 --> 00:06:55.858
Iris runs to every room, only to find that every window and door is shut

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.874
then she hides in the basement

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.082
just when she is escaping from the window,

00:07:00.178 --> 00:07:03.490
Shepard's son appears and wants to rape the smelly Iris

00:07:03.778 --> 00:07:07.474
Iris resists fiercely, and stabs the son in the thigh with the ice pick

00:07:07.522 --> 00:07:09.778
but unfortunately misses his balls

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.994
the doctor hears them and comes to rescue Iris

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:17.575
but he is shot dead by the bald butler before he could take Iris out

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:21.319
Iris returns to the dining room under the bald butler's escort

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:24.775
the bald butler tells Shepard what his son did in the basement

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:30.487
after checking his damned son's wound, Shepard apologizes to Iris for the hormone assault

00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:32.215
the third round begins

00:07:32.647 --> 00:07:37.207
the bald butler wheels in a big barrel of water and gives everyone an envelope randomly

00:07:37.303 --> 00:07:39.607
with an unknown punishment written inside

00:07:39.991 --> 00:07:44.503
if they don't choose the envelope, they must choose to be submerged underwater for 2 minutes

00:07:44.743 --> 00:07:47.383
Sparse Beard is the first to be selected by Shepard 

00:07:47.527 --> 00:07:52.807
as a gambling addict, Sparse Beard analyses Shepard's psychology with his gambling experience 

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:55.063
and chooses the envelope decisively

00:07:55.351 --> 00:07:58.519
his punishment is to light off a firecracker in his hand

00:07:58.903 --> 00:08:02.839
Sparse Beard thinks he can survive this round and feels relieved

00:08:03.127 --> 00:08:06.247
but when he sees how the firecracker is, he is scared

00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:08.695
to prevent him from releasing the firecracker

00:08:09.031 --> 00:08:12.151
the bald butler wraps the firecracker to his left hand in tape

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:15.367
with an explosion, his left hand is blown up

00:08:15.703 --> 00:08:18.967
Sparse Beard dies of a heart attack caused by the shock

00:08:19.159 --> 00:08:20.791
the next one is Lucas

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:24.199
considering there is no way he can hold his breath for 2 minutes

00:08:24.247 --> 00:08:26.455
Lucas chooses to open the envelope

00:08:26.695 --> 00:08:28.951
on the card, there is a picture of an eye

00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:31.687
so Shepard asks him to blind one of his eyes

00:08:31.975 --> 00:08:34.279
Lucas can't accept such a harsh punishment

00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:36.439
however, he has no other choice 

00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:40.231
but to cut his eye with a blade with the bald butler's gun pointing at him

00:08:40.423 --> 00:08:43.591
Lucas screams in pain and finishes his round

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:45.751
Iris is not the gambling type

00:08:45.847 --> 00:08:47.863
so she chooses the barrel challenge

00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:52.600
the bald butler starts the timer, then pushes Iris's head into the cold water

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.275
Iris tries her best to hold on and thinks of the dream her brother shared with her

00:08:57.463 --> 00:09:00.919
her brother's soft words echo in her ear and calm her down

00:09:01.255 --> 00:09:04.519
Iris survives the challenge, which impresses Shepard a lot

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.927
out of curiosity, Lucas opens Iris's envelope

00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:10.663
her punishment was to have all of her teeth extracted

00:09:10.855 --> 00:09:14.599
hearing that, Iris finds herself lucky to make the right decision

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:18.199
as the last contestant, Whipping Hair opens her envelope

00:09:18.295 --> 00:09:21.511
there is a barrel pattern on the card with a number 4 on it

00:09:21.655 --> 00:09:24.871
which means she has to be submerged underwater for 4 minutes

00:09:25.015 --> 00:09:28.279
when the challenge finishes, Whipping Hair is not breathing

00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:32.647
now there are two contestants left, Lucas and Iris, in the final round

00:09:32.887 --> 00:09:36.151
the bald butler flips a coin to decide who goes first

00:09:36.295 --> 00:09:38.551
Iris gets the chance to choose first

00:09:38.887 --> 00:09:42.199
she can choose to either end the game and leave with Lucas empty-handed

00:09:42.295 --> 00:09:44.263
or shoot Lucas to win the game

00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:47.075
in this case, her brother can get the chance for treatment 

00:09:47.075 --> 00:09:49.447
and she can get a large sum of money

00:09:49.687 --> 00:09:55.159
realizing his life is in her hands, Lucas begs Iris to listen to the reason why he came here

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:59.671
however, when Lucas begins to say he has 3 younger sisters to care for

00:09:59.815 --> 00:10:04.903
Iris, who has been silent, suddenly shoots him before he can finish his wordy smelly manshit

00:10:05.095 --> 00:10:08.119
Lucas dies, and everyone applauses for Iris

00:10:08.359 --> 00:10:11.719
Shepard promises that he will arrange an operation for her brother this week 

00:10:11.767 --> 00:10:13.399
and sees her off warmly

00:10:13.495 --> 00:10:16.519
exhausted, Iris returns home with the prize

00:10:16.903 --> 00:10:20.695
she has a shower, trying to wash away her tiredness and sin

00:10:20.887 --> 00:10:25.879
the next morning however, Iris discovers her brother killed himself by overdosing on pills

00:10:26.071 --> 00:10:29.239
as he didn't want to be a burden for Iris any longer

00:10:29.479 --> 00:10:33.271
Iris cries and loses herself in endless pain

00:10:33.463 --> 00:10:36.007
