00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.720
She goes in the woods and finds Hansel alone;

appears, Gretel goes and grabs a stone and

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.350
throws the stone to door, but it does nothing.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.350
Later A lady called Holda, comes out and invites
her in the house.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.701

Hansel and sniffs it, and tells them their

00:03:53.701 --> 00:04:00.370
bed is ready, Gretel says they should be going
but they end up taking some rest.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.640
While sleeping, Gretel sees a lady with long
nails and hears a scream, she soon sees spirits

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.870
of many children telling her how their family
abandoned them.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.549
She wakes up, and the lady offers them breakfast,
Hansel says he likes meat, but their family

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.509
couldn’t afford it, which Holda replies,
you can have all the meat in the world here.

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:30.189
Gretel offers her that they can work for her
in exchange of abed and food, Holda teaches

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:37.050
Hansel how to use an axe, and sniffs him.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.400

a book with some plants and craft, and offers

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.430
a drink, she denied but Holda insists.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.039
Later after Hansel finishes practice, they
play chess, Holda tells them there is a storm

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:00.069
coming, he asks her how she knows that, she
replies, women often know things they’re

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:02.620
not supposed to.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:10.270
It rains that night, in bed Gretel sees a
girl, she follows her, and she comes across

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:17.949
a room, she sees some bodies, they start to
bleed, and she wakes up.

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:23.999
She washes clothes and sees a doll in the
rocks, then she comes across a surface that

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:30.449
looks hollow from inside, she goes to Hansel
and advice to leave the house saying something

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:36.449
is wrong here, saying there are no animals
to get meat neither any Cattle to draw milk.

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.080
Hansel is happy saying they’re safe here.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.270
Hansel practices with axe in woods and soon
he hears a scream and comes across an inverted

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:52.039
pentagram carved into the tree he then sees
a woman.

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:59.099
Gretel touches a cloth, and it bleeds, she
goes in the storage to get another one, and

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.189
comes across a hidden entrance.

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:07.509
Later, Gretel notices Holda has darker spots
on her hands, she then shows Gretel how to

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:14.870
use Witch powers to provide for their needs,
and asks her to practice it, after few efforts

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.189
she moves a stick in the air.

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:21.629
Holda tells her to awaken the powers inside
her.

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.909
Hansel hears a voice and falls asleep.

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:31.550
Gretel goes to woods and tries to learn more
about her powers that she has discovered,

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.280
she uses her power to control a tree.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.740
Later, Hansel asks her what she did whole
day, and Gretel now says that Holda taught

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.729
her things that can help them to survive.

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:47.599
Hansel recalls how Gretel used to say there
always a price for something, so what is the

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:49.819
price for this gift?

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:54.600
Hansel wants to leave Gretel tells him to
be quite and aggressively throws him outside

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.050
the house, he then sees a young girl.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.360
Gretel wakes up, saying it was a nightmare
but desire to get rid of her brother seemed

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.439
real, but she can never abandon him alone
in a night.

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:12.210
Gretel then looks through the window and sees
a girl walking.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:18.279
Gretel talks to Holda, and Holda says that
Gretel is not her mother and should not worry.

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:22.379
Gretel is still concerned and Holda gives
her a drink.

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:27.069
She then goes to her room and throws up, pretending
that she drank it earlier.

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:30.740
She then goes to that hidden door and decides
to open it.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:38.430
She enters the cellar, and surprisingly finds
her brother in there, he seems strange.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:46.780
The room fills with blood and sooner a beautiful
girl emerges from it, the girl empties the

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:52.990
buckets of human remains on the table, and
with her magic she turns it into food, the

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.119
food that they’ve been eating the whole
time throughout their stay.

00:07:57.119 --> 00:08:02.650
Gretel wakes up, and tells herself to play
dumb, untl she can outsmart Holda, Gretel

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.800
then sees Holda getting ready to go somewhere.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:11.099
As Holda leaves, she goes and opens the book
that she uses to do the magic, we see Holda

00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:13.309
digging a hole in the ground.

00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:19.460
Later, Holda comes back tells Gretel that
soon her brother will come back, by saying

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:26.300
Gretel will become great once she accepts
her weaknesses, Holda eats food and then plucks

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.210
out human out of her mouth.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:34.900
Gretel says what have you done to my brother,
she says, say it again and I will turn you

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.520
into ashes, she then says that her little
brother will be delicious.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.740
Gretel says I am not like you, but Holda claims
they’re made of same matter, and same magic

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.080
that they can see visions without saying.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.590
And she shows a vision of the beautiful child,
saying Holda is the mother of that child,

00:08:54.590 --> 00:09:01.740
and that she hates her, and gave her back
to darkness but she was wrong, and that wasn’t

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.740
enough.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.490
The child promised to she share her powers
with Holda if she trusts the darkness, also

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:12.880
that she ate her children and disguised herself
as an old woman to lure other children.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:18.710
Gretel wakes up locked in the cellar, and
Gretel asks to see her brother, and Holda

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:24.340
with her actual youthful appearance, she brings
Hansel to Gretel.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:32.720
Holda lures Hansel in a cage so she can cook
him, Gretel tries to use her power and chocks

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:39.240
Holda with a stick burning her, then she uses
her powers to set free.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.780
Few hours later, Hansel wakes up and Gretel
says Holda doesn’t live here anymore and

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.620
they’re safe now.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.000
She tells him to leave without her and saying
she will always be with him in his heart.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.770
Before leaving Hansel says you’ll see my
face again, Hansel then reaches his old home

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.390
and reclaims his axe.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.560
Gretel says she wants her brother to live
his own story and nurture, and she has her

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.080
own story.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:11.590
Gretel sees the spirits of dead children emerging
from the tress, finally free.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.340
She says they’re free to go.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.840
She is Happy.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.870
However, her fingers start turning black as
Holda’s did, she tells herself that she

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:25.430
is brave, and she trusts herself, and the
movie ends.
