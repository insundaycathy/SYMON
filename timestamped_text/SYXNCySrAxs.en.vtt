Welcome to Cinema Summary.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.780
Being John Malkovich is a mindboggling movie,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.380
one of many in fact.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.340
Let’s cut to the chase and see what it's like to be John Malkovich

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.260
Craig Schwartz is our loser protagonist: unemployed
and a puppeteer in a breaking marriage with

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.439
his pet-obsessed wife Lotte. A lucky find
in the classified section gets him a filing

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.300
clerk job through Dr. Lester at LesterCorp,
in the strange Floor 7½ low-ceiling offices

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.440
of the Mertin-Flemmer Building in New York
City

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.000
Here he develops an attraction (though it’s more of an obsession)

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.820
to his coworker Maxine
Lund, who does not return his affections.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.250
One day while working, Craig accidentally
finds, and enters a small door hidden behind

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.900
a filing cabinet and finds himself in the
mind of actor John Malkovich

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.540
Craig is able to observe and sense whatever Malkovich

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.020
does for fifteen minutes before he is ejected
and dropped into a ditch near the New Jersey

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.020
Turnpike.
Like literally, ejected and dropped.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.660
Craig tells Lotte, who becomes obsessed with
the experience,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.460
allowing her to live out her transgender desires.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.060
Lotte becomes attracted to Maxine and they begin a sexual relationship via Lotte being inside

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.010
Malkovich's head while Maxine has sex with
Malkovich. Craig, ditched by both women, binds

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.600
and gags Lotte and locks her in a cage, then
enters Malkovich's mind and has sex with Maxine

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.200
What the heck is wrong with these people?

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.500
Craig with his expert puppeteering skills discovers

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.820
that he is able to control Malkovich's actions
while in his head

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.920
and brags about it in front of a caged Lotte

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.680
But the actor realizes his lack of control

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.240
and begins to feel paranoid

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.940
that he is being controlled by someone else.
After Malkovich talks with his friend Charlie

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.680
Sheen (an equally real actor), Malkovich follows
Maxine to the Mertin-Flemmer building, discovering

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.620
Maxine and Craig’s business, where he himself
tries the portal into his own head and finds

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.750
himself in a world where everyone's face looks
just like him and they can only say "Malkovich"

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.691
Running out of the strange restaurant, he

00:01:57.691 --> 00:02:02.750
is then ejected and meets Craig by the turnpike.
Malkovich demands that the portal be closed,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.860
but Craig refuses.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.300
Lotte escapes with the help of her pet chimpanzee.
She phones Maxine, revealing that it was Craig

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.060
who was having sex with her while inside Malkovich.
Maxine is annoyed but accepts it,

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.380
she enjoyed the experience and goes to Malkovich’s anyway.
Seeking help, Lotte finds Lester, who reveals

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.180
Seeking help, Lotte finds Lester who reveals

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.320
himself to be Captain Mertin, the original
founder of LesterCorp. Lester is aware of

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.200
the portal, and has a room dedicated to Malkovich's
life

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.280
which Lotte had discovered earlier in the flim.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.260
So a little explanation for you guys

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.620
whoever enters the portal is basically a ghost

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.724
and whenever they enter this portal, which is connected to somebody.

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:41.420
On their 44th birthday at 12 'o'clock at midnight

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.160
This 'ghost' can take control of this body, forever.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.799
But! If they go past midnight, instead of this body...

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.240
they go into the body, of 'their child' and when that happens

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.880
the 'ghost' cannot control the body.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.379
Lester, who has been using the portal in order
to live longer, reveals his plan to use Malkovich

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.180
when "ripe" as the host for him and several
of his elderly friends. Offered the chance

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.170
to join Lester's group, Lotte warns him that
Craig currently has control of Malkovich.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.859
Craig finds he is able to remain in Malkovich
permanently. He spends the next eight months

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.959
in Malkovich's body, using his skills as a
‘puppeteer’, he is able to turn Malkovich

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.440
into a world-class puppeteer as narrated
over a TV special. Malkovich marries Maxine.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.999
He learns that she is pregnant though their
relationship grows distant.

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:33.719
As Malkovich's 44th birthday approaches, Lester
and his friends make a deal with Maxine, and

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:38.999
fake her kidnapping. They call up Craig, threatening
to kill her if Craig does not leave Malkovich.

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:43.250
Craig ends the call, causing Lester to think
that he is calling their bluff. Lotte loses

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.139
hope and tries to kill Maxine, but they end
up at the turnpike after falling through the

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:51.950
portal and through Malkovich's shame-ridden
subconscious. Maxine reveals to Lotte that

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.640
Maxine conceived when Lotte was inside Malkovich's
body, and she kept the child because it is

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.360
"theirs".

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.660
This reveal cements their love
for each other.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.579
Craig calls back Lester, thinking Maxine is
still in danger. Realizing his opportunity,

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.739
Lester continues his bluff, convincing Craig
to leave Malkovich's body which he does

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.700
Lester and his friends enter the portal ,taking control of Malkovich.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.420
Craig, discovering that Lotte and

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.130
Maxine are together again, decides to enter
the portal to become Malkovich and regain

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.500
Maxine’s love, however he
has unknowingly missed the deadline for getting

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.041
into Malkovich. Years later, an aging Malkovich,
containing the collective mind of Lester and

00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:30.130
his friends, reveals to Charlie Sheen a plan
to prolong their lives via Maxine's daughter

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.030
Emily, within whom Craig is now permanently
trapped. Through Emily's eyes Craig watches

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.780
Maxine and Lotte living happily together.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.820
