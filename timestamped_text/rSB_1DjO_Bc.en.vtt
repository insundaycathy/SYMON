00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.900
Welcome back to Movie Shortens.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.170
Follow us today to a movie titled: Planet
Of The Apes.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.180
Be aware, there are spoilers!

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.599
The movie begins with the captain of a spaceship
sitting at its helm as it hurtles through

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:12.599
space.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.990
As he, Taylor, puffs on a cigar, he reflects
that on the crew’s return to Earth - some

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.730
six months after they left it - it will have
aged around 700 years while they will have

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.190
hardly aged at all.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.920
He also ponders, we assume for the benefit
of people listening back on Earth, whether

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.060
they will still be at war with each other
and mistreating each other.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.809
With his crew already in a deep sleep in sealed-off
chambers, he injects himself in the arm and

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.030
joins them.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.579
With the crew still fast asleep, we soon witness
the ship descending towards a barren planet

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.770
at speed, seemingly out of control.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.260
It eventually crash-lands on a flat, still
body of water, awakening those on board.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.620
As the confused and now bearded male members
of the team clamber quickly from their beds,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.930
water gushing into the ship, they notice that
the only female member of the crew, Stewart,

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.940
has not made it - she has aged incredibly
and died en route.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.420
The men set about trying to save themselves,
with Taylor attempting to restart the ship

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.119
and Dodge climbing up a ladder to test whether
or not the atmosphere is safe and breathable.

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.119
It is.

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.600
So, unable to get the ship up and run again
and the water beginning to sink it, the guys

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.520
grab a few essentials and abandon it, hopping
into the water and making their exit in a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.880
small, round, yellow rubber dingy.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.570
As they paddle away, the third member of the
crew - the rather serious Landon - counts

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.250
down the ship’s final seconds before it
descends below the surface.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.179
Upon finding a suitable place to land, Dodge
quickly gets to work testing the soil while

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.530
Landon looks out over the lake deep in thought
- he is thinking about Stewart.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.700
Unsympathetic Taylor points out Landon has
gone grey.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.649
As Dodge declares the soil incapable of sustaining
any life, Landon marks their landing spot

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.079
with a small American flag.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.319
Taylor, meanwhile, laughs at this and chooses
the entirely random direction in which they

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:57.319
will head.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.090
They have enough food and water for only three
days.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.770
Still clad in their spacesuits, the group
marches across the lifeless terrain ascending

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.560
rocky outcrops and descending steep, grey,
sandy slopes.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.040
At one point, they are forced to run as a
loose boulder rolls down a hill in their direction.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.680
At this point, clearly tired and thirsty,
they contemplate a drink but decide to save

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.290
the remaining fluid instead.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.450
Then, as Dodge forges ahead, Taylor and Landon
begin to argue with Taylor mocking Landon

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.780
for wanting to be a hero and restating the
fact that everything they ever knew on Earth

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.750
would, by now, be long dead and buried.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.400
Dodge yells out excitedly to them from a vantage
point that’s well ahead of the others and

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.900
significantly higher.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.150
Taylor and Landon pick up the pace, and we
soon witness the three of them gathered around

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.900
a tiny plant, which they pluck from the ground.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.480
Where there is one, there will be many more
they assert and head off searching for them.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.329
Now venturing down a path lined by an increasing
number of plants, bushes, and trees, the group

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.249
are - unbeknownst to them - being followed
as we observe the silhouettes of those watching

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.700
them atop some steep rocks nearby.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.439
Having spotted some rather sinister-looking
scarecrows up there, the group begins to make

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.129
their way up but is quickly distracted by
the sound of a waterfall.

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:18.439
They run towards it, clearly dirty and parched
from their lengthy journey, flinging off their

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:19.760
clothes and diving in.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.999
They swim around gleefully, still unaware
of their hidden observers.

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:28.900
At that very moment, they spot footprints
in a sandbank at the edge of the pool.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.170
Their possessions are being stolen by the
errant hands of those that had been flanking

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.170
them.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.660
They spot this and give chase, noticing along
the way that very little has been discarded.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.230
However, they manage to pick up and put on
at least some of their clothes which have

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.180
been cut up and partially destroyed.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.549
The chase leads them to a field where a large
group of primitive-looking, long-haired, only

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.880
partially dressed people gather food.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.909
While Landon remarks that they’re unlucky
to have landed in a place that’s seen such

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:02.629
little advancement, Taylor laughs it off and
suggests they could soon be running the site.

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:08.099
At this moment, panic ensues, and the hordes
of people begin to run from the field, pursued,

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.269
we soon discover, by what appear to be gorillas,
many of which are on horseback, armed with

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.659
sticks and guns.

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.479
The crew also attempts to flee, but Dodge
is shot to death trying to escape the field.

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.039
Taylor can hide among the crops nearby.

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.190
Landon is initially able to get away but is
soon captured in a net, as Taylor has been

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.229
shot in the neck.

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.539
The apes are clearly on a mission to either
kill or capture the humans, and as Taylor

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:37.830
is carried into a camp, bound to a stick,
and placed in a caged carriage, we see several

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.270
other humans strung upside down, hanging from
their ankles.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.479
Here, in captivity, he first makes eye contact
with the striking female human he will later

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:47.690
name Nova.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.780
Taylor is transported to what appears to be
a hospital and is next seen undergoing treatment

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.040
while two chimpanzees discuss both his fate
and the nature of their work.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.680
While the doctor tending to Taylor’s injury
appears irritated and frustrated in his work

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.710
and disgusted at the dirtiness of the human,
his companion Dr. Zira is more sympathetic.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.730
Her job, it seems, is to study the brains
of humans.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.180
Having recovered much of his strength, Taylor
is transferred to a cell and is visited by

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.030
Zira who appears to be fascinated by him.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.650
As she engages in a conversation about him,
he attempts to contribute to it but cannot

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.020
speak due to his injury.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.199
His observers, nevertheless, notice he is
trying to form words.

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:34.170
Though this fascinates Zira, it is quickly
dismissed by her superior, Dr. Zaius, an orangutan,

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.259
who claims Taylor is merely mimicking their
actions.

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:42.389
In a series of subsequent interactions, Taylor
attempts to write messages to Zira, one of

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.699
which reaches her on a piece of paper he stole
from her.

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:47.009
She has learned his name.

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:52.020
The other humans, it has become apparent,
can neither write nor speak, but despite this,

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.610
we sense a growing affection between Nova
and Taylor, who Zira presents to him as a

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.009
gift as they begin to share a cage.

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:03.789
With Zira’s interest in Taylor - who she
prefers to call Bright Eyes - now piqued,

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:06.729
she brings her fiancé Cornelius to see him.

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.560
Cornelius, we find out, is intrigued as he
has been involved in archeological work and

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.169
believes a previously advanced human civilization
to have preexisted their current ape one.

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.960
This, he notes, suggests that men could, potentially,
be domesticated.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.820
He is quickly shut down and warned by Dr.
Zaius, who consistently maintains mankind

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.010
to be incapable of order and inherently combative.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.050
Zira and Cornelius are further intrigued when
Taylor makes a paper airplane, and they watch

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.229
it fly across the room as he attempts to convince
him that flight is possible and that his story

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.229
is indeed the truth.

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:42.289
His plan and their interest is once again
quashed by Dr. Zaius, who also suggests that

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:44.520
he plans to have Taylor castrated.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.470
Taylor quickly realizes his only hope is to
escape and manages to do so, but though he

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.479
flees through, over, and between many buildings,
he cannot get away from his captures.

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:58.170
During this pursuit, he also witnesses Dodge’s
stuffed corpse in a museum.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:03.099
Having been detained once again, we soon find
Taylor in a courtroom, with Zira and Cornelius

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:06.530
attempting to defend him against a group of
judges led by Zaius.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.670
Unable to speak for himself, Taylor writes
down his story, which is laughed off and dismissed

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:12.780
by the judges.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:19.199
We learn this society is founded on some ancient,
sacred scripts and, as a man, Taylor is judged

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:20.349
according to these.

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:25.599
Though suspicious of Taylor’s story, Zaius
pushes him to reveal more, concerned that

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:30.069
a rival group of men live in a distant forest
on the other side of the forbidden zone from

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:33.720
which Taylor emerged, and maybe a threat to
the ape kingdom.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.030
However, he gives Taylor a chance to prove
other humans are capable of communication

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.419
by leading him, along with the other members
of the court, to meet the other people with

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:44.319
whom Taylor was captured.

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:49.310
Here we get our final glimpse of Landon, who
has a big scar on the side of his head and

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.949
has been operated on, depriving him now of
both awareness and speech.

00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:58.730
Realizing the situation is now hopeless, and
with the help of her nephew Lucius, that night,

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.629
Zira frees Taylor, who insists on bringing
Nova with them.

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:05.990
The group makes their getaway on horseback.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:10.819
Once free of the settlement, Taylor takes
one of their guns and asserts his independence.

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:15.669
The gang of them head for the cave Cornelius
had previously been excavating in the forbidden

00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:20.530
zone, convinced that the evidence there can
prove his theory in contradiction of the scripts

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:21.569
and save them.

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:26.449
As Taylor sits on the beach shaving, much
to the bafflement of the others, Zaius and

00:08:26.449 --> 00:08:28.349
a group of guards catch up to them.

00:08:28.349 --> 00:08:33.170
During a brief gunfight, Taylor is able to
take the senior orangutan hostage, causing

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:34.850
the gorillas to back off.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:39.510
At this point, Cornelius leads Zaius into
the cave desperate to convince him of his

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:40.940
theories on mankind.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.900
Zaius remains cynical though and is unwilling
to accept any explanation for the discoveries

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.200
therein, even though Taylor is able to explain
the use and purpose of many of the artifacts,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.630
an artificial heart valve included.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.960
It seems they may be on the cusp of a breakthrough
when they discover the human doll has been

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.580
designed to say ‘mama’ as Taylor asserts,
‘why would an ape make a human doll that

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.580
could speak.’

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.700
Gunfire from outside ruins the moment, though,
as the group emerges to check on Lucias.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:12.600
In this, the final showdown, Taylor gags and
binds his hostage, Dr. Zaius, who is in the

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.600
midst of this.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.170
He admits he has long known of this previous
human world and discourages Taylor from uncovering

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.140
more information about it.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.580
Unperturbed, Taylor heads off on horseback
with Nova, leaving those that freed him at

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.290
the mercy of Zaius and the gorillas.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:30.940
They are immediately arrested, with Zaius
instructing the gorillas to blow up the entrance

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.840
to the cave to hide the evidence.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:38.150
Taylor and Nova, meanwhile, are seen trotting
along a beach in the shadow of the remains

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.690
of the Statue of Liberty.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:44.650
Our hero breaks down in tears of anger, despair
and frustration now knowing he has made it

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.570
home, a home that was entirely destroyed by
mankind.
