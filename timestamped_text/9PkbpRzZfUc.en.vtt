00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.520
imagine driving through a blizzard somewhere&nbsp;
far off grid in Norway night time is coming in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.400
your wife is pregnant and you have packed as&nbsp;
much food as you would give your toddler for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.160
a lunch break in third grade since the start it&nbsp;
is very obvious that these characters haven't put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.040
much thought into their trip what would you do if&nbsp;
you were snowed in and locked into your car while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.800
it's way below zero outside and you have no way&nbsp;
to escape our two characters whose names by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.320
way will never get to know wake up in their car&nbsp;
they have spent the night in there and by now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.600
their car is completely covered with snow and ice&nbsp;
we get to know that they were on their way to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.120
woman's sister and because it was night time and&nbsp;
a disastrous blizzard came in they decided to pull&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.480
over and spend the night before continuing their&nbsp;
journey by daylight now if you have any questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.880
by any chance i know me too why would you make&nbsp;
your journey just before night time and if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.240
didn't and begin your journey as early as possible&nbsp;
the morning before then why would you go on a 6&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:07.680
hour car drive with your 8 months pregnant wife&nbsp;
all the while being in norway in winter i mean if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.200
you had to do this for whatever odd reason then&nbsp;
at least you would have surely planned a hat no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.440
i think we're snowed under just some ice well not&nbsp;
those two apparently however i do agree with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.200
following if you ever get into a situation that&nbsp;
makes it too dangerous to keep on driving well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.880
yes waiting for better conditions to arrive can&nbsp;
be life-saving but in extremely cold temperatures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.240
like those you would find around that time in&nbsp;
norway you may just keep the engine on a blizzard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.040
is no joke and being caught up in a blizzard&nbsp;
dozens of miles away from the next town can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.760
deadly so the first mistake our characters made&nbsp;
was parking the car without keeping the engine on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.040
now some people might argue that that will burn&nbsp;
through all of your fuel and you risk being stuck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.360
there anyway well that's kind of true however&nbsp;
you don't traverse the fjords of norway in winter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.600
without taking any precautions right i mean if you&nbsp;
travel through the death valley in California or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.160
the siberian china and russia or traversing&nbsp;
to sahara north africa whatever pick one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.040
you just know that all these places are notorious&nbsp;
for their harsh and unpredictable environments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.160
and the same goes for the fjords in norway during&nbsp;
winter therefore it is expected to start your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.080
journey with a certain level of precaution and&nbsp;
that of course entails extra fuel for your car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.960
in fact if we consider that our characters are not&nbsp;
norwegian and that they don't know the environment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.720
the sheer number of mistakes they have made before&nbsp;
the movie has even started is quite insane for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.600
example they have not packed more than a handful&nbsp;
of nuts and one sandwich they have only 2 liters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.480
of water they obviously don't have any extra&nbsp;
fuel they don't have a miller blanket and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.480
don't have a heater plus their phone yes they only&nbsp;
have one is low on battery now all this screams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.600
complete ignorance you don't need a blizzard to&nbsp;
be stuck in the middle of nowhere an engine fail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.520
a flat tire your wife going into labor crashing&nbsp;
an animal all of that is possible and yet it seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.640
like they have not considered any of that on top&nbsp;
of all those missed points and miscalculations our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.840
characters don't know any better than blaming each&nbsp;
other i'm sorry baby i'm just trying to get my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.280
head around this okay i knew we should have kept&nbsp;
on driving amazing what they do at first is going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.880
through their provisions next to a box of matches&nbsp;
and some candles they have enough food for 12 days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.240
and a map with an approximate location where they&nbsp;
are now if you ask me there are two options here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.240
either you stay inside the car and hope that&nbsp;
someone will drive by and take note of you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.600
or break through the windows and continue by foot&nbsp;
both ways have their pros and cons and i know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.360
i would do but what would you do i'll give you a&nbsp;
quick moment to figure it out okay so what i would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.960
do is stay in there for a set number of days we&nbsp;
have enough food to comfortably get by for two to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.400
three days we also have a lot of water available&nbsp;
if we consider that we are completely snowed in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.600
so if we find a way to open the windows just a&nbsp;
tiny bit we could gather enough water to get by as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.360
well however three days would be my limit because&nbsp;
first of all it is obviously very cold inside this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.280
vehicle and that won't really change over time and&nbsp;
second our food is only enough for so many days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.400
meaning at some point we will get so weak day&nbsp;
by day that any sort of intervention on our side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.920
just won't work anymore and therefore before we&nbsp;
would completely become dependent on a third party&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.600
intervention i would try waiting inside first and&nbsp;
if nobody arrives i would opt for option 2 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.640
break a window to get out of here however breaking&nbsp;
a window might not be the only option we have

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.080
at a later point in the movie our guy here uses&nbsp;
a candle to defrost a window to let it down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.680
and scratch off some ice to drink it later&nbsp;
smart move but why just use one candle i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.240
would use four to five candles and toast this&nbsp;
window until i can freely open the damn thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.040
if i can find a way to open a window completely i&nbsp;
will be able to scratch through the eyes without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.560
having to break a window meaning if i then&nbsp;
get through the ice i can manually defrost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.680
the ice from the outside of the car and then&nbsp;
climb back in and close the window again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.400
having a phone with me albeit low in battery&nbsp;
would also convince me to try this out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.240
connection outside is arguably better than inside&nbsp;
here and of course i wouldn't make a call alright&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.440
like our characters that uses way too much&nbsp;
battery i would send out an emergency sms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:37.840
that i can pre-write and send it out to multiple&nbsp;
people at once but what do our characters do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.360
15 days my good lord never would i stay in there&nbsp;
for 15 days i get that it's more comfortable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.200
inside but the problem with being comfortable is&nbsp;
you don't really get ahead yes staying inside does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.720
prolong your life but if nobody passes by then&nbsp;
you are just going to starve to death comfort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.720
zone is crippling okay you should forge your own&nbsp;
way rather than waiting for others to rescue you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.560
those that succeed are those that venture out&nbsp;
despite losing comfort and if people 10 000 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.720
ago would survive naked ice age then you can&nbsp;
do it too i mean look at this scene right here

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.520
that's that's just uh now look uh i get it okay&nbsp;
their behavior is clearly motivated by this story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.240
right here because a similar thing happened to&nbsp;
this swedish guy and he survived in his car for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.600
two months before he was rescued and that is&nbsp;
remarkable but in my honest opinion you need a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:41.760
stupid amount of luck to survive this story kudos&nbsp;
to this guy though i guess his survival skills are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.720
on a different level i hope he's doing fine in the&nbsp;
case of our characters though i don't think this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.400
is the right way our characters have at no point&nbsp;
actually studied the map they have and that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.600
where i and every other reasonable person would&nbsp;
begin right you need to calculate how long it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.520
would take you to walk to the next town that's the&nbsp;
starting point also if you had to break a window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:09.120
to leave the car then your pregnant wife could no&nbsp;
way join you she has to stay back and that is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.800
problem but if you can make it to town within six&nbsp;
hours by foot then she should be okay at least in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.840
theory the reason why i keep referring to six&nbsp;
hours by the way is that this is the shortest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.960
period of daylight in late december in norway at&nbsp;
least in the southern parts and since we can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.680
that they do have daylight we can assume that they&nbsp;
are not in the northern parts otherwise it would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.840
be pitch dark 24 7 at least almost and if you're&nbsp;
scandinavian then feel free to correct me if i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.800
wrong i guess the thing though that i'm hinting&nbsp;
on here is that if he can't make it a civilization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.320
within sun hours then he will most likely die&nbsp;
as soon as darkness creeps in good luck finding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:52.160
your way out of here no chance if you make this&nbsp;
move then you have to isolate the broken window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.520
to leave your pregnant wife as comfortably back&nbsp;
as possible if you don't she will keep reminding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.400
you for the rest of your life and you don't want&nbsp;
that there are quite a few things you can do to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.680
cover your car window effectively during winter if&nbsp;
you put layers up on layers on the broken area you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:13.120
will be able to insulate airflow quite a bit if&nbsp;
you don't have any tape at hand to fixate stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.320
then i would put layers of snow from the outside&nbsp;
over it it may seem counterintuitive but that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.360
also how an igloo works the most dangerous thing&nbsp;
about a broken window in winter is the constant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.320
airflow that chills to inside even further and&nbsp;
with this method you can minimize that risk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.840
and for the guy that leaves well going by foot&nbsp;
is not a safe bet but it might be your only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:39.440
chance if you decide to do this you want to start&nbsp;
early in the morning perhaps even before sunrise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.720
pack your map if necessary break the window&nbsp;
isolate it with the techniques from before figure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.920
out where north is and then move your little ass&nbsp;
to figure out where north is without having your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.800
precious congolese cobalt nourished smartphone at&nbsp;
hand you have to figure out the direction without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.480
a compass but in our case here we have a map we&nbsp;
also know the street on which we are and therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:06.080
knowing where north is is no problem at all we&nbsp;
have everything at hand to make an escape possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:12.480
however our characters don't and here is what i&nbsp;
think about this i think people who don't leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:18.560
their comfort zone forget how quick life is able&nbsp;
to turn around for better or worse you might go on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:24.240
walking six hours through the blistering cold your&nbsp;
feet numbing your face losing all its sensation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.680
and you barely give up but the thought of your&nbsp;
loved ones keeps you going and just before you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:35.040
can make it across the finish line you may fall&nbsp;
onto your knees your vision blurs into darkness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.080
just to be reversed with the brightest and most&nbsp;
beautiful light you have ever seen and before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.600
you can understand what is actually happening&nbsp;
you find yourself on the back of articuno now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.960
obviously if that happens then you hopefully pick&nbsp;
up your why first but here's what happens in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:56.880
movie instead no mystical pokemon experience&nbsp;
and no dmt machine elves okay but we got this

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.960
now some people might call that magical as well so&nbsp;
i don't know however question what is worse than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:13.680
being caged inside a tiny space with your spouse&nbsp;
for days on end that's right a crying newborn baby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:19.760
on top of that and before you come at me at full&nbsp;
speed i love kids okay i really do i love kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:25.280
everywhere but airplanes restaurants and when&nbsp;
locked in frozen cars i hate when that happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.920
but let's give a round of applause for this&nbsp;
dude to courageously maneuver his precious wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:36.080
through this painstaking event he even removes&nbsp;
the placenta what a hero now where am i going with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:42.640
this well my fellow breast milk people how is it&nbsp;
going listen breast milk is the thing to feed on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.680
in this situation with this you will probably last&nbsp;
for well over a month i never thought today would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:54.240
come that i would research breast milk but oh boy&nbsp;
this stuff is kind of special it's the feminine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:00.720
nectar off the go just kidding but this drink sure&nbsp;
is more energizing than red bull look at this fats&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:07.680
proteins amino acids anti-inflammatory agents and&nbsp;
a solid 70 calories per 100 milliliter furthermore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.120
a woman produces up to a liter on average after&nbsp;
two weeks of given birth that's not per titty by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.320
the way we're talking netto here now here's a few&nbsp;
more things to mention here apparently the breast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.520
milk before the baby is born is actually called&nbsp;
colostrum now don't ask me about the details&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.000
but apparently it's even more nutritious than&nbsp;
actual breast milk and is available at halfway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.800
through the pregnancy already meaning even before&nbsp;
the baby was born here they could have indulged in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:39.040
this very out of the box survival technique who&nbsp;
is bear grylls again i don't know now people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:44.080
really love to nitpick may point out that due to&nbsp;
stress production of breast milk may suffer and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:50.080
that is true but let's just forget about this okay&nbsp;
i like my idea now in the movie our characters are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.680
blessed with a newborn the days pass relentlessly&nbsp;
though and they hit the 20-day mark and as we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:01.120
expected they lost the majority of their energy&nbsp;
too and the screaming newborn definitely isn't a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:06.480
help neither the biggest problem though is that&nbsp;
at this point they have been frozen in for such&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:12.320
a long time that they are stuck in a solid block&nbsp;
of ice which is much much harder to break through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.360
than it was in the beginning that's something&nbsp;
that supports my set day plan as well if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.840
know that you will leave this place in for&nbsp;
example 3 days you can actively prevent your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:28.000
chosen window from freezing by day 20 there were&nbsp;
still burning candles that means they have many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.720
available and therefore with toasting the windows&nbsp;
continuously during the first few days you would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:37.520
not just heat up the interior considerably but you&nbsp;
would also make it much harder for ice to settle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:43.280
on the outside of this area now obviously they&nbsp;
haven't done that and well this is what happens

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.240
in case you wonder why he took off his clothes&nbsp;
well that is because of his hypothermia a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.800
known symptom of hypothermia is that those&nbsp;
suffering from it start to sweat and become&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:04.400
really hot despite the fact that their body&nbsp;
temperature falls below 35 degrees celsius&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:10.160
and that accelerates their impending death&nbsp;
even more and that is what happens our guy here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:16.080
dies now we could go into cannibalism but let's&nbsp;
skip that one because it's obvious and i'm about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:21.440
to have dinner too okay but of course that is a&nbsp;
possibility and it would keep you alive for quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:27.280
some additional time now by now it's somewhere&nbsp;
around day 24 and our character is still stuck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.480
although now arguably alone she is starting to&nbsp;
hallucinate and talk with her deceased husband&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.760
and we can't really blame her for that i wouldn't&nbsp;
have much hope left neither however i still think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:43.200
leaving the igloo is the best way to go from here&nbsp;
on out but what if the ice wall between you and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:49.280
freedom is so thick that you can't break through&nbsp;
well i suggest you pee on it you might not be able&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.920
to pee a black hole into the ice but with the&nbsp;
bottle opener from before we are able to carve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.440
through it it will take some time of course but&nbsp;
it is entirely possible and by now she hasn't done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:05.360
anything for 24 days straight so i don't think&nbsp;
this plan is too much of a burden at this point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:11.760
we would all try to get out at all costs obviously&nbsp;
in the movie however something else happens the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:17.840
sun shines so bright the ice melts away all around&nbsp;
the car what a pleasant surprise now here's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:23.040
real bummer though she with some struggle makes it&nbsp;
out and starts walking remember how in the worst&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.880
case we only have 6 hours available well guess&nbsp;
what she makes it to the next house within a few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:35.360
hours only and that after 24 days of hell giving&nbsp;
birth to a child and even carrying that baby in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.640
her arms all the while it's freezing cold that's&nbsp;
a little hard to believe but it especially means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.280
that if they had broken out of the car at the&nbsp;
beginning they would have saved an easy 20 days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.480
had a great story to tell and the dude would have&nbsp;
certainly survived but i would like to ask you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.600
what would have you done differently how&nbsp;
would you survive being frozen into your car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.960
let me know and as always i appreciate you&nbsp;
for being here and i see you in the next one
