00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:07.893
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.021 --> 00:00:11.349
today I'll show you a science fiction film: "Orbiter 9" 

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:13.909
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:19.477
Helena is a beautiful young woman who has traveled alone in space for the last 3 years

00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:23.445
3 years ago, the oxygen regeneration system broke down

00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:28.821
oxygen remaining within the space station was only enough to support 3 people for 3 years

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.021
Helena's parents had sent out a distress signal

00:00:32.213 --> 00:00:36.181
they still needed to travel nearly 23 years to reach the destination

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.621
so they decided to commit suicide to save oxygen so that their daughter Helena could survive

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.885
since then, Helena has lived alone on the station

00:00:45.205 --> 00:00:49.109
she was born here and has never seen anyone else except for her parents

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:52.949
every day, apart from eating, sleeping, and exercising

00:00:53.077 --> 00:00:54.741
she can only kill the boring time 

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:59.733
by watching videos of her parents and some movie reviews from Daniel CC Youtube Channel

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.333
in order to keep healthy

00:01:01.397 --> 00:01:05.493
she uses some medical equipment to do periodic health checks on the station

00:01:05.877 --> 00:01:09.589
on the day of her 20th birthday, the rescue finally arrives

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.301
with the door opening, Helena sees the first stranger in her life

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:15.669
a maintenance engineer named Alex

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:18.357
she is very nervous and happy to see the male Alex 

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:20.853
as he takes off his hormone-smelly helmet

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:25.013
however, Alex seems very calm and even a little cold to her

00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:30.197
Alex briefly introduces himself, then goes straight to the main cabin to repair the system

00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:34.421
Helena follows him tightly and invites him to stay for dinner (but actually for hormones)

00:01:34.485 --> 00:01:36.533
however, Alex is not interested 

00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:40.949
until Helena tells him that he is the first and only living man she has met in 20 years

00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:43.765
during dinner, Helena tries to chat with Alex

00:01:43.893 --> 00:01:46.389
but Alex doesn't like that she is a colonist

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:51.378
Helena and her parents are actually the colonists who are heading to another habitable planet

00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:53.490
which is a 40-year-long journey

00:01:53.618 --> 00:01:58.162
though Helena knows nothing about it, she can't change the fact that she is a colonist

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.298
Helena doesn't think her situation is a privilege

00:02:01.426 --> 00:02:03.730
she hasn't been able to go anywhere since her birth

00:02:03.858 --> 00:02:06.994
and she has to go through all this alone in a tiny space

00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:10.600
half of her life is going to be wasted on the journey without hormone-let-go

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.453
 as described by Daniel CC

00:02:13.074 --> 00:02:15.950
if she could choose, she would never want a life like this

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:19.369
hearing this, Alex feels a bit sorry for her

00:02:19.497 --> 00:02:24.297
at night, Helena can't resist her boiling hormones and goes to Alex's room

00:02:24.425 --> 00:02:27.241
begging him to show her some hormone mercy 

00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:30.505
for she will probably not meet any man in another 20 years

00:02:30.697 --> 00:02:32.681
Alex doesn't push her away this time

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:37.481
and generously bestows on her the first, fantastic but fast hormone game 

00:02:37.737 --> 00:02:42.089
two minutes later, Alex tries to leave secretly while Helena is sleeping

00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:45.865
Helena wakes up and follows him, expressing her sadness 

00:02:46.185 --> 00:02:48.873
she knows perfectly that Alex cant's stay for long

00:02:48.937 --> 00:02:53.097
so the still-hormone-thirsty Helena has to watch him leave the cabin in anguish

00:02:53.225 --> 00:02:56.809
Alex walks out of the cabin and enters a strange elevator

00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:59.049
surprisingly as the elevator stops

00:02:59.177 --> 00:03:02.633
Alex takes off his spacesuit and walks into a wooded area

00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:07.497
Alex puts his belongings into a truck parked at the roadside and leaves in a hurry

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:11.017
it turns out that the so-called space journey is just a lie

00:03:11.145 --> 00:03:13.385
with the deterioration of the Earth's environment

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:16.009
Alex's company comes up with such a project

00:03:16.137 --> 00:03:19.465
they have found a habitable planet which is Helena's destination

00:03:19.593 --> 00:03:21.769
but that planet is very far away

00:03:21.897 --> 00:03:25.417
to predict potential problems, they decide to experiment on humans

00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:27.017
they have chosen 10 humans 

00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:30.537
and observed them in 10 Orbiter simulators over a long period of time

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.993
Helena is one of them and she is from Orbiter 9

00:03:34.057 --> 00:03:37.065
different from others, Helena was born in the simulator

00:03:37.193 --> 00:03:39.241
she may spend her whole life there

00:03:39.497 --> 00:03:42.761
Alex returns to the company and has a conversation with his boss

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.217
who tells him that the departure is 20 to 30 years away

00:03:46.345 --> 00:03:48.841
but Alex doesn't seem very excited about it

00:03:48.905 --> 00:03:51.721
because he has some hormone feelings towards Helena now

00:03:51.913 --> 00:03:54.153
his boss can tell Alex is wavering

00:03:54.217 --> 00:03:58.441
he continues to tell Alex that they are working for the future of 8 billion people

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.345
by comparison, those 10 people in the simulators are trivial

00:04:02.473 --> 00:04:05.417
he then warns Alex to focus on his job

00:04:05.673 --> 00:04:10.025
on Alex's way home, the radio in the car reports that the climate is getting worse

00:04:10.153 --> 00:04:13.417
when he gets home, he processes the newly collected data

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:16.233
in the meantime, Helena is missing Alex

00:04:16.425 --> 00:04:19.945
as time goes on, Alex's affection for Helena is growing

00:04:20.137 --> 00:04:24.873
Alex's friend, who is also a doctor, can tell Alex is worried about something

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:29.929
he tells Alex that his health test results are fine, but there is radiation in his body

00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:34.409
for his health, he shouldn't have entered the simulator nor enter it again

00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:37.417
when Alex is drinking alone at home during the night

00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:40.681
his robot pet starts projecting a video on the wall

00:04:40.937 --> 00:04:44.073
it was Helena talking to the robot about how much she liked Alex 

00:04:44.265 --> 00:04:47.529
she recorded this in Orbiter 9 while Alex wasn't there

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.921
the next morning, Alex goes to work in Orbiter 10

00:04:51.177 --> 00:04:54.761
when he returns, he can't help but stop at the gate of Orbiter 9

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.321
but he leaves after stopping for a while

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.289
at night, Alex comes to a psychological clinic to meet a therapist

00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:03.401
he tells her about his confusion 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:07.689
as a scientist, he shouldn't have had feelings towards the experiment subjects

00:05:07.881 --> 00:05:12.617
but he feels sorry for Helena and other subjects who live their whole life in a lie 

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.729
they are just like human guinea pigs

00:05:14.857 --> 00:05:17.097
the therapist is in shock hearing that

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.809
Alex returns home, but he can't stop thinking about Helena

00:05:20.937 --> 00:05:25.353
while the therapist stays up the whole night long, thinking about what Alex told her

00:05:25.673 --> 00:05:30.089
one day, Alex finally makes up his mind and goes to Orbiter 9 secretly

00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:33.673
Helena is surprised to see Alex in his casual clothes

00:05:34.057 --> 00:05:37.961
Alex reveals the truth to Helena and tries to take her out of Orbiter 9

00:05:38.281 --> 00:05:42.505
however, Helena doesn't believe his smelly man-shit and refuses to go

00:05:42.697 --> 00:05:45.705
Alex then takes the bio-feeds out of Helena's body

00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:48.329
the alarm on the station starts immediately

00:05:48.457 --> 00:05:53.065
when Alex puts the bio-feeds into a machine he prepared, the alarm then goes off

00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:57.289
Helena finally trusts Alex and leaves the simulator with him

00:05:57.673 --> 00:06:00.617
she would never have thought she's been living such a big lie

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:05.993
Helena lies down in a box in the back of his car and escapes the research compound safely

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:07.785
when they reach a safe place

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:11.945
Alex lets Helena out and tells her about the project and the experiment

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:14.761
Helena can't believe her parents are part of it

00:06:14.825 --> 00:06:19.433
right now she wants to see her parents, but Alex thinks it is not safe to do so

00:06:19.625 --> 00:06:23.273
it is better she does not let anyone knows she has left the Orbiter

00:06:23.593 --> 00:06:27.049
later, they return to Alex's apartment and sleep on the same bed

00:06:27.177 --> 00:06:29.289
which is like a dream for Helena

00:06:29.417 --> 00:06:32.809
the next morning, when she wakes up, Alex has gone to work

00:06:33.001 --> 00:06:37.865
when Alex finishes work, he goes to meet the therapist and tells her he has saved Helena

00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:41.833
the therapist thinks it is risky, but she supports Alex's decision

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:46.761
before Alex leaves, the therapist tells him she has an apartment that nobody knows about

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:50.025
if there is an emergency, he can call her for help

00:06:50.281 --> 00:06:55.465
later on, Alex takes Helena to an aquarium because she's been dreaming about seeing the sea

00:06:55.657 --> 00:06:57.897
but Earth's sea has been polluted by acid

00:06:58.153 --> 00:07:01.097
if left alone, all marine life will die out

00:07:01.353 --> 00:07:04.553
watching the fish in the aquarium, Helena has a great time

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:06.665
she is curious about everything

00:07:07.113 --> 00:07:09.481
the next morning, Helena finds his office

00:07:09.673 --> 00:07:14.089
from the monitor in the office, she is aware that nobody knows of her disappearance

00:07:14.217 --> 00:07:18.313
that is because Alex records her data and transmits it back to the simulator

00:07:18.697 --> 00:07:22.537
she wonders why people would accept to be in the simulators in 20 years time

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:28.341
Alex tells her the simulator will inform them there is an error in the navigation after they getting in

00:07:28.341 --> 00:07:30.250
and the journey will be extended indefinitely

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:33.397
so that the company can study their vital signs

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:37.237
all scientists only see the positive side of emigrating to another planet

00:07:37.365 --> 00:07:40.437
but ignore the lives of the 10 people in the simulators

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:43.957
at night, Alex takes Helena to a party in a club

00:07:44.213 --> 00:07:47.541
Alex introduces Helena as a childhood friend to his friends 

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:50.293
and states that they met each other at the company

00:07:50.485 --> 00:07:53.237
the doctor finds there is something weird about Helena

00:07:53.557 --> 00:07:58.357
somehow they start to talk about the emigrating project, which the doctor doesn't approve of

00:07:58.613 --> 00:08:01.621
he thinks it is irresponsible to leave Earth after destroying it 

00:08:01.685 --> 00:08:04.565
and let their kids spend half of their life on the journey

00:08:04.757 --> 00:08:07.829
people should try their best to save Earth rather than abandon it

00:08:08.085 --> 00:08:11.221
the other two girls say they will give up the chance to emigrate

00:08:11.349 --> 00:08:14.805
now Helena realizes not everyone supports the project

00:08:14.933 --> 00:08:18.453
her 20 years spent alone in the simulator is totally for nothing

00:08:18.837 --> 00:08:22.933
the next day, Helena finds a bruise on her back when she is taking a shower

00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:26.005
so Alex takes Helena to the doctor for a health check

00:08:26.325 --> 00:08:30.421
when they are back home, Helena enters Alex's office again out of curiosity

00:08:30.549 --> 00:08:33.301
this time, she finds the data of the 10 simulators 

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:36.757
and figures out the real reason why people don't care about the subjects

00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:40.597
these 10 people are all clones, including Helena herself

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.285
Helena is astonished to notice the truth 

00:08:43.413 --> 00:08:48.021
later, using the address on the documents, Helena goes to find her birth parents

00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:52.757
in the meantime, Alex'S boss is presenting updates to representatives from all countries

00:08:52.885 --> 00:08:56.149
trying to persuade them to agree to the emigration project

00:08:56.405 --> 00:08:59.477
Helena arrives at her parents' house before night falls

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:01.653
they are surprised to see Helena

00:09:01.781 --> 00:09:04.853
they explain to Helena that she is a clone of their late daughter

00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:09.333
even though they tell her she is special and unique, Helena is still upset

00:09:09.525 --> 00:09:12.469
because they left her to be a test subject in a lab

00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:14.965
the father excuses himself to make a coffee

00:09:15.157 --> 00:09:20.149
when he returns, he handcuffs Helena and informs the company that Helena is there

00:09:20.277 --> 00:09:22.773
the mother is not as cold towards Helena

00:09:22.837 --> 00:09:26.421
so she knocks the husband out and releases the poor cloned daughter

00:09:26.549 --> 00:09:29.685
though Helena is a clone, the mother cares for her

00:09:29.813 --> 00:09:33.717
she gives Helena a hug and asks her to run before she is found

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:36.917
on the other side, Alex can't find Helena at home

00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:41.589
when he sees the scattered documents, he realizes Helena must have gone to her parents

00:09:41.845 --> 00:09:46.261
but shortly after, Helena comes back and challenges Alex why he lied to her

00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:49.397
Alex says he is sorry, but he doesn't regret it

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:53.685
because Helena has exposed herself, they have to run away immediately

00:09:54.069 --> 00:09:59.765
Alex's boss receives an order from higher authorities to catch Alex and Helena at any cost

00:09:59.957 --> 00:10:03.733
Alex has left his apartment with Helena and contacted the therapist

00:10:03.861 --> 00:10:07.381
who agrees to give him the key to her apartment when she finishes work

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:11.541
right then, Alex notices that Helena's bruise is getting worse

00:10:11.733 --> 00:10:16.085
Alex's boss gets to Alex's home with his men and can't find either of them

00:10:16.277 --> 00:10:18.581
but he finds the therapist's name card

00:10:18.773 --> 00:10:23.061
so he goes to the therapist's office, where Alex and Helena happen to be 

00:10:23.445 --> 00:10:26.645
the therapist asks them to stay behind the screen and don't move

00:10:26.837 --> 00:10:29.781
the boss threatens to kill the therapist if they don't come out

00:10:29.909 --> 00:10:33.621
one man shoots the therapist in the head and scares Helena a lot

00:10:33.685 --> 00:10:35.413
which gives them away

00:10:35.989 --> 00:10:39.829
after they expose themselves, they run to the rooftop, chased by the boss's men

00:10:40.021 --> 00:10:44.949
knowing they cannot escape from their pursuers, Helena decides to sacrifice herself

00:10:45.141 --> 00:10:47.893
she tricks Alex into jumping across a rooftop first 

00:10:47.957 --> 00:10:51.477
but she doesn't follow and therefore is captured by the coming hatchet men

00:10:51.669 --> 00:10:55.893
Alex escapes and finds the doctor in a bar who has been beaten up

00:10:56.085 --> 00:10:59.157
the doctor tells Alex that Helena's condition is not good

00:10:59.413 --> 00:11:02.293
she can't adapt to the environment outside of the simulator

00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:05.365
maybe the simulator is the safest place for her

00:11:05.685 --> 00:11:09.013
but the analytics chain is broken when she escaped from the simulator

00:11:09.141 --> 00:11:12.853
which means that Helena is useless as an experiment subject to the company 

00:11:13.045 --> 00:11:16.053
as a result, the company has disconnected Orbiter 9

00:11:44.277 --> 00:11:46.261
