00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.640
imagine coming home from school and finding a&nbsp;
cute girl or guy in a not so badly made bleach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.160
cosplay in your room there aren't any conventions&nbsp;
right now so that's a bit odd but not so quick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.640
perhaps she's going to a private cosplay party&nbsp;
that would make sense but why the hell is she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.200
in my room that's probably what this Ichigo&nbsp;
thought when he was stopped by this girl that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.160
claims to be Rukia but it turns out she isn't&nbsp;
cosplaying at all and that's serious about her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.840
eternal fights versus hollows she's even talking&nbsp;
about how she places lost souls into soul society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.520
okay now that's a bit weird if something&nbsp;
like this happens to you it stays with you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.400
for some time first of all as weird as this&nbsp;
event might be if something like this happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.120
to you i think you should make sure that this&nbsp;
girl isn't an escapee from a mental hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.680
the last thing you want is facing a schizophrenic&nbsp;
tsundere with a real katana on her back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.800
claiming she's hunting hollows at this moment&nbsp;
Ichigo runs downstairs only to witness this

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.600
you would normally be quick in giving your&nbsp;
best friend a call and tell him what the f&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.080
going on right now i mean where does this even&nbsp;
lead to but before you can figure out what is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.520
actually happening a full-sized hollow appears&nbsp;
what at this point you start questioning your own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.160
sense of reality did you really just project your&nbsp;
own schizophrenic tendencies onto this innocent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.680
cosplayer you go mentally through all possible&nbsp;
explanations the most plausible explanation is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.280
you forgot to take off your nerve gear you try to&nbsp;
log out but that would be a joke suddenly the view&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.240
starts to blur and you find yourself spending&nbsp;
a fortune on a virtual idyllic nature lodge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.400
planning ahead of family with your 16 year&nbsp;
old online girlfriend what is happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.040
before you can understand what is happening the&nbsp;
giant hollow punches you 15 feet across the air&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.840
leaving you speechless the idea that you&nbsp;
somehow became the real Ichigo Kurosaki&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.600
in whatever dimension you exist in&nbsp;
is slowly creeping up in your mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.560
perhaps all of your dreams came true and&nbsp;
you were manifested into a real anime world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.080
and as circumstances would have it it was&nbsp;
the bleach universe sick in any way let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.600
assume for now that all of this is as it seems&nbsp;
and you became the Ichigo in this dimension

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.880
this is a hollow a hollow is an evil turned soul&nbsp;
of a dead person when people die they normally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.840
go to soul society a place like heaven minus the&nbsp;
angels plus sword-wielding psychos but some people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.400
die with a grudge or unfinished business imagine&nbsp;
dying and leaving back your daughter or son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.120
or dying on the same day you find your spouse&nbsp;
cheating on you in such cases the soul of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.640
deceased person can go over to the soul society&nbsp;
naturally it is somewhat stuck in our world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.160
that wouldn't be a big issue in itself but those&nbsp;
souls turn slowly into hollows after time passes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.120
once they turn into hollows there is no way back&nbsp;
and they start harming humans and other souls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.400
the only place hollows are able to traverse to is&nbsp;
our world the human realm and the hollow world or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.840
also called hueco mundo hollows pose a threat to&nbsp;
humans as well as souls they feed off of them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.160
prolong their existence and to get more powerful&nbsp;
and possibly because souls taste awesome maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.040
the only way to prevent lost souls from turning&nbsp;
into hollows is to manually free them from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.240
its burden and place it into the soul society&nbsp;
directly that is where shinigamis come into play&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.640
on one hand they detect lost souls and release&nbsp;
them into the soul society before they turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.080
into hollows and on the other hand they actively&nbsp;
fight hollows a hollow can't be seen by ordinary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.280
people the reason Ichigo can see them indicates&nbsp;
that he has a lot of suppressed spiritual power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.880
or maybe he just needs to have a girl in any&nbsp;
way the only way to successfully win against a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.920
hollow is by cutting through its mask which sits&nbsp;
usually on top of its body in front of its face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.520
this results in the hollow to be purified and its&nbsp;
original soul can be transported into soul society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.240
during this fight Rukia gets injured and is&nbsp;
thus unable to continue fighting the hollow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.360
that's pretty shitty but of course she has&nbsp;
a plan the idea is to stab you into your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.200
chest with her katana or also called zanpakuto&nbsp;
with this method she can transfer her shinigami&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.320
powers temporarily onto you meaning she can&nbsp;
sit back and relax and you have to do her job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.440
great now first of all finding a random girl&nbsp;
in my room pretending to be Rukia and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.840
pressing me into getting stabbed in my chest so i&nbsp;
can do her job i don't know man sounds fishy to me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.040
but seeing a full-sized hollow that seems to&nbsp;
be real with all its special effects i mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.000
that's pretty convincing besides my family&nbsp;
is in immediate danger so i mean let's do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.280
let's get the chest piercing going that worked&nbsp;
better than expected huh how do we go from here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.440
well the next morning when Ichigo wakes up&nbsp;
he seems to be the only one remembering the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.920
incident from last night his two sisters&nbsp;
and his dad don't seem to remember anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.560
everything seems to be pretty normal apart&nbsp;
from that massive hole in the house of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.720
everything is fine until Rukia joins Ichigo's&nbsp;
class and claims to be the new transfer student&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.680
looks like we aren't done yet so here's the&nbsp;
deal on the rooftop she tells us that from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.120
now on we must fulfill her role as a substitute&nbsp;
shinigami that's pretty cool can't deny that but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.600
why would we want to fight massive monsters&nbsp;
without getting any sort of compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.320
that seems like a pretty unbalanced deal here&nbsp;
besides i'm still not convinced that my last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.240
acid trip weared off yet anyway for now it seems&nbsp;
we do have to fight hollows but apparently our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.840
new shinigami powers attract powerful hollows from&nbsp;
all over the place putting our friends and family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.600
into a not so nice spot we have three options here&nbsp;
first f this fake Rukia and her madness that's all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.080
just way too weird to be true we continue&nbsp;
our lives as if nothing happened risking the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.600
well-being of everyone around us or secondly&nbsp;
we agree to fight hollows but prefer to do so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.960
from out of town so our loved ones won't become&nbsp;
collateral damage if things won't go straight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.680
the only downside with this is if something&nbsp;
unexpected happens which it always does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.120
we aren't able to intervene in time making this&nbsp;
option worse than option 1. leaves is only the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.200
third option fighting the hollows for Rukia in&nbsp;
our neighborhood but for that we need training

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.840
wonderful i think that should suffice i think we&nbsp;
are able now to fight giant monsters with magic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.560
powers that feed off of lost souls let's see&nbsp;
how this goes but before that we get to meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:38.880
another cosplayer another cosplayer on a trip&nbsp;
or is it really me that is going nuts here well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.240
it doesn't really matter because a Renji cosplayer&nbsp;
can't be sane to begin with let me make this short&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.480
side note on what is happening in this scene&nbsp;
so you can understand the plot of the movie too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.960
this is Renji he's another shinigami and has a&nbsp;
hot temper his duty is to bring back Rukia since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.480
she broke the rules by giving Ichigo her powers&nbsp;
in this scene ichigo pretends to not know who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.840
Rukia is or what this red haired dude is talking&nbsp;
about and i think this is the best way to react&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.800
at this point we still don't know enough about&nbsp;
shinigamis their hierarchies or anything else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.520
that is going on really all we know is a&nbsp;
powerless shinigami's living in our closet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.640
we became substitute shinigamis and we must&nbsp;
fight giant monsters called hollows i think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.680
the best option we have right now is to focus&nbsp;
on what we know and avoid everything we don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:34.160
know keeping things simple is always a good way to&nbsp;
start the next day things start to fall in place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.600
another hollow appears and Rukia uses her soul&nbsp;
glove to push Ichigo's shinigami form out of him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.680
your shinigami form is powerful remember but&nbsp;
your human form stays weak so before this rude&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:51.440
girl attempts to push through your body to release&nbsp;
your other self wear a helmet a grown-up body that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.160
falls over like a sack full of potatoes bears a&nbsp;
high risk of serious head injury you don't want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.360
to become a shinigami by murdering your true&nbsp;
self right so Ichigo storms over to rescue the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.720
soul of that little boy and as luck would have&nbsp;
it we are facing a giant hollow spider of course

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.920
as i have mentioned before the only way to win&nbsp;
against the hollow is to cut through their mask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.560
any other damage performed won't suffice&nbsp;
Ichigo struggles a lot here even though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.440
this is a low-class hollow it shows that he&nbsp;
hasn't trained sufficiently at this point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.920
therefore fighting hollows in our current&nbsp;
state is pretty reckless and rather dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.320
we won't be helping anyone by getting eaten up&nbsp;
by random hollows in the neighborhood so either&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.600
we train more or we find a better solution what i&nbsp;
mean is when Renji comes into the scene to defeat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.960
the hollow he attacked us and Rukia too like i've&nbsp;
mentioned before Rukia broke the law by giving us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.160
her powers we on the other hand didn't know jack&nbsp;
[ __ ] about what was happening in the first place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.720
all we knew was there was a cosplayer in&nbsp;
our room a hollow appeared and we suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:00.480
became shinigamis therefore the simplest most&nbsp;
effective way at this moment would be to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.440
open your mouth and explain what happened&nbsp;
entering a fight against a shinigami that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.880
has defeated the hollow you struggled with in a&nbsp;
split second is just a bad idea because part of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.720
the job of a shinigami is to protect humans so it&nbsp;
would make sense to engage in a conversation first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.560
rather than start a seemingly&nbsp;
hopeless fight look at it like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.120
all you want is for your friends and family&nbsp;
members to be safe that you are being targeted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.640
by giant monsters and shinigamis at the same time&nbsp;
is a complete accident or misunderstanding at best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.680
the best way to beat this threat is to explain&nbsp;
thoroughly what happened that gives you a fair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.800
chance to solve this issue without a needless&nbsp;
fight because the best way to win a fight is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:51.920
to win before you fight yeah i've read the art of&nbsp;
war sun tzu actually Rukia is trying exactly what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.640
i've just said she tries to explain everything to&nbsp;
her elder brother who by the way is a captain and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.520
a very high ranking shinigami in fact he's one&nbsp;
of the Gotei 13 of which each has his own field&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:07.360
of responsibility the Gotei 13 are captains&nbsp;
and leaders of uh you know kind of military&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:13.680
fractions and stuff um they're very powerful very&nbsp;
very powerful Renji is his lieutenant and Rukia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.400
an aspirant to become his successor or something&nbsp;
similar in this scene he tells her to retake her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.760
powers from Ichigo before the next full moon if&nbsp;
she doesn't well then it's lights out for both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:30.960
the only catch is if she retakes her powers while&nbsp;
our spiritual pressure is low we will die leaves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.080
is only the option to regain our spiritual powers&nbsp;
i have a few things in mind but i don't want this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.480
video to become a semen retention video that&nbsp;
promises you superhuman powers within 30 days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.920
if you follow my exact routine for one month for&nbsp;
only 9.99 in any way we are in a [ __ ] position&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.440
here and our options are scarce you can't hide&nbsp;
because they can sense you pretty much anywhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.240
you can't fight because you're too weak and the&nbsp;
last online course you bought on how to release&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:02.080
your hidden energies turned out to be a scam&nbsp;
so we don't really have good options here if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.200
you're honest what would you do in this position&nbsp;
how would you build up your spiritual pressures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:13.200
what i would do is visit urahara-san that seems to&nbsp;
be the single best option available in this moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.320
for those who don't know who he is he is an&nbsp;
ex-shinigami who was exiled for whatever reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.120
he lives in our neighborhood lucky us and&nbsp;
manages somewhat like a black market for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:29.360
people concerned with souls etc whoever that&nbsp;
is if anyone knows what to do it's this guy

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.440
according to the movie he can't really&nbsp;
help us though and i have to admit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:45.040
it seems like a pretty hopeless situation it&nbsp;
seems we have to use different tactics this time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:50.400
so i have recently read a book about how to&nbsp;
negotiate and it turns out the best way to receive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:56.240
what you want is to give what the other side&nbsp;
wants first that according to the book sparks up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:02.000
a sense of guilt and gratitude in the receiver's&nbsp;
mind making him more receptive to your requests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.240
but what the hell would a shingami want&nbsp;
right probably not swiss chocolate balls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.960
or a cool new tech gadget it has to be&nbsp;
something meaningful something impressive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.880
and red apples i don't think they&nbsp;
will work on this shinigami here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.240
so here's a not so serious question for you what&nbsp;
present would you make to be a Byakuya Kuchigi let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:25.040
me know in the comments that's a tough question&nbsp;
i know but you have all the time you want really

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.880
anyway what Ichigo decides to do is the following&nbsp;
he promises to hunt down the grand fischer a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:40.800
powerful hollow that has escaped the grip of&nbsp;
shinigamis for 54 years that's a pretty smart move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:46.800
looks like he has red dale carnegie too huh and&nbsp;
it worked the other side accepts Ichigo's request&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.360
and lets him have his chance that went&nbsp;
better than expected huh where's the catch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.360
now the next challenge to solve would&nbsp;
be how to beat the grand fisher but for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.800
that you must understand what the grand fisher&nbsp;
actually is so the grand fischer is a powerful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.240
hollow who has eaten dozens of other hollows&nbsp;
becoming more powerful each time thereafter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.600
one of his special abilities is that he can&nbsp;
take on any form that he wants including humans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.560
this makes it easy for him to prey on other&nbsp;
hollows or people with high spiritual energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:22.080
in fact it turns out that it was the grand fisher&nbsp;
who has killed Ichigo's mother all those years ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.400
but before we can do what we said we would do&nbsp;
killing the grand fischer to be spared by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:36.240
other two shinigamis from before we need more&nbsp;
training let's go how about that all you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:42.800
is a giant sword two wood sticks and an old tire&nbsp;
to become the next Ichigo kurosaki in a week&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.640
we know about the saitama challenge how about a&nbsp;
30-day Ichigo challenge anyone feel free you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.880
have to pay me it's all right it's alright on the&nbsp;
following day Ichigo and his family are going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:58.080
visit his mother's grave it's been 9 years&nbsp;
since she's been killed Ichigo only recently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.640
realized that it was a grand fisher who killed&nbsp;
her i mean he didn't really know about hollows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:08.160
and their abilities until recently he could see&nbsp;
ghosts ever since he was a kid but that's about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.080
so when they are about to arrive at&nbsp;
the cemetery his sister gets attacked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:20.160
by of course the grand fisher luckily we have&nbsp;
invested the past seven days to train like the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:26.640
ultimate killer machine this won't be a problem&nbsp;
now first of all one of the tactics i'd recommend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:32.880
is don't run into the city to fight a giant&nbsp;
hollow instead try to move away from busy places&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.640
i know that isn't really obvious and&nbsp;
quite difficult to figure out but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:43.840
that's why i'm here right to give you the best&nbsp;
tips based on profound and in-depth observations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:51.440
while Ichigo tries to avoid further destructions&nbsp;
because he was an idiot we get a cameo from Uryu&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.880
Ishida he's a quincy now if you don't know what&nbsp;
this is don't worry just think in terms of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:04.560
wizard or watch the anime or read the manga really&nbsp;
seriously just it's a great great thing um anyway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.120
it looks pretty [ __ ] cool in live-action format&nbsp;
not gonna lie so they fight the grand fisher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.000
together and Ichigo gets the chance to strike&nbsp;
one last time causing the hollow to finally decay

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.600
but the victory doesn't last long Uryu gets&nbsp;
stabbed from the back by Renji and Ichigo gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.320
involved in a pretty heavy fight with both&nbsp;
shinigamis looks like honor is foreign to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.760
them huh we just defeated a hollow they&nbsp;
were incapable defeating for 54 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:39.440
and this is how we're thanked that's f-up bro&nbsp;
what the hell Renji activates his true zanpakuto&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:45.440
form also called Shikai his katana in this form&nbsp;
resembles something like a whip that can extend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:50.880
itself and fight on long range bases this is the&nbsp;
second form of a zanpakuto and much more powerful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:56.240
than the original ordinary katana form of course&nbsp;
we didn't learn anything of that sword yet and are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:01.280
pretty much boxed around the air but we haven't&nbsp;
defeated Zangetsu yet in fact we don't even know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:06.800
who the [ __ ] is so even though Ichigo here seems&nbsp;
to be somewhat able to measure himself with Renji&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:13.440
as soon as he engages in a fight with Byakuya it's&nbsp;
pretty hopeless as you can see beating Byakuya or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.800
any of the Gotei 13 without even knowing the name&nbsp;
of our sword well leave that to the idiots the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.680
only reasons Ichigo survived this encounter was&nbsp;
because he was so determined to keep fighting even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.480
though he was long defeated i guess that somehow&nbsp;
impressed Byakuya and he spared him because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:34.160
that Rukia here retakes her powers all of a sudden&nbsp;
that's apparently no problem right thanks girl how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.760
about next time you don't wait until i'm on the&nbsp;
verge of death because your cocky brother is an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:43.520
[ __ ] jesus in any way they travel back to&nbsp;
the soul society and we finally wake up from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:49.840
our massive pretty heavy acid trip if you've&nbsp;
made it this far you should subscribe thanks
