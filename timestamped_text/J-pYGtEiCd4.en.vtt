Hi, Israq21 here,

00:00:09.806 --> 00:00:12.942
Today, I will recap a movie called The Boy Next Door

00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:17.435
The Boy Next Door is a 2015 American erotic psychological thriller film,

00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:20.048
This film tells about a 19 year old boy,

00:00:20.048 --> 00:00:23.744
who develops a dangerous and sexual obsession with his Teacher.

00:00:23.744 --> 00:00:27.458
This boy really wanted to make love and live together forever with his Teacher,

00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:31.011
But Things Turn For The Worse after The Teacher rejected and dumped him.

00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:35.134
OK, what's the continuation of the story?
watch out and take care,

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:40.001
This is a spoiler content video, Enjoy the video and let’s start the story,

00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:47.698
The film begins with a beautiful woman named Claire,

00:00:47.698 --> 00:00:55.730
she is very dizzy because her husband is having an affair and she is also confused about whether she wants to continue or get a divorce.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.592
However, because of her son birthday, namely Kevin,

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:05.227
Claire was forced to allow her husband, who had been away for 9 months, to return to her home.

00:01:05.227 --> 00:01:09.045
It seems that Claire is no longer able to continue her marriage

00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:12.842
because it turns out that her husband still wants to live with his mistress.

00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:15.693
So that makes Claire very hurt.

00:01:15.693 --> 00:01:19.737
The next day, when Claire wants to take Kevin to a dermatologist,

00:01:19.737 --> 00:01:21.438
the garage door is broken,

00:01:21.438 --> 00:01:26.067
and suddenly comes a 19 year old boy named Noah,
who immediately helps her.

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:29.770
Noah had just moved to his uncle's house which is next to Claire's house,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.038
because Noah has become an orphan now after his parents had a car accident.

00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:39.614
Noah immediately took Kevin to the store to repair the garage door.

00:01:39.614 --> 00:01:44.188
In the store, Kevin meets a girl named Allie who he really liked at school.

00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:47.603
Then Noah teaches Kevin to be confident and greet Allie,

00:01:47.603 --> 00:01:51.808
but unfortunately the bullies from Kevin's school come and mock Kevin in front of Allie.

00:01:54.499 --> 00:02:01.097
At home, Noah tells Claire that Kevin was bullied earlier,
but Claire thinks it's usual for Kevin.

00:02:01.097 --> 00:02:06.262
After that, Noah starts to get to know Kevin and teaches him how to repair cars,

00:02:06.262 --> 00:02:09.366
Claire looks happy that her son has such a good friend.

00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:15.387
furthermore, Claire is also getting closer to Noah because they both love classic literature,

00:02:15.387 --> 00:02:23.835
Noah even gives her one of the first editions of a classic book which is said to be rare and expensive. Claire is immediately delighted here.

00:02:23.835 --> 00:02:30.667
One day, Kevin and his father are going to camp and spend the night in the forest, so Claire is alone at home now.

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:36.114
That night, Claire accidentally sees Noah from her window who was naked changing clothes.

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:38.749
Claire is feeling hot when she saw Noah's body,

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:44.018
but suddenly Noah turns around and She is shocked,
then she lefts with a smile on her face.

00:02:44.018 --> 00:02:47.986
Claire is ready to go on a date now, 
so she can move on from her husband,

00:02:47.986 --> 00:02:53.048
but unfortunately the man is rude and mocked Claire's job as not being very useful he said,

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:57.056
it turns out that Claire is a teacher who teaches classical literature lessons,

00:02:57.056 --> 00:03:01.646
after saying that, Claire gets angry and lefts from there.

00:03:01.646 --> 00:03:04.174
At home, Claire is really upset,

00:03:04.174 --> 00:03:10.848
But Suddenly Noah calls and says that he was cooking chicken,
but only part of the chicken is cooked, the other part is still raw.

00:03:10.848 --> 00:03:14.237
so he asks Claire to come over to his house to help him cook.

00:03:14.237 --> 00:03:19.655
So Claire comes to the house next door,  
Then she helps Noah to cook until they are eating together.

00:03:19.655 --> 00:03:23.359
At the dinner table, Noah can’t stop staring at Claire,

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.874
then he teases her by saying she's beautiful, cute, sexy,

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:28.738
Yeah Noah it's such a crocodile,

00:03:28.738 --> 00:03:31.894
Then Noah Touches Claire until Claire is feeling hot,

00:03:31.894 --> 00:03:33.743
but she says stop Noah stop,

00:03:33.743 --> 00:03:35.969
this is a mistake,

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:39.512
but Noah immediately kisses and takes off Claire's clothes,

00:03:39.512 --> 00:03:43.203
Claire can’t refuse him because she is feeling very very hot now.

00:03:43.203 --> 00:03:46.605
finally Noah manages to enjoy Claire’s bottom cave,

00:03:46.605 --> 00:03:50.446
Claire also enjoys making love with Noah until she feels satisfied,

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:52.771
the making love scene is really Amazing.

00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:56.235
In the morning,
Claire is shocked to wake up at Noah's house,

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.951
she rushes to go home but Noah forbids her,

00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:03.854
but Claire still insists on going home and says that last night's incident was just a mistake.

00:04:03.854 --> 00:04:08.030
Hearing that, Noah immediately gets angry and being really emotional.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.299
so Claire treats Noah's wounds,

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.748
but here Claire again said that last night was just a mistake, we can't continue this relationship.

00:04:15.748 --> 00:04:21.394
After Hearing that, Noah becomes even more disappointed and immediately kicks Claire out of his house.

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:29.230
Luckily Claire has returned to her house, because after that,
Kevin and his father have also returned home.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.246
When Claire is cooking,  suddenly she lost her focus when she finds out that Noah comes to her house.

00:04:35.246 --> 00:04:40.782
Claire's heart is beating fast here, But luckily Noah doesn't tell them what happened last night.

00:04:40.782 --> 00:04:47.372
After that, her husband tells Claire not to file for divorce because he wants to fix their household.

00:04:47.372 --> 00:04:51.865
The first day of school, Claire is teaching classical literature in her class,

00:04:51.865 --> 00:04:55.510
suddenly a new student comes, it turns out that it’s Noah,

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.757
Claire really surprises so she asks the principal why Noah is in her class?

00:04:59.757 --> 00:05:04.627
It turns out that Claire herself told the principal to send Noah to her class via email,

00:05:04.627 --> 00:05:05.728
what's the matter?

00:05:05.728 --> 00:05:11.829
It turns out that Noah is also good at hacking computers,
so Noah himself sent the email.

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:17.231
When Noah comes to invite Kevin to play, suddenly Claire tell Kevin to stay away from Noah,

00:05:17.231 --> 00:05:20.085
Noah hears them so finally he makes a plan.

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:26.028
He instigates Kevin to hate his father so that Kevin's father and mother don't get back together.

00:05:26.028 --> 00:05:32.466
While boxing, Noah continues to instigate him, Kevin finally panics and his allergies recur,

00:05:32.466 --> 00:05:36.250
fortunately Noah manages to inject Kevin's medicine,

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.952
it looks like Noah really cares about Kevin here and he doesn't want anything bad to go to Kevin

00:05:41.952 --> 00:05:46.720
The next day, at school, Claire got a flower delivery written from her husband,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.294
but when she calls her husband, it turns out that he wasn't the one who sent the flowers,

00:05:51.294 --> 00:05:55.710
Claire panics and realizes that the flowers must be from Noah.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.275
Then Claire goes to meet Noah,
Noah says that the flowers were for an apology.

00:06:00.275 --> 00:06:03.646
Because She doesn't want anything weird to happen again from Noah,

00:06:03.646 --> 00:06:06.989
Claire finally says, can we start over from the beginning?

00:06:06.989 --> 00:06:11.247
And Noah agrees and says yes, 
Finally they are together again,

00:06:11.247 --> 00:06:13.800
it seems that Noah is very happy here.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.521
Noah teaches Kevin to be confident again,
and finally Kevin manages to ask Allie out on a date.

00:06:20.521 --> 00:06:25.158
That night, Claire and her husband had just come home from a date until they are drunk,

00:06:25.158 --> 00:06:30.569
they both are feeling hot now, but suddenly Claire pushes her husband and says that she wasn't ready yet,

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:32.506
so they aren't making love here.

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:37.203
because he is too drunk to drive back to his home, her husband can't drive home,

00:06:37.203 --> 00:06:42.028
so finally she allows him to sleep on the sofa and stay at Claire's house that night.

00:06:42.028 --> 00:06:49.362
But on the other hand, Noah looks very angry and stressed because he sees Claire's husband's car still parked in front of her house.

00:06:49.362 --> 00:06:55.849
He misunderstands and thinks that Claire was making love and betrayed him, but actually she didn't do it.

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:01.188
The next day, when her husband came home,
Noah immediately came to scold Claire,

00:07:01.188 --> 00:07:03.938
they had a fight because of a misunderstanding last night,

00:07:03.938 --> 00:07:06.012
Noah says the war had started,

00:07:06.012 --> 00:07:07.110
get ready Claire.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.412
suddenly Kevin comes, and Claire tells Kevin to stay away from Noah,

00:07:11.412 --> 00:07:15.743
but Kevin fights back and then he chooses to go to school with Noah.

00:07:15.743 --> 00:07:22.382
At school, Kevin is almost bullied again,
luckily Noah comes and beats them until he passed out.

00:07:22.382 --> 00:07:26.839
Noah is called to the teacher's room named Vicky, Claire's best friend.

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:33.399
But it turns out that all of Vicky's dirty deeds are known to Noah, so Noah can easily escape from the teacher.

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:40.870
At night, Kevin dates with Allie at the school party,
Suddenly a student says that the school toilet was deadlocked,

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.748
so Claire goes to the toilet,

00:07:42.748 --> 00:07:46.950
and it turns out that Noah was already there,
then Noah locks Claire with him.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:53.264
This is where Noah's psychopathic nature begins to emerge,
he wants to explore Claire’s bottom cave again,

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:58.589
but Claire immediately kicks Noah's balls, then she runs away from there.

00:07:58.589 --> 00:08:03.141
When Claire wants to sleep, she hears the sound of making love from her window,

00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:07.416
it turns out that Noah was having fun in the bottom cave of the girl Kevin liked,

00:08:07.416 --> 00:08:10.423
the reason being that to make Claire jealous.

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:16.077
The next day, Noah terrorizes Claire by posting a photo of them making love in her classroom.

00:08:16.077 --> 00:08:20.990
Claire is very panicked and quickly cleans up the photo before the students enter the classroom.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:26.692
After school, Kevin is picked up by his father,
this time Kevin is allowed to drive the car,

00:08:26.692 --> 00:08:31.286
now because Kevin starts to hate his father as the result of being incited by Noah,

00:08:31.286 --> 00:08:34.686
finally Kevin get emotional and drives the car recklessly,

00:08:34.686 --> 00:08:38.408
suddenly when he almost hit the car, apparently the brakes failed,

00:08:38.408 --> 00:08:42.242
but luckily Kevin manages to survive the accident.

00:08:42.242 --> 00:08:50.948
When she returns home, Claire is shocked because her husband's car was damaged and even more shocked when she sees Noah is already in the house.

00:08:50.948 --> 00:08:55.990
Noah teases Claire and tells her to come to see her later that night in the room,

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.098
Noah wants to explore Claire’s bottom cave again.

00:08:59.098 --> 00:09:04.582
In the room, Noah is very obsessed with Claire,
he says that he would not let Claire go,

00:09:04.582 --> 00:09:06.345
basically Noah must have Claire,

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:10.440
but Claire wants to end their relationship,
when Noah wants to kiss Claire,

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.889
Claire immediately slaps him and left there,

00:09:13.889 --> 00:09:18.067
thus making the soul Noah's psychopath is becoming more and more.

00:09:18.067 --> 00:09:21.009
The next day, Claire asks for Vicky's help,

00:09:21.009 --> 00:09:28.961
Vicky pretends to be driving Claire's car so Noah will follow her,
while Claire goes to Noah's house to delete their making love video.

00:09:28.961 --> 00:09:33.435
Long story short, Claire finds a basement that contains all of her photos,

00:09:33.435 --> 00:09:36.587
she also manages to delete the video on Noah's laptop,

00:09:36.587 --> 00:09:44.438
besides that she also finds a file where Noah himself damaged the brakes of his parents' car, causing them to die in an accident.

00:09:44.438 --> 00:09:52.440
After deleting the video, it turns out that on the other hand Noah actually beats Vicky until he faints and holds her back.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.631
Then Noah calls Claire using Vicky's cellphone, so Claire comes to Vicky's house.

00:09:57.631 --> 00:10:05.984
When Claire enters Vicky's house,  suddenly Vicky's body falls from the roof which shocked Claire and immediately calls 911.

00:10:05.984 --> 00:10:10.057
Not having time to speak, suddenly Noah comes and drags Claire,

00:10:10.057 --> 00:10:15.137
Noah also calms Claire by saying this is all for you,
I love you very much Claire.

00:10:15.137 --> 00:10:17.369
Then he takes Claire to a warehouse,

00:10:17.369 --> 00:10:20.299
where her husband and Kevin are already tied up there.

00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:24.328
Kevin also tells his mother to take the iron and hit Noah's head right away.

00:10:24.328 --> 00:10:27.558
But when Claire wants to untie the rope that bound Kevin,

00:10:27.558 --> 00:10:32.014
suddenly Noah gets back up and drags Claire and pushes her away.

00:10:32.014 --> 00:10:36.355
Noah also takes gasoline and sets fire to the warehouse,

00:10:36.355 --> 00:10:42.521
when the warehouse starts to burn, luckily his husband manages to escape the bond and immediately slams Noah,

00:10:42.521 --> 00:10:46.942
but apparently Noah has a gun, so He shoots him straight away.

00:10:46.942 --> 00:10:49.138
When Noah wants to go with Claire,

00:10:49.138 --> 00:10:53.239
suddenly Claire takes out Kevin's injection drug and stabs it into Noah's eye,

00:10:54.878 --> 00:11:00.701
after that, it is plugged in again with Claire's finger,
but Noah isn't dead yet,

00:11:00.701 --> 00:11:05.210
when Noah wants to shoot Claire,
Kevin comes and hits Noah from behind.

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:09.200
Until finally Noah is framed and she drops an iron ballast to crush him.

00:11:11.334 --> 00:11:13.058
and now he has died.

00:11:13.058 --> 00:11:17.321
Finally Kevin, Claire and her husband manage to survive the terrible incident,

00:11:17.321 --> 00:11:19.828
and they return to being a whole happy family.
