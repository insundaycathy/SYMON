Welcome To Movie Recall. In Today's video,
we will be going through the 2021 science

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.910
fiction, action movie “Free Guy”.
The Movie Shows Ryan Reynolds Aka Deadpool

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.219
As A Non Playable Character In Open-world
Video Game Where He Has Powers Same As Avengers

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.570
Captain America And Hulk.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.000
It's Time To Recall.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.240
Let's Get Started.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.949
Turn On Subtitles and Spoilers Ahead!

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.200
Have you ever played or heard of Grand Theft
Auto or GTA? The movie takes place in an open-world

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.039
desktop video game called Free City, where
players can take part in action-packed missions

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.289
like spy jobs or bank robberies in order to
gain money and level up their characters.

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.699
The strongest characters in the game are obviously
the ones with sunglasses because they are

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.250
controlled by real players. To support the
storyline of the game, the developer also

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.850
created non-playable characters or we call
it NPC. An NPC is a character that is not

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.230
controlled by a real player, instead it is
programmed to do certain daily activities

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.120
in the game. And of course, an NPC cannot
die.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.230
Among the many non-playable characters in
the game, there is Guy, a NPC who is programmed

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.250
to be a bank teller in the game and unaware
that his world is a video game. He works and

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.670
spends most of his time with his best friend
Buddy, who works as security in the bank.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.960
The pair works in the bank that will always
be robbed by real players and they always

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.990
have to play the part of helpless bank employees
as they get robbed.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.570
On the other side, there is a sunglasses character
called Molotov Girl, who is making a deal

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.650
with another player for a coordinate of a
safe house that keeps a video that contains

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.740
top secret information. Later on, as Guy and
Buddy on their way to home, they suddenly

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.810
walk past her. Guy seems surprised as she
sings the song he says his dream girl will

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.649
like. He comments on the song, which surprises
the girl because she is used to hearing all

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.600
the phrases each NPC has to say. Because of
that, Guy begins to deviate from his programming

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.460
and follows where The Molotov Girl goes. But
unfortunately, he is hit by a train, sending

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.509
him back to his home and having to start his
boring daily activities again.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.790
The next day, when the robbery takes place
in the bank, Guy sees the girl he met yesterday

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.430
and starts to rebel. He tries to fight back
and manages to grab the sunglasses from the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.349
robber. When he puts them on, he finally discovers
many features of the game that supposedly

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.500
only appear to real players. He sees a first
aid kit floating. He casually goes near the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.820
kit and looks at a businessman sitting next
to it. Guy points to what looks like nothing

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.629
And Ask him if he can see it. the businessman
looks at him like he's crazy and walks off.

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.890
Guy takes off the sungalsses and the kit isn't
there. Puts them back on and it is still there,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.300
clear as day. He touches the first aid and
the kit disappears with a glowing light floats

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.730
up his body healing all his wounds. While
Walking guy sees a dead player and sees money

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.099
floating. Guy appraches the stack of money
and touches it. And the money status bar on

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.530
his glassess jumps by two thousand dollars.
Guy Goes to the ATM and checks his balance.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.510
Sure enough - he has TWO THOUSAND more dollars
in his account than he did few minutes ago.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.739
In the real world, Keys and Mouser, who work
at Soonami, a company that runs Free City,

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.799
detect Guy's weird activities and suspect
that he is a hacker who uses NPC skin to take

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.500
down other players. To resolve the problem,
they decide to go into the game as their avatars

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.920
to confront Guy. Then they enter the game
and meets guy who has brought his favourite

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.310
shoes with huge amount of money. As they closes
in Guy runs deep into the construction site

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.800
and they follows him. Then guy notices a button
on his new shoes which can help him jump far.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.370
Then he presses the button and use it to go
far from them. At first time he loses his

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.330
balance because it was his first time. And
he does not know how to control it, and the

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.720
same time the police and rabbit was closing
in and starts to fire at him. Guy tries to

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.230
run away from there and he learns to control
the shoes. He jumps to the highest level of

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.800
the building. Unfortunately his shoes battey
is out. They keep chasing after him. Guy tries

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.790
to escape by grabbing onto a wrecking ball,
but he misses and falls. Luckily, he manages

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.230
to save himself with a bubble suit. However,
The employees find him and hit him with the

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.630
police car, thinking they have taken the “hacker
out for good. Keys feels something strange

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.390
as the number of online players did not change
even after they killed him, indicating that

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.020
it wasn't a hacker.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.650
Suddenly, an interview of Keys with Millie
in earlier years is displayed, discovering

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.630
Keys and Millie are the masterminds behind
the Free City before Antwan, owner of Soonami

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.980
Company, stole their original code from Life
Itself game - a game which was originally

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.270
developed by Keys and Millie - and used that
code to build Free City franchises. Surprisingly,

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.770
Millie is the player behind The Molotov Girl
character. Millie visits Keys and asks him

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.880
to help her get evidence of Antwan's crimes
because she knows the proof of their stolen

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.100
code is hidden in a safe house, which she
is going to infiltrate while playing as Molotov

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.100
Girl.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.380
Later on, Guy approaches Molotov Girl outside
the safe house. The house guards spot them

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.850
and start shooting at them, so they have to
flee. Guy offers to help her in her mission,

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.620
but it is impossible as he is only at level
1, while she is already at level 195. Guys

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.610
then starts taking on missions and pulls off
several heroic acts like returning stolen

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.050
money and pulling kids away from traffic.
Because of his uniqueness, players in real

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.380
life start to notice him and Guy suddenly
goes viral with his unique nickname called

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.800
“The Blue Shirt Guy”. He even shows up
as an answer on one of America's Quiz Show,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.620
Jeopardy. Long story short, he manages to
reach level 102.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.500
The next day, Guy comes to the bank and persuades
Buddy to join him after stealing sunglasses

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.060
from a player who is doing a heist mission
at the bank, but Buddy refuses to do so because

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.280
he thinks it is too dangerous. Antwan realizes
the popularity of Guy and wants his employees

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.670
to keep Guy on the game. Additionally, The
company is also going to launch Free City

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:55.040
2 in two days, despite not being fully coded
and still contains bugs, and he makes it worse

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.330
by telling Keys that the game is not backward
compatible with the first game, meaning that

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.280
most of the characters will not be able to
be played in the Free City 2.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.680
The Molotov Girl goes back to the safe house
and manages to take the stolen code. But,

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.800
she is confronted by the house's guards and
gets cornered. Out of nowhere, suddenly Guy

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.860
crashes through on a motorcycle and helps
her to eliminate the guards before escaping

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.630
by using a hang glider. After the event, the
two hang out and Guy surprisingly manages

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.200
to guess The Molotov Girl's favourite ice
cream flavour, which is bubblegum ice cream.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.380
She is impressed because nobody likes that
flavour and he manages to guess it right.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.110
It's just like Guy knows everything about
this Molotov Girl. They end up kissing before

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.680
Millie disconnects from the game. Keys finally
realizes there is something strange about

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.220
the codes of the Free City's NPCs. He tells
Millie that Guy is not controlled by a hacker,

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.790
instead he is the first living AI which could
be able to decide his own path.This proves

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.280
that Antwan has stolen their code and implemented
it to the Free City, because their main idea

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.070
for the game was to have the NPCs grow and
develop over time as they adapt, and that

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.980
is what Guy has been doing recently. He also
warns Millie that the current world of Free

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.740
City will be completely erased when the Free
City 2 is launched, which is 48 hours from

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.270
now. Thus, they decide to ask Guy's help.
Millie goes back to the game as Molotov Girl.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.280
She reveals to Guy that he is just a character
in a video game who does not exist in real

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.890
life and he will be completely deleted if
he doesn't help Millie. After knowing the

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:28.270
truth, Guy feels so sad and runs to the beach.
There, he realizes that something is hidden

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.490
behind the beach and he decides to help the
Molotov Girl.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.620
Guy then asks Buddy to go with him to the
safe house, where the stolen code is kept.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.900
But surprisingly, the guard`s real player
is a big fan of Guy and is very excited to

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:45.060
meet him. He basically lets Guy rob him and
take what he wants, even asking Guy to kill

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:50.760
him, but Guy refuses the request. He later
brings the file to Millie. On the other hand,

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:56.180
Guy's popularity has risen sharply, even popular
streamers in real life like Poki mane, Dan

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:01.160
TDM and Ninja are talking about him! Knowing
about that, Antwan gets pissed off and thinks

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.840
that Guy's presence in the game will hurt
the Free City 2's sales.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.531
Mouser suggests to reboot the system, so that
Guy will get back to its default form. In

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:13.800
the game, Guy and Millie manage to access
the file, showing an island which proves that

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.500
Antwan really stole their code. Guy claims
that he has seen this island, but doesnt remember

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.320
when or where. The game then is successfully
rebooted before he can tell where he saw it

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.550
to Millie.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.500
Millie manages to get back into the game after
the reboot, but Guy doesn't remember who she

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:34.280
is as he is already back to his default setting.
She asks Keys for help, and he tells her that

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.400
Guy is created to always be searching for
his dream girl, and he just needs something

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.700
to help trigger the code. Molotov Girl decides
to kiss Guy and it brings back all his memories,

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.930
including where he saw the island. It turns
out that the image of it is reflected off

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:52.590
the blinds in his apartment. Because of that,
Keys figures out that the island is just hidden

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:57.180
beyond the city's horizon. Guy and Millie
then gather all the NPCs in the game and tell

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.260
them that there is an island across the city
that allows them to move and act freely instead

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.960
of what they were coded to do. The speech
inspires all the NPCs and they start to move

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.890
at their own will.
With all the NPCs gone, the players are left

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:14.740
confused. Mouser then shows Antwan a recording
of Guy and Millie taking the secret file at

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.310
the safe house. Antwan then realizes that
Millie is involved and orders Mouser to kill

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:24.220
them and kick them out from the game. Mouser
uses his power as the game developer to destroy

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:30.040
Guy and Millie as Guy is driving them outside
the city. With the help of Keys, a ramp suddenly

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.370
pops out and they manage to escape. They arrive
at the beach, but Keys gets caught and fired

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:40.810
from the company. Before he leaves Antwan
room, Keys launches his last help to the pair.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:45.710
He creates a bridge for them so that they
can cross the sea safely. On the other side,

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.990
Antwan orders Mouser to boot the game, which
disconnects Molotov Girl and all the players

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:54.920
from the game, but Keys secretly conducts
a live broadcasting of Guy to all Free City

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.670
players, so that they can still be able to
watch him despite being disconnected from

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:04.840
the game. Furthermore, Antwan also commands
his employees to deploy DUDE, a bigger, stronger,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.850
but dumber version of Guy who is not fully
programmed, but it is the final weapon of

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:14.500
Antwan to get rid of Guy. Buddy arrives to
help while Guy gets tossed around by DUDE.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.020
Before receiving the final blow, Guy manages
to pick up sunglasses and deploy a Captain

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:24.080
America's shield, which surprises Chris Evans
who is watching it live in a cafe. He also

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.800
manages to deploy a Hulk's fist, and a lightsaber.
However, Dude is too strong and keeps beating

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.720
Guy until he puts the glasses on Dude, who
now is able to see the world as Guy does and

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.160
starts dancing randomly.
Guy and Buddy then start running toward the

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.710
island. Antwan starts to lose it and brings
Mouser to the server room, where he plans

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.950
to destroy the server and delete the game
entirely. Mouser stops helping Antwan when

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:51.910
he figures out that Antwan was really stealing
the code from Keys, so Antwan begins to destroy

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:57.960
everything with an axe, causing the city environment
to be deleted, including the bridge. Unfortunately,

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.900
Buddy can't make it to the end and is deleted
from the game, but he tells Guy that he has

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:06.370
had the best day of his life because of Guy.
Guy runs and finally breaks through the barriers

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:10.650
and makes it to the island, which is then
revealed to all the NPCs and the players in

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.670
the real world.
Millie then confronts Antwan in the server

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.810
room and makes a deal with him. She will let
Antwan keep the Free City name for sequels

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:22.530
and spin-offs, but Antwan has to let her have
the original code of the game and stop destroying

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:27.900
the server. Soon, Free City 2 is launched,
but the sales slump because of numerous bugs

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:32.390
and lagging online play, resulting in Antwan
being kicked out from the company. On the

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:37.970
other side, Millie, Keys and Mouser develop
Free Life which brings all NPCs from Free

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.090
City to there. Millie then watches a recording
of Keys explaining that Guy's character is

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:46.270
always going to fall in love with Molotov
Girl because he created the algorithm based

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:51.780
on Keys own love to Millie. She realizes this
and decides to approach Keys and kiss him.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.520
Back in the game, Guy and Dude finally become
friends and surprisingly Buddy is brought

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.220
back to life in the game and they reunite.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.520
