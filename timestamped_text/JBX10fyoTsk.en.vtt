Hi folks, welcome back to Movie Shortens.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.609
Follow us today to a movie titled: Curve.

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.349
Be aware, there are spoilers!

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:12.330
On an SUV, Mallory is driving alone to Denver
for her wedding rehearsal.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.710
On the way, she stops for a rest, looking
at the ring on her hand and becoming deep

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.710
in thought.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.289
Just then, she facetimes with her sister,
Ella, who tells Mallory that she hasn't bought

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.060
her plane tickets yet.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.760
Ella wants to make sure Mallory is truly in
love and happy with her decision.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.000
Mallory reluctantly responds by telling her
sister that she is happy and hangs up.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.110
She continues to drive while listening to
her fiance’s voice messages about his tight

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.330
business schedule.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.760
He wants her to make sure she’ll be at the
church on time tomorrow, which upsets Mallory.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.940
As she meets a T-road, she decides to turn
left to visit the Scenic Canyon Pass instead

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.010
of heading to Denver.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.370
Just now, Mallory looks so carefree and happy
while enjoying some road trip music.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.690
After a few minutes, the car suddenly alarms
for some engine errors.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.810
The girl has to pull over to take a look by
herself.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.909
After checking the oil, Mallory tries to start
the car but fails.

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.950
She then makes a phone call for the car service
but there is no signal.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.060
She gets back in the car and accidentally
stains her shirt when having a soft drink.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.020
While Mallory changes her clothes in the back
of the car, she is startled by a hitchhiker

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.710
named Christian.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.060
Realizing the car breaks down, he offers to
fix it.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.509
Surprisingly, Christian can get the car started.

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.579
Mallory suggests paying the young man for
the help but he refuses.

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.319
Mallory gets in the car and drives off after
thanking Christian.

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:35.179
However, feeling guilty, she stops and offers
the man a ride, thinking that he seems nice

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:36.179
enough.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.539
The two share their lives with each other,
saying sometimes it is easier with a stranger.

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.889
Just then, Mallory realizes there is something
very odd about Christian as he keeps talking

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:48.259
about the fate that brought them together
in the same car.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.990
What’s worse, he continues to make some
bad jokes about his body parts, which disgusts

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.990
her.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.090
Mallory gets angry and sends him away, only
to learn that he has a knife in the bag.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.829
She is forced to keep on driving while Christian
claims that it was meant to happen like this.

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.390
The man commands Mallory to get to a little
motel down the road, which has been abandoned

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.440
for years.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.810
She then notices that Christian doesn’t
fasten the seatbelt.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.920
Taking this chance, Mallory decides to speed
towards a guardrail near a curve, attempting

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.920
to kill him.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.820
However, Christian realizes it and tries to
stop her, but the car plunges off the cliff

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.820
at the end.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.540
Mallory wakes up and finds herself upside
down in the car with cuts all over the body.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.030
She manages to unlock the seat belt, just
to realize the car’s trapped at the bottom

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.170
of a ravine, and her leg ensnared in the wreckage
of her SUV.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.031
Looking towards Christian, who’s slowly
gaining consciousness, Mallory leans for the

00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:43.330
knife nearby.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.850
However, he tells her that it was good to
know each other and leaves her there alone.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.530
Mallory desperately shouts out and beeps the
horn for help but nobody is around in the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.800
middle of an isolated ravine.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.150
When the night comes, she attempts to pull
the leg out, but it just keeps bleeding when

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.150
she takes efforts.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.100
Shaking from the cold, she puts on the hoodie
and drinks the last drops in the bottle.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.530
Suddenly, there is some noise seemingly from
wild animals.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.202
Mallory turns on the car’s light to send
them away during the night.

00:03:13.202 --> 00:03:14.202
Luckily, there is no dangerous ones at that
time.

00:03:14.202 --> 00:03:17.520
The following morning, Christian comes back
and lets her know that he found a cabin nearby

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.520
the night before.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.650
He confronts her about the reason she drove
off the road.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.420
He then asks if it was because she was afraid
he would rape her, smearing the girl that

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.910
she must have read too much stories.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.940
Mallory doesn't answer his questions and only
asks for some water and food.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.250
The psychopath will give her food provided
that she shares about her first time of making

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.250
love.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.850
As Mallory mentions about her first love Theo
and their fun times, Christian keeps asking

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.000
more and more sick questions.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.700
However, in the last one, Christian changes
his mind, saying that Mallory only fantasizes

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.900
about Theo.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.720
He abandons her again without giving her food
as promised.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.750
Another night arrives, Mallory gives up on
waiting.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.660
She writes some notes for her sister Ella
that she loves her and the name of the psychopath

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.650
in case someone found her.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.950
Turning on the heat in the car, she realizes
it is not warm enough.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.240
Mallory burns out some garbage outside of
the car to keep herself warm instead, eventually

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.170
even throwing the bridal veil to the fire.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.829
She has no regret for doing that and finds
it relief in fact.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.639
While sleeping, she is annoyed by some of
the rats.

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.460
Terrified, she smashes one of them with the
car key.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.180
Later, Mallory decides to eat the rat as she
has been starving for two day long.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.280
She uses the knife and cuts open the dead
rat, taking some slices of meat and grills

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.280
it in fire.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.599
Finally, Mallory has little food in her stomach.

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.400
The next day, the phone vibration wakes her
up.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.270
She attempts to take the phone back with a
wooden stick, but soon is interrupted by Christian

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.270
again.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.449
Mallory quickly hides the phone away and pretends
to listen to his story.

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.289
The man shares that he has spent the night
tormenting the family who owns the cabin.

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:54.999
Christian is impressed seeing Mallory has
started to fight for her life after seeing

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:57.990
the dead rat, saying he is proud of her.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.779
Suddenly, the phone vibrates again.

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.990
The psychopath storms in and fights with Mallory
to take it back.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.500
He then trembles the phone in pieces and leaves
her again.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.240
Before that, he tells her that he will not
kill her, he only enjoys her escape efforts.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.009
He then gives her a hand saw.

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.509
Mallory says she can’t cut the door with
it, but he tells her he doesn’t mean that.

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.249
She soon realizes he wants her to cut off
her leg, or else she’ll die of bleeding

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:24.189
out and decaying leg.

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:28.810
When Mallory asks why he treats her like this,
she also mentions the photos in his wallet,

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:29.810
which was a happy family of Christian.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.870
He says it was a fake photo he uses to lure
people like her.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.650
After that, Mallory tries to enlarge the seat
by the saw, but it only works for some second

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.990
and breaks apart.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.939
She then uses the saw blade only to cut her
leg, and finds herself helpless as she couldn’t

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:44.939
make it.

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:48.590
As being dehydrated, Mallory has no choice
but to drink from her own urine, which is

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.629
apparently not easy to swallow.

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:54.499
A moment later, a huge rain comes, relieving
the girl a lot.

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:57.259
She takes this chance to drink as much as
she can from the rain water.

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:59.690
After that, she sees a car light up on the
road.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.960
She tries to call them for help, but it turns
out to be Christian.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.249
She thinks of an idea to use the dead rat’s
blood and smears it around her trapped leg.

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:12.779
When Christian checks on her, thinking she
is dead, he enters the car and realizes this

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:13.779
is a trick.

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.080
However, Mallory immediately attacks him with
the knife.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.680
Christian luckily survives but Mallory steals
his car key while the two fight.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.620
She triggers his car’s siren and throws
the key away, which he can’t find.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.279
He rushes up to the car parking to stop the
alarm with a knife.

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:32.749
At that time, a police car approaches and
asks if he needs a tow as the weather is getting

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:33.749
worse.

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:38.159
Christian lies that he left the key inside
the car so he might need a ride to a cabin

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:39.159
nearby.

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:41.590
The police officer is happy and willing to
help him.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.909
Meanwhile, Mallory tries her hardest to draw
the police’s attention with her flashlight

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:47.090
and the car horn.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.969
When the cop says he hears someone calling
for help.

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:53.669
Christian tells the police that he doesn’t
hear anything and the rainstorm hits so bad

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:54.789
if they don’t hurry.

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:59.129
The cop reluctantly agrees and leaves with
the psychopath.

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:02.449
As the rain pours badly, a flash flood wipes
out the valley.

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:06.620
Mallory decides to amputate her leg before
drowning in the car.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.069
However, she can’t do it by herself.

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:11.460
Just then, the car is swept away by the flood.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.580
This fortunately allows her leg to get rid
of the seat.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.789
She swims towards the shore and escapes from
the car.

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:21.090
Her left leg is badly injured and has no feeling
now.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.900
She relies on a stick to keep walking.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.069
As she walks by a house, she hears a woman
calling for help from inside.

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:31.300
Although injured, she crawls along the house
to check on the woman.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.610
She comes across a bear trap, but luckily
she can avoid it.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.460
She realizes this is the cabin where Christian
mentioned earlier.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.199
She finds the owners dead on the bed, and
the girl is their daughter.

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:45.939
When she hears some male’s voices, she learns
that it is the cop earlier.

00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:50.849
She witnesses him killing the police officer
and keeping the girl, Katie, as a hostage.

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:54.889
When Christian gets to the second floor with
Katie, Mallory sneaks into the house and takes

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:56.419
the gun from the cop.

00:07:56.419 --> 00:08:01.820
Later, she waits until the man leaves so she
can rescue Katie, who is held captive on her

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.820
bed.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.539
Hearing the noise in the room, Christian storms
in and confronts the poor girl.

00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:10.960
Hiding behind the door, Mallory opens fire
at the man, but fails due to being scared.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.809
She then tells Katie to leave while fighting
with Christian alone.

00:08:13.809 --> 00:08:16.550
She struggles to deal with the killer until
she pushes him off the balcony.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:22.509
Mallory and Katie both come to check on Christian,
finding him wounded by the bear trap.

00:08:22.509 --> 00:08:27.499
She then gives him the same chance as he used
to do with her by throwing a knife to him.

00:08:27.499 --> 00:08:32.229
Mallory also mentions about fate and things
supposed to happen like this after all.

00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:37.680
Katie helps Mallory get out of the cabin while
Christian gradually dies from the injuries.
