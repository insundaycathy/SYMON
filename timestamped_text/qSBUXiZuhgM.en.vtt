00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.480
Welcome back to Movie Recaps. Today&nbsp;
I will show you an action, sci-fi,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.440
thriller film from 2012, titled Lockout.&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.520
The year is 2079. Our protagonist,&nbsp;
former CIA agent Snow, is being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.200
interrogated at a prison in Washington DC&nbsp;
by Secret Service director Scott Langral.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.960
Langral wants to know what happened in&nbsp;
that room in New York with the colonel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.280
but every time he asks, Snow replies with a&nbsp;
joke, earning him many punches from an officer.&nbsp;

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.400
We then get a flashback: it's Snow in a&nbsp;
motel room, being choked by a mysterious man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.120
Since Snow keeps trying to fight back, the man&nbsp;
pushes him onto the table, where we see Snow's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.880
phone getting a call from his friend Mace.&nbsp;
Snow headbutts the man to get him off him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.600
but quickly turns around to continue the fight.&nbsp;
Both men push and punch around the room until Snow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.000
manages to steal a gun and shoots the attacker,&nbsp;
who falls to the floor next to two other bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.560
Snow finally picks up his phone - Mace tells him&nbsp;
he's been double-crossed and he needs to get out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.040
immediately. He crouches next to the body of the&nbsp;
colonel, who hands him his lighter and asks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.120
not to let them take "this". Snow looks at&nbsp;
the briefcase lying on the floor nearby and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.760
says it's ok before the colonel passes away.&nbsp;
Then Snow moves to pick up the briefcase, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.560
various noises and lights alert him the police has&nbsp;
arrived. After tricking the cops with a mattress,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.720
Snow hits them and leaves the room to get to the&nbsp;
roof where he has no other choice but to jump.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.960
He hits the ground and the briefcase lands right&nbsp;
next to him; he grabs it and starts running away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.360
just as the police catch up with him. Suddenly he&nbsp;
comes across a bike that he doesn't hesitate to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.840
steal. Now the chasing has moved to the highway,&nbsp;
where Mace calls Snow to tell him to meet him on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.240
the subway and asks him to drop the phone since&nbsp;
they're using it to track him. Snow does exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.800
that right as the helicopter that followed him&nbsp;
explodes. When the subway station comes into view,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.360
Snow just keeps driving the bike inside and&nbsp;
jumps off it before the bike falls on the rails.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.280
He runs through the station and makes it to&nbsp;
platform ten just as the train is about to leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.440
so he throws the briefcase through to doors right&nbsp;
before they close for his buddy Mace to catch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.840
The cops use that moment to capture him.
We return to the present then, where Snow is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.080
finishing telling his story. Langral mentions they&nbsp;
had the colonel under surveillance because he had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.080
been selling secrets about the space programs,&nbsp;
but as far as Snow knows, the colonel had been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.640
protecting them. Langral accuses Snow of having&nbsp;
killed the colonel, and when Snow denies it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.720
he shows him a very short clip of the motel&nbsp;
room: Snow is shooting a gun right behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.200
the colonel and the colonel falls to the floor,&nbsp;
hurt. Snow says that's not what happened, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.400
Labral replies he saw it with his own eyes. More&nbsp;
questions keep coming, which Snow still refuses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.680
to answer as a new officer enters the room: Harry&nbsp;
Shaw. Shaw changes places with Langral and offers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.520
his help, Snow asks him to pick something&nbsp;
up for him that he last saw on the train.&nbsp;

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.760
Another flashback begins and we see Mace get off&nbsp;
the train, followed by a visit to the station&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.080
lockers where he hides the briefcase. When a&nbsp;
cop finds the keycard he forgot on the lock,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.240
he walks away anxiously and bumps into another&nbsp;
person, making him drop his gun which goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.560
off on the floor and hurts a cop. A different&nbsp;
officer shoots Mace in return and captures him.&nbsp;

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.560
Back in the interrogation room, Shaw&nbsp;
asks Snow who was his backup guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.200
Snow says aloud that he won't tell because Shaw&nbsp;
would take it to his boss, but on the table, using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.240
cigarette ash, he writes down Mace's name. Shaw&nbsp;
ends the conversation after cleaning the ash off.&nbsp;

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.280
We cut to the First Daughter, Emilie Warnock,&nbsp;
who is in a spaceship flying through orbit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.680
together with her bodyguard Hock and her aide&nbsp;
Kathryn. There are also police officers traveling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.760
with them, including prison warden Barnes,&nbsp;
who offers a quick briefing. The group is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.640
about to visit the MS One, a maximum-security&nbsp;
space penitentiary that has been tested on 500&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.040
prisoners without incidents. Once they're properly&nbsp;
open for business, they'll be able to rent space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.720
to five hundred thousand criminals with all&nbsp;
countries signed up but overseen by the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.440
Barnes explains the MS One is the only prison&nbsp;
in existence without abuse or riots because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.360
they put the prisoners to sleep, and that's&nbsp;
what worries Emilie. There had been reports&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.200
of the after-effects the stasis leaves on&nbsp;
the mind, like dementia, but Barnes says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.240
the press made it all up. He also explains that&nbsp;
the defense system is automatic and well-armed.&nbsp;

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.320
They make it inside then. After the visitors&nbsp;
are put through the standard procedure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.400
they take the elevator to the third floor.&nbsp;
Emilie asks Barnes if the real purpose of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.240
this prison is to test the effects of deep&nbsp;
space exploration on humans, Barnes says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.720
he's just an employee and doesn't know anything.
Barnes takes the visitors to see the prisoners&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.720
sleeping in their stasis capsules and informs&nbsp;
them they've prepared an interview room for them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.080
but they can't take weapons there. Hock keeps&nbsp;
one hidden under his pants anyway. Back on Earth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.640
Snow is being held at a detention center. Langral&nbsp;
visits him to inform him he's been convicted to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.960
the MS One. He's then dragged to the procedure&nbsp;
room to be injected with some kind of drug.&nbsp;

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.200
Meanwhile, in the MS One, Emilie is introduced to&nbsp;
Hydell, a deranged prisoner. She tries to ask him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.280
questions but he won't take her seriously; Hock&nbsp;
doesn't like it and to make him behave, he pushes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.480
his head on the table. Hydel uses this chance to&nbsp;
steal his hidden gun. After pushing Hock away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.920
he shoots a section of the wall that causes&nbsp;
an explosion that hits everyone in the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.080
and knocks Hock unconscious. Unshaken,&nbsp;
Hydel shoots the chains on his ankles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.760
to free himself then goes after Emilie,&nbsp;
who is already running out of the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.160
He manages to shoot her leg, but she closes a set&nbsp;
of doors between them that allows her to escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.880
We briefly are shown a different ship belonging&nbsp;
to the LOPD, Low Orbit Police Department,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.040
and their alarms are already alerting them&nbsp;
of the fire in the MS One. Back to Emilie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.800
she is entering the control room and telling&nbsp;
a scientist to hide before doing so herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.280
Hydell enters the room as well and threatens the&nbsp;
scientist with his gun, demanding to know where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.000
Emilie is. The scientist is confused and the&nbsp;
lack of answer angers Hydell, who throws him on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.640
top of some buttons and accidentally activates&nbsp;
the control room. Realizing what this means,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.880
he grabs the scientist and makes him free all&nbsp;
the prisoners from their stasis capsules. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.880
shoots him when it's done then pretends to leave&nbsp;
the room, only to surprise Emilie seconds later.&nbsp;

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.440
The released prisoners are rioting all&nbsp;
over the place. In a particular capsule,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.440
there's Alex, Hydell's brother, who pretends&nbsp;
to still be asleep when guards pass by,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.760
only to jump on them from behind, knock them&nbsp;
out and steal their weapons. Meanwhile, in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.400
the interrogation room, Hock wakes up and realizes&nbsp;
what's happened, so he sends a message to Langral.&nbsp;

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.200
Back in the control room, Hydell is grabbing&nbsp;
Emilie and putting her on the table to abuse her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.040
but Alex -who's become the leader of a small&nbsp;
band of prisoners- arrives and stops him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.680
since they'll need as many&nbsp;
hostages as possible to negotiate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.080
At that moment, the LOPD tries to reach out to&nbsp;
them through the communication channels, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.720
Alex realizes they're being approached by police&nbsp;
spaceships. Hydell brings another scientist over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.040
to make him activate the security system and he&nbsp;
can't stop himself from pressing the big button,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.920
causing the prison ship to fire at the cops.
In the meantime, Langral and Shaw are visiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.160
President Jeff Warnock at the White House again&nbsp;
to inform him of what's happening at the MS One.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.000
Warnock worries about his daughter and they tell&nbsp;
him they know she's fine thanks to her telemetry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.960
which is a little machine connected to&nbsp;
her body that keeps track of her health.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.360
Langral wants to send special forces, but&nbsp;
Shaw first wants to know how to proceed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.840
because sending in soldiers would equal losing&nbsp;
Emilie. He offers an alternate plan: sending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.040
just one man with a very specific order. We cut to&nbsp;
Snow then, who is refusing to participate in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.440
plan to save the president's daughter. But when&nbsp;
Shaw secretly tells him Mace is in the prison,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.080
Snow changes his mind and accepts the deal. Shaw&nbsp;
returns the colonel's lighter to him as thanks.&nbsp;

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.920
In the MS One, all hostages are put together in&nbsp;
a room and their IDs are taken by the prisoners.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.560
When Emilie shows signs of&nbsp;
being cold, Kathryn hands her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.520
a lab coat that is hanging nearby to wear.
Back on Earth, Snow, Langral and Shaw board&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.480
a space shuttle and go over the plan. Snow is told&nbsp;
about the telemetry and about a scape pod on level&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.200
five that he'll use to escape, a map is given to&nbsp;
him to find it. He's also given some explosives.&nbsp;

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.640
In the prison ship, Alex's hand gets hurt in a&nbsp;
fight, so he asks for a doctor. One of his men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.880
goes to the hostage room, where Emilie is&nbsp;
having her leg wound bandaged by Kathryn.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.040
Seeing her wearing the coat, he thinks she's&nbsp;
a doctor and grabs her to take her to Alex.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.680
Emilie plays along and works on patching him up.
Snow, Langral and Shaw make it to the LOPD&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.080
spaceship and Langral takes over. An officer&nbsp;
tells him Alex has demanded a negotiator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.120
Langral tries to talk to&nbsp;
Alex, but he's hanged up on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.000
At least they got to see Emilie next to him and&nbsp;
since Alex didn't mention her, Snow arrives to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.320
conclusion that the prisoners don't know she's the&nbsp;
president's daughter. The feed is suddenly back on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.560
and Alex appears on the screen, telling them they&nbsp;
have a little demonstration: they take Barnes and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.200
release him into space to die. Alex tells the&nbsp;
agents there will be another "show" in an hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.880
Langral will try to negotiate with the&nbsp;
prisoners, Shaw tells Snow he'll go anyway.&nbsp;

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.640
While Snow looks for a way in, a cop is sent to&nbsp;
the MS One as negotiator. He speaks with Alex&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.160
privately and convinces him that releasing&nbsp;
at least one hostage is the best way to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.360
When Alex accepts, the officer tells him the&nbsp;
hostage should be a wounded woman, so Alex chooses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.160
Emilie. Hydell dislikes this idea and since they&nbsp;
need a wounded woman, he shoots Kathryn so they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.440
can take her instead, but she dies. At the moment,&nbsp;
Snow manages to find a spot to climb onboard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.400
and he's seen by a prisoner, who warns Alex about&nbsp;
this being a set-up. Alex shoots the negotiator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.040
then asks his brother to find Snow and kill him.
Shaw guides Snow to safely enter the ship while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.000
Alex, who's found a digital newspaper, finally&nbsp;
realizes who Emilie is. At that moment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.320
she's in an elevator with Hock, being taken&nbsp;
back to the hostage room by a prisoner. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.040
grabs the fire extinguisher from the wall opens it&nbsp;
on the prisoner's face. Hock uses the distraction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.960
to attack him, but the prisoner pushes him at&nbsp;
the same time as the doors open to reveal Snow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.440
The prisoner punches Snow, throws him out&nbsp;
of the elevator and, after some struggling,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.440
holds him by the neck against the wall. Snow&nbsp;
puts the explosives around the man's neck and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.920
blows his head off. Emilie appears then, and&nbsp;
she hits him with the fire extinguisher before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.400
running with Hock into a secure, locked room that&nbsp;
triggers a nitrogen alert on Emilie's telemitry.&nbsp;

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.160
Outside that room, Snow is telling&nbsp;
Lanfral and Shaw what happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.160
but he needs to hide when Alex and his men&nbsp;
suddenly come out of the elevator. They find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.320
the room Emilie has locked herself in, and Alex&nbsp;
asks one of his men to bring him two engineers.&nbsp;

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.880
Snow sneaks around the ship and finds a computer,&nbsp;
where he searches for the place where Mace is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.600
being held at. He's told about Emiele's current&nbsp;
oxygen problem, but since the room is secured,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.680
he doesn't know what to do. Outside the&nbsp;
secure room, the two engineers arrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.200
Alex shoots one of them as an example&nbsp;
and tells the other to open the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.760
Meanwhile, Snow is crawling through the ships'&nbsp;
shafts, unaware a prisoner is following him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.240
He reaches the torsion system, which&nbsp;
creates a gravity that should hold him up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.640
When he's about to glide over, the prisoner jumps&nbsp;
on him, and they fight while floating in the air.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.560
Snow pushes the prisoner off and jumps over to&nbsp;
grab the edge of the exit, but the prisoner jumps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.680
on him and hangs onto his leg. Hydell, currently&nbsp;
in the control room, sees all this on camera,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.560
so he shoots the controls to turn off the torsion&nbsp;
system. Snow shoots the prisoner off him, but with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.880
the gravity off, he's having trouble hanging&nbsp;
on. The rope that is holding him breaks and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.280
starts to go down, but Shaw's men reactivate&nbsp;
the torsion and Snow glides out as planned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.640
In the secured room, Emilie and Hock hear&nbsp;
how they're trying to get the door open.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.120
Since the current engineer is failing, Alex&nbsp;
shoots him when a new one comes to take his place.&nbsp;

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.000
In Emilie's room, oxygen is about to run out,&nbsp;
so Hock shoots himself to give her his air.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.160
Snow is still moving through the shafts and&nbsp;
finally manages to find the room, which he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.480
enters after blowing up the shaft lid. Emilie&nbsp;
is unconscious when he finds her, but he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.480
a medical kit with him and manages to bring her&nbsp;
back by following a LOPD doctor's instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.120
Emilie is shocked when she wakes up and pushes&nbsp;
him away. He tells her he's there to help her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.720
and takes her out through the shafts but not&nbsp;
without leaving a bomb for Alex and his men,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.040
who enter the room right after they leave.
Shaw continues to guide Snow and Emilie through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.680
the shafts, but now his voice is heard by the&nbsp;
prisoners as well. Alex is brought a communicator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.400
officer, who is ordered to cut transmissions.&nbsp;
Without Shaw's guidance, Snow and Emilie take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.240
a wrong turn and fall through the ceiling into a&nbsp;
random room, but they quickly find their way into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.200
an infirmary. While tending Emilie's wound, Snow&nbsp;
tells her the president sent him, and when she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.680
asks about the other hostages, he tells her he's&nbsp;
there to save only her. Since they want different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.680
things, Snow gives her the map and a gun and&nbsp;
sends her to save the hostages on her own,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.760
but Emilie doesn't know much about following&nbsp;
directions in a spaceship. At that moment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.000
Alex appears on all the screens of the ship,&nbsp;
showing the picture of Emilie's ID and asking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.160
everyone to capture her if they see her. Snow&nbsp;
takes pity on her and makes her join him again.&nbsp;

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.600
They enter a supplies room and Snow gives Emilie&nbsp;
a prisoner uniform to change into, then cuts and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.520
dyes her hair by force. He also gives her&nbsp;
a hat and punches her face to make a scar.&nbsp;

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.560
In the LOPD ship, Langral is talking to Alex,&nbsp;
who tells him he now knows who Emilie is and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.800
they'll hurt her if they don't get what they&nbsp;
want. The president arrives a few hours later.&nbsp;

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.760
After changing into a prisoner uniform too, Snow&nbsp;
takes Emilie into the main containment area. At&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.440
first they walk among the prisoners without&nbsp;
calling anyone's attention, but eventually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:02.080
they make it to an area where they need a password&nbsp;
to pass, which they obviously don't know. Snow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.560
solves this by hitting the prisoner then running&nbsp;
away. The men chase them, and he shoots at them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.440
but Emilie is stuck at a jammed door. He makes her&nbsp;
shoot instead while he forces the door to open,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.440
finding Mace on the other side. They run&nbsp;
together into another room that they lock up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.320
and Snow hugs Mace only to find out he's repeating&nbsp;
random, senseless words. Emilie tells him he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.760
dementia because of the stasis. When Mace is asked&nbsp;
about the briefcase, he just says more nonsense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.800
When they hear Alex and his men use a special tool&nbsp;
to open the door, they start running away. Alex&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.400
almost catches them when he hears a noise,&nbsp;
but only finds the alarm they left behind.&nbsp;

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.840
At that moment, the MS One is starting to lose&nbsp;
control and hits the International Space Station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.320
The collision causes a hull breach, separating&nbsp;
Mace from the others. Snow tries to make him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.640
press the panic button, but Mace can't understand&nbsp;
him, so he leaves to search for something to open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.360
the door with. Emilie listens to more nonsense&nbsp;
words before he returns, but opening the doors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.920
is impossible and Mace is frozen to death.
Back in the LOPD ship, Langral is told that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.160
the MS One will collide on Earth in around six&nbsp;
hours, so he decides to call the Department of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.040
Justice with a plan. Meanwhile, Snow and Emilie&nbsp;
finally make it to the pod room, where they see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.760
government ships approaching them, but not to&nbsp;
rescue them. The pod they find only has one seat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.400
Snow lies to Emilie and tells him he'll use&nbsp;
another one to make her escape. The pod takes off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.960
but Emilie appears behind Snow moments later.&nbsp;
She thinks her father won't authorize an attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.360
if she's still on the ship, she still wants to&nbsp;
protect the hostages. Snow doesn't want to help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.720
and Emilie changes his mind by pretending&nbsp;
Mace told her where the briefcase is.&nbsp;

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.280
Hydell appears on the ship screens then and says&nbsp;
he will shoot a hostage every three seconds if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:38.800
Emilie doesn't give him her location. Emilie does&nbsp;
so, but Hydell kills all the hostages anyway. Snow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.440
drags her into the elevator to get away, Emilie&nbsp;
confesses she doesn't know where the briefcase is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.600
The elevator gets stuck between floors and&nbsp;
Snow forces the doors open, they jump into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.920
room where they find proof prisoners are being&nbsp;
used as guinea pigs, only to be found by Alex&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:57.360
and his men. Snow tries to defend himself, but&nbsp;
a shot pushes him into the shafts. Alex takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.920
Emilie back with him to the control room. In&nbsp;
the shaft, Snow is woken up by Shaw talking to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.640
him through a secure channel, he asks about Mace&nbsp;
before giving Snow instructions on how to escape.&nbsp;

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.680
In the control room, Alex is talking to Langral,&nbsp;
who threatens with an attack. Alex tells Emilie to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.840
ask her dad to cancel the attack, but Emilie tells&nbsp;
him they should blow up the entire prison instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:21.200
In the LOPD ship, the president refuses to send&nbsp;
the attack, so Langral relieves him of his duties,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.040
which the constitution allows when the president&nbsp;
won't put national security above personal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.320
concerns. Langral authorizes the attack then.
Alex and Hydell see the incoming ships and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.720
start arguing, Hydell stabs his brother before&nbsp;
going after Emilie, but Snow arrives just in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.520
time to save her, knocking Hydell out. While the&nbsp;
MS One is under fire from the security force ships&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.840
and with prisoners chasing them, Snow takes&nbsp;
Emilie to the room Shaw told him about. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.520
lock the door behind them then proceed to put&nbsp;
on special space suits and jump off the ship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.440
right before it explodes. The force of the&nbsp;
explosion gives them the push they need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.080
land on Earth where they're found by the police&nbsp;
- Emilie is rescued. Snow gets arrested again.&nbsp;

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.960
Days later, Emilie is on her hospital bed when&nbsp;
a quote on her tablet makes have a realization.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.280
She escapes the place while remembering the last&nbsp;
words Mace told her: he did tell her where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:10.000
briefcase is. She reaches the station and decodes&nbsp;
the hidden number in Mace's words, which allows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.800
her to open the right locker and finally retrieve&nbsp;
the briefcase. She also visits the motel room and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.880
we learned what truly happened that day: Snow&nbsp;
shot at the same time a hidden intruder shot the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.200
colonel, and to Langral, who was watching from&nbsp;
a neighbor roof, it looked like Snow did it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.160
Emilie takes the briefcase to the&nbsp;
president and tells him to do something.&nbsp;

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.360
We cut to the detention center, where Shaw is&nbsp;
visiting Snow. A cop brings the briefcase to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.360
Snow to show to Shaw, and explains the colonel&nbsp;
wasn't selling secrets, he was returning them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.840
Shaw opens the briefcase and finds it empty, Snow&nbsp;
points out it's weird he knew the combination.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.080
Shaw turns out to be a paid rat,&nbsp;
and Langral is here to arrest him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.600
Snow uses the colonel's lighter to give&nbsp;
Shaw the rat mark before he's taken away.&nbsp;

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.880
Proven innocent, Snow leaves the precinct and&nbsp;
tries to light a cigarette. It's then he discovers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.880
a secret SD card on the lighter, which was the&nbsp;
real object the colonel wanted him to protect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.960
Suddenly Emilie approaches and tells&nbsp;
him she's learned his name is Marion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.120
After punching him as payback, they leave the&nbsp;
place together, bantering and teasing each other.
