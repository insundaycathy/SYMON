00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.710
Welcome to the breakdown where we breakdown
all the messed up shit!!

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.200
Sorry for no videos last week, I was just
super busy with school but if you're from

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.500
the future like this purple haired king then
just ignore what I just said.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.240
So today we are recapping the movie Hereditary,
a supernatural horror film directed by Ari

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.480
Aster I'm sure I said it wrong, but this guy
also directed the disturbing short film The

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.380
Strange Thing About the Johnsons which you
can find on YouTube!

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.810
Hereditary stars Toni Collete as Annie Graham
who just got done burying her mother Ellen,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.399
but Ellen seems to have kept a lot of private
information about herself from Annie, something

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.680
that we will uncover later in this video!

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.300
I'll happily say that this video is not catered
towards people that have already seen the

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.100
movie and are looking for a validated video
to share opinions on what it really means

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.350
or whatever!

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.350
This is just a simple recap from a guy who
dislikes theories and all that!

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.640
If you are looking for an analysis feel free
to check out Foundflix's video on it, but

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.570
regardless if you want to see what happens,
including all the messed up parts, stay tuned

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.190
for the breakdown!

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.240
The movie starts off with a message telling
us that Ellen Leigh passed away a month before

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.649
may when I did Felidae!

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.619
She's the momma of Annie Graham, a woman we
will see later!

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.780
First, take a look at this treehouse guys!

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.090
Remember it because I'm sure it has some significance
later on!

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.119
We then pan away from that house in the trees
to the doll houses sitting in Annie's art

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.119
room!

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.429
We zoom back into the story through a small
house where a Annie's husband Steve comes

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.090
in to wake up their son Peter for his grandmother's
funeral!

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.960
Steve asks where his sister slept last night,
who apparently likes to sleep outside in this

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.400
cold treehouse.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.219
Before we cut to the sister, we see a waiting
Annie in the car!

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.249
Well here is Charlie who gets roasted by dad
for sleeping in this cold ass treehouse, but

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:01.859
she doesn't give two fucks!

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:07.619
Well then, we cut to the funeral of this pretty
old lady, and Annie gives a eulogy which basically

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.790
expresses their difficult relationship with
each other, not all moms and daughters get

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.790
along!

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.780
While looking at grandma's body, Charlie rips
out a big ass Hershey bad, but mommy and daddy

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.390
want to make sure she doesn't swallow any
nuts!

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.850
Looks like someone has a peanut allergy!

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.200
After the funeral, Annie reveals something
feels weird which is basically she doesn't

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.530
feel sad about the death of her momma!

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.130
Later that night Anne then goes to speak to
Charlie who drew pics of Granny!

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.280
Yo Charlie are you good?

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.860
Annie says that Charlie was Granny's favorite
and Charlie says that Granny wanted her to

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.860
be a boy!

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.950
I bet we will find out why later.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.440
The thing that's really on Charlies mind is
who will take care of her, even when Anne

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.400
her own mother dies!

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.200
While comforting her daughter, Annie notices
the word Satony on the wallpaper, which is

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.570
some kind of magical incantation but we don't
give a fuck about that right now!

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.420
Later Annie notices a box saying moms thongs,
eww who wants to look at that!?

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.610
Oh excuse me it says things, which inside
shows some old family pics and some book called

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.750
Notes on Spiritu..

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.180
damn bitch let me see!

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.150
Okay this notes on spiritualism basically
holds this note from Annie's mom saying sorry

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.320
for being stubbornly private, but whatever
I'm dead now so yeah.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.710
This note was too weird for Anne who throws
it back like a fat ass!

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.580
While leaving, Annie is shocked to see a scary
ass apparition of her mother who disappears

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.340
once them lights turn on.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.600
Her curiosity points her to one of her dollhouses
showing that not only was grandma really all

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.260
up in her daughters childcare, but she was
breastfeeding Charlie too!

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.080
Speaking of Charlie, we then see her at school
playing with her pill bottle toy when she

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.820
should be testing!

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.140
After getting grilled nicely by her teacher,
a damn bird crashes into the window, scaring

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.580
everybody including me except for Charlie,
who seems to turn her interest into some scissors!

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.530
Then we see Peter in class who does what every
single boy does in a class full of fine ass

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.530
girls.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.990
Then Peter gets a text from Smokey in the
back who wants to smoke big fat doinks after

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.990
class.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.930
This gets him caught by the teacher and my
guy gets caught lacking on a question, but

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.959
I'm sure getting homegirl attention was worth
it for.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.120
Remember that dead bird, cuz Charlie was the
only one that did.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.970
She is also the only one I know that would
use scissors to decapitate a bird and then

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.340
pocket the head.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.270
Okay Charlie whatever floats your boat, but
looks like you got a stalker that looks just

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.800
like grandmama that died!

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.750
Looks like Annie aint the only one seeing
apparitions!

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.380
Later, pops here gets a call from the funeral
home telling him that the entire grave of

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.900
grandma has been desecrated, but he makes
sure not to tell Annie that, so without worry,

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.870
Annie says she is finna go watch a movie!

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.430
Well what a funny looking movie theatre you're
going too Annie!

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.780
Really, Annie is visiting a support group
for people who lost loved ones.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.780
Annie shares many of her experiences and fatal
thoughts about her mother, including how manipulative

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.830
she was.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.290
One simple think to take from this scene is
things was never good for Annie and mommy,

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.200
but she still feels some kind of guilt.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.430
Back home, we see Peter who gets a text from
his friend telling him "Holy shit, huge party

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.310
at Aaron's house, bring your dick!"

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.900
Who the fuck says that shit my guy!

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.970
Meanwhile it seems someone is watching him
from the treehouse, watching some unknown

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.580
plans roll into motion.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.300
The next day, we see Charlie working on her
own little arts and crafts when her attention

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.490
is gained and called elsewhere.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.360
Peter then visits his momma to ask if he can
use one of the cars for a "School Barbacue

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.360
Thing".

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.310
She says well you better bring your sister,
who meanwhile I walking bare foot to an apparition

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.260
of her grandmother in front of a blaze.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.120
What do you got to say about that Charlie?

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.800
" Pop Sound " Okay Charlie, well anyway she
does this normally just to let you know that

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.960
she is a special unique person.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.260
Annie drags Good Luck Charlie back in so she
can go to that party with Peter, who definitely

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.280
aint feeling having his sister along with
her annoying popping and level 8 cock blocking

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.370
power.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.580
One highlight of this scene is we pause on
a pole with a weird symbol on it.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.020
Hmm I wonder who that belongs too..

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.420
Well here is the lit party, where lots of
fresh game is available for our fisherman

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.180
Peter, but we also see a girl cut up some
peanuts that will be used in a chocolate cake.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.340
Peter locks on to his crush, but this equals
an awkward conversation since Peter has no

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.340
sauce.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.360
He finally succeeds in impressing her when
he offers to smoke up some weed with her,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.980
and David gets Charlie...who the fuck is David?

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.990
Excuse me Peter influences his leechy sister
to stay behind so she can get a piece of that

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.990
chocolate cake!

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.780
Unknowingly, she eats the cake which contained
those nuts which she is allergic to.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.639
Its weird because she seems to know it had
nuts in it, but finally tells her brother

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:01.260
its hard for her to breath after a bit of
him smoking big doinks and all that.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.990
Peter grabs his sister and drives as fast
as he can to get her some help!

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.360
In the back she struggles to breathe, and
I'm guessing in a need to get air she sticks

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.510
her head ouf of the window, but a carcass
in the road makes Peter swerve, and Charlie

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:23.540
is decapitated by that pole we saw earlier.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.730
Peter stops the car and this is probably the
epitome of a mindfuck seeing that your sister

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:33.330
just brutally died in a freak accident, plus
the sight of the head in the mirror makes

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.600
things worse.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.760
Peter slowly lets off the breaks for a while,
and drives home disturbed as hell but instead

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.949
of telling everybody what happened he goes
to bed.

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:47.180
Sleep is the last thing that he got though,
and we soon hear the cries of Annie showing

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.010
she knows what happened.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:53.760
Then we see the actual decapitated head which
honestly is something that makes you turn

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.600
away a bit, I mean it looks real plus it's
a child's head.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.290
The loud cries of Annie just make everything
sadder and reminds me of a similar scene in

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:03.520
Funny Games.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.150
Different from her mother's funereal, Annie
can't keep her composure at the burial of

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:09.150
her daughter.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:14.160
In the middle of grief, here is another wall
message in Charlie's room saying Zazas which

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.030
is a word used by a British occultist named
Aleister Crowley whenever he wanted to summon

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.250
some demons!

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:25.520
The grief of losing a sister is very strong,
as Peter cant forget the nature of his sister's

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.520
death.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.900
Weirdly though, while smoking with his clique
he starts to suffer some weird reaction similar

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:36.090
to his sister's allergy reaction and cries
for his friends to hold his hand!

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:41.329
Later we see Annie go to the support group
place again but changes her mind real quick.

00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:45.860
Before she leaves though she is stopped by
a woman named Joan who becomes a guiding voice

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:51.100
for Annie who herself lost both her son and
grandson in a drowning accident.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.820
She offers her number and address to talk
if Annie ever wants to.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.610
Later though Annie does take up Joan's offer
and goes to her residence, noticing a welcome

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.660
mat that looks like something her mom used
to make, maybe Joan and Ellen knew each other.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:10.040
Well anyway, Annie painfully explains the
nature of the funeral, and also shares a story

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.449
about her sleep walking and almost lighting
her whole family on fire, we will see that

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:15.930
nightmare later though.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.459
This nightmare seems to be a result from disconnect
between Peter and his mother Annie, which

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:22.670
is at its strongest after Charlie's death.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:27.709
At dinner at home, its super awkward and the
negative tensions between Peter and Annie

00:09:27.709 --> 00:09:32.709
result in a strong vocal argument that concludes
with Annie completely blaming her son for

00:09:32.709 --> 00:09:33.959
what happened to Charlie.

00:09:33.959 --> 00:09:37.129
Before things get any more heated, Steve stops
the argument.

00:09:37.129 --> 00:09:41.829
Another day, Anne leaves the arts and crafts
store and sees Joan on the way out, who is

00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:44.699
ecstatic after visiting a spiritual medium.

00:09:44.699 --> 00:09:48.310
Long story short, I talked to my dead son
and grandsons, let me show you!

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:54.100
At Joan's house, she starts a seance which
contacts the spirit of her grandson who completely

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:58.190
shocks Annie by moving glasses and writing
on chalk boards and shit.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:02.300
This causes Annie to freak out and want to
leave, but Joan makes sure to show her how

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.899
to call for Charlie's spirit herself!

00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:09.730
Later that night, Annie is woken up from ants
crawling all over her pillow and around the

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:10.730
room.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.040
She follows a huge trail of ants coming from
Peter's room.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:19.649
Annie walks in disgusted, seeing hundreds
of ants crawl all over Peter and is repulsed

00:10:19.649 --> 00:10:22.459
to see them crawling out of his mouth.

00:10:22.459 --> 00:10:27.220
It turns out she was just sleep walking though,
and oddly asks if Charlie is here.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.889
She even says I never wanted to be your mother
on accident.

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:35.879
Apparently, grandma forced Anne to have a
baby and even tried having a miscarriage to

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:37.630
get rid of Peter.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:42.420
Peter cries learning this from mom, but we
then see he is doused in paint thinner and

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:47.240
so is mom, who then blows up in flames like
that nightmare described in Joan''s house

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.260
earlier.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.670
Gladly though that was a dream too.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:56.050
Annie gets up and wakes up Peter, apologizing
for all the harsh words and recruits him and

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.910
Steve to do that seance.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:02.740
They start it up, and Annie asks Charlie to
move that glass which she does!

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.839
Then Charlie starts getting a little out of
control, breaking glass and shooting fire,

00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:13.230
which is really her possessing Annie who eerily
growls before speaking in Charlie's voice

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:14.899
in a scared manner.

00:11:14.899 --> 00:11:19.879
Steve gets Charlie to leave by dumping water
on Annie, but it also seems Steve wants to

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:22.529
take his son and get away from his wife.

00:11:22.529 --> 00:11:27.459
Then we see another wall message saying Liftoach
Pandemonium, which basically means open up

00:11:27.459 --> 00:11:29.309
hell to bring the demon.

00:11:29.309 --> 00:11:34.559
Then we see Peter going to school, but his
attention is taken by this energy wave possibly

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:36.199
created by Charlie.

00:11:36.199 --> 00:11:40.970
He then looks in the mirror seeing himself
smiling, but becomes the class dummy in the

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:41.970
progress.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:47.019
Even at night, Peter is creeped out from apparitions
of Charlie and is chocked out from random

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:52.059
arms, so in order to stop this malevolent
spirit, Annie takes Charlies notebook and

00:11:52.059 --> 00:11:53.839
throws it in the fireplace.

00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:59.250
The only issue is that as long as that notebook
is on fire, so is Annie who is forced to save

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.249
to notebook to save herself!

00:12:01.249 --> 00:12:07.589
To get help on whats going on, Annie visits
Joan's place but Joan seems to be gone, well

00:12:07.589 --> 00:12:12.309
after she did some weird cult like shit that
definitely relates Joan to her grandma, Charlie

00:12:12.309 --> 00:12:13.309
and Peter.

00:12:13.309 --> 00:12:18.800
Speaking of Peter, he watches as Joan screams
nonsense at him from across the street.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:24.470
Back at home Annie finds a book with the same
symbol that was on that pole we saw that decapitated

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.470
Charlie.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:30.579
In the book, it describes a demon called King
Paimon, who by this text is a passive demon

00:12:30.579 --> 00:12:35.679
that uses bodies as hosts through rituals
ordained by some cult that Ellen and Joan

00:12:35.679 --> 00:12:36.899
are apart of.

00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:42.369
Aparently when Paimon is in a female, he becomes
livid and vengeful but it wants a male host

00:12:42.369 --> 00:12:43.389
ideally.

00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:48.199
This must mean that Charlie was the first
host who herself wasnt very happy.

00:12:48.199 --> 00:12:49.660
Charlie what did grandma Ellen say to you
one day?

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:55.089
"Charlie: She wanted me to be a boy" exactly
Charlie, she wanted you to be a boy to please

00:12:55.089 --> 00:12:56.660
King Paimon!

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:02.410
Annie then goes to the fly infested Attic,
seeing the decapitated body of her mother

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.980
and the symbol of the cult that she was the
leader of.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.600
That isn't the only weird thing going on,
because at school, Peter is tormented by the

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:17.629
sounds of Charlie's or rather Paimon's popping
sound, and his body starts to entirely contort

00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:19.589
into something nasty.

00:13:19.589 --> 00:13:25.089
Peter then horrifies his classmates by hitting
his face on the desk, breaking his nose and

00:13:25.089 --> 00:13:26.860
screaming in terror!

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.959
Steve brings Peter home and Anne tries to
convince him that the body of her mother is

00:13:31.959 --> 00:13:34.279
up in the attic and you better check it out.

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:39.749
A fragile Annie explains how a cult is the
reason why everything is happening, and the

00:13:39.749 --> 00:13:44.929
only way to stop this curse and save their
son from Paimon is to destroy Charlie' drawing

00:13:44.929 --> 00:13:45.929
book!

00:13:45.929 --> 00:13:50.829
Annie gears up to sacrifice herself to stop
this supposed curse and gives Steve the book

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:56.309
to destroy it, but he turns out believing
his wife is a lunatic, so instead she grabs

00:13:56.309 --> 00:14:01.019
and throws away the book but this immolates
Steve instead!

00:14:01.019 --> 00:14:06.779
Annie watches in horror, but the energy of
Paimon seems to take control of her real quick!

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:11.239
Later Peter wakes up, but a ghostly Annie
flies behind him.

00:14:11.239 --> 00:14:16.291
Peter walks down the stairs finding the burnt
crispy body of his father, and even sees a

00:14:16.291 --> 00:14:19.709
nude ass man who actually is a cult member.

00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:24.160
Annie then comes out from the ceiling and
runs after Peter, but he locks himself away

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.610
in the attic as a demonized Annie knocks on
the door!

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:32.920
Once she stops, Peter finds all the nasty
stuff around the room, but he sees above him

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:38.180
that Annie is decapitating herself with some
piano wire and damn she really is getting

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.180
into it too!

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:44.389
Then suddenly, two saggy titty women and a
old man causes him to jump out of the window

00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:47.319
and we head Annie's head drop to the floor.

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:53.939
We see Paimon's energy circle over Peter and
seemingly this is Paimon in Peter's body now.

00:14:53.939 --> 00:14:58.389
Peter gets up to follow his mother's dead
levitating corpse, and even does that pop

00:14:58.389 --> 00:15:02.999
noise that Charlie used to do, indicating
that the popping Charlie did was Paimon's

00:15:02.999 --> 00:15:04.129
popping!

00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:06.489
Peter walks in as nude ass cult member watch.

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:11.839
He climbs up to see he is being honored and
we even see a statue with Charlie's head on

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:16.240
it being honored by the decapitated corpses
of Annie and her mom.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:22.100
The followers then transfer power from the
previous host of Charlie to Peter, and the

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:27.559
movie ends as we see that Peter is now the
host of a demon, after being wearied down

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:29.949
from the death of his whole family!

00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:34.519
Now this movie deserve an applause because
it was a greatly directed horror film and

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:39.970
still had plenty of shocking scenes like the
death of Charlie and the influence of King

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:40.970
Paimon.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:45.339
Now that we seen an entire family lose its
will, lets talk about the most disturbed moment

00:15:45.339 --> 00:15:48.949
and most enjoyed moment in that Spooky Stuff!

00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:56.809
So lets get right into it, the most disturbed
moment is for me at least the death of Charlie!

00:15:56.809 --> 00:16:02.699
It's crazy how the cult initiated every sequence
just for the giving of power to Peter.

00:16:02.699 --> 00:16:07.019
Like every single thing that happened seemed
to be the plan of the cult!

00:16:07.019 --> 00:16:09.639
The most enjoyed moment Id say is the doggie
in the movie!

00:16:09.639 --> 00:16:12.790
Oh wait did I even mention the dog in this
video?

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.459
Nvm It was the acting I enjoyed, especially
of Annie.

00:16:16.459 --> 00:16:19.360
She probably pured her heart out for this
movie!

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:24.160
And that's it, remember this isn't like some
theory video or what it really means behind

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.829
the scenes it literally just a simple recap
so you can see what happens in your convenience.
