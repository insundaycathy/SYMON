00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.920
Detective Recapped here. Today, I'm&nbsp;
going to explain a drama film called,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.760
"The Poker House", which is about the early&nbsp;
life of the director of the film, Lori Petty,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.720
in a gritty and gang-infested neighborhood.&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.600
In 1976 in Council Bluffs, Iowa, there is a place&nbsp;
called "The Poker House". It's an ordinary-looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.520
house situated in an ordinary-looking&nbsp;
neighborhood. However, within the four walls of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.160
the house, neighborhood pimps and criminals gather&nbsp;
to play poker and enlist the services of escorts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.920
The owner of the house is an escort herself&nbsp;
who was coerced into that kind of life. Her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.400
name is Sarah, and she has three daughters: the&nbsp;
14-year-old Agnes, the 12-year-old Bee, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.280
8-year-old Cammie. One morning, Agnes comes home&nbsp;
to their dilapidated home only to find a young man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.360
exiting their bathroom in his underwear. It would&nbsp;
be a lie to say that Agnes is at all surprised&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.920
by this. To her, this is just another morning.&nbsp;
Several men come into their house every day then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.840
leave the next morning after a night of hooking&nbsp;
up. Agnes convinces the man to leave their house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.560
and even helps him get dressed. The man complies&nbsp;
with Agnes's demands and quietly leaves the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.720
Agnes is now once again left in the cluttered&nbsp;
living room, scouring for something to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.760
She barely bothers cleaning up, knowing that&nbsp;
there's little hope for their house to ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.080
be set right. Before the sun rises, she rolls up&nbsp;
the stack of newspapers on the floor, binding them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.640
each with a rubber band. She then goes to wake&nbsp;
up her little sister, Bee. As young as Agnes is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.160
she knows that she’s the only hope that her&nbsp;
sisters have. She stands as their pillar of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.480
strength. Amidst the confusion and the harshness&nbsp;
of it all, Agnes looks after Bee and Cammie.&nbsp;

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.960
Agnes knocks on her door, and Bee goes to prepare&nbsp;
for her usual routine. The two sisters sit on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.320
floor and gather the rolled-up bundles of&nbsp;
newspapers. They put the rolls in the pouch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.760
that Bee's wearing. When Agnes asks where&nbsp;
their youngest sister is, Bee replies that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.160
Cammie's at her friend Shiela's place. Apparently,&nbsp;
Sheila's mother has tried to ban Cammie from home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.760
considering that she has enough children of&nbsp;
her own to feed. But there would be times when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.360
Sheila's mother is too tired to kick her out,&nbsp;
especially after coming home from her second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.760
job. Though Agnes reasons that Cammie's tiny and&nbsp;
doesn't take up much room, Bee explains that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.160
eats up all their food. To Agnes, this is a good&nbsp;
thing for Cammie since she might grow that way.&nbsp;

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.840
Agnes talks with Bee some more until it's time for&nbsp;
Bee to leave the house to deliver newspapers in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.760
the neighborhood. Before Bee leaves, Agnes asks&nbsp;
if she could make her an improvised version of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.920
mac and cheese using nacho cheese Doritos.&nbsp;
After hearing what Agnes had in her mind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.760
Bee sternly rejects her idea. Their inability&nbsp;
to make a decent plate of food speaks to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.160
children's lack of guidance and resources.&nbsp;
Agnes is keenly aware of this. She must have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.280
been thinking of this when she thought of&nbsp;
Cammie eating plenty at her friend’s house.&nbsp;

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.280
Bee goes on to deliver the rolled-up newspapers&nbsp;
while Agnes puts on a vinyl record, listening to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.360
a bass-heavy track while preparing for a bath.&nbsp;
While Agnes is getting ready to take a bath,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.120
she spots a tiny mouse on the bathroom sink.&nbsp;
She takes a small paper bag and places the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.040
mouse inside before gently pushing it outside&nbsp;
the window. Though she has every reason to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.120
spiteful and resentful towards the world, Agnes&nbsp;
maintains her kindness, and this extends even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.480
to small animals. Agnes then takes a moment alone&nbsp;
to enjoy a serene bath in the tub. Moments later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.840
Agnes is visited by a man wearing a fedora. This&nbsp;
is Duval, her mother's pimp. Duval plops down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.680
his gun along with a burger on the table for&nbsp;
Agnes as he goes on to flirt with her. Agnes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.920
muses that Duval had kissed her a week before, and&nbsp;
her excitement upon seeing him again is evident.&nbsp;

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.680
Duval announces that he won in a card game&nbsp;
nearby and flaunts his cash in front of her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.400
They share a kiss once again, delighting the naïve&nbsp;
young girl. In turn, she excitedly reports to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.960
Duval that she has a basketball competition coming&nbsp;
up that day. Duval asks Agnes if she loves him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.200
to which she answers yes. At this point,&nbsp;
Agnes tells Duval about the man from earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.360
Realizing that Sarah had a customer without his&nbsp;
knowledge, Duval gets up in a rage and goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.760
beat Sarah. The young Agnes takes Duval's gun&nbsp;
and poises it towards him in the other room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.280
She thinks about how she doesn't want any part&nbsp;
of Duval beating up Sarah, but she does like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.240
it when Duval kisses her. Before Duval notices&nbsp;
the gun, Agnes places it back onto the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.160
After seeing her mother get beaten up, Agnes&nbsp;
changes her tone with Duval and refuses to eat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.440
the burger that he brought for her. Any adult&nbsp;
would find it plain to see that Duval doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.760
actually love Agnes and that he has no business&nbsp;
making out with a literal child. But Agnes isn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.800
an adult. Agnes, through her young and innocent&nbsp;
eyes, sees Duval for much more than what he is.&nbsp;

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.400
Cammie wakes up at the Hightower residence, where&nbsp;
several siblings run around in a blur in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.280
perpetually loud house. Cammie's friend, Sheila,&nbsp;
tells her that she has to leave and go home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.360
Obliging, Cammie leaves the house with Mister&nbsp;
Hightower. Cammie and Mister Hightower have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.640
gotten close over time to the point that Cammie&nbsp;
tells Mister Hightower that she wishes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.440
he were her dad. The kind Mister Hightower takes&nbsp;
Cammie to breakfast at a bar before going to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.040
However, he receives an urgent call from&nbsp;
work, forcing him to leave Cammie behind.&nbsp;

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.360
Eventually, Sarah wakes up from her drunken&nbsp;
sleep and stumbles outward to the living room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.920
where Agnes is doing her homework. Anger grows in&nbsp;
Sarah's voice, with the woman becoming more and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.080
more frustrated when she can't find what she's&nbsp;
looking for in the living room. To this, Agnes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.480
says that she cleaned up the living room after&nbsp;
seeing it so messy. Upon hearing that, Sarah gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.800
mad at Agnes, saying that she wants to be able to&nbsp;
put whatever she wants wherever she feels like it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.280
This leads to Agnes feeling overwhelmed by her&nbsp;
fussy and unsavory mother. Sarah then teases and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.280
forces Agnes to start being a call girl herself&nbsp;
so that their family could earn more money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.600
When she hears this, Agnes is pushed to the verge&nbsp;
of tears, but Sarah only teases her further,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.680
saying that she won't be fourteen forever.&nbsp;
Despite Agnes’s attempts at having a semblance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.080
of an orderly life, her mother shows no&nbsp;
appreciation of this. She’s even mad about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.240
To Agnes, it feels as if her efforts are in&nbsp;
vain. But more than that, it feels as if her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.400
mother wants them to keep living in such a dismal&nbsp;
state. Most heartbreaking of all, her mother wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.160
her to be a call girl. This is devastating,&nbsp;
especially when most mothers would struggle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.600
against continents to keep their children safe&nbsp;
and to keep them away from such a tragic life.&nbsp;

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.240
At this point, Agnes recounts their life&nbsp;
before, back when things weren't as messed up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.400
Agnes and her sisters used to live with Sarah&nbsp;
and their father. Their father was a preacher,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.320
so the three girls were much in tune with&nbsp;
religion. However, their father was abusive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.080
towards them, physically hurting both&nbsp;
his children and his wife. Eventually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.760
the police came for their father, and the four of&nbsp;
them escaped to where they are now. After that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.920
Agnes still attempted to connect with God, but&nbsp;
her faith waned over the long and difficult years.&nbsp;

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.680
Meanwhile, Bee is almost done with her delivery&nbsp;
run and is now collecting empty bottles for some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.320
extra cash. She then visits some local hobos who&nbsp;
are well-acquainted with her. While waiting for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.080
the local general store to open, Bee tells the&nbsp;
hobos that she's going to be moving soon and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.840
that she has Child Services helping her get to&nbsp;
a foster home. When the store owner comes in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.680
Bee and the hobos present their empty bottles&nbsp;
for the owner to buy from them. Bee uses the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.480
cash to buy some candy that she could enjoy for&nbsp;
herself. At this time, Agnes escapes to her room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.000
where several posters of soul musicians are&nbsp;
plastered all over the walls while Cammie is still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.960
at the bar, chatting with the bar owner, Dolly,&nbsp;
and the rather delirious alcoholic, Stymie. While&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.640
their home life may be in shambles, this doesn’t&nbsp;
stop the three sisters from getting along well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.400
with their neighbors. Though they’re surrounded&nbsp;
by the seediest people in the Poker House, they’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.720
all still innocent, and they yearn for a better&nbsp;
life. This is especially evident with Bee, who’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.880
trying to get into a foster home, and in Cammie,&nbsp;
who longs to be a part of the Hightower family.&nbsp;

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.560
Before leaving the house for the day, Agnes&nbsp;
writes a poem expressing her frustrations with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.160
her father and religion. The poem reads, "Never&nbsp;
called nobody father. Why bother? When you left,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.240
you took God with you. Never met no preacher&nbsp;
who wasn't trying to reach her, selling heaven,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.000
taking your sin home with him. Saw some funny&nbsp;
hats though when they made the new Pope, givin'&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.480
the sheep hope. Never called nobody father. Why&nbsp;
bother? Ain't no reverends, anyway. Revered ones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.040
pimpin' the little ones who need God to be true.&nbsp;
Ain't no end to what they'll do. When you leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.600
take God with you." This poem revolves around&nbsp;
the rejection of patriarchal figures. These&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.360
figures include the church, which is a response&nbsp;
to Agnes’s disillusionment with her father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.040
together with the religion that he taught her.
After writing this down in her blue notebook,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.480
Agnes leaves the house on her bike. She stumbles&nbsp;
upon Bee, who's eating candy nearby. Agnes takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.160
this opportunity to give her little sister a&nbsp;
scare. With Bee spooked and flustered by her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.800
little prank, Agnes tells her to run home. Though&nbsp;
Agnes continually and playfully teases her sister,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.960
she sincerely tells Bee that she loves her before&nbsp;
leaving. Agnes then heads to the local paper,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.800
where she claims a check for her poetry&nbsp;
submissions. As she's practically an honorary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.880
employee there, Agnes is friendly towards all&nbsp;
the employees. She then hands in her school&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.720
report card to the head of the paper, who is&nbsp;
impressed by her stellar grades. Afterward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.960
Agnes drops by a restaurant where she works to&nbsp;
pick up another check. Once she has her check,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.200
she goes for a quick game of basketball with the&nbsp;
neighborhood kids. It’s made apparent that Agnes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.360
is quite popular with everyone in town. But&nbsp;
aside from being a kind and well-liked girl,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.760
she’s also multi-faceted and multi-talented. This&nbsp;
gives the sense that if she really wanted to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.280
Agnes most definitely has the potential and&nbsp;
the talent to break free from this sordid town.&nbsp;

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.000
Meanwhile, Cammie becomes increasingly frustrated.&nbsp;
She's been abandoned in a bar that she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
unfamiliar with, and she wishes for someone&nbsp;
to just come and pick her up. That evening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.680
Bee is practicing her saxophone in her room up&nbsp;
until things start to stir at the poker house.&nbsp;

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.400
By the time that Agnes got home, the debauchery's&nbsp;
already well underway. She sees their house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.760
filled with the all-too-familiar characters&nbsp;
that populate their home every single night:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.400
call girls, pimps, criminals. Then, sleeping&nbsp;
in the backroom is her twelve-year-old sister,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.960
Bee. Agnes goes to Bee first by going up&nbsp;
the window to her room. When she gets there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.800
she tells Bee to visit Kelly's house that night,&nbsp;
even though she doesn't have band practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.040
Without understanding why Bee does as she's told.&nbsp;
With her sister gone, Agnes lights a cigarette and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.360
braces herself to enter the living room, the&nbsp;
melting pot of a crummy, backwater life. Once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.520
she goes into the living room, someone hits&nbsp;
on her despite Agnes's young age. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.200
Duval has just won a game of cards by cheating,&nbsp;
but none of his friends could protest because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.720
he brings out his gun every time someone says&nbsp;
something against him. It’s hard not to feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.640
for Agnes because her love for her sisters&nbsp;
is on full display here. She understands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.480
what goes on in that house, and she attempts to&nbsp;
keep these dangers from reaching her sisters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.080
Though this means that she has to be the one to&nbsp;
dive headfirst into the darkness, she is willing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.880
to do it to protect her sisters’ innocence.
Eventually, Agnes runs into Duval in the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.840
When no one is looking, Duval kisses Agnes, and&nbsp;
she kisses him back. Blissfully unknowing, Agnes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.360
is flustered by Duval's kisses again, thinking&nbsp;
that they're a genuine display of affection.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.320
Suddenly, someone else enters the kitchen, and&nbsp;
the two of them break it off. Later that night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.240
when it's just Duval and Agnes in the sordid&nbsp;
living room, they continue kissing each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.880
Agnes remains delighted by Duval's kisses as she&nbsp;
keeps thinking that he loves her. But soon enough,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.040
the girl is brought down to a harsh reality&nbsp;
when Duval suddenly takes advantage of her body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.840
Immediately after the horrid act, Agnes panics&nbsp;
and rushes into the bathtub. Distraught, Agnes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.000
is in shock after having such a despicable thing&nbsp;
done to her, and she panics over getting pregnant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.640
She then turns on the water in the tub while blood&nbsp;
gushes out of her. Suddenly, a drunken Sarah comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.200
into the bathroom. She asks Agnes what she was&nbsp;
doing without the faintest glimmer of concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.440
Crushed and devastated, the young girl reaches out&nbsp;
for her mother to come and embrace her. Without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.000
even acknowledging her daughter's unmistakable cry&nbsp;
for help, Sarah only gives her some errands to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.320
Poor Agnes just closes her arms and embraces&nbsp;
herself instead. If there’s anyone to be held&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.880
responsible for the three sisters’ lives, it&nbsp;
would be their mother, Sarah. But as it stands,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.200
Sarah is too consumed by her obsession with Duval&nbsp;
and the drugs in her veins. And when she needed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.600
her mother the most, all Agnes could feel from&nbsp;
Sarah is her emotional coldness and indifference.&nbsp;

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.440
Sarah recounts a story from when Agnes&nbsp;
was a baby. Even at a very young age,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.840
all Agnes wanted was for her mother to read a book&nbsp;
to her. She mentions a red book that Agnes liked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.360
and she tells Agnes that she had asked her to read&nbsp;
that book so many times that she began to grow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.920
sick of it. So Sarah made up her own stories while&nbsp;
she was reading the book over and over again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.760
However, Sarah remarks that she could never fool&nbsp;
Agnes and that she always knew what her mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.760
was trying to do even when she was young. The&nbsp;
drunken Sarah leaves the room, never noticing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.360
her daughter's disturbed state. This telling&nbsp;
display gives the sense that Sarah has some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.360
level of awareness of what she’s doing to her&nbsp;
daughters. The recounting of Agnes’s early life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.280
indicates that Sarah knows that she can’t fool&nbsp;
Agnes into living a life that she doesn’t want.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.280
No matter what she says, the truth will&nbsp;
surface and Agnes will come to understand it.&nbsp;

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.760
Moments later, Agnes barges into the kitchen&nbsp;
with Duval's pistol in hand. She overhears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.320
Duval telling Sarah that he wants to start selling&nbsp;
Agnes, so Agnes points the gun at him. Shooting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.280
the gun once, Agnes warns Duval not to move. For&nbsp;
all of Duval's smugness, he changes his tone when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.600
the shot nearly hits him, and he realizes that&nbsp;
Agnes is making a serious threat. But Sarah would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.480
step in the line of fire, protecting Duval from&nbsp;
Agnes. This only enrages Agnes, so she tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.480
that Duval had just taken advantage of her. But&nbsp;
Sarah refuses to acknowledge what her daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.800
just said, and she even defends Duval, asserting&nbsp;
that he takes care of her. The realization that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.280
her mother is a lost cause comes, and Agnes could&nbsp;
only say that she'll be leaving. To this, Sarah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.680
responds by telling her not to come back to her&nbsp;
house anymore. With that, Agnes goes out the door.&nbsp;

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.640
Agnes heads straight to her basketball game at&nbsp;
Ridgeview High. The game is already in the second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.480
half and their team's down by thirteen points.&nbsp;
While she's still upset over what happened at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.800
home, her spirits are lifted when she sees all the&nbsp;
friends she's made watching and cheering her on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.480
From the local paper employees to the kids she&nbsp;
played basketball with, to her co-workers at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.800
the restaurant, and more—they're all rooting for&nbsp;
her. Amidst the miserable hellscape that swallowed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.200
Agnes’s day whole, she’s still not alone. The&nbsp;
love and respect she doesn’t receive at home, she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.680
finds in the people who she cares for and in turn,&nbsp;
care for her. It says a lot about Agnes that she’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.680
able to earn the affection and support of those&nbsp;
around her. In the next half of the game, Agnes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.440
single-handedly brings her team from the brink&nbsp;
of defeat to a tied game of sixty points each:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.280
a feat never before seen in the school’s history.&nbsp;
During the final four seconds of the game, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.520
superstar Agnes shoots the ball just in time to&nbsp;
score an additional two points, finally securing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.920
their team's victory. That night, Agnes has broken&nbsp;
a state record for having scored twenty-seven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.720
points in under seven minutes. Marching out of the&nbsp;
school gym, Agnes proceeds straight to her car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.400
Despite her victory, the horrors from earlier&nbsp;
continue to plague the traumatized girl,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.200
and she goes through a nervous breakdown.
She eventually recovers, and Agnes pushes forward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.360
driving now in search of her sisters. She finds&nbsp;
them by a bridge looking down near the edge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.520
so she tells them to come inside the car.&nbsp;
Finally, the sisters are reunited after a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.360
long and difficult day. She plans on taking&nbsp;
out Bee and Cammie to dinner in celebration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.200
of her victorious basketball game. After&nbsp;
inserting a tape into the car's player,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.600
the three jam out to the song, "Ain't No Mountain&nbsp;
High Enough". The sisters take turns in singing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.920
the parts of the song as they ride out into the&nbsp;
night. Despite everything, Agnes takes solace in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.360
the one redeeming aspect of her life: her sisters.
Eventually, Agnes leaves Iowa for New York City to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.120
become an artist. Twenty years later, Agnes—or&nbsp;
Lori Petty—wrote and directed this very film.&nbsp;

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.200
In a way, the story concludes with an&nbsp;
anti-climactic ending. It’s natural to yearn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.440
for a bombastically triumphant conclusion each&nbsp;
time there’s a story of hardship and heartbreak.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.360
But ultimately, the Poker House is&nbsp;
a real-life story. And in real life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.360
things don’t always end in a neatly tied bow.&nbsp;
We don’t get to see exactly how Agnes and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.040
her sisters break free from their unsettling&nbsp;
world, but in the final minutes of the film,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.880
we do get reassurance that things will turn&nbsp;
out okay for the family. More than that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.240
this is less of a fully-fleshed tale but more&nbsp;
of a portrait of what it was like for director&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.720
and actress Lori Petty growing up in that world.&nbsp;
It’s a very personal film but at the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.560
it carries universal appeal as it gives voice to&nbsp;
young girls everywhere who find themselves in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.200
similarly deplorable situation, as well as the&nbsp;
trauma of being taken advantage of by cruel men.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.200
Overall, the film is a beautiful take on how&nbsp;
three young girls refuse to yield their hearts and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.360
spirits to a dreadful world and how they overcome&nbsp;
this darkness by finding strength in each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.840
And this sentiment is displayed through&nbsp;
the scene’s final song sequence.
