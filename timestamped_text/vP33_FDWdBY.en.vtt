00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:16.080
MI6 operative James Bond gains promotion to&nbsp;
00 agent status by assassinating two targets:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.560
traitorous section chief Dryden at the British&nbsp;
Embassy in Prague and his contact, Fisher.&nbsp;

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.440
In Uganda, the mysterious Mr.&nbsp;
White introduces Steven Obanno,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.520
a high-ranking member of the Lord's Resistance&nbsp;
Army, to Le Chiffre, an Albanian private banker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.560
to terrorists. Obanno entrusts Le Chiffre&nbsp;
with a large sum of money to invest;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.840
Le Chiffre subsequently buys put options&nbsp;
on aerospace manufacturer Skyfleet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.320
betting on the company's failure given his&nbsp;
insider knowledge of a terrorist attack.&nbsp;

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.480
In Madagascar, Bond pursues bomb-maker Mollaka&nbsp;
to an embassy, killing him and blowing up the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.600
building. In London, MI6 chief M admonishes Bond&nbsp;
for causing an international incident and ignoring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.000
her orders to capture Mollaka alive. Clues point&nbsp;
to corrupt Greek official Alex Dimitrios, whom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.280
Bond finds in the Bahamas. After winning his 1964&nbsp;
Aston Martin DB5 in a poker game and seducing his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.680
wife Solange, Bond pursues Dimitrios to Miami and&nbsp;
kills him. Bond then thwarts the destruction of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.040
Skyfleet's prototype airliner, costing Le Chiffre&nbsp;
his entire investment, $101,206,000 in total. Due&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.880
to Dimitrios' failure to carry out the attack, his&nbsp;
wife Solange is subsequently tortured and killed.&nbsp;

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.320
To recoup his clients' lost money, Le Chiffre&nbsp;
organizes a high-stakes Texas hold 'em tournament&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.280
at the Casino Royale in Montenegro.&nbsp;
MI6 enters Bond in the tournament,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.360
believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre&nbsp;
to seek asylum with the British government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.560
in exchange for information on his clients.&nbsp;
Bond is paired with Vesper Lynd, a British&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.520
Treasury agent protecting the $10 million&nbsp;
buy-in. During their train ride, they assess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.200
and make insightful guesses about each other. In&nbsp;
Montenegro, they meet their contact René Mathis.&nbsp;

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.800
Bond seems to gain the upper hand, deducing Le&nbsp;
Chiffre's “tell”. Obanno ambushes Le Chiffre but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.000
allows him to continue playing to win back the&nbsp;
money. Obanno's bodyguard spots Bond and Vesper,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.360
but Bond kills him and Obanno both.&nbsp;
After comforting a traumatized Vesper,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.520
Bond loses his stake because Le Chiffre&nbsp;
has been tipped off about his own tell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.400
Vesper refuses to cover the $5 million rebuy, but&nbsp;
fellow player Felix Leiter, a CIA agent, agrees to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.760
stake Bond enough money to continue in exchange&nbsp;
for taking Le Chiffre into American custody.&nbsp;

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.480
Le Chiffre's lover Valenka poisons Bond's martini&nbsp;
with digitalis. Retrieving an antidote and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.880
defibrillator from his Aston Martin DBS V12,&nbsp;
Bond passes out but Vesper rescues him. Bond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.280
returns to the game, which culminates in a $115&nbsp;
million hand that Bond wins with a straight flush.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.480
Apparently tipped off by Mathis, Le Chiffre&nbsp;
kidnaps Vesper and uses her to trap Bond.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.360
Le Chiffre brings the captives to an abandoned&nbsp;
ship and tortures Bond to reveal the account&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.280
number and password to the winnings, but Bond&nbsp;
refuses. Mr. White bursts in and kills Le Chiffre&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.920
as punishment for betraying the trust of his&nbsp;
organization by gambling with their money,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.200
leaving Bond and Vesper alive.
Bond awakens in an MI6 hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.240
and has Mathis arrested as a traitor. After&nbsp;
transferring the winnings, Bond spends time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.000
recovering with Vesper at his side and the two&nbsp;
fall in love. He resigns from MI6 and they run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.840
away to Venice. When M reveals the money was never&nbsp;
deposited, Bond realizes Vesper has betrayed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.880
He follows her to a handoff of the money, where&nbsp;
gunmen take her captive as soon as they spot him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.600
Bond shoots the building's flotation devices,&nbsp;
causing the foundation to sink into the Grand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.640
Canal. He kills the gunmen, but Vesper is&nbsp;
imprisoned in an elevator plunging into the rising&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.520
water. She drowns after deliberately locking&nbsp;
herself inside the elevator to prevent Bond from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.200
rescuing her; he recovers her body but is too late&nbsp;
to revive her. Mr. White escapes with the money.&nbsp;

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.720
M informs Bond the organization behind Le&nbsp;
Chiffre threatened to kill Vesper's lover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.480
unless she became a double agent. When Bond coldly&nbsp;
renounces Vesper as a traitor, M deduces that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.400
likely made a deal later with White, trading the&nbsp;
money for Bond's life. Bond returns to service.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.520
Realizing Vesper left her phone to help him, he&nbsp;
checks the contacts and locates Mr. White at an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:39.280
estate in Lake Como. Shooting him in the leg, 007&nbsp;
introduces himself: "The name's Bond, James Bond".
