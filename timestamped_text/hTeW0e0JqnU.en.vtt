00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.280
in this video our three characters Emma, Norman&nbsp;
and Ray have to escape an orphanage what looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.160
like a beautiful and blissful home full of&nbsp;
loving siblings in the lovely foster mom at first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.280
turns out to be a breeding&nbsp;
farm where children are bred&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.520
like livestock is and then once&nbsp;
fully developed fed to demons

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.320
now the demons in this world are real gourmets&nbsp;
as they are only interested in big brains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.440
therefore the orphanage puts a lot of effort in&nbsp;
developing the kids in fact they put more effort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.240
in than real life schools the more intelligent&nbsp;
the kit becomes the more valuable it is which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.920
basically is the opposite of our reality of course&nbsp;
our three main characters are the biggest brainies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.320
in here and this will lead to a fun chess&nbsp;
game between them and those that run the place&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.520
at the very beginning none of our kids know any&nbsp;
of the truths behind this establishment but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.320
for honest those neck tattoos gave it away the&nbsp;
second we've seen them i mean having borderline&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.160
facial tattoos with a font reminding me of gta&nbsp;
characters making up a five digit number as if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.600
they were inmates of a federal prison i don't&nbsp;
know man that stuff is uh kind of suspicious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.880
but they are kids and they have never experienced&nbsp;
anything else but what's happening in there so i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.640
can't blame them for not realizing that they carry&nbsp;
numbers just like livestock does although that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.440
definitely a red flag now whenever a kid is being&nbsp;
adopted that kid is actually fed to demons and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.200
the next victim in line is little connie when Emma&nbsp;
and Norman realize that connie forgot her precious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.160
teddy bear they venture out to give it back to&nbsp;
her just when they have arrived at the main gate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.680
and for the first time walk past it they come to&nbsp;
realize that the real purpose for their captivity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.360
isn't what they thought it was duh i would&nbsp;
probably freeze in terror and stay down there plus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.560
get caught in a quick second however if i were&nbsp;
in that position after having not jacked off for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.160
a week i would rise up like superman would high&nbsp;
kick that demon in its face run up to that to my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.360
well-trained naruto run skill and then roundhouse&nbsp;
kicker into oblivion after which i would pick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.040
up her knife like a fortnite weapon and then&nbsp;
clear that whole place imitating onlyusemeblade&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.960
boom done but that's not how this works okay&nbsp;
first i don't have the budget to film that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.080
and second this is a feature film and not a 10&nbsp;
minute ackermann skit but hey perhaps we will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.600
get there one day so our two characters&nbsp;
are able to escape before they're caught&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.440
they get back home and have to digest what just&nbsp;
happened can't blame them but one thing is clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.760
they need to escape asap not just that but they&nbsp;
need to escape with as many kids as possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.000
and so the preparation begins whenever you need&nbsp;
to escape an unescapable place you need to act&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
cautiously and steady just like Andy Dufrense did&nbsp;
prepare diligently but don't let you be exposed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.200
right the best way to do that is befriend your&nbsp;
enemy as if you were trying to get that promotion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.960
from your slimy and ungrateful boss Emma has&nbsp;
a hard time doing that and we can't blame her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.640
she's just a kid ever since she has seen that&nbsp;
whole thing last night she's been on edge she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.440
almost losing it when looking into her foster&nbsp;
mom's eyes the next morning that woman literally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.960
breeds children here how many of our dear friends&nbsp;
and siblings have we let go throughout the years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.680
thinking they were living a good life out there&nbsp;
when in all actuality their brains were slurped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.960
out like monkeys in foreign restaurants this is a&nbsp;
terrible situation and we need to get out of here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.920
but there are challenges we need to beat first&nbsp;
first of all our prison is surrounded by a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.240
massive wall pretty steep wall as well if we were&nbsp;
only a handful of people that would borderline be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:51.040
okay but not with over a dozen children also mama&nbsp;
seems to have a compass that can locate each kid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.760
although if we're honest that thing looks more&nbsp;
like something to find the dragon balls which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.360
not gonna lie would solve our problem instantly so&nbsp;
not just do we have to climb a steep wall with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.800
dozen children or so which is impossible to climb&nbsp;
unless you know how to manipulate your chakra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.200
but i guess we don't so we need to take use&nbsp;
of either a good old rope or find something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.800
that is also known as a ladder we also have&nbsp;
to avoid being located by that radar thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:23.520
plus somehow escape giant monsters that want to&nbsp;
eat our brains sure let's do this now at this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.040
point in the movie our protagonists find out that&nbsp;
their mother is aware of their plan the fact that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.440
she has blatantly shown the power of her radar to&nbsp;
find each kid by just one glance was an act of war&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:42.160
but it also shows that she is overconfident in her&nbsp;
ability to keep us under control that buys us time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.960
before we continue to beat this movie though with&nbsp;
the help of mike tyson i might say let's look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.400
our character's next moves they need to convince&nbsp;
the other siblings and that's a challenge because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:59.200
it's risky because if just one kid makes a tantrum&nbsp;
we are screwed the thing is one of the main rules&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.680
in this orphanage is that without hard evidence&nbsp;
of our conspiracy mom cannot contact the hq&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.400
for intervention so as long as we stay low key we&nbsp;
are good to go so three major things happen next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.400
Ray joins the game the third and last protagonist&nbsp;
in this movie he's another genius and is a great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.240
asset to our character's plot together they forged&nbsp;
their master plan by looking for clues in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.840
local library they find multiple cues hinting at&nbsp;
what is actually happening in this world the story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.080
goes like this long time ago demons have overrun&nbsp;
humanity after years upon years of war and killing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.520
each other the humans and demons concluded that&nbsp;
there must be a better way a way for both of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:48.160
to co-exist without the need of constant war the&nbsp;
problem is the only thing that demons can eat are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:55.200
human brains yes this conflict sort of reminds me&nbsp;
of the conflict in tokyo ghoul although here they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.040
solved it more politically correct i guess that's&nbsp;
what happens when you release a movie in 2020&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.960
anyway to settle that conflict the world was&nbsp;
split into two halves on the demon side human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.400
children would be bred in various orphanages as&nbsp;
told at the beginning each kid will be served&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.800
as a demon-style thanksgiving turkey before the&nbsp;
age of 16. essentially they were born to die now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.400
this would frighten me but it would also give me&nbsp;
kind of hope because if we aren't the only orphans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.240
out there there must be dozens of other high iq&nbsp;
children and teenagers that would team up with us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.680
if we could contact them then we could overthrow&nbsp;
that whole demon human conspiracy here just like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.280
the animals sit on animal farm considering that&nbsp;
our three characters might would do well to escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.400
on their own first connect with the teenagers&nbsp;
from other orphanages and then free all other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:53.360
kids with one carefully planned strike i'm talking&nbsp;
kids with guns okay kids with guns against massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.600
demon gorillaz i have also found this map online&nbsp;
obviously originating from the manga now as we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.200
see this map is perfect for a battle royale style&nbsp;
cleansing another interesting point though about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.680
this map is there is literally no other way out&nbsp;
than over the wall and then over the abyss unless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:18.240
of course we opt for a revolution and not for&nbsp;
an escape what are you for revolution or escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.480
let me know now whatever we decide to do we would&nbsp;
first need to get rid of our gps implants anyways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.280
for that there were multiple options that we&nbsp;
could go with we could inspired by Van Gogh cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.840
off our ears that would be clean or maybe not so&nbsp;
clean if i think about it but it would be simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.120
or we could do what our kids do scavenge items&nbsp;
and construct a device that is capable of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.000
electroluting our earlobes to short-circuit&nbsp;
the chip you can do that if you're a genius&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
i would do it differently i would summon mike&nbsp;
tyson version 28 june 1997 and have this dude&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.120
bite my ear off if you go to escape i mean you&nbsp;
got to do it with style right but it isn't all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.400
that easy because mama knows what's up so&nbsp;
she employs another caretaker who in reality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:10.160
is a ___ now not only is she a snitch nope she's&nbsp;
also creepy as hell if a man tried running behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.440
kids like this best believe he's not just&nbsp;
canceled he is brand marked for life the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:21.520
second thing is new allies Emma, Norman and Ray&nbsp;
are able to convince a bunch of other kids about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.200
what is actually happening together with them they&nbsp;
create a plan on how to escape with the other kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.200
they plan on using a rope to surmount the wall so&nbsp;
let me recap we gotta climb the wall dodge mama's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:39.760
radar summon mike tyson for a second and perhaps&nbsp;
in the best case exploit the new caretaker's greed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.880
to play her out against mama meanwhile we&nbsp;
find out that Ray in order to survive provided&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.960
info to mama as a spy at this moment though&nbsp;
this kind of comes in handy he traps sister&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.440
crony by telling mama about her ambitions&nbsp;
which leads to an early game over for her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.600
a secret that we learn from that incident as well&nbsp;
is that each mother of each orphanage used to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.920
an orphan herself if this is true then i would&nbsp;
dead sure try to manipulate them emotionally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:17.360
essentially try to get them teaming up with us by&nbsp;
using sentimental slurs that i have picked up by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.960
watching average kdrama series you see apart from&nbsp;
sister cronin joining the house later in the movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:28.640
it was only one person mama that was taken care&nbsp;
of this place that's not very secure if you think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.760
about it we have also learned that it sometimes&nbsp;
takes months until another kid is being shipped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:39.520
for death meaning we have time another advantage&nbsp;
in corrupting mother lies in her knowing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:45.120
blueprint of the whole place with her sneaking&nbsp;
out picking up other orphans in other houses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:52.400
is completely possible and with an army of high&nbsp;
iq children a 25 year old i mean caretaker in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.920
the maid costume i really don't see the issue&nbsp;
here now before our kids can make the next move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:04.480
mama comes along and short-handedly breaks Emma's&nbsp;
leg all right that's uh that's kind of savage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:10.160
if i'd be one of these kids at this moment i'd&nbsp;
reconsider an escape and go for a takedown instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.000
you could armbar her into oblivion or smack her&nbsp;
hard like a russian dude in a slap competition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.120
whatever you do you need to KO her then tie&nbsp;
her up gag her and then take the kids i know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.520
that doesn't happen but i know you and me&nbsp;
both want to see that and don't you lie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:34.320
anyway though Emma is taken out that means no&nbsp;
escape for her at the same time this happens

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.680
mormon's shipment has been set for tomorrow&nbsp;
this is the last moment to make a final decision&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.280
what would you do in this situation&nbsp;
give yourself up for your friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.760
or fight and see what's gonna happen now&nbsp;
what i would do is probably somewhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.080
on the line of slipping on some juice&nbsp;
while being on my way to cut some onions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:03.520
with a big chef's knife while passing mother's&nbsp;
bed in the corner room upstairs and then of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:09.200
purely accidentally irreversibly injure her to&nbsp;
the point of no return and then i would probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.960
slip over the wall across the abyss until i&nbsp;
eventually slip into the human part of this world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:22.320
sorry demons be gone jokes aside there is only so&nbsp;
much you can do right if you escape your friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:28.080
will be shipped instead of you which is not too&nbsp;
bad but kind of cheap if you surrender then it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:35.040
over and if you fight well you have a chance now&nbsp;
Norman decides to run away so he packs his stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.800
says goodbye and goes climbing up the wall this&nbsp;
is the moment where he for the first time realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.920
that there is a huge abyss on the other side&nbsp;
impossible to overcome without a proper plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.520
he returns is able to quickly let the other two&nbsp;
characters know about the abyss behind the wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:57.440
and then get shipped off let's have a minute&nbsp;
of silence for Norman okay thanks alright even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:02.800
though we lack one genius now we do know the last&nbsp;
bit of the puzzle the steep cliff and that's why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:10.240
norman is a hero but our characters do what great&nbsp;
characters always do escape with a bang now what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.360
they essentially do is hide food and tools around&nbsp;
the forest that's a smart move because they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.440
been playing hide and seek almost every day in&nbsp;
the past meaning it doesn't appear suspicious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.560
whatsoever then when the night finally&nbsp;
arrives we get a dramatic performance by Ray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:36.000
yep that's what's up every good ending needs a&nbsp;
fire so what happens is due to the fire and Ray's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.240
subsequent death mother is so distracted that all&nbsp;
other kids are able to escape you see right next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:48.000
to Emma and now to see Norman is one of the most&nbsp;
valuable assets in this orphanage therefore she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.200
tries everything trying to get through the fire&nbsp;
to rescue him this is enough time for our kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.480
to make their way to the wall and eventually&nbsp;
even climb up and as surprise would have it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:04.880
Ray survived as well amazing and here is how he&nbsp;
did it he cut off part of his ear threw it into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:10.400
the fire alongside some of his clothes and escaped&nbsp;
with the others and mama relying onto her children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.920
radar of course wasted too much time to realize&nbsp;
what's going on now that was a pretty slick move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:22.000
not gonna lie i approve to cross the abyss though&nbsp;
they have thought of a zipline of course they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.360
have they are kids after all now can we please&nbsp;
enjoy the setting of this escape for a second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.680
if i were a nine year old watching this movie i&nbsp;
would have fanboyed so hard i would have turned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:37.360
into a fan girl however as much as i like&nbsp;
his conclusion in my opinion taking out mama&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.760
and trying to reach out to the other orphans in&nbsp;
different orphanages would have been the ultimate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:47.440
showdown but the most interesting bit with&nbsp;
this ending was when even mother at last didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.560
intervene and lets Emma escape meaning inside of&nbsp;
her there was still some humanity left proving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:57.600
that emotional manipulation could have worked&nbsp;
well now since you know that i'm into summoning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.800
mike tyson and caretakers and maid costumes well&nbsp;
what have you done would you accept your fate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.560
as demon food or would you revolt and try to get&nbsp;
out of there well let me know thanks for watching
