00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.600
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.
Today I will show you a drama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.920
sci-fi, thriller film from 2018, titled Level 16.
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.280
The film opens with a sequence introducing the&nbsp;
viewer to the two main characters as little girls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.520
Vivien and Sophia. They are still at level 10&nbsp;
of their special boarding school that works&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.240
as a foster home for young women as well. Their&nbsp;
friendship and bond can be seen as they get ready&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.840
for bed and discuss their hopes and dreams&nbsp;
when they finally get adopted by a family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.240
Vivien tells her friend Sophia that once she's&nbsp;
chosen she will say that she won't go anywhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.560
without her. They hear the bell and proceed&nbsp;
to the hall for the night washing regimen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.640
All the girls from level 10 form a line&nbsp;
toward the sink, carrying their own soap.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.120
The first girl that washes her face shows the&nbsp;
camera how she cleans herself. When the line&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.680
moves, Sophia drops her soap, but she has a lot&nbsp;
of trouble finding it because her eyesight is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.320
terrible so she calls Vivian for help. The girl&nbsp;
drops out of the line to help her, but she gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.560
back to the sink too late and misses her turn to&nbsp;
wash her face, pleading to the camera that she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.960
doing it. The other girls turn to the wall and&nbsp;
Sophie doesn't react to Vivian's begging to tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.800
them why she missed her spot as the guards come&nbsp;
in the hall and drag her away from the others.&nbsp;

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.160
Some years later, Vivian is on level 15 and&nbsp;
listens to the lecture about cleanliness with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.200
others. She has become the top girl on her floor&nbsp;
and is grown into a rule follower, with a somber&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.680
look in her eye because of all the punishment she&nbsp;
got. One night Ava talks to her in the darkness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.000
about another girl from their group who she's&nbsp;
worried asks too many questions. The next day the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.560
girls are ordered to stand for assembly and Brixil&nbsp;
arrives in the room, sizing them up and informing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.720
them that they will all be moving on to level 16&nbsp;
which is the final one in the school before they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.160
get adopted by new families. She calls the guards&nbsp;
and reads the names of the three girls Rita, Ava,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.880
and Vivian that will be placed in the Rose Hall&nbsp;
on level 16. They're taken to the next level by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.000
a limping guard and find their hall. Once they&nbsp;
enter, the girls introduce each other, when Sophia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.640
appears and recognizes Vivian, however, Vivian&nbsp;
ignores her and places her dominance over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.520
other girls by telling them that she will be their&nbsp;
top girl. She recites the four feminine virtues:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.960
obedience, cleanliness, patience, and humility to&nbsp;
remind the others what she will expect from them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.280
That night they take their supplementary&nbsp;
vitamins, then grab some lunch in the cantina.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.320
Ava is the only one talking, gossiping rather when&nbsp;
the lights go out. Another girl comments something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.960
about their school because she's disappointed that&nbsp;
the new level looks worse than the previous ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.080
Ava scolds her for sounding angry, which is one&nbsp;
of the vices when Vivian leaves. Sophia corners&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.320
her in the bathroom and Vivian shows her just how&nbsp;
angry she is about what happened on level 10 when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.800
they are called into an assembly. Brixil brings&nbsp;
them some new clothes, saying that the dresses are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.440
meant to make them look like daughters from a top&nbsp;
society family. Before they tuck in for the night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.640
she tells the girls to leave the dresses&nbsp;
to air out for the night and that they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.400
wear them the next day and sleep in them the&nbsp;
next night as a reward for virtuous behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.120
That night, all the girls are excited about what&nbsp;
the dresses mean for their eventual adoption.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.400
Sophia is the only one who seems perturbed.&nbsp;
In the next shot, the lights go out and all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.200
the girls fall asleep, except Sophia.
The next day, Sophia finds Vivian to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.080
share something really important with&nbsp;
her convinced that she can trust her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.120
Vivian, however, isn't interested in anything she&nbsp;
has to say because of the grudge she still holds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.320
against her. Regardless, Sophia tells her not to&nbsp;
take her vitamin that night and see what happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.280
Ava interrupts them to ask Vivian for help. When&nbsp;
they step outside she asks Vivian what's wrong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.440
with Sophia and if she is unclean which sends&nbsp;
Vivian into a rant, telling her never to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.520
that about another girl and never to act as if the&nbsp;
two of them are friends because no such thing can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.080
exist in the school. All of the girls take the&nbsp;
vitamins that day, but Vivian spits it out in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.200
the bathroom after. Later, everyone falls asleep&nbsp;
the moment their heads touch their pillows, except&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.400
for Vivian and Sophia. Vivian marks the days&nbsp;
passed on level 16 on her bedpost with her pin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.840
and when she lies back down, she tries to speak to&nbsp;
Ava, but when she won't answer, Sophia gets up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.160
tells her that she won't answer back because she's&nbsp;
sedated. Vivian doesn't believe they would lie to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.000
them about the vitamins that are meant to protect&nbsp;
them from the unclean air and dirty water on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.880
outside. Sophia doesn't explain further just tells&nbsp;
her to pretend she's asleep and when the guards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.840
come to call out if she needs help. They suddenly&nbsp;
hear them coming and Sophia runs to her bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.240
Brixil walks in with the guards and points&nbsp;
to Vivian and another girl to be taken away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.560
The guards carry the two girls to another level&nbsp;
of the school and place them in a showroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.560
The guard with the limp creepily touches Vivian's&nbsp;
face, prompting the other guard to tell him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.800
stop it. When they leave, Vivian opens her&nbsp;
eyes and is shocked about what she sees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.680
She pretends to be asleep when Brixil walks in&nbsp;
with the customers. Brixil talks about their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.320
skin as if it is the thing they will be shopping&nbsp;
for. The woman looks at herself in the mirror,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.200
when Brixil offers them some Champaign and leaves.&nbsp;
The husband comments how perfect the girls' skin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.480
is, never damaged by a single ray of sunlight. The&nbsp;
woman has second thoughts and they argue, but when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.800
Brixil comes back they make a decision on which&nbsp;
girl they will buy, so she takes the husband back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.760
to her office to complete the transaction. Later,&nbsp;
she oversees the guard taking the other girl for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.640
the buyers. When they exit the room, Sophia runs&nbsp;
over to Vivian and tells her that they must make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.680
their escape because Brixil has left the door&nbsp;
unlocked which never happens. Vivian, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.080
is still in shock about what she experienced.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, before they can do anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.440
Brixil comes back and takes Sophia away too, but&nbsp;
leaves the door unlocked again. Vivian exits the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.240
room cautiously hiding from the cameras when Miss&nbsp;
Brexil comes back. She gets a phone call from her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.400
boss and tells him that she doesn't want to leave&nbsp;
one of the guards unsupervised with the girls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.880
They take away one more girl and she leaves.&nbsp;
Vivian checks the main door on the floor but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.120
can't open it when she hears the limping guard&nbsp;
come back and returns to her bed quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.880
He brings Sophia back who says that the door&nbsp;
is locked and they've missed their opportunity.&nbsp;

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.160
The following day, Sophia tells Vivian that&nbsp;
she stopped with the vitamins on level 13,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.720
but that she's the only one that knows. Vivian&nbsp;
defends the school, thinking there must be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.120
reason why they're drugging them. Later,&nbsp;
Vivian goes in to see the doctor. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.840
the first time she meets Miro. He gives her a&nbsp;
vaccine, saying that there was an outbreak on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.480
one of the other levels and they need to protect&nbsp;
the others from the disease. Next, he asks her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.960
if she has any skin conditions she would like to&nbsp;
report and she says that there is only one thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.760
When the doctor asks her to show him, Vivian says&nbsp;
it's just a sleep scab that all the girls get.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.920
Miro gives her some kind of ointment but tells her&nbsp;
that she should continue using the soap for it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.480
tell the other girls that have sleep scabs to do&nbsp;
the same. Rita walks up to her when she leaves the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.800
doctor's office and tells her that they'll be&nbsp;
watching a movie that night. Later, the girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.000
watch an old-timey movie to which Rita knows all&nbsp;
the lines the actors say. At bedtime, Vivian and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.560
Sophia talk about what they've learned so far.&nbsp;
Sophia tells her about what she has been doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.040
at night all those years, which is mostly nothing&nbsp;
because the doors are locked and the other asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.520
She can only listen to the other halls and hears&nbsp;
them go through their 5-hour day just like them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.600
Between the waking times of the different halls,&nbsp;
there is a dark hour when everyone is asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.000
Vivian thinks that if they get an opportunity&nbsp;
to escape they should do it during their time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.480
but Sophia is worried about the cameras. Vivian&nbsp;
doesn't think the cameras are really monitored&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.120
by anyone based on her experience from the&nbsp;
night before. Sophia suddenly realizes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.960
they should tell the other girls from their hall&nbsp;
about everything, but Vivian is adamant that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.040
shouldn't. She knows what will happen if one of&nbsp;
the others rats them out and what the punishment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.360
downstairs will be like since she has felt it&nbsp;
before when she tried helping Sophia on level 10.&nbsp;

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.360
Sometime later, Vivian goes to speak to the doctor&nbsp;
again. She notices that he enters and exits with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.760
a card, like all the other school employees.&nbsp;
She takes a seat in his office and tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.160
that she likes his glasses, then says that Sophia&nbsp;
has really bad eyesight and that she might need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.960
glasses too. Miro insists on what she wanted&nbsp;
to know when she came to see him, and Vivian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.760
asks if she was named after a famous actress. He&nbsp;
tells her that she was named after Vivian Leigh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.080
who was a very beautiful woman and that because he&nbsp;
chooses the movies for the girls on movie night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.640
he will choose a movie with her for the next one.&nbsp;
Vivian tells him that, unlike the other girls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.800
she doesn't enjoy the experience of a movie night&nbsp;
as much, because they just end up seeing the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.280
movies all the time. The doctor calls her a&nbsp;
selfish girl and leads her out of the office,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.360
then tells her not to share their chat with&nbsp;
anyone else because Brixil won't approve of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.760
Before she leaves, he tells her to follow the&nbsp;
rules, be patient and let them take care of her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.320
Later, the girls play chess in the cantina&nbsp;
when one of them gets some sort of attack,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.760
convulsing and vomiting on the&nbsp;
floor. Some think that she's sick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.280
while Ava says that she's probably unclean&nbsp;
and that they should call for the guards.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.200
Sophia doesn't think that's necessary&nbsp;
since the girl hasn't done anything wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.080
Ava, however, tells them that she doesn't want&nbsp;
to get infected, prompting Vivian to tell her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.120
to shut up, then pick up the girl and take her&nbsp;
to the bathroom to clean her up. After, Sophia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.280
runs into the girl in the hallway and sees that&nbsp;
her arm where she got the vaccine looks horrible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.640
then checks hers and Vivian's as well. She doesn't&nbsp;
think it's just a vaccine. Sophia says that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.720
should tell the other girls and devise a plan,&nbsp;
so Vivian asks if they should get help from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.440
doctor. Sophia doesn't understand how she&nbsp;
can trust him, but she realizes that Vivian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.880
has just stopped taking the vitamins and still&nbsp;
doesn't know everything that's been happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.920
She tells Vivian that the guard with a limp comes&nbsp;
into their room at night and touches the girls.&nbsp;

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.400
The following movie night begins with a lecture on&nbsp;
skincare when a problem with the TV in the lecture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.520
room appears. Ava tells the girls not to ask any&nbsp;
questions because curiosity is the first vice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.040
Then, the TV shows a Vivian Leigh film, to the&nbsp;
delight of Vivian. The next time she sees the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.200
doctor, she thinks he's on her side and tells him&nbsp;
that she loved the film because the actress was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.400
very strong and empowered. Miro doesn't like her&nbsp;
answer and begins to scold her, but Vivian insists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.880
that there is something wrong. He asks if she's&nbsp;
been taking her vitamins because she seems upset.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.400
Vivian lies that she has and he tells her that she&nbsp;
sounds angry. She tells him that she isn't angry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.640
aware that it is the first vice so the doctor&nbsp;
reminds her that the vices lead to hysteria which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.120
is a serious health risk for young women. Miro&nbsp;
gets ready to give her a stronger version of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.120
vitamin, saying that it's the better alternative&nbsp;
to calling the guards on her which he would do if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.840
another girl exhibited the same behavior as her.&nbsp;
She conforms out of fear but pretends she's doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.240
it out of obedience. The doctor gives her the&nbsp;
shot and tells her that she's not being punished,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.640
but that he only wants to help her. Vivian gets&nbsp;
really dizzy because of the shots which she has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.120
been getting constantly. She can barely walk&nbsp;
and function, but she persists nevertheless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.680
One night Sophia goes to talk to her and Vivian&nbsp;
tells her that her head feels heavy and the days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.080
blur together. Sophia tells her that she has&nbsp;
a new plan on how to get them out of there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.960
but that they have to steal a card from the&nbsp;
guards, which upsets Vivian. Ava decides to report&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:12.240
Vivian for unclean behavior. Meanwhile, Sophia&nbsp;
and Vivian concoct a plan to steal the card from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.520
the molesting, limping guard. Suddenly, they are&nbsp;
called to assembly and Brixil grabs Vivian to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.240
her to her punishment. She puts her into a kind of&nbsp;
solitary because she doesn't want to immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.880
send her downstairs to get physical punishment.&nbsp;
Brixil tells her to reflect on the four feminine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.520
virtues and she might let her out in the morning.&nbsp;
In the next shot, Brixil goes to unwind in her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:36.160
apartment and is quickly joined by Miro. They talk&nbsp;
about their boss when the doctor tells her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.320
he wants them to restock the school. Brixil&nbsp;
doesn't want to, but he tells her that with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.800
the advancements he has made they can start with&nbsp;
12-year-olds instead of young children. She wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.960
them to end the project in three years as planned&nbsp;
because the facility is falling apart, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.800
seems that their boss won't allow that to happen&nbsp;
and the doctor is too afraid to go against him.&nbsp;

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.080
As the night passes with Vivian in solitary,&nbsp;
Sophia prepares a rope for the guard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.760
He comes into their room as expected and when&nbsp;
he touches one of the girls she attacks him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.480
Unfortunately, she doesn't knock him out as&nbsp;
much as she thinks she has and she gets caught.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.800
Sophia struggles with the guard when he knocks&nbsp;
her over. Before he can do anything to her she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.760
hits him with an iron over the head and steals his&nbsp;
card. Then, Sophia goes to get Vivian but when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.560
alarm blares, she panics and leaves her there.&nbsp;
Brixil gets her out of confinement the next day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.200
and takes her to an assembly where she informs the&nbsp;
girls that Sophia stole a card. Since she doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.760
have it on her, Brixil thinks she gave it to one&nbsp;
of them. She gives the girls the opportunity to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.720
give themselves up and be spared heavy punishment.&nbsp;
Miro interrupts Brixil and goes on a hysterical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.800
rant about feminine values and the like, then&nbsp;
grabs Rita and tells the others that if they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.960
don't give back the card, she will be punished and&nbsp;
another one each day until the card is returned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.440
As the girls leave, Vivian sees the doctor&nbsp;
give Brixil new sedatives to give them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.200
She's made to take the pill and fully inspected by&nbsp;
Brixil. That night, the girl tries to stay awake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.240
barely. She stumbles over to Sophia's bed, looking&nbsp;
for the card and when she doesn't find it there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.880
she finds it hidden in her own bed. Unfortunately,&nbsp;
the card doesn't work on the door anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:08.000
Vivian slides down and cries, then hears&nbsp;
someone outside the door. She figures out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.280
a new way to get the door open, by using the card&nbsp;
to loosen the screws. When she finally undoes it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.440
she stumbles through the hallway, and Brixil,&nbsp;
who's in the doctor's office hears her so she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.320
prepares a sedative, and waits. She hears&nbsp;
the girl outside and tells her to come in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.800
Vivian walks inside and confronts her about&nbsp;
Sophia, confusing the woman because they had taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.440
measures to prevent friendships from happening in&nbsp;
the school. Brixil tells her that Sophia is fine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.680
and that when she gives her the vitamin she'll&nbsp;
take her down to see her. She attacks Vivian,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.880
but the girl knocks her down, sedates her, and&nbsp;
restrains her. Then, Vivian goes downstairs to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:46.640
the cells, finds Sophia, and releases her. Sophia&nbsp;
is happy that she came back for her. They leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:51.040
the cells so Vivian can find something to untie&nbsp;
her and they walk into a room with surgical tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.200
Vivian uncovers three bodies in the back of&nbsp;
the room and the girls find out that one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.360
them is Rita. When they check her body they see&nbsp;
that her skin has been removed from her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.160
Sophia realizes that they will do the same to the&nbsp;
other girls and says that they have to help them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.800
but Vivian disagrees and tells her that she won't&nbsp;
help her free the other girls. They separate and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.120
Sophia goes back inside the school to release&nbsp;
the other girls. She finds the ones from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.520
hall that's in the waking shift and tells them to&nbsp;
wake up all the other girls from their level. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.600
of the girls assemble in one of the lecture rooms&nbsp;
and Sophia is ready to explain why they're there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.960
Meanwhile, Vivian goes to the client level and&nbsp;
finds a video about what they actually do there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.680
The school is actually a company that provides the&nbsp;
services of facial rejuvenation by finding ideal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.640
subjects for skin transfer. After that, Vivian&nbsp;
brings Brixil to the girls and explains that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.880
the school is actually a farm for their skin and&nbsp;
all the girls that were supposedly adopted were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:46.400
actually killed, including Rita. Brixil says that&nbsp;
she can't help them, but Vivian confronts her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.800
saying that even though she might not have killed&nbsp;
those girls herself, she aided in their death. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.040
girls realize that she has had a skin graft as&nbsp;
well so they shove her in solitary confinement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.760
and leave her there while they escape the school.&nbsp;
The moment they step outside, an alarm blares and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.720
while the other girls escape, Vivian and Sophia&nbsp;
get captured by the liming guard. They struggle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.040
with him and kill him, then they run with the&nbsp;
rest. Other guards begin to chase them and all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:14.160
of the girls scatter, hiding in different places.&nbsp;
Vivian and Sophia hide in a shed and two of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.200
guards find them instantly. Miro joins them&nbsp;
suddenly and they inform him of the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.640
He talks to Vivian through a window and&nbsp;
tries to manipulate her into coming back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:27.360
but the girl deflects his lies. When she sees&nbsp;
that there is no escape from her situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.000
Vivian asks how much her face is worth and Miro&nbsp;
tells her that it's worth 16 years of his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.200
She laughs and cuts up her face to prevent him&nbsp;
from being able to use it. Miro is devastated and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.120
when the two guards tell him that they have to get&nbsp;
him to his boss because of his massive mistake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.440
it's obvious that he'll get what he deserves.&nbsp;
The next day, the girls are found in the shed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:50.080
by the police. They walk out of the shed and&nbsp;
see the Sun for the first time in their life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.760
The final image of the movie is of the&nbsp;
two friends holding hands, finally free.
