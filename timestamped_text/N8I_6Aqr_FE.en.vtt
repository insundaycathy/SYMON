00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.880
the film begins with a dream of the main&nbsp;
character where her reality is submerged in water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.480
reflecting her dual nature which will&nbsp;
be revealed fully throughout the story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.000
her alarm goes off and everything returns to&nbsp;
normal as she wakes alisa esposito a mute woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.240
that lives an uneventful life starts her wake-up&nbsp;
routine before work by running the bath and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.120
putting some eggs in boiling water as the timer&nbsp;
for the eggs ticks she takes a refreshing bath&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.080
later she packs her dinner and makes an extra&nbsp;
plate for her next door neighbor and close friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.320
alisa gives giles the food and sits with him&nbsp;
for a moment watching an old musical on tv&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.200
they both enjoy the dancing and when she leaves&nbsp;
elisa dances in the hallway on her way out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.400
leaving the building she runs into her landlord&nbsp;
who also runs a cinema theater in the building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.040
then proceeds to the bus station to catch her&nbsp;
ride to work alisa arrives at the super secret&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.600
government research facility for the night shift&nbsp;
where her co-worker and best friend zelda keeps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.240
a spot for her in the line to punch her time card&nbsp;
the two women proceed to do their job as part of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.040
the cleaning staff until they reach a special&nbsp;
secret lab housing a pool fleming the chief of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.080
security introduces dr hof steedler as the main&nbsp;
scientist responsible for overseeing the new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.040
asset that is to arrive in that lab as fleming&nbsp;
sets up the importance of the asset it arrives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.920
in a pressure tank accompanied by a government&nbsp;
agent strickland while the men from the facility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.240
coordinate with him alisa has a little look-see in&nbsp;
the tank after she hears the creature howling from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.360
inside it reacts to her touch on the tank alarming&nbsp;
hofstealer of their presence and prompting him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.640
to get them out of a lab because the creature had&nbsp;
become agitated the next day alisa and giles go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.600
his favorite restaurant to get key lime pie giles&nbsp;
has a little chat with the bartender thinking that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.160
he might have a chance with him in the future&nbsp;
in the next shot he and elisa are eating the pie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.400
at his place making it apparent that the desert&nbsp;
is awful and that he only goes to that shop for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.280
the guy the following night alisa and zelda are&nbsp;
cleaning the washroom when strickland comes in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.240
he washes his hands before he pees then does&nbsp;
his business while the women are still there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.400
alisa wants to move the cattle prod he has left&nbsp;
on the washroom counter but he tells her not to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.760
touch it explaining how powerful and dangerous it&nbsp;
is then he introduces himself and explains why he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.400
doesn't wash his hands after going something that&nbsp;
should tell them a lot about his character before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.800
he leaves strickland kindly greets the women&nbsp;
making it seem like he's taken a little bit of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.880
liking to elisa zelda hates him already later the&nbsp;
two are taking out the garbage from the hallways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.800
when they hear the door from the lab where the&nbsp;
asset was taken open then see strickland come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.120
out of their bleeding the other scientists and&nbsp;
a few mps run over to help him and contain the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.920
asset while zelda pulls elisa away from the&nbsp;
scene moments later as they're eating dinner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.000
and talking about what they just witnessed fleming&nbsp;
comes over to get them so they can clean the lab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.960
when they get there they find the lab in an awful&nbsp;
bloody state but they still continue to mop it up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.320
suddenly lisa finds strickland's bit off fingers&nbsp;
and sticks them in a paper bag while zelda goes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.120
get fleming alisa finally gets a chance to see and&nbsp;
meet the amphibian man they're keeping in there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.840
zelda comes back with fleming and alisa&nbsp;
gives him the paper bag with the body parts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.360
the following morning alisa tells&nbsp;
giles everything about what happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.360
but he doesn't believe her about the creature&nbsp;
he shows her the latest ad he had painted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.200
which he needs to take into his former boss&nbsp;
and hopefully get paid or his old job back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.080
when giles meets with the boss he tells him that&nbsp;
he needs to repaint some of the details for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.240
client's instructions he also tells giles&nbsp;
that he'll see what he can do about his job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.560
that night alisa goes to work and heads&nbsp;
immediately to the lab to see the creature again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.920
she hears him in the pool and figures out a way to&nbsp;
get him to come out elisa cracks an egg and shows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.560
up above the water then she lures him over and&nbsp;
he slowly comes out of the water to take the egg&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.200
when she tries handing it over the amphibian&nbsp;
man freaks out so she puts it down gesturing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.120
word in sign language he calms and takes the egg&nbsp;
abruptly jumping back into the water zelda catches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.960
elisa coming out of the lab and tells her that&nbsp;
strickland wants to see them both in his office&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.080
in the next shot the women are already there for&nbsp;
a long and awkward conversation with strickland&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.320
who wants to know even more about them and&nbsp;
especially alisa he reads in her file that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.640
she was left orphaned as a baby and zelda tells&nbsp;
him that alisa was found by the river in the water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.960
strickland wants to thank her for finding his&nbsp;
fingers prompting her to return his wedding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.960
band back to him as he explains the surgery&nbsp;
in which the doctor stitched his fingers back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.240
he realizes that she's mute but not deaf so he&nbsp;
asks if the scars on her neck are the reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.680
she can't talk alisa doesn't think so because she&nbsp;
wasn't able to speak since she was a child before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.920
they leave strickland tells them to keep away from&nbsp;
the creature in the lab which he took from south&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.320
america and dragged back to the us he cautions&nbsp;
them that while the creature may look similar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.960
to a human that it's still a monster the women&nbsp;
leave when strickland gets a phone call from a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.080
general informing him that he will be visiting the&nbsp;
facility soon meanwhile the creature reminisces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.120
over elisa repeating the sign for an egg that&nbsp;
following night alisa waits for the scientists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.760
to leave the lab then takes out a record player&nbsp;
from her card and places it next to the pool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.080
she plays music for the amphibian man and serves&nbsp;
him a single egg while she also takes a bite from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.960
her sandwich he takes the egg without surfacing so&nbsp;
she pauses the music to make him come out and join&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.040
her surely enough the amphibian man pokes his&nbsp;
head out grunting and alisa unpauses the record&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.000
she teaches him the sign for music and he learns&nbsp;
it fast enjoying the music and their time together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.760
their dates continue in the following&nbsp;
nights coupled with boiling eggs and music&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.400
then eventually graduating to dancing hofstedler&nbsp;
walks in on them one night when he goes to bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.120
the creature it's dinner but he doesn't interrupt&nbsp;
them he realizes that he has come upon something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.200
significant about the asset so he contacts his&nbsp;
real bosses and meets with them at a separate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.840
location after sharing the password with the&nbsp;
security he's taken to another location to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.400
meet with the main soviet agent hofstedler gives&nbsp;
him all his notes on the creature in a blueprint&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.040
of the lab so they can plan its extraction he's&nbsp;
adamant about going forward with the extraction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.760
sooner because he thinks that the creature is an&nbsp;
intelligent being able to communicate the agent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.880
promises to pass that along to their superiors&nbsp;
alisa goes back to work taking care of the laundry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.960
for the facility where she learns how she can&nbsp;
disable the security camera if she needed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.000
later she covertly enters the lab and finds&nbsp;
the creature chained up and badly wounded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.240
alisa wants to help him but here's strickland&nbsp;
coming back and promptly hides in the lab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.120
the amphibian man screeches as&nbsp;
strickland comes back inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.160
strickland taunts him and tortures him with a&nbsp;
cattle prod remorselessly disturbing elisa as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.800
the general arrives at the lab and is immediately&nbsp;
stunned by the size and look of the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.760
strickland tells him that the native tribes in the&nbsp;
amazon where he found it worship the amphibian man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.480
like a god both strickland and the general think&nbsp;
that he doesn't look like much of a god when hof&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.120
stealer checks him and asks why he's bleeding the&nbsp;
scientist tells the general that the creature can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.920
alternate between two entirely separate breathing&nbsp;
mechanisms making him a very special and unique&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.720
living organism that can help future scientific&nbsp;
progress the general and strickland make fun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.440
of both him and the creature when hofsteadler&nbsp;
notices elisa in the lab he also realizes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.520
the amphibian man is having difficulty breathing&nbsp;
since he's been out of the water for too long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.640
and pleads with strickland to get him back in&nbsp;
strickland however continues with his presentation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.880
telling the general that they need to vivisect the&nbsp;
creature if they really want to know more about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.440
hofstedler disagrees and when the creature passes&nbsp;
out he orders the men to take him to the pressure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.920
tank then leaves with strickland and the general&nbsp;
to discuss the next steps concerning the asset&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.240
alisa hears it all and frantically follows them&nbsp;
back to strickland's office where she learns that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.120
the creature will be killed and dissected later&nbsp;
elisa tries to acquire giles's help to get the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.600
creature out of the facility however he doesn't&nbsp;
want to have anything to do with it fearing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.400
they'll be breaking the law alisa finally admits&nbsp;
to her love for the amphibian man who she thinks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.760
sees her the way no one has seen her before as a&nbsp;
person with no deficiencies even after her speech&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.000
giles isn't convinced saying that the creature&nbsp;
isn't even human so he leaves the apartment in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.360
hurry alisa storms after him signing that if they&nbsp;
don't help him they don't won't be human anymore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.000
giles ignores her plea again in the next shot&nbsp;
he meets with his boss who tells him that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.920
corrections aren't even necessary because the&nbsp;
client went in another direction and says that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.360
will never be hired back later charles goes back&nbsp;
to the restaurant to see his bae but unfortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.760
the moment he makes a move on him he learns that&nbsp;
not only is the man not gay but also a massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.880
homophobe even worse as an african-american&nbsp;
couple walks into the restaurant the man is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.280
revealed to be a massive racist too completely&nbsp;
disappointing giles on all possible levels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.760
feeling what it looks like to be treated like&nbsp;
an animal on his own skin giles finally grows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.960
a conscience and goes to alisa to tell her that he&nbsp;
will help her after all meanwhile ha steeler meets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.520
his soviet contacts again to inform them that&nbsp;
the creature will be vivisected his boss tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.240
him that he has two options either to delay the&nbsp;
procedure which is impossible or use a tool to cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.120
the power in the facility giving him enough time&nbsp;
to kill the creature himself the scientist hates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.840
the alternatives because his primary obligation is&nbsp;
to science and not any country's political motives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.080
however his boss tells him he has no other choice&nbsp;
simultaneously strickland buys an expensive car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.680
in a color he hates just because the man at&nbsp;
the shop tells him it's the cool new thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.040
that night while hof steedler takes care of the&nbsp;
amphibian man alisa stakes out the lab and its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.800
exits to figure out a way to get the creature&nbsp;
out of there and zelda catches a glimpse of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.200
planning something giles prepares his van to make&nbsp;
it look like one of the laundry vans that do the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.800
pickups from the facility later he and elisa go&nbsp;
over the plan which is to use fake documents to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.200
get to the lab by 5am while she takes care of the&nbsp;
cameras and gets the creature out in a laundry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.720
cart meanwhile hoss steeler prepares the poison&nbsp;
to kill the creature clearly unhappy about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.200
elisa goes back to the staff locker room just&nbsp;
as everybody gets ready to leave but she stays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.000
behind and gets back to the loading dock to move&nbsp;
the camera as she's doing that hof steedler makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.800
his final plea to strickland not to kill the&nbsp;
amphibian man while they argue he sees that elise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.200
is moving the cameras on the monitor and when he&nbsp;
realizes that strickland won't budge he decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.080
to help her instead alisa is already preparing the&nbsp;
laundry cart for the creature as zelda waits for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.960
her to come by the elevators then stays back and&nbsp;
goes searching for her when she doesn't show alisa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.840
goes to the lab with hof steeler already waiting&nbsp;
for her there she takes the amphibian man out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:51.120
the water and hofstedler approaches giving her the&nbsp;
keys to the chains he tells elisa what she needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.040
to do to keep the creature comfortable and gives&nbsp;
her a special mixture to put in his water to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.600
him alive he also tells her that he'll disable&nbsp;
the power which will give her five minutes then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.480
he'll meet her at the loading dock while elisa is&nbsp;
rolling the creature out of the lab jaws drives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.280
over there and hofstedler goes to find the main&nbsp;
power fuse giles arrives at the loading dock but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:14.080
is stopped by the mp at the gate while hofstedler&nbsp;
sets the timer on the gadget to cut the power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.880
in a fast sequence of events alisa brings the&nbsp;
creature out and zelda stops her while strickland&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.280
sees the van on the security camera from the gate&nbsp;
suspecting that something is wrong and calling the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.080
mp he runs over there as the mp points a gun at&nbsp;
giles to step out of the vehicle when suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.880
the power goes out hofstedler hurries lisa to&nbsp;
get the creature to the loading dock and zelda&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:38.560
finally decides to help then he kills the mp&nbsp;
so giles can have a clear path to get to alisa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.200
the four of them get the amphibian man into the&nbsp;
van and giles drives off leaving zelda and haas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.000
dealer behind giles crashes into strickland's&nbsp;
car because he's mesmerized by the creature's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.040
beauty giving the security enough time to catch&nbsp;
up to them and to start shooting fortunately the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.920
escape van makes it out of the facility and&nbsp;
strickland is pissed later alisa and giles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.560
get the creature comfortably into her bathtub so&nbsp;
he can start breathing they both rejoice because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.560
their plan worked as strickland investigates the&nbsp;
chain of events that allow the creature to escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:12.400
the following morning alisa forges a new plan on&nbsp;
how to set the amphibian man back into the ocean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.080
she'll have to wait for the october reigns to&nbsp;
come and release him in the canal so she writes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.360
it down in her calendar later alisa has a nice&nbsp;
moment with a creature showing their growing bond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.200
that night they all go back to work pretending&nbsp;
it's business as usual strickland questions alisa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.520
and zelda then realizes that whoever planned the&nbsp;
escape could not have been a simple member of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.480
cleaning staff and dismisses them convinced that&nbsp;
the creature was grabbed by highly trained agents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.960
meanwhile giles takes care of the amphibian&nbsp;
man in his apartment but when he falls asleep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.760
the creature hears the tv and leaves the&nbsp;
bathroom the amphibian man sees one of giles cats&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.880
then hunts and eats her getting caught by giles&nbsp;
in the act giles yells at him to stop scaring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.760
the creature terribly he reacts by attacking&nbsp;
giles as well and running out of the building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.720
before alisa and zelda leave work hofstealer&nbsp;
gives them another care package for the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.840
alisa tells him about her plan to release him and&nbsp;
calls him a good man suddenly she gets a phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.840
call from giles that the creature ran away so she&nbsp;
gets back to the apartments as fast as she can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.200
alisa finds the amphibian man in the downstairs&nbsp;
cinema drawn there by the sounds of the films&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.520
puzzled by what he's seeing they have a touching&nbsp;
moment together and then come back to tend to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.760
giles the creature has already learned that&nbsp;
the cats are off the menu and he tries to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.400
it right with giles for eating one of them he&nbsp;
places his hand on giles's head and his wound&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.600
blowing magnificently signifying that something&nbsp;
magical is happening meanwhile strickland calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.800
hof steedler to his office questioning him because&nbsp;
he suspects his involvement alisa and the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:44.000
continue to bond and fall in love one morning&nbsp;
alisa accepts his advances and walks into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.880
bathroom stripping her clothes suggesting they&nbsp;
will get intimate together the next night at work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:54.000
zelda catches her smiling and figures out she had&nbsp;
slept with the amphibian man so elisa explains how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.880
it all worked zelda is shocked and says never&nbsp;
trust a man even when he looks flat down there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.400
hofstedler gets a visit from his soviet comrades&nbsp;
who questioned him about the amphibian man as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.480
falsely thinking that he went ahead and killed&nbsp;
it he can tell that they're a little suspicious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.480
as well and gets ready to defend himself but&nbsp;
they leave telling him that they'll contact him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:18.000
when they have his extraction plan as time goes on&nbsp;
alisa and the amphibian man continue their loving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.560
affair and she almost floods the entire building&nbsp;
creating their own little aquarium in her bathroom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:28.160
giles catches them in the act stopping the flood&nbsp;
from getting worse but he relays no judgment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.240
moreover he might be starting to believe the&nbsp;
creature is really a god considering it healed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.360
both his wound and made his hair grow back with a&nbsp;
simple touch hofstedler finally gets the call from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.080
his comrades to meet them for his extraction and&nbsp;
lisa checks the docs because the reins had started&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.600
when she comes back home she realizes that&nbsp;
the creature is getting sick being out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.400
the water for so long meanwhile strickland&nbsp;
gets a visit from the general who pushes him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.200
even more to find the creature faster informing&nbsp;
him that if he doesn't find it he will lose his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.760
job with the government alisa realizes that the&nbsp;
date has come to release the creature back in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.560
ocean and during their meal together she finds a&nbsp;
way to express her love for him later she tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.960
zelda what's happening and when she checks on the&nbsp;
creature zelda says that she must release him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:14.480
night before zelda leaves she calls hofstedler to&nbsp;
ask him what to do but unfortunately he's already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:19.440
at the door and misses the call since strickland&nbsp;
is on to hofstetler he follows him when he leaves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.560
his apartment to go to the secret meeting place ha&nbsp;
steedler isn't getting extracted though when his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.560
compatriots arrive at the meeting place they&nbsp;
shoot him down but are killed by strickland&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.280
before they can finish him strickland tortures the&nbsp;
barely living scientist for information about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.680
creature and learns that it was the cleaning staff&nbsp;
who managed to fool him and release the creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.360
upon learning that strickland goes to&nbsp;
zelda's house to question her about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.440
but finds out the truth from her husband since&nbsp;
she wasn't willing to give up her friend as soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:50.400
as he leaves zelda calls elisa to tell her that&nbsp;
he's on his way alisa and giles make it to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.640
canals before strickland gets to her apartment and&nbsp;
are ready to say goodbye to the creature forever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:00.160
unfortunately strickland sees the date that elisa&nbsp;
has written in her calendar and follows them there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.240
so before the amphibian man can jump in&nbsp;
the water he shoots both him and elisa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.320
giles knocks him over stopping him from shooting&nbsp;
further and giving the creature enough time to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:13.360
heal his own wounds the amphibian man gets up&nbsp;
and promptly confronts strickland who shockingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.600
says that the creature is a god before the&nbsp;
amphibian man slashes strickland's neck open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.080
as strickland is dying and zelda arrives at the&nbsp;
dock with the police the creature takes elisa in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:27.760
his hands and jumps in the water zelda and giles&nbsp;
watch them go silently saying their farewells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.760
the creature heals elisa in the water and helps&nbsp;
her start breathing through the gills on her neck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:37.360
