00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.120
Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here. Before we&nbsp;
start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today, I’m going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.960
to recap the final part of the Squid Game series.&nbsp;
In this part, 2 last games will be played. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.040
committee and sponsors of the game will also&nbsp;
come to watch the game as the final unfolds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.440
So, who will bring all the prize money? Who is the&nbsp;
person behind the crazy games? Let’s find it out.&nbsp;

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.040
After surviving the game, the players are&nbsp;
surprised to see the Woman sleeping on her bed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.320
peacefully. Since no one was going to partner up&nbsp;
with ther, she is escorted back by the masked men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.080
as the rules imply. On the other hand, the Front&nbsp;
Man continues his search for the infiltrator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.120
He commands the masked men to be on watch since&nbsp;
the Game’s VIPs are coming to watch the finals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.080
The next day, the VIPs arrive and the Front&nbsp;
Man greets them on behalf of the Korean host.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.480
Aside from sponsoring the game,&nbsp;
the VIPs also bet on the players.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.080
Meanwhile, the Policeman looks for a chance to&nbsp;
expose the VIPs and collects some more evidence.&nbsp;

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.680
Before starting the fifth game, the players are&nbsp;
asked to wear numbered vests. The number on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.240
vests will decide their order in playing the&nbsp;
game. The players pick the middle numbers first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.200
in hope that they will have a greater chance of&nbsp;
surviving. Due to his indecisiveness, Seong is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.280
left with number 1 and 16, the first and the last&nbsp;
order. Initially, Seong wants to take number 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.040
but the other player begs him to give him&nbsp;
number 1 because he doesn’t want to be the last.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.120
As a result, Seong takes the last number. After&nbsp;
wearing their vests, the players are led to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.560
arena. A tall bridge with glass footholds lays&nbsp;
in front of them. The glass footholds are made of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.680
2 materials, a normal glass that will break when&nbsp;
stepped on, and a strong tempered glass that will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.680
not break. Within 16 minutes, they have to cross&nbsp;
the bridge safely, starting from number 1 to 16.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.080
Being the first player means that they have&nbsp;
to choose the foothold correctly to live,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.760
while being the last player means that they&nbsp;
have to cross the bridge within the time limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.080
One by one, the players take their turn and fall.&nbsp;
Some are able to take 2 steps, while most of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.520
are only able to take one step. As the time&nbsp;
goes, some players become impatient and push&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.640
the players in front of them. When the Mafia is at&nbsp;
the front, he doesn’t want to stake his life and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.080
stays at his foothold. Annoyed with his actions,&nbsp;
the Woman holds the Mafia’s body and intentionally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.000
falls with him. As the game continues, only&nbsp;
4 players left in the arena. Turns out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.360
the foremost player was a glass manufacturer&nbsp;
and can differentiate between the glass types.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.000
However, when he is about to identify the last&nbsp;
foothold, the Front Man turns the lights off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.120
to make the game more difficult. When the time is&nbsp;
almost up, Cho pushes the player to save himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.920
As a result, Cho, the Thief, and Seong&nbsp;
become the winners of the fifth game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.240
The glass footholds are blown up and some of&nbsp;
the fragments shatter and hit the players.&nbsp;

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.320
In the VIP room, the Policeman disguises&nbsp;
himself as a waiter and serves the VIPs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.240
When he brings a drink to a VIP, their eyes&nbsp;
meet and the VIP takes a liking to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.280
The Policeman is brought to the VIP’s bedroom&nbsp;
to further serve him. The Policeman decides to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.200
blow his cover and points his gun at the&nbsp;
VIP and interrogates him about the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.720
He also records all of the evidence with this&nbsp;
phone. After getting all of the evidence he needs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.080
the Policeman sneaks away from the arena to save&nbsp;
himself. He uses diving equipment without knowing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.920
that a tracker has been planted. With a radar,&nbsp;
the Front Man chases him to an isolated island.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.480
The Policeman tries to send the evidence&nbsp;
to his superior but receives no signal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.600
He walks up to a higher place but still with no&nbsp;
luck. The Front Man corners him to a cliff and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.800
tries to negotiate with him. Unbeknownst to him,&nbsp;
the Front Man is actually his long-lost brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.760
who he has been searching for. He asks for his&nbsp;
brother’s reason, but is shot down the cliff.&nbsp;

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.160
In the hall, the three finalists are invited&nbsp;
to a proper dinner as a reward. Despite being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.120
a finalist, the Thief is actually dying due to a&nbsp;
glass fragment stuck on her belly from the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.800
game. She uses her worn down clothing to slow the&nbsp;
bleeding and decides to bear the pain. During the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.600
dinner, Seong and Cho finish their meal, while&nbsp;
the Thief barely touches it due to her pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.160
While the masked men are cleaning the plates,&nbsp;
a small knife is left on each of the players’&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.600
tables. When the night comes, Seong tries to kill&nbsp;
Cho because of his actions during the last game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.320
However, he is stopped by the Thief,&nbsp;
saying that he is not a killer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.160
She also asks him to promise that he will&nbsp;
take care of her little brother if she dies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.040
Upon realizing that the Thief is bleeding,&nbsp;
Seong calls for the masked men to treat her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.960
Suddenly, the door opens and the masked men come&nbsp;
in with a casket. Turns out, Cho has stabbed the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.680
Thief to death. That incident enrages Seong&nbsp;
and he vows to kill Cho in the final round.&nbsp;

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.160
The next day, the finalists will play Squid Game&nbsp;
for the final round. In this game, Seong as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.200
attacker has to invade Cho’s area to win the&nbsp;
game. Even though the game looks complicated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.120
violence of any kind is allowed. Seong immediately&nbsp;
attacks Cho with his knife, and strangles him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.560
Their fight intensifies as rain drenches the&nbsp;
arena. At one point, Seong lets his guard down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.880
and Cho stabs his leg. However, Seong fights back&nbsp;
and corners Cho. With the knife in his hand, Seong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.080
tries to stab Cho but doesn’t have the heart to&nbsp;
do so. He decides to win the game without killing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.600
Cho. Upon realizing that the loser will be killed,&nbsp;
he tries to leave both the game and the prize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.880
through a vote to save Cho. However, Cho kills&nbsp;
himself and asks Seong to take care of his mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.840
After the incident, Seong is declared as&nbsp;
the champion and wins the 45.6 billion won.&nbsp;

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.520
Seong is sent back to his residence with&nbsp;
a debit card containing the prize money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.920
Despite his wealth, he is saddened due to his&nbsp;
friends’ death and chooses not to use the money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.920
He feels guilty about how he got the money and&nbsp;
decides to stay poor. When he comes home, he finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:14.560
that his mother has passed away. One year later,&nbsp;
his life becomes messier due to the frustration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.920
He suddenly receives the mysterious contact card&nbsp;
with an address and time on it. Upon arriving at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.680
the agreed time and place, he is surprised to see&nbsp;
the Old Man laying on a hospital bed. Turns out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.960
the Old Man is actually the game’s Korean host and&nbsp;
he participated to enjoy his last moments in life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.000
He also admits that he and the other VIPs make&nbsp;
the game because they are bored with their wealth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.960
They can only enjoy themselves by watching&nbsp;
people killing one another for the money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.080
Due to his frustration, Seong is infuriated&nbsp;
after hearing the confession. However, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.520
Old Man emphasizes that the players participate&nbsp;
based on their own consent. He made the rules to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.480
ensure free-will of the players in participating.&nbsp;
Then, he also thanks Seong for playing with him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.840
during his last moments. After thanking Seong,&nbsp;
the Old Man passes away due to the disease.&nbsp;

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.640
After meeting the Old Man, Seong decides to accept&nbsp;
his new life and use the prize money. He picks up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.600
the Thief’s little brother from the orphanage and&nbsp;
entrusts him to Cho’s mother. He also gives a part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.040
of the money to her to fulfill his promise to Cho&nbsp;
and the Thief. In the end, Cho decides to catch up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.240
with his Daughter in America. However, he sees&nbsp;
the man who recruited him into the game, trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.520
to round up new participants. He takes the contact&nbsp;
card away and calls the Front Man to threaten him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:35.200
to stop the crazy game. Still not satisfied with&nbsp;
the Front Man’s reply, he abandons his trip to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.080
America and is determined to uncover the game so&nbsp;
that no more innocent lives will be lost again.&nbsp;
