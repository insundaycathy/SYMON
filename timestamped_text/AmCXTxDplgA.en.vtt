00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:14.360
Peter Parker&nbsp;finds himself struggling to
balance his civilian life with his superhero

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:28.810
life as&nbsp;Spider-Man: he faces employment,
financial, and academic trouble, is estranged

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.359
from both his love interest&nbsp;Mary Jane Watson,
who continues to pine for him and his best

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.840
friend&nbsp;Harry Osborn, who blames Spider-Man
for his father&nbsp;Norman Osborn's death and

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.840
discovers that his&nbsp;Aunt May&nbsp;is facing&nbsp;eviction.
He also finds himself suffering temporary,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.980
but recurring losses of his powers, often
in life-threatening situations.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.460
Harry, who is now head of&nbsp;Oscorp's genetic
and scientific research division, is sponsoring

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.710
a&nbsp;fusion power&nbsp;project by nuclear scientist&nbsp;Otto
Octavius, who befriends and mentors Peter

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:01.519
after Harry introduces him. While handling
hazardous materials, Octavius wears a harness

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:10.560
of powerful&nbsp;robotic tentacle arms&nbsp;with&nbsp;artificial
intelligence. During a public demonstration

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.070
that Peter and Harry attend, a power spike
causes the fusion reactor to destabilize.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.380
Octavius refuses to shut down the reactor
despite the increasing instability and it

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.659
goes critical, killing his wife Rosalie, fusing
the harness to his spine, and burning the

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.340
inhibitor chip blocking the arms from his
nervous system. Peter, as Spider-Man, shuts

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:46.600
the experiment down, destroying it in the
process. At a hospital, doctors prepare to

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.869
surgically remove Octavius' harness; however,
without the inhibitor chip, the now-sentient

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:59.890
arms defend themselves by attacking and killing
the staff. Upon regaining consciousness and

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:07.310
seeing the carnage, Octavius escapes and takes
refuge at a harbor. Becoming increasingly

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.150
influenced by the arms' AI, he decides to
re-try his experiment. He robs a bank to fund

00:02:13.150 --> 00:03:09.060
a second experiment. Peter and May coincidentally
are there, and Octavius takes May hostage.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:17.930
Peter rescues her, but Octavius flees with
the stolen money. The&nbsp;Daily Bugle&nbsp;subsequently

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.239
dubs the scientist Doctor Octopus.

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.910
Mary Jane finds success as a&nbsp;Broadway&nbsp;actress
and becomes engaged to&nbsp;astronaut&nbsp;John Jameson,

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.620
the son of&nbsp;Bugle&nbsp;editor&nbsp;J. Jonah Jameson,
while Harry devastated and embarassed over

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.930
losing millions of dollars following Otto's
failed experiment, ends up further straining

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:42.290
his relationship with Peter. Peter suffers
an emotional breakdown over his inability

00:03:42.290 --> 00:04:10.750
to balance his life and loses his powers.
He quits being Spider-Man, returns to his

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:22.630
normal life, and unsuccessfully attempts to
reconcile with Mary Jane. A garbageman brings

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:34.690
Peter's costume to Jameson, who takes credit
for driving Spider-Man into hiding. Peter

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.860
tells May the truth behind his&nbsp;uncle Ben's
death and how he is responsible. May forgives

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.180
him, but the rise in&nbsp;New York City's crime&nbsp;rates
worries Peter.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.790
Meanwhile, requiring the isotope&nbsp;tritium&nbsp;to
fuel his reactor, Octavius visits Harry to

00:04:51.790 --> 00:05:00.340
demand it. Harry agrees in exchange for Spider-Man.
He tells Octavius to seek Peter, whom Harry

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:08.280
believes is friends with Spider-Man, but tells
Octavius not to harm him. Octavius locates

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:19.100
Peter, tells him to find Spider-Man, and captures
Mary Jane. Her endangerment leads to Peter's

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:29.030
powers returning. As Jameson admits that he
was wrong about Spider-Man, Peter steals his

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:36.551
costume back from the&nbsp;Bugle&nbsp;and goes after
Octavius. As Peter battles Octavius, they

00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:41.900
fall onto a&nbsp;New York City Subway&nbsp;train.
Octavius sabotages the controls and leaves

00:05:41.900 --> 00:06:25.250
Peter to save the passengers, which he does
at a great physical toll. When he faints from

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.880
exhaustion, the grateful passengers save him
from falling and bring him into the train,

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.490
seeing his unmasked face but promising to
keep their knowledge hidden. They unsuccessfully

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:44.970
try to protect him when Octavius returns to
capture Peter, whom Octavius delivers to Harry.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.530
After giving Octavius the tritium, Harry prepares
to kill Spider-Man, only to be shocked to

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:58.271
see Peter under the mask. Peter convinces
Harry to direct him to Octavius' lair, as

00:06:58.271 --> 00:07:03.340
bigger things are at stake.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.050
As Peter arrives at the doctor's waterfront
laboratory and attempts to rescue Mary Jane

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.590
discreetly, Octavius discovers him, and they
battle as the nuclear reaction swells and

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:22.130
starts threatening the city. Peter ultimately
subdues Octavius, reveals his identity, and

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:31.090
persuades Octavius to let his dream go for
the greater good. Octavius commands the tentacles

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:40.920
to obey him, and sacrifices himself to destroy
the experiment. Mary Jane sees Peter's true

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:46.150
identity and feelings, which he says is why
they cannot be together. Peter returns Mary

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:51.120
Jane to John, and leaves.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:58.080
Meanwhile, Harry is visited by a vision of
his father&nbsp;Norman&nbsp;in a mirror, pleading

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:04.930
for Harry to avenge his death. Enraged and
reluctant to hurt his friend, Harry shatters

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:09.650
the mirror, inadvertently revealing a secret
room containing prototypes of the&nbsp;Green Goblin's

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:25.550
equipment. On her wedding day, Mary Jane abandons
John at the altar and runs to Peter's apartment,

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.140
telling Peter that she is willing to accept
the risks of being in a relationship with

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:34.510
him and that she loves him. After they kiss,
they hear police sirens, and Mary Jane encourages

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:48.840
him to go help as Spider-Man.
