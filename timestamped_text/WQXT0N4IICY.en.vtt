00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:15.440
Five years after Godzilla defeated King Ghidorah,
Kong is monitored by Monarch within a giant

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.419
dome on Skull Island.

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:24.320
Kong is visited by Jia, the last Iwi native
and adopted daughter of Kong expert Ilene

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.029
Andrews. Jia is deaf and communicates with
Kong via sign language.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:36.170
Bernie Hayes, an employee of Apex Cybernetics
and host of a Titan conspiracy theory podcast,

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.989
extracts data suggesting sinister activities
at a Pensacola facility.

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.780
However, Godzilla suddenly attacks the facility;
during the rampage, Bernie stumbles on a massive

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.870
device.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.920
Madison Russell, a fan of Bernie's podcast,
enlists her friend Josh to investigate Godzilla's

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.920
attacks.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.920
Apex CEO Walter Simmons recruits Nathan Lind,
former Monarch scientist, and Hollow Earth

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.140
theorist, to guide a search for a power source
into the Hollow Earth, the homeworld of the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.140
Titans.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.429
Nathan is initially hesitant as his brother
died in an expedition to the Hollow Earth

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:15.160
due to a strong reverse-gravitational effect.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.920
He agrees after Walter reveals that Apex has
developed HEAVs, specialized crafts that are able to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.810
withstand the pressure exerted by the gravity
field.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.119
Nathan meets with Ilene and convinces her
to let Kong guide them through the Hollow

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.430
Earth via an outpost in Antarctica.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.090
Nathan, Ilene, and an Apex team led by Walter's
daughter Maia board a modified barge escorted

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.670
by the U.S. Navy that carries a sedated and
restrained Kong.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.080
Godzilla attacks the convoy and defeats Kong
but retreats after the ships disable their

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.240
power and trick him into thinking they are
destroyed.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.369
To avoid alerting Godzilla, Kong is airlifted
to the Hollow Earth entrance, and Jia convinces

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.489
him to enter the tunnel while the team follows
him in the HEAVs.

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:03.539
Madison and Josh find Bernie, who joins their
investigation.

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.970
They sneak into the wrecked Apex base, discover
a secret facility underground, and are inadvertently

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.020
locked into an underground monorail transport
to Apex headquarters in Hong Kong, where they

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.250
unwittingly stumble on a test of Mechagodzilla.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.430
It is telepathically controlled by Ren Serizawa, through

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.129
the neural networks from the skull of a severed
Ghidorah head, but is hobbled by its power

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.019
supply's limitations.

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.829
Walter intends to harness the Hollow Earth's
energy to overcome Mechagodzilla's limitations.

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:37.469
Inside the Hollow Earth, Kong and the team
find an ecosystem similar to Skull Island.

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.939
They discover his species' ancestral throne
room, where they find remains of an ancient

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:47.790
war with Godzilla's kind and a glowing axe
made from another Godzilla's dorsal plates.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.340
As they identify the power source, the Apex
team sends its signature back to their Hong

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.549
Kong base despite Ilene's protests.

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.280
Attracted by Mechagodzilla's activation, Godzilla
arrives in Hong Kong, and sensing Kong, he

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.780
directly drills a shaft to the throne room
with his atomic breath.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.439
Maia and the Apex team attempt to escape in
the ensuing mayhem, but their HEAV is crushed

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.502
by Kong.

00:03:11.502 --> 00:03:17.841
Kong, Ilene, Jia, and Nathan ascend to Hong Kong, where Kong engages Godzilla in a final

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:18.849
battle.

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.530
Kong initially gains the upper-hand; however,
Godzilla emerges victorious after incapacitating

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.530
Kong.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.510
Madison, Josh, and Bernie are caught by security
and taken to Walter.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.889
Despite Ren's concerns over the power source's
volatility, Walter orders him to activate

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:36.889
Mechagodzilla.

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:42.129
Now possessed by Ghidorah's consciousness,
Mechagodzilla kills Walter, electrocutes Ren,

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.480
and then attacks Hong Kong.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.290
Godzilla and Mechagodzilla battle, but Godzilla
is overwhelmed.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.970
Nathan revives Kong by destroying the HEAV,
and Jia convinces him to help Godzilla.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.980
As Mechagodzilla overpowers both Titans, Josh
short-circuits Mechagodzilla's controls with

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.230
Bernie's flask of liquor, momentarily interrupting
the mech.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.999
Godzilla charges Kong's axe with his atomic
breath, allowing Kong to destroy Mechagodzilla.

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:16.130
Madison, Bernie, and Josh reunite with Madison's father, Mark
Russell, while Godzilla and Kong acknowledge

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.780
each other before the two go their separate
ways.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.610
Sometime later, Monarch has established an
observation post in the Hollow Earth, where

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.410
Kong now rules.
