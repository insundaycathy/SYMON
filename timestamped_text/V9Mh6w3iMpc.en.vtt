00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.699
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:07.110
Today, I’m going to show an animated, adventure,
and family film called, “James and the Giant

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.149
Peach.”

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.590
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.450
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.990
James Henry Trotter is a kind and optimistic
little boy living near the English seaside

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.700
with his loving parents.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.410
On his seventh birthday, James’s family
celebrates by having a picnic at the beach.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.280
As they gaze upon the clouds, his father hands
him a travel book and tells him about the

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.380
tallest building in the world, the Empire
State Building.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.370
It’s located in a land across the Atlantic
Ocean, in a city where all dreams come true,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.930
New York City, and that’s where all three
of them will be going one day.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.040
But James’s dreams are cut short when one
day, an angry rhinoceros appears out of nowhere

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.010
and eats his father and mother.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.880
As sad as James was, his troubles were just
beginning.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.640
Now an orphan, James is sent to his two ugly,
horrible, wicked, and self-absorbed aunts,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.739
Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.149
His aunts have a rundown house on a hill where
nothing ever grew.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.180
In its tiny and dusty attic, James slept.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.920
Aunt Sponge is an enormous lady with a protruding
nose and horrible toes while Aunt Spiker is

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.530
a tall, bony, woman whose cheeks cut like
a knife.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.890
The two terrible aunts wake James up at the
crack of dawn ordering him to chop the wood,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.900
pull the weeds, and do all the chores around
the house.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.990
Left with no other choice, James sets upon
his tasks for the day while Aunt Sponge and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.810
Aunt Spiker sunbathe in their ghastly sundresses
at the front lawn, too busy admiring themselves

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.500
in their handheld mirrors.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.480
Suddenly, the silence of chopping woods catches
their attention.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.290
Aunt Sponge finds James sitting with his travel
book and reprimands him.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.130
Aunt Spiker snatches the book out of his hand,
accusing him of leaving, and hands it to her

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.240
sister.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.510
The aunts scold him, telling him that he has
no other place to go, and threatens by saying

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.190
that if he leaves, the rhino will come and
eat him, just like what it did to his parents.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.740
Aunt Sponge tears up his travel book and they
order him to stop daydreaming and get back

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.130
to work.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.780
Later that evening, James is finally done
with his chores and climbs up the house to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.640
see his two aunts finish all that’s left
of dinner.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.259
Aunt Spiker teases him and tells him that
there’s something in the oven, but to James’s

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.510
dismay, it’s only a plate of two raw fish
heads.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.319
He grabs a piece of leftover food from the
trash as he’s ordered to go back to his

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.319
room.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.800
James eats the few potato chips left in the
trash bag and spots a spider on his window.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.900
He lets it down and tells it to hide away
from his aunts.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.459
After his tiny dinner, he takes out his crayons
and draws on the trash bag, missing his parents

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.159
and dreaming of the day he sees the city of
dreams.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.209
He folds the bag into a lantern and uses the
last candlestick from his last birthday to

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.450
light it up.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.209
He releases the lantern into the night sky,
setting it free together with his dreams.

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.530
James wakes up to Aunt Spiker screaming early
in the morning.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.999
She has found his friend, the spider.

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:51.719
He takes the spider into his hands and runs
into Aunt Sponge in the doorway with the bug

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:52.769
spray.

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.730
They tumble down the stairs.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.799
Aunt Spiker comes down running and hits her
sister on the face with the bug swatter.

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.329
With his two aunts distracted, James runs
outside and sets the spider free.

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.669
When he looks up, an old man in a decorated
uniform appears in front of him and seems

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:09.170
to know his name.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.109
The old man tells James that the answer to
all his problems is inside a little bag and

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.650
hands him the lantern that he flew last night.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.340
James peeks into the bag and sees thousands
of glowing green worms.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.959
The old man tells him that they are crocodile
tongues that hold more magic than anything

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.409
else in the world.

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.779
He can use the crocodile tongues to get to
the place that he’s ever dreamed of, New

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.010
York City.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.370
James accepts the crocodile tongues but the
old man warns him, telling him that he shouldn’t

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.449
let the tongues get away, for if they do,
they will work their magic on whoever or whatever

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:38.760
they meet first.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.900
James nods his head and all of a sudden, a
strong gust of wind blows and the old man

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.200
disappears.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.670
As James runs back up to the house, he trips,
letting loose the thousand crocodile tongues

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.170
upon the old tree that stood on the lawn.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.369
He desperately tries to catch them, but it’s
too late.

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:58.170
Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker have caught up
to him and scolds him yet again.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.229
Aunt Spiker tells her sister to beat him,
but being too lazy, Aunt Sponge says it’s

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:04.449
too early in the morning for a beating.

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:09.290
As they drag James back to the house, Aunt
Sponge spots a single peach on the old tree.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.479
Aunt Spiker looks up shocked to see anything
other than a dead leaf on their property.

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:17.989
As Aunt Sponge pushes James up the tree to
get the fruit, Aunt Spiker stops them, exclaiming

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.379
that the peach is growing.

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:24.690
Puzzled at the absurd situation, the trio
stand back as the peach quickly grows in size,

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.510
eventually outweighing the tree itself and
resting its bottom on their lawn.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.540
The peach has grown almost as big as the house
itself!

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.759
Suddenly, Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker come
up with a money-making scheme.

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.400
They build an enclosure around the peach and
advertise it as the greatest peach in the

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.740
world, charging a hefty fee for anyone who
wants to see it.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.039
James watches the spectacle from his window
in his tiny attic room, a tear rolling down

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.460
his eye, as his only wish was to play with
the children outside.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.520
Later that night, his aunts call him downstairs
as they’re counting the money and order

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.229
him to pick up the garbage outside.

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.180
Among the trash on the ground, James finds
his lantern and inside a single crocodile

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.250
tongue.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.949
It hops its way down and hides under the peach.

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.699
His stomach growling with hunger, James takes
a bite out of the peach.

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.039
Unbeknownst to him, the crocodile tongue jumps
into his peach and he accidentally eats it.

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.630
Suddenly, a hole emerges from where he got
the piece of fruit, and with it, a light beckoning

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.770
him to come inside.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.830
James, curious as ever, goes inside the peach
and travels through the tunnel.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.850
As he reaches the end of the tunnel, he hears
several voices and falls through a hole.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.110
He lands in a room full of human-sized anthropomorphic
insects.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:40.400
The kind-hearted Mrs. Ladybug, the old Mr.
Grasshopper, the strong-willed Mr. Centipede,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:47.970
the blind Mr. Earthworm, the mysterious Ms.
Spider, and the deaf Glowworm.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.740
James learns that the insects have lived on
the hill for decades and are planning to escape

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.960
the clutches of Sponge and Spiker.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.379
He tells the group that he’s scared of leaving
because the rhino might eat him, but Mr. Grasshopper

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:02.090
assures him that he has never seen a single
rhino on that miserable hill.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.370
The insects share with James their dream life
and he realizes they all have the same goal,

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.389
to go out to the city where all dreams come
true.

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:14.280
Their jolly gathering is interrupted when
Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker call out for James.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.009
Mr. Centipede climbs outside the peach and
starts sawing the peach’s branch with his

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:19.389
sharp claws.

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.259
The peach finally breaks loose from the tree,
crushing Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker who have

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:25.300
taken refuge in their car.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.280
Much to the aunts’ dismay, the giant peach
rolls down the hill, making its way through

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.500
the town, and then bouncing off the local
church.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.840
It flies into the air, rolling down and down
into the farmlands until it reaches the end

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.499
of the cliff and falls down into the ocean.

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:44.160
After the bugs regain their composure, they
go outside the peach to inspect their situation.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.340
They find themselves floating in the middle
of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.610
The bugs wonder about what they’re going
to do now when James reaches into his coat

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.190
pocket and finds his travel book intact!

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.509
He opens it up and sees the peach on the map,
already on its way to New York City.

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:01.189
The group decides to head for the city of
dreams and tries to come up with a way to

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:02.189
travel.

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:04.220
Just then, James comes up with an idea.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.810
They’re going to catch and use the seagulls
to fly their peach all the way to New York.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.249
Using a reluctant Mr. Earthworm as bait, James
manages to catch one seagull and tie it up

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:15.229
with Ms. Spider’s thread.

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:19.509
Before they can catch the other birds, they
hear a deep rumbling coming from the ocean.

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:23.090
All of a sudden, a great mechanical shark
emerges from the water.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.160
The shark sets its eyes on the peach and is
coming for them.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.099
James asks for Ms. Spider’s net as Mr. Centipede
wiggles Mr. Earthworm to get the seagulls’

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:32.099
attention.

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:35.699
As the birds dive forward, James traps them
with the net and they tie the rest of the

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:37.430
threads unto the birds.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.169
They set the seagulls loose and the force
lifts the peach up into the air.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.249
But they’re not free from the shark yet.

00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:46.410
The shark launches an arrow and drags the
peach towards it.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:50.210
It shoots several torpedo sharks, cutting
loose a few of their birds.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.110
James hops on to Mr. Grasshopper and they
catch the birds before they can escape while

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.550
Mrs. Ladybug knocks out the rest of the torpedo
sharks.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.990
Ms. Spider hammers out the arrow, saving Mr.
Centipede, and sending the arrow back to the

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.650
mechanical shark.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.860
Its own arrow ties itself around the shark,
sending it to overdrive and causing it to

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.900
explode.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.110
The bugs celebrate on top of the peach and
thank James for his brilliant idea.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.580
They set their course and head for New York.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.340
As they travel, James reassures an insecure
Mr. Earthworm.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.409
He tells the worm that if he finds himself
in a bad situation, he remembers what his

00:08:23.409 --> 00:08:27.879
parents used to tell him, to look at them
another way, in a more positive light.

00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:31.990
The peach flies high above the clouds and
their journey is long and tiring.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:37.409
Soon enough, the bugs grow hungry, especially
Mr. Centipede who starts hallucinating food.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:41.699
After fighting with Mr. Grasshopper over a
crumb of soda bread, James insists that they

00:08:41.699 --> 00:08:43.500
don’t need to fight for food.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.160
Their whole ship is a piece of food!

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.529
It’s a giant peach after all.

00:08:47.529 --> 00:08:49.820
They have enough food for five voyages.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.350
The crew feasts on their newfound meal and
end up with full stomachs.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.839
Later that night, Ms. Spider tucks James into
a woven nest.

00:08:56.839 --> 00:09:00.589
He learns that Ms. Spider was the spider on
his window that he saved from his two terrible

00:09:00.589 --> 00:09:01.589
aunts.

00:09:01.589 --> 00:09:06.350
She reassures the little boy, removing his
doubts and fears, and soon enough, James drifts

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.690
off to sleep.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.350
He dreams of himself as a caterpillar with
his two wicked aunts in their rickety car

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:16.089
hunting him down with a bug spray that turns
into a large and terrifying rhino.

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:19.490
When James wakes up, his face is covered in
snowflakes.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.080
He goes on top of the peach and finds the
crew lost in the middle of a frozen ocean

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.450
with shipwrecks.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:28.199
He sees Mr. Centipede and Mr. Grasshopper
fighting each other.

00:09:28.199 --> 00:09:31.560
Mr. Grasshopper accuses the centipede of getting
them lost.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.420
The bugs confront the centipede, saying that
if he had indeed traveled the world, then

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.570
why did they end up getting lost.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:41.630
Mr. Centipede caves in and admit that he never
traveled the world, but he did spend most

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:45.500
of his time between the pages of a National
Geographic magazine.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.980
Mr. Grasshopper kicks him in the face out
of anger and tells the crew that they need

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.880
a compass if they want to get out of this
frozen place.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.330
James asks if there’s a compass onboard
one of the ships.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.430
Mr. Grasshopper says that there probably is,
but only a fool would venture out into the

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.960
icy waters.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.160
Mr. Centipede hears this and hoping for redemption,
jumps into the freezing sea.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.700
James and Ms. Spider follow to save him.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.050
They dive into the deep waters and find themselves
among a pirate’s treasure trove.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:16.399
Meanwhile, Mr. Centipede spots a compass in
the hands of a pirate captain.

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:20.269
He takes the compass, but all of a sudden,
the skeletons come alive.

00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:24.880
James and Ms. Spider reach the ship and see
the skeletons torturing the centipede.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.680
Before they could cut the bug in half, James
intervenes and kicks the pirate.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.040
Ms. Spider joins in and kicks the rest of
the pirates.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.570
A game of catch for the compass ensues, with
each side snatching the prize from one another.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.570
Free from his ropes, Mr. Centipede catches
the compass and hands it to James and Ms.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:41.650
Spider.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:46.050
The bugs on the peach pull on the thread,
pulling James and Ms. Spider to safety.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.240
Mr. Centipede jumps off to fight the rest
of the pirates.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.230
When they resurface, Ms. Spider jumps back
into the water.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.720
Just then, the centipede’s hat floats up.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:00.120
Fearing the worst, Ms. Spider stands back
in horror as the pirate captain surfaces,

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.680
but it turns out, it’s Mr. Centipede, alive
and well wearing the pirate’s hat!

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.310
The bugs welcome back their friend, now having
redeemed himself.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.610
With their compass, they set sail for the
big city.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:15.240
In the evening, Mr. Grasshopper relieves Mr.
Centipede of his steering duty.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.950
James looks at his map, seeing that they’re
almost at their dream destination when he

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.079
hears the sound of a violin.

00:11:21.079 --> 00:11:24.810
He joins Mr. Grasshopper as the insect plays
some songs for him.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:28.550
He reminds the little boy to brighten up because
if it weren’t for him, they wouldn’t have

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.550
gotten very far.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.390
He doesn’t need to feel lonely because they
are his new family now.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.310
Just then, they hear a foghorn blowing from
below.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:41.430
They look down and see the clouds part, revealing
the shining city of New York and Lady Liberty.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:45.600
Their celebration is cut short by a strong
gust of wind that blows off their compass,

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.040
setting them off course.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.600
The nearby clouds have now turned into a storm
in the form of a rhino.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.000
Thunder booms, lightning crackles, as the
rhino marches towards them.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.660
The bugs climb into the rigging but James
chooses to face the beast.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.290
He remembers what his parents used to tell
him.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.819
Look at it another way.

00:12:02.819 --> 00:12:06.390
He screams at the rhino, telling the beast
that he’s not afraid of it.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:10.730
He bravely faces the rhino as the lightning
strikes the peach, cutting the rigging, and

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.880
sending the peach down from the skies.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.220
James wakes up and coughs out the crocodile
tongue that he ate.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.480
He finds himself transformed into his human
self and alone inside the peach.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.339
He climbs out of the fruit and sees the shining
city of New York below him.

00:12:24.339 --> 00:12:28.140
He looks for the Empire State Building, unaware
that he’s actually sitting right on top

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.390
of it.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.850
Down on the streets, juices coming from the
peach disrupt the citizens.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:37.680
A child calls out from the balcony, telling
an officer that there’s a boy out there.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.569
The officer calls the station and asks for
the biggest crane in the city.

00:12:41.569 --> 00:12:44.480
The crane arrives and begins to lift off the
peach.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.820
One of the crane workers tells James that
he’s sitting on top of the Empire State

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.820
Building.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.310
James celebrates but feels sad that his family
isn’t with him.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:56.000
By the time the peach is on the streets, a
large crowd of homeowners and journalists

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.160
have gathered.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.130
Suddenly, the crowds part to reveal a wet
and smashed-up car.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.660
From the car emerges his two wicked aunts.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:08.190
Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker are wet, having
crossed the Atlantic in their beat-up car.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:11.560
They walk towards James, pretending to be
caring relatives.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.529
They hand the officer a photograph, confirming
that they’re the original peach owners,

00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:17.310
and try to whisk the boy away.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:21.000
James insists that he’s the original owner
of the peach and not them.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.790
The aunts resist the urge to gauge his eyes
out and lie to the officer, telling him that

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.670
James is a chronic liar.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:31.540
Enraged, James stands on top of the truck
and begins telling the crowd his story.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.440
How they attached it to a hundred seagulls
and how they few it over the ocean.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.850
His aunts laugh at his story, suggesting that
it’s something he dreamed up.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:43.100
James stands by on his story, saying that
all things started out as dreams, but he’s

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.610
here and he’s made it.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:48.940
The wicked aunts still insist on bringing
him back, but the boy stands his ground.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:53.209
He screams at his aunts telling him that he’s
not going with them to be beaten and starved.

00:13:53.209 --> 00:13:56.040
The crowd gasps in horror at the revelations.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.370
His aunts’ patience has run thin as they
grab an ax and begin smashing the truck.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:04.750
Just then, a light falls down from the sky,
James’s bug family has arrived!

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.319
They land on top of the peach, ready to help
their little friend.

00:14:08.319 --> 00:14:12.329
Ms. Spider throws James a string and he uses
it to round up his two aunts.

00:14:12.329 --> 00:14:15.450
They pull them up in the air and spin the
web around them, muffling their mouths of

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:16.720
their screams.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.470
The officer watches in awe as he realizes
that James was telling the truth all along.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:25.110
James climbs up the peach and introduces the
crowd to his family.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.600
He then gives the peach for the crowds to
feast on.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.220
The people eat the peach right down to the
pit.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.320
When it was done, they set up the pit in Central
Park, where James Henry Trotter lived with

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:44.410
his family, telling his adventures to all
his friends and anyone willing to hear.
