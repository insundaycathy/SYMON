00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.520
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going&nbsp;
to explain a Japanese manga series adapted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:15.920
into a movie called “The Promised Neverland,”&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.560
At the beginning of the movie, an eleven years&nbsp;
old girl named Emma gets up from her bed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.240
wakes other children sleeping in the same hall.&nbsp;
They live in a massive orphanage called the Grace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.760
Field House, where all their needs are taken care&nbsp;
of. They are guided by a woman named Isabella,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.440
who the kids call their “Mom.” Although the kids&nbsp;
aren’t tied by blood, they live like one large&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.200
family and receive much love from their mom. Their&nbsp;
mornings start when Emma wakes everyone up. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.720
they sit together and enjoy varieties of healthy&nbsp;
food. The children’s education and happiness are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.000
given the first priority in the orphanage. They&nbsp;
are taught inside the premises of the orphanage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.840
like any other school. Emma and two of her best&nbsp;
friends, Norman and Ray, always excel in their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.280
studies and get the highest scores. The children&nbsp;
also have identifying numbers tattooed on them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.320
and have no knowledge of the outside world.&nbsp;
The orphanage is surrounded by a large meadow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.120
where the kids run around and play together. 
However, they are never allowed to go outside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.960
fence that surrounds the meadow. The kids arrive&nbsp;
at the orphanage as an infant, but they do not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.160
stay there for their whole life. They are arranged&nbsp;
to be adopted by their foster parents and go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.840
the outside world to meet new people. Similarly,&nbsp;
a little girl named Conny leaves the orphanage one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.440
day. The kids send her off after wishing her well&nbsp;
and tell her to be good to her new parents. Next,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.960
Isabella takes little Conny to the entrance of&nbsp;
the orphanage. Meanwhile, Emma finds a stuffed toy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.640
that Conny loves and runs outside with Norman to&nbsp;
return it to her. They reach the entrance gate and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.400
see that Isabella and Conny have already passed.&nbsp;
The two take a chance and slowly step outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.200
where they find a single van and no one around.&nbsp;
As they look inside the van, the duo is horrified.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.560
Conny lies limp on the floor with a plant&nbsp;
stabbed onto her chest. Before they can react,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.480
two grotesque creatures approach them. Emma and&nbsp;
Norman hide under the van, frozen in shock. 
&nbsp;

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.120
The creatures talk to each other about human&nbsp;
meat being the best. One of them claims that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.800
meat coming from this farm is elite and is saved&nbsp;
for the rich demons. The kids from their hiding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.080
realize that their orphanage is only a farm where&nbsp;
they are raised like cattle, only to be eaten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.080
by demons. The students are classified as “good&nbsp;
meat” when they are more intelligent. Just then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.960
Isabella arrives there and talks to the demons&nbsp;
about the students who get the highest score in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.320
the class. Those students are the most delicious&nbsp;
ones and the ones who are on demand. Isabella&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.200
had been schooling them to make them taste better&nbsp;
for the demons. She promises to bring the highest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.840
scoring children the next time. Norman and Emma&nbsp;
narrowly escape without being seen and run to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.760
orphanage. Emma falls down, crying midway claiming&nbsp;
that the girl they saw was not Conny and refusing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.720
to believe their mom can be this evil. Norman&nbsp;
tries to calm her down and says that they can run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.120
away from the orphanage, but Emma is worried for&nbsp;
the other children who are like family to her. 
&nbsp;

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.240
The following day, Emma and Norman talk about the&nbsp;
events of the previous day. Norman suggests they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.280
plan an elaborate escape from the orphanage and&nbsp;
not tell the others before the plan is completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.320
They decide to cross the fence that day to see&nbsp;
exactly what the outside world is like. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.040
walking through the woods for a while, they&nbsp;
reach a tall wall. They cannot jump across it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.040
so they return. Meanwhile, a little girl named&nbsp;
Naila gets lost in the forest. Isabella looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.480
into her watch and brings Naila back in no&nbsp;
time. Emma and Norma see this and realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.440
that the watch is a transmitter with which she&nbsp;
knows where all the kids are. The following day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.320
Norman and Emma go to the woods with a rope&nbsp;
with which they plan to cross the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.520
Just then, they are caught by their best friend&nbsp;
Ray, who is suspicious of them. Norman reveals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.640
the truth about the orphanage to Ray, telling&nbsp;
him everything they heard and saw that night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.200
In contrast to what the two had thought, Ray&nbsp;
believes them almost immediately. He claims that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.440
they should run away from the orphanage as soon&nbsp;
as possible, but Emma insists that they shouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.480
leave the other kids behind to be eaten. 
At night, Isabella introduces everyone to their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.440
new caretaker Krone. Krone’s arrival makes&nbsp;
it more difficult for the group to escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.280
Then, we see Isabella and Krone talking when&nbsp;
Isabella reveals that she found Conny’s toy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.080
and is aware that Emma, Norman, and Ray&nbsp;
know about the orphanage’s true motive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.520
However, she is confident they won’t escape.&nbsp;
Later, the three set off to talk in private.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.840
Norman believes that someone among the children&nbsp;
is Isabella’s spy, who provides her with all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.880
the information. If this is true, they know that&nbsp;
someone from the older children should be one. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.400
group decides to tell two of the older children,&nbsp;
Don and Gilda, about the reality of the orphanage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.400
They do not believe the kids at first&nbsp;
but eventually agree to help them. 
&nbsp;

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.000
When the three are alone, Norman says that he told&nbsp;
Don and Gilda two different locations of the ropes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.400
that they are about to use to climb the wall.&nbsp;
The one that will disappear first will reveal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.000
who is the spy. The next day, one of the ropes&nbsp;
disappears. Emma and Ray are happy that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.440
found the spy. But Norman instead reveals that the&nbsp;
rope story was a trap for Ray. He had told Ray a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.360
fake location to find out if he was the spy, and&nbsp;
Ray fell into the trap. Ray finally admits that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.720
discovered the orphanage’s truth a long time ago&nbsp;
but knew that he couldn’t escape. He confronted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.560
Isabella who said that no matter what he will be&nbsp;
given to a demon one day. So, with no way out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.480
he volunteered to be a spy for her, so she will&nbsp;
delay his “adoption.” However, Ray hasn’t told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.280
Isabella about the children’s plan to use the rope&nbsp;
to climb the wall, which makes Norman believe Ray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.560
isn’t loyal to her. Then, Ray reveals that he&nbsp;
has been planning to escape for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.400
In fact, he was the one who stole Conny’s toy so&nbsp;
that Emma and Norman could find out the truth and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.000
would try running away too. Norman declares Ray&nbsp;
as a double spy and keeps him in the team. 
&nbsp;

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.440
At night, Ray goes to Isabella and falsely reports&nbsp;
to her about Norman trying to poison her food.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.280
Isabella thanks him but, in turn, says that Ray’s&nbsp;
turn to being adopted is near. The next day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.920
all five of the children are planning to jump&nbsp;
over the wall when Krone overhears them talking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.880
But instead of reporting to Isabella, she joins&nbsp;
them. It turns out that Krone was also a student&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.200
like them. She wants to remove Isabella&nbsp;
and be the new mother of the orphanage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.160
and for that, she is ready to help the kids. At&nbsp;
night, they visit her room, where Krone tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.480
them everything she knows about the outside world.&nbsp;
Over 1000 years ago, man and demons were at war.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.560
After a long and tedious battle, both&nbsp;
creatures decided not to bother each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.080
An agreement called "The Promise" was made,&nbsp;
according to which both humans and demons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.800
would live in their own separate worlds. Some&nbsp;
humans were left behind in the demon world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.360
and that is how the humans breeding farms&nbsp;
started. By eating intelligent humans,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.160
demons take on their attributes which prevent&nbsp;
them from turning into mindless monsters. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.000
also benefits the humans, hence they sacrificed a&nbsp;
few on the farm so the world can be at peace. 
&nbsp;

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.120
The very next day, Isabella fires Krone because&nbsp;
she somehow found out about her intentions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.160
While leaving, Krone sees their supervisor&nbsp;
grandmother at the gate. She makes a demon eat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.720
Krone for trying to help the kids. The kids then&nbsp;
execute their plan. Emma and Norman go to the wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.480
while Ray stalls Isabella and the&nbsp;
other two keep an eye on her. 
&nbsp;

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:36.240
However, their plan soon fails when Isabella&nbsp;
locks Ray inside a room and goes to catch Norman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.200
and Emma herself. She finds them near a wall&nbsp;
and finally confronts them, claiming that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.080
has given them everything they want in life,&nbsp;
so they shouldn’t resist the inevitable. Emma&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:52.000
tries to stop Isabella, and as they struggle, she&nbsp;
breaks Emma’s leg. She then informs Norman that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.840
he has been “adopted” and tomorrow will be his&nbsp;
last day in the orphanage. The group reunites at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.240
night. They are worried about Norman, who claims&nbsp;
that he would happily die if that meant everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.280
else in the orphanage is safe. When everyone&nbsp;
is asleep, Norman finds a strange pen in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.640
drawer. This pen was kept there by Krone to help&nbsp;
them escape. The next day, Norman climbs on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.680
wall with the help of a rope to run away but only&nbsp;
to come across a cliff that he cannot cross. 
&nbsp;

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.600
He returns back to the orphanage and has accepted&nbsp;
his death. The group hugs for the last time with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.840
teary eyes. Isabella finally takes him away as&nbsp;
Emma cries in agony. But, to Norman’s surprise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.600
he is taken to a man instead of a demon. The man&nbsp;
claims that he oversees if everything goes well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.400
in the world of demons and humans. As they&nbsp;
talk, a demon arrives in front of Norman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:46.080
ready to devour him. For the next few months, we&nbsp;
see a depressed Emma recovering from her injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:51.600
She and Ray have lost all hope and forgotten about&nbsp;
their plan to escape. Isabella observes them every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.400
day and is happy that they are under control.&nbsp;
After two months, it is finally Ray’s turn to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.720
be handed to the demons. The night before,&nbsp;
Emma comes to visit him and tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.080
they still have a chance. But Ray has decided to&nbsp;
light himself on fire along with the house. 
&nbsp;

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.520
As the fire starts to spread, Emma cries and calls&nbsp;
for Isabella. Isabella tells the kids to get out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.240
of the house quickly and tries to put out the&nbsp;
fire. After a while, she realizes that no kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.440
are around. It turns out that this had been&nbsp;
their plan all along. In the past two months,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.160
Emma couldn’t do anything suspicious because&nbsp;
she was being watched by Isabella, so instead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.760
Don and Gilda told the other kids about their plan&nbsp;
and prepared them for it. Emma also found a letter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.640
in Norman’s bed that had an elaborate plan written&nbsp;
on it. Emma couldn’t tell Ray sooner because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.560
Isabella was watching them closely. They have&nbsp;
left the little kids because they couldn’t put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:46.240
their lives in danger. Emma has promised to come&nbsp;
back for them later when they have more help. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:51.360
they climb the wall as Isabella approaches them&nbsp;
with the help of the navigator. She soon realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.760
the navigator isn’t working because the children&nbsp;
have removed the device from their ears. 
&nbsp;

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.800
Finally, when everyone is on top of the wall, they&nbsp;
tie a rope and slide through it to the other end.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.440
Emma is the last one to go, but before she can&nbsp;
slide, Isabella arrives and threatens to cut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.640
the rope. Emma emotionally tells Isabella that she&nbsp;
knows killing the children has been hard for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.880
Isabella wants to see the children grow and is&nbsp;
actually proud of them for escaping this far.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.160
Isabella denies everything Emma says and stays&nbsp;
adamant about wanting to get the kids back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.480
Emma takes the risk and slides down the&nbsp;
rope. Isabella has a chance to cut it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:31.280
but to their surprise, she doesn’t. She watches&nbsp;
the kids she raised on the other side and smiles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.480
at them for the last time. The kids then make&nbsp;
their way through the jungle. They stop when Emma&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.840
tells them about the pen that Krone had left them.&nbsp;
The pen projects a picture in the air on being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:47.200
opened. An owl emerges out of the image and leads&nbsp;
them to the city where they will be safe. 
&nbsp;

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.960
Meanwhile, Isabella stands in front of the&nbsp;
grandmother and the overseer of both worlds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.880
They are disappointed in Isabella for&nbsp;
letting the valuable children run away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.800
At the end of the movie, she is&nbsp;
fed to a demon as a punishment.
