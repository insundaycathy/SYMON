00:00:06.334 --> 00:00:07.806
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.062 --> 00:00:11.326
today I'll show you a superhero film: "Black Widow"

00:00:11.518 --> 00:00:14.270
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:14.526 --> 00:00:17.534
back in 1995, Natasha lived happily together

00:00:17.662 --> 00:00:20.926
with her foster parents Dad and Mom, and foster younger sister

00:00:21.182 --> 00:00:26.110
one night, Dad came home glumly, and urged the family to leave the city as soon as possible

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:30.270
Mom quickly led the two daughters to pack up and rushed out for departure

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.494
when all was ready, the family took Dad's car to a hidden gateway plane

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.886
as soon as they reach, they were surrounded by many police vehicles

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:42.558
Dad opened fire at the police and instructed the rest to take off the plane

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:46.078
despite many hindrances, they barely managed to escape

00:00:46.334 --> 00:00:49.662
unfortunately, Mom was injured, but the wound was not fatal

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:52.670
following a bumpy landing in a Cuba military base

00:00:52.862 --> 00:00:57.790
Dad submitted a set of confidential documents to his boss and resigned at the same time

00:00:57.982 --> 00:01:02.910
in fact, Dad and Mom were Russian undercover spies sent to the United States for duty

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.662
adopting Natasha and Yelena is part of their plan

00:01:05.854 --> 00:01:08.478
to masquerade themselves as harmless USA citizens

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:13.022
wrenched from Dad and Mom, Natasha and Yelena were enrolled by the Red Room

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.246
the Russian Agent Training Institute, where many other homeless girls are imprisoned

00:01:17.502 --> 00:01:21.662
by years of cruel training and brainwashing, Natasha has become a trained killer

00:01:21.854 --> 00:01:24.798
the almost invincible Natasha is an all-rounded agent

00:01:25.182 --> 00:01:29.598
so fast in both her thoughts and movements that she never fails any given mission

00:01:29.726 --> 00:01:33.886
however, Natasha has left the Red Room and joined the Avengers instead

00:01:34.078 --> 00:01:37.918
since then, Natasha had to run away and hide from the killers

00:01:38.174 --> 00:01:42.398
on the other hand, Yelena, Natasha's younger sister, is another perfect agent

00:01:42.718 --> 00:01:45.726
she is tasked to take back a mysterious parcel from the target

00:01:45.854 --> 00:01:50.206
at first, she is prepared to snipe directly from a distance to kill the targeted person

00:01:50.526 --> 00:01:54.366
but the subject is alert enough to notice Yelena's presence and runs away

00:01:54.622 --> 00:02:00.254
Yelena immediately goes for a melee combo with the opponent and stabs her hard in the chest

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.326
as the opponent collapses, succumbing to her wounds

00:02:03.454 --> 00:02:05.886
Yelena prepares to give her another deadly stab

00:02:06.014 --> 00:02:08.766
to her surprise, the lady takes out a little red bottle

00:02:08.894 --> 00:02:13.118
and sprays on Yelena some special potent red dust, which's worse than hormone spray

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.062
once Yelena gets into contact with the synthetic gas

00:02:16.254 --> 00:02:20.990
she comes to her senses and realizes that the target is a fellow agent from the Red Room

00:02:21.246 --> 00:02:23.870
the dying agent entrusts the red dust to Yelena

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:26.942
and asks her to rescue more Black Widows trapped by the Red Room

00:02:27.198 --> 00:02:29.118
so Yelena rebels against the Red Room

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.382
and finally escapes the thumb of the evil mastermind (Mastermind)

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.926
needless to say, she is being pursued by the Taskmaster, a robot soldier

00:02:37.182 --> 00:02:41.790
on the other hand, Natasha stays in a safe house in Norway where a friend takes care of her

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.014
the friend brings her some groceries and some letters from the Budapest Safehouse

00:02:46.206 --> 00:02:50.325
thinking the letters are irrelevant, Natasha leaves the Safehouse to throw them away

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.486
when she is crossing over a bridge, she is attacked by a missile bomb from the Taskmaster

00:02:55.678 --> 00:02:58.238
the blast is no joke, and her car is totaled

00:02:58.494 --> 00:03:03.038
Natasha survives the deadly blow and falls into a fierce fight with the Taskmaster

00:03:03.294 --> 00:03:05.790
as the two wrestle intensely with each another

00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:10.654
Natasha discovers that Taskmaster is here for a parcel she disposes of, rather than herself

00:03:10.846 --> 00:03:14.430
the particular parcel is among the documents from the Budapest Safehouse

00:03:14.622 --> 00:03:18.590
full of curiosity, Natasha grabs the parcel ahead of the Taskmaster

00:03:18.718 --> 00:03:20.702
and dives into the river for escape

00:03:20.894 --> 00:03:23.902
later, the parcel is found containing a number of Red Reagents

00:03:24.094 --> 00:03:26.270
and a photo of Natasha and Yelena

00:03:26.398 --> 00:03:28.190
knowing this parcel is from Yelena

00:03:28.254 --> 00:03:31.966
Natasha travels to the Budapest Safehouse to meet her younger sister

00:03:32.158 --> 00:03:36.638
however, their reunion involves a bone-cracking episode of hand-to-hand combat

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.238
that ends in a truce

00:03:38.366 --> 00:03:40.734
after the two have rolled themselves like burritos

00:03:40.862 --> 00:03:43.678
Natasha suspects that Yelena works for the Red Room,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.262
but her worries soon vanish as Yelena tells her side of the story

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.254
it's revealed the Red Reagents are used to keep the brain immune to external manipulation

00:03:52.446 --> 00:03:55.454
in fact, to maintain the Widows' absolute obedience

00:03:55.518 --> 00:03:58.398
the Red Room uses certain mind-control drugs on them

00:03:58.462 --> 00:04:01.854
and the Red Dust is the right antidote to the mind control spell

00:04:02.046 --> 00:04:06.590
Yelena wants to take down the Red Room in collaboration with Avengers via Natasha

00:04:06.782 --> 00:04:09.918
however, the Avengers have fallen apart since its third war

00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:14.910
Natasha is shocked to learn that Mastermind is still alive, whom she thought she had killed

00:04:15.038 --> 00:04:19.070
Yelena confirms that Mastermind and his daughter have survived the explosion

00:04:19.262 --> 00:04:23.038
merely seconds later, the Black Widows break into the Budapest Safehouse

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.286
Natasha and Yelena hurry to escape only to find them surrounded by Widows at all sides

00:04:28.606 --> 00:04:31.500
they flee to the rooftop, planning to jump over to another building

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.598
with the water pipe as a stepping stone

00:04:33.805 --> 00:04:37.709
in the meantime, a Widow climbs up the pipe and loses her foothold

00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:41.805
Natasha approaches the seriously injured Widow to check her health status

00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:44.493
but she is already killed remotely by the Red Room

00:04:44.813 --> 00:04:49.101
now Natasha is now fully convinced that Red Room is still active

00:04:49.357 --> 00:04:52.237
later, the two sisters run to the street from the back exit

00:04:52.365 --> 00:04:54.221
and flee the scene with a motorbike

00:04:54.413 --> 00:04:57.869
the agents immediately spot them and chase after them by car

00:04:57.997 --> 00:05:00.045
as Natasha's motorbike turns over

00:05:00.109 --> 00:05:04.141
they grab a car to continue the fast and furious journey, rather than a hormone game

00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:07.213
the Taskmaster then fires a missile to blow up their car

00:05:07.405 --> 00:05:09.517
the car ends up in a subway station

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:13.293
Natasha and Yelena crawl out from the car and dash into the crowds

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:17.645
only when they enter the ventilation duct, they finally get rid of the Taskmaster

00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:20.717
while staying safe, Yelena explains to Natasha

00:05:20.845 --> 00:05:23.533
that the Taskmaster is Mastermind's latest invention

00:05:23.635 --> 00:05:27.859
Taskmaster is a fast learner who can imitate the action and tactics of anyone

00:05:28.051 --> 00:05:32.339
by now, Natasha is determined to destroy the Red Room and save all other Widows

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:37.331
as Red Room keeps moving around, even Yelena is not sure of its latest location

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:41.299
Natasha's friend supplies them with a plane and flies them to meet their Dad

00:05:41.363 --> 00:05:45.587
who is an ex-soldier with supernatural power and an ex-member of the Red Room

00:05:45.715 --> 00:05:49.525
he is the Red Guardian who owns a shield similar to that of the Captain of America

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:52.177
just that their rank is completely different

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:56.977
a few years ago, the once-mighty Guardian was locked up in prison at a snow mountain

00:05:57.105 --> 00:06:01.905
speculating that Dad must know the Red Room's location, Natasha suggests meeting him

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:04.050
in order to free Dad from his shackles

00:06:04.215 --> 00:06:07.159
the sisters send him a childhood toy with earpieces hidden in it

00:06:07.415 --> 00:06:10.999
as soon as Dad sees the toy, he knows that the daughters are here to rescue him

00:06:11.255 --> 00:06:14.327
he quickly puts on the earpiece to communicate with Natasha

00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:19.831
following her instruction, Dad overcomes the jailers with his superpower and breaks away

00:06:20.087 --> 00:06:23.543
at the same time, Natasha and Yelena's plane is approaching the prison

00:06:23.735 --> 00:06:27.511
following an alarm throughout the prison, many security guards assemble

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.007
and start shooting at Dad and the helicopter

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:32.887
Natasha descends from the helicopter to tackle the guards

00:06:33.015 --> 00:06:36.215
and wipes out a few like a breeze blowing away the smelly shit

00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:40.247
Yelena fires a shot at the tower, which triggers a snow-slide

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:44.983
the snowdrift rushes down from the mountain like raging waves, enveloping the whole prison

00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:48.311
at once, all the guards dash back to the prison for safety

00:06:48.567 --> 00:06:51.063
Yelena quickly lets down the rappel of the aircraft

00:06:51.191 --> 00:06:54.775
to pick up Natasha and Dad before the snow swallows them up

00:06:54.903 --> 00:06:58.487
to their surprise, Dad doesn't know where the Red Room locates

00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:02.263
but Natasha learns that their foster Mom is still working for the Red Room

00:07:02.327 --> 00:07:05.143
as a research scientist in the suburb of Pittsburgh

00:07:05.335 --> 00:07:09.879
in the faux-family that only lasts for three years, Yelena prefers Mom over Dad

00:07:10.007 --> 00:07:11.991
so the trio set off to Pittsburgh

00:07:12.247 --> 00:07:15.063
Natasha does not have many feelings for the foster family

00:07:15.191 --> 00:07:18.007
as her sole focus now is to locate the Red Room

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:19.671
soon after, they find Mom

00:07:19.799 --> 00:07:24.151
who is overwhelmed that Natasha and Yelena intend to mutilate the Mastermind's kingdom

00:07:24.343 --> 00:07:28.055
Mastermind owns a chemical reagent that does the trick of mind control

00:07:28.247 --> 00:07:30.615
he has widely applied it all over the world

00:07:30.743 --> 00:07:33.239
showing that Mastermind's power is at its pinnacle now

00:07:33.431 --> 00:07:35.863
with countless Black Widows at his disposal

00:07:35.927 --> 00:07:39.127
Natasha and Yelena absolutely stand no chance to win

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:42.903
Mom cannot bear to see her foster daughters going down the way of death

00:07:43.031 --> 00:07:44.951
so the meeting ends in a heavy mood

00:07:45.143 --> 00:07:48.663
recalling the heart-warming memories during the three years when they were together

00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:51.415
the four of them actually cherish the short reunion

00:07:51.607 --> 00:07:53.975
however, out of her loyalty to the Red Room

00:07:54.103 --> 00:07:57.367
Mom still reports to Mastermind about Natasha's visit

00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:00.503
shortly after, a helicopter hovers over their residence

00:08:00.631 --> 00:08:02.935
recognizing the troops are from the Red Room

00:08:03.063 --> 00:08:06.327
Natasha, Yelena, and Dad get ready for a fierce fight

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:09.655
however, before Dad releases any of his superpowers

00:08:09.783 --> 00:08:13.239
he is stunned by the anesthetic dart that comes right through the window

00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:17.783
while Mom surprise attacks Natasha and Yelena and hands them over to the Taskmaster

00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:22.455
Dad wakes up to find himself tied up, and Mom is navigating the plane upwards

00:08:22.775 --> 00:08:27.191
it turns out the Red Room is built in the air, a place too mysterious to find

00:08:27.447 --> 00:08:31.095
as Yelena is the only survivor among those who have taken the antidote

00:08:31.223 --> 00:08:34.039
Mastermind decides to dissect her brain for research

00:08:34.295 --> 00:08:38.327
in fact, the antidotes are created by some Widows, not the Mastermind

00:08:38.583 --> 00:08:41.079
to remove any potential threat to his regime

00:08:41.207 --> 00:08:44.663
Mastermind commands Mom to find out the mechanism of the antidote

00:08:44.855 --> 00:08:48.700
he also instructs Mom to give a jab to Natasha, but she hesitates

00:08:48.975 --> 00:08:53.600
Mastermind steps forward to touch her hair and is surprised to realize she is not Mom

00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:56.742
but Natasha, who masks herself to pretend as Mom

00:08:56.998 --> 00:09:01.030
it turns out that Mom is not aware of the Red Room's specific location

00:09:01.286 --> 00:09:03.014
so they have come up with such a plan

00:09:03.078 --> 00:09:04.550
Mom willingly helps out

00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:08.262
because she loves her daughters and hates the Mastermind's evil acts

00:09:08.838 --> 00:09:12.550
at the same time, Mom also removes her mask before Dad

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:17.050
as the structural designer of the base, Mom easily saves Dad out from prison

00:09:17.286 --> 00:09:20.975
Yelena wakes up just before the medical staff is about to tranquilize her

00:09:21.281 --> 00:09:24.161
she takes out the hidden knife and fights her way out

00:09:24.225 --> 00:09:28.641
Mom directs Yelena to steal antidotes from the freezers and apply them to the Widows

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:31.329
Mom then brings Dad to the main control center

00:09:31.393 --> 00:09:34.209
trying to bring the floating base down to the ground

00:09:34.465 --> 00:09:39.265
back to Mastermind's office, Natasha tries to kill him, but neither her gun nor knife works

00:09:39.457 --> 00:09:42.657
her weapon is repelled whenever they are placed close to Mastermind

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:47.265
Natasha is deeply shocked to discover that she has lost control over her own hands

00:09:47.585 --> 00:09:50.977
it is due to the mind-control particles filling the atmosphere

00:09:51.233 --> 00:09:55.201
as soon as she breathes in the air, she is unable to assassinate Mastermind

00:09:55.521 --> 00:10:00.001
later, Mastermind shares with Natasha his kingdom blueprint through the control console

00:10:00.321 --> 00:10:05.505
his agents control over all walks of life, be they government officials or ordinary civilians

00:10:05.825 --> 00:10:09.089
the oil market and the stock market will collapse if he wishes it

00:10:09.345 --> 00:10:13.441
he can easily wipe out one-quarter of the world's population through starvation

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:18.689
with just one word, he can deploy his agents to wage war to overthrow various governments

00:10:18.945 --> 00:10:22.081
all the magic is done through the control console in his hand

00:10:22.273 --> 00:10:25.921
Mastermind aspires to seize control of the Avengers through Natasha

00:10:26.177 --> 00:10:30.081
once the Avengers come under his power, there will be no more hurdles ahead of him

00:10:30.273 --> 00:10:33.857
Natasha laughs at his ambition and bangs her head against the table

00:10:34.049 --> 00:10:35.201
seeing Mastermind puzzled

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:39.617
Natasha tells him she is already aware of the mind-control substance floating in the air

00:10:39.873 --> 00:10:44.609
Mom tips off to her the way to free from Mastermind's control is to cut her taste nerve

00:10:44.865 --> 00:10:49.601
right then, the alert Natasha grabs the control console from Mastermind and beats him up

00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:54.145
Mom and Dad are proceeding to the control room, but the Taskmaster confronts them

00:10:54.337 --> 00:10:59.009
Dad stays behind to deal with Taskmaster while Mom enters the control room alone

00:10:59.329 --> 00:11:03.105
her intrusion causes the self-protective operation system to shut down

00:11:03.297 --> 00:11:08.033
Mom has no choice but leaves the control room and ventures to the engine room instead

00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:11.617
there, she damages an engine and forces the spaceship to land

00:11:11.745 --> 00:11:15.329
which results in a huge explosion and setting off the alarm bells

00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:17.249
in response to the emergency

00:11:17.313 --> 00:11:20.769
the mind-controlled Black Widows are all heading to the Mastermind's office

00:11:20.897 --> 00:11:22.561
getting ready to kill the intruders

00:11:22.945 --> 00:11:25.697
so when Yelena finally comes to the base with the antidotes

00:11:25.761 --> 00:11:28.193
she cannot find any Widows around

00:11:28.513 --> 00:11:31.265
Dad and Taskmaster are having a white-hot battle

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:35.425
even though Dad is a powerful veteran, the Taskmaster gains an upper hand

00:11:35.617 --> 00:11:40.289
at the critical moment, Mom shows up and manages to lock the Taskmaster inside the prison

00:11:40.609 --> 00:11:44.705
on the other hand, the Widows arrive at the Mastermind's office to attack Natasha

00:11:44.897 --> 00:11:46.945
Natasha seems to be winning at first

00:11:47.201 --> 00:11:50.401
but soon, she is worn out as the opponents outnumber her

00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:54.113
fortunately, Yelena's timely arrival ends Natasha's crisis

00:11:54.369 --> 00:11:57.761
she ties the antidote to a bomb and makes it blast in the air

00:11:58.017 --> 00:12:02.945
as such, all the Widows are awakened to avenge Mastermind, but he is nowhere to be found

00:12:03.393 --> 00:12:06.721
Natasha copies all the agent data from Mastermind's computer

00:12:06.913 --> 00:12:09.025
while the whole spaceship is breaking apart

00:12:09.153 --> 00:12:14.401
Natasha rushes out of the base with the thumb drive, but she is stopped by the Taskmaster

00:12:14.593 --> 00:12:17.985
she soon identifies the Taskmaster as Mastermind's daughter

00:12:18.177 --> 00:12:21.761
years back, Natasha follows his daughter to the base to demolish it

00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:25.985
Natasha thought that both Mastermind and his daughter have died of the explosion

00:12:26.113 --> 00:12:29.441
by now, it is clear that Mastermind was not present during the bombing

00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:34.689
Mastermind saves his daughter and transforms her into the Taskmaster, a robot soldier

00:12:34.881 --> 00:12:38.337
having pity for the daughter's misfortune, Natasha releases her

00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:43.073
however, the daughter losing all senses of herself only wants to defeat Natasha

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:47.489
all of a sudden, the place is blown up, and the two of them land in different places

00:12:47.873 --> 00:12:52.801
Mom decides to leave the scene by plane, but a coming robot soldier surprises her

00:12:52.993 --> 00:12:57.921
after a fierce fight, Dad manages to throw the robot soldier off the plane with his shield

00:12:58.177 --> 00:13:01.825
however, the plane loses its balance and plunges drastically

00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:05.281
on the other side, Yelena is sharp enough to spot Mastermind

00:13:05.409 --> 00:13:06.817
before he boards a plane

00:13:06.945 --> 00:13:10.977
in order to kill him, Yelena hops onto the helicopter and sets a bomb to blow it up

00:13:11.105 --> 00:13:14.561
as the plane disintegrates, Yelena begins to fall from the sky

00:13:14.945 --> 00:13:18.849
luckily, Natasha sees what happens and saves Yelena with her parachute

00:13:19.233 --> 00:13:23.137
unexpectedly, Mastermind's daughter also survives the explosion

00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:26.017
and lands in the same place as the sisters

00:13:26.209 --> 00:13:28.961
Natasha takes a chance to apply the antidote to her

00:13:29.123 --> 00:13:32.451
causing the daughter to regain her consciousness from the mind control

00:13:32.515 --> 00:13:35.395
Natasha apologizes to her for the death of her father

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:39.171
in the final scene, the foster family all survive the disaster unscathed 

00:13:39.299 --> 00:13:41.475
and are ready for a family reunion

00:13:41.539 --> 00:13:45.699
shortly after however, seeing the enemy convoy is rushing into the battlefield afar

00:13:45.827 --> 00:13:48.899
Natasha urges her family to leave to rescue more black widows

00:13:48.963 --> 00:13:52.150
while she's determined to stay behind for the coming challenge

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.833
this's Daniel CC movie channel, peace out
