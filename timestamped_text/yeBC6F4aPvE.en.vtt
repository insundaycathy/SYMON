00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.080
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.690
Today, I am going to explain the American
drama thriller film called “Stonehearst

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:07.690
Asylum.”

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.940
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.247
Watch out and take care!

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.330
At the beginning of the movie, an Oxford University
professor demonstrates a case of female hysteria

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.090
on Eliza Graves, before his class.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.550
She protests that she is sane, but the professor
mercilessly triggers her hysteria by touching

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.199
her inappropriately.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.109
Any human touch sends her into a frenzied
state.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.370
After the demonstration, he asks his assistant
to bring in the next patient.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.170
Cut to Christmas Eve, a young doctor, Edward
Newgate from Oxford arrives at the Stonehearst Asylum

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.780
He is led by guards and the head of the guards,
Mickey Finn, into the building.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.450
The asylum consists of two hundred residents.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.630
Most of them are Lords and Ladies of the finest
families of Britain.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.379
Dr. Edward is there to gain clinical experience
for his further medical practice.

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.429
He meets the superintendent of the asylum,
Dr. Silas Lamb.

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.589
Edward impresses Dr. Lamb with his will to
work with the mentally challenged.

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.860
So, Dr. Lamb invites Edward to the afternoon
rounds with him.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.070
He introduces him to the patients of the Stonehearst.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.410
Some think they are animals, some delusional,
while some of them are there for being homosexual.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.640
But one patient, in particular, catches Dr.
Edward’s eyes- Lady Eliza Graves, the woman

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.750
shown at the beginning of the film.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.970
She is in the asylum getting treated for female
hysteria.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.900
She belongs to a noble family and is married
to a very wealthy man.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.180
Unfortunately, Lady Eliza suffers from hysteria.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.020
She reacts negatively to all physical touches.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.350
She bit her abusive husband’s ear off.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.390
So, she was sent to the asylum by her father.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.750
Doctor Edward is fascinated by Eliza’s musical
skills.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.360
He seemed to have charmed her as well.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.260
Edward is surprised by Dr. Lamb’s unique
way of treating his patients.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.260
Rather than working on fixing their problems,
he celebrated their conditions and allowed

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.280
them to live happily in their delusions.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.560
Dr. Lamb invites Edward for a staff dinner
that night.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.370
Many dishes lay etiquettely on the dining
table.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.190
But Edward is surprised to see patients joining
them on the table.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.329
According to Dr. Lamb, it is therapeutic for
the patients to mix with the polite society.

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.629
At the dinner, everyone is having cheerful
conversations until Dr. Edward mentions that

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.170
Mickey Finn is a funny name.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.700
This causes tension in the dinner.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.250
Everyone goes silent; but Mickey Finn starts
to laugh hysterically.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.370
He then offers Dr. Edward a glass of alcohol.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.620
He is about to drink it when Lady Eliza from
below the table, hits him with her legs.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.800
Doctor drops the liquor.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.370
Then, Eliza brings him out with an excuse
of cleaning his shirt ,and tells him to run

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.950
away from the asylum as soon as he can.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.620
She gives no reason as to why.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.040
That night, Edward goes to his room confused.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.860
He prepares his gun in case he needs it in
the future.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.870
A loud noise startles Edward.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.790
He follows it and reaches down to the basement.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.620
There are several people in prisons begging
for his help.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.849
His first thought is that they are extremely
insane patients...but after a chat with them,

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.010
he realizes that they are the actual staff
and superintendent of the asylum.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.650
Lamb was actually a patient who led a mutiny.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.730
He locked up the staff, and let the patients
run things (including Finn).

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.150
Among the prisoners are the actual superintendent
of the asylum, Dr. Benjamin Salt, two nurses,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.489
a health guide, and many others.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.569
They were given a drink with some drugs and
brought down to the basement.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.430
Edward realizes that he would have ended up
like them if Lady Eliza hadn’t saved him

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.430
today.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.140
Horrified, Edward rushes to tell Eliza the
truth.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.720
But she already knows all of it.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.280
In fact, she is one of the lunatics who helped
Dr. Lamb imprisoned the staff.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.780
The next day, Lamb takes Edward and Micky
Finn with him on his afternoon rounds.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.200
They make Edward go into a lunatic’s room
to change his dressing.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.629
The lunatic is terrifying to look at.

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.079
When Edward initially approaches him, he is
attacked by the man.

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.319
He is almost about to choke Edward to death, but soon, he notices the name “Arthur” written

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.639
on the wall.

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.120
Edward assumes that it is the lunatic’s
name so he calls him Arthur.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.139
This finally calms the man down.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:08.599
Dr. Lamb is impressed but Edward ends up with
many injuries after the encounter.

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.689
Lady Eliza looks after his wounds.

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:15.420
Edward tells her about his intentions of freeing
the prisoners and running away with them.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.100
At that time, she reveals that back then,
Stonehearst Asylum was a cruel place for the

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.360
patients....where they were experimented upon
by Dr. Salt.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.230
His ways and ideas matched that of a devil’s.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.440
Lamb, Mickey Finn, Eliza, the cooks, and the
guards were all the victims of Dr. Salt’s

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.660
cruel method.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.000
He touched Eliza inappropriately to trigger
her hysteria with an excuse of finding her

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.970
a cure, he applied severe water pressure on
some of his patients and kept them in the

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.880
running water for days.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.230
According to Dr. Salt, a patient’s worst
fear is the way to cure their madness.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.400
But he struggled to find Lamb’s worst fear.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.310
Dr. Salt performed all kinds of terrifying
procedures on Lamb when he was a patient.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.310
Lamb and other patients had come to despise
Dr. Salt so they planned for months, the way

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.450
to free themselves of the torture.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.340
Finally, one day, they spiked the doctor and
staff’s drink and imprisoned them.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.320
Lamb took Dr. Salt’s place as the chief
of the asylum, and let the patients live freely.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.560
He employed some of them as the gatekeepers,
some as cooks, and some as nurses.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.600
He gave all their life a purpose and made
Stonehearst a happy place.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.340
After hearing the story, Edwards promises
that she will never again have to suffer the

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.330
way that she has.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.040
Shortly, Edward impresses everyone in the
asylum.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.416
An old lady had refused to eat until her son
comes from war.

00:05:31.416 --> 00:05:36.020
Edward poses as her son and lovingly feeds
the lady.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.470
Seeing this encounter, Eliza is more drawn
towards Edward.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.310
His kindness has impressed her.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.780
The pair starts to fall in love with each
other.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.650
Edward tries to persuade her to run away with
him from the asylum but Eliza is doubtful

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.110
of the idea.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.550
Not long after, Edward is called by Dr. Lamb

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:57.100
Dr. Lamb wants Edward to assist him in an
experimental procedure on Dr. Salt.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.990
He ties him to the bed.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.470
Dr Lamb claims that Dr. Salt is a lunatic
who believes himself to be the rightful superintendent

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.120
of Stonehearst, and he needs a therapy.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.110
This therapy is called “Electrotherapy”.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.970
Then, in front of Edward, Dr Lamb hits the
switch, electrocuting him.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.240
He asks Edward to do the same.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.030
After the electrotherapy, Dr. Salt loses all
of his memory.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.870
The next day is the new year 1900.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.630
Everyone in Stonehearst is celebrating and
happy.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.100
Edward intends to set the prisoners free tonight.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.892
A ceremony takes place.

00:06:29.892 --> 00:06:33.090
Everyone is dancing as Dr. Lamb watches them.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.660
Elsewhere, Edward knows Dr. Lamb has some
good inside him.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.990
So, he sets out to find it.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.014
In Lamb’s room when he was a patient, Edward
finds a hidden picture inside the wall, and

00:06:43.014 --> 00:06:44.734
takes it with him.

00:06:44.734 --> 00:06:47.934
Everyone goes outside the building to celebrate
the coming of the new century.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.370
But Edward stays inside to spike the champagne
with a chemical that will make everyone unconscious.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.540
However, Mickey Finn catches him in the act.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.740
After an intense fight, Edward frees himself
from Finn.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.870
The spiked champagne is brought to the celebration
and distributed to everyone.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.910
But as they are about to drink it, Mickey
Finn stops them, and Edward's act is caught.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.500
Dr. Lamb hits him with a bottle.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.630
When Edward opens his eyes, he is tied to
a hospital bed and is being taken into the

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.040
electrotherapy room.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.100
Dr. Edward is about to be electrocuted as
Dr. Salt did.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.930
Just then, Eliza comes into the room with
Edward’s pocket watch.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.030
It has a picture of Eliza on it.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.840
She assumes that her husband had sent Edward
to get her out of the asylum.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.670
She asks him for his real intentions for coming
into the asylum.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.950
He reveals that six months ago, he
was in a medical lecture where a doctor displayed

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.360
Eliza and her medical disability.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.150
He felt so pitiful and saddened by her condition,
he vowed to save her from that hell.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.720
This was the real reason Edward had come to
the Stonehearst Asylum.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.880
As he is being taken away, he asks Eliza to
run away from the asylum.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.430
Just as Dr. Lamb is about to electrocute him,
Edward requests a final will.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.060
His request is to give Eliza Graves the picture
that is in his pocket.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.750
But in reality, the picture is the one Edward
had found in Lamb’s room.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.820
Dr. Lamb takes a look at it, and he is shocked.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.570
The picture is the root cause of his madness.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.860
It is revealed that Dr. Lamb was a real doctor
in the war.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.950
He had to kill his soldier friends to free
them of the pain.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.910
He had shot each of them to death, and had
tried to kill himself too, but he ran out

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.200
of bullets.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.170
This turned him insane with time.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:28.870
The picture Edward showed him was the picture
of one of Lamb’s soldier friends.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.320
So, it triggered his madness again.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.140
Dr. Lamb runs away from there.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.330
Seeing this, Mickey Finn decides to perform
the procedure on Edward himself.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.370
But Eliza comes to Edward’s aid.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.640
The whole asylum watches them fight cheerfully.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.400
However, Finn triggers her hysteria by touching
her trigger point, sending her into a frenzied

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.490
state.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:49.709
Edward manages to calm her down.

00:08:49.709 --> 00:08:50.709
Raynaldo, put one here

00:08:50.709 --> 00:08:52.350
Then, the fight continues.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.089
Mickey Finn finally gets electrocuted and
burns to death.

00:08:55.089 --> 00:08:58.329
But the fire spreads around and the room starts
burning.

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:02.660
Eliza runs to save the prisoners from the
basement...while Edward goes looking for Lamb.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.930
He finds him in the hallway; out of his mind
and deluded.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.080
So, Edward brings him outside with other patients.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.870
All of them are safe now.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.209
Everything is over.

00:09:12.209 --> 00:09:16.439
Edward wants Eliza to come to a new place
with him, but Eliza refuses.

00:09:16.439 --> 00:09:20.785
They kiss their last goodbye...when Edward
tells Eliza that he has a final secret to share

00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:23.689
It is now a few months later.

00:09:23.689 --> 00:09:26.980
Stonehearst has become back to normal, and
is better than ever.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.060
The true head nurse appears to be running
things some time later, caring for the patients

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.209
now...including Salt and Lamb.

00:09:33.209 --> 00:09:37.230
The Oxford professor from the beginning of
the movie and Eliza Graves’ husband arrive

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.190
at the asylum to release her.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.930
But they are surprised to be informed that
Dr. Edward had already discharged her three

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.180
weeks ago.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.370
The men are surprised to hear this because
the professor himself is Dr. Edward Newgate;

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.240
THE REAL Dr. Edward

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.009
He explains that the person who came here
posing as a doctor was actually a patient

00:09:54.009 --> 00:09:55.029
of his.

00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:59.980
He had seen Eliza Graves in a medical demonstration
at Oxford.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.519
Then he ran away from an asylum in London
with Dr. Edward’s belongings and stole his identity

00:10:05.135 --> 00:10:07.255
All in order to save Eliza Graves.

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:12.759
At the end of the movie, we see Mrs. Graves
and the imposter Newgate in Tuscany, Italy.

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:15.470
They are now known as Dr. and Mrs. Lamb.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.870
The two dance happily...and embrace in the
garden of what appears to be another asylum,

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.329
run peacefully by nuns.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:24.149
That’s the ending of the movie “Stonehearst
Asylum”.

00:10:24.149 --> 00:10:26.449
Now, for the explanation.

00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:29.120
Edward has been a mentally ill patient all
along.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:34.050
He suffers from a condition called pseudologia
fantastica, more commonly known as pathological lying

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:39.319
It is a condition where a person constantly
lies for no personal gain.

00:10:39.319 --> 00:10:41.339
Edward had been doing this for years.

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:43.589
We never come to know his real name.

00:10:43.589 --> 00:10:48.209
But despite of his disorder, he possesses
the unique qualities of love and empathy.

00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:52.699
His love and empathy for mentally ill people
like him made him able to help those people.

00:10:52.699 --> 00:10:55.950
Even Eliza's fear of touch is cured because
of him.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.610
Because of this, Edward is able to act like
a sane and normal person.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.490
The audience will not think that he is a madman.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.100
Edward's character is built very strongly.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.339
One of the messages conveyed from this film
is about how great the power of love is.

00:11:09.339 --> 00:11:13.610
It is even capable of conquering the greatest
human suffering: an insane soul.
