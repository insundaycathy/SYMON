00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.320
Welcome to Movie Shortens.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.140
Follow us today to a movie titled: Cube.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.900
Be aware, there are spoilers!

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.449
The movie begins as a man, Alderson, awakens
in a strange box-like room.

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.219
He is clad in what appears to be prison overalls.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.670
He is clearly confused and has no idea where
he is but he finds a number of handles around

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.670
the room.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.370
Alderson soon realizes he is able to twist
these, each opening a square shaped door to

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.610
another near-identical room.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.200
The rooms appear to vary only in their colour.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.070
He steps through another and triggers a booby
trap.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.559
He is brutally killed, cut into many small
pieces.

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.289
Cutting to another room, we see another man,
Worth, asleep.

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.600
He is wearing similar prison-style fatigues.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.670
A bloodied hand emerges through one of the
doors, followed by its owner, Quentin.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.670
He is more alert and agitated.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.139
As another door opens, he runs and grabs the
person emerging from it and tosses her across

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:56.610
the room.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.789
Her name is Holloway and she is in a state
of panic.

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.830
Almost immediately, Quentin hears someone
yell in a nearby room and so he goes to investigate.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.220
Here he sees Leaven.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.510
He warns her not to move and checks for traps,
before helping her back into the room where

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.510
the others are.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.180
The last to enter is an older man named Rennes.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.040
It is at this point that Quentin warns the
group about the traps, suggesting that they

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.480
don’t go climbing about.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.220
Upon entry, Rennes immediately begins unlacing
his boots.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.140
Meanwhile, Holloway, who is a doctor, tends
to Worth who has been hit on the head.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.780
Rennes uses his boot, checking another room
for traps, hurling it through and hauling

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.780
it back using the laces.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.360
The boot is immediately torched.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.230
Rennes suggests this trap has been activated
by motion sensors.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.380
The group attempts to establish how they arrived
in the cube, but all they can remember are

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.950
their final actions outside of the cube.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.160
Their conversation is interrupted by a grinding
noise and a brief but heavy tremor.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.890
The group contemplate their next move, with
Rennes suggesting they move in a straight

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.659
line until they get out.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.900
Quentin agrees while Leaven wishes to stay,
but she is persuaded to join them.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.330
Worth is dismissive of their plan and suggests
there is no way out.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.920
It is during this conversation that Quentin
reveals he is a cop.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.330
In the next room, the group speculates as
to the cause of the vibrations.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.140
They rule out ventilation as a possibility.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.750
They also notice that each room has a lengthy
set of numbers at each entry point.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.500
Holloway draws the other members’ attention
to their plight.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.660
With no food or water, she suggests, they
can only survive for about 3 days.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.060
Quentin soon works out that Rennes is actually
The Wren - a famous criminal who has successfully

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.200
escaped from 7 different prisons.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.640
This gives Leaven hope that he’ll help them
escape, but Wren declares that he is only

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.770
taking them with him because he needs their
boots.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.910
Clearly overconfident, Wren hops into the
next room and triggers a trap which squirts

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.280
acid into his face.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.110
Though the others are able to help him out
of the trapped room, he quickly dies as the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.040
acid eats through his face and into his skull.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.599
Next, Quentin begins to contemplate why the
group has been selected and begins interrogating

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.599
the others.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.849
Leaven is dismissive of her talents, telling
them she’s just a student, and Worth says

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.700
he is merely an office worker.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.170
We find out that Quentin is a father of three
and he’s desperate to get out.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.380
Holloway is angry and openly speculates about
who or what has put them here.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.830
Quentin realizes that Holloway’s rings have
been taken, but not Leaven’s glasses, suggesting

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.910
there must be a reason for this.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.050
He draws her attention to the numbers on one
of the cell doors.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.390
She quickly concludes that only the rooms
with prime numbers have been a trap thus far.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.099
It is soon revealed that she has a gift for
working with numbers.

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.900
The group believe she has decoded the system
as she jumps excitedly through to the next

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.930
room.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.050
Eventually the group find themselves in a
room in which all the doors appear to lead

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.450
to a trapped room, with the exception of the
one in the roof.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.440
Quentin climbs up to open this.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.500
As he does so the final prisoner, Kazan, falls
through the door, knocking over Leaven in

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.500
the process.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.470
Kazan appears almost catatonic and bangs her
head against the wall.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.900
He wants to go back to a blue room.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.690
Holloway signs him off as mentally handicapped.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.060
While the others wish to leave Kazan behind,
Holloway says that she’ll take care of him.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.050
As Holloway springs into the next room she
appears to choke.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.750
The others assume this to be gas and summon
her back.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.840
However, she is actually choking on a button
she had been sucking on to keep her saliva

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.840
flowing.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.200
The room is safe.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.830
The next one isn’t though and Leaven spots
this just in time.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.800
This gives Quentin the chance to dive out
of the way before being cut to pieces.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.120
He sustains injuries to his arm and leg, but
survives and remains mobile.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.130
The room code did not contain a prime number
so their system has failed them.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.449
Tensions rise and Quentin begins to blame
Kazan for this, claiming he knew about the

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:40.449
trap.

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.530
Meanwhile, Leaven gets to work re-exploring
her number theory.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.610
Quentin also challenges Worth about his negative
attitude.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.230
As they argue, Worth finally admits that he
helped to build the outer shell of the cube.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.639
He claims to have had no knowledge as to what
it was or what it would be used for.

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.610
As Holloway, Quentin and Worth continue to
fight about its purpose and their plight,

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.210
Quentin turns violent and punches Worth.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.140
Leaven interjects, claiming they need Worth.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.880
She soon discovers he knows the cube’s dimensions.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.080
This allows her to work out that it is probably
around 26 rooms across in each direction.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.120
Then, using the numbers as coordinates she
is able to discern their location and the

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.540
quickest route to the edge of the cube.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.530
En route to its edge the group come across
a boobytrapped room blocking their path.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.770
They figure out this one is trapped using
sound sensors.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.910
Rather than turn back, they decide to push
on and attempt to move through it in silence.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.389
Each member makes it through with Quentin
the last to follow.

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.389
As he approaches the exit door, Kazan yelps
and activates the trap, but Quentin makes

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:36.430
it through.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.890
Clearly angered by this, a further argument
ensues.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.300
As they fight, Holloway - who is increasingly
protective of Kazan - suggests Quentin was

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.620
probably an abusive husband and that he clearly
likes young girls.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.790
This seems based on the affection he has been
showing towards Leaven.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.570
Quentin loses control and aggressively slaps
Holloway.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.759
Now at the end, the group are desperate to
find a door on a wall facing their edge of

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:00.759
a cube.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:05.660
They decide to make a rope using their overalls
so one member can swing across to investigate.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.820
Though Quentin eventually volunteers, they
decide on Holloway as she is considerably

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.470
lighter than the heavier police officer.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.550
On the outside of the cube, at the bottom
of their rope, Holloway swings across 3 times

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.190
but cannot see a door.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.600
On the third occasion the remainder of the
group lose grip on the rope, shaken by the

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.970
cube’s vibrations.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.070
As the rope slips from the cube, Quentin dives
and grabs it, saving Holloway.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.150
However, as she climbs back up and clasps
his hand, he decides to let her go.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.000
She plummets to her death.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.610
Though Quentin claims she slipped, it is clear
that the rest of the group have their doubts.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.090
With the relationship between the members
of the group more strained than ever, Quentin

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.680
attempts to head off with Leaven leaving the
others behind.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.110
In the next room, he approaches her from the
back in what appears to be a sexual advance.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.070
She attempts to resist him, but he tightens
his grip.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.980
Luckily, she is saved by Worth.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.199
As a result of his intervention, Quentin turns
violent beating Worth.

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:05.260
He then drops him through the door in the
floor of this room into the one below.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.320
From there we hear Worth begin to chuckle.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.990
He has landed next to the corpse of Rennes.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.320
Devastated, the rest of the group conclude
they have been going around in circles.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.620
It is in this room that they make two major
discoveries though.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.710
Firstly, Worth realizes they have ended up
in the same room, the rooms have been moving

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.490
every time they have felt vibrations.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:28.820
Leaven, meanwhile, is once again confident
she has decoded the system, with the trapped

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.770
rooms identified not by prime numbers but
by the powers of prime numbers.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:37.720
Sadly, she tells the others, calculating these
is beyond her capabilities and she’d need

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.449
a computer to do it.

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:42.220
As they argue about this, Kazan begins to
speak.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.300
The others quickly realize he is an autistic
savant and can do these calculations with

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.300
ease.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.600
They use his amazing mathematical powers to
help them continue their journey, occasionally

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.310
having to bribe him with the promise of candy
if they make it out.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:59.750
Desperate to be rid of an increasingly volatile
Quentin, the group lay a trap for him.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.289
Initially, as he attempts to make it through
a door, Worth traps him in it.

00:08:03.289 --> 00:08:07.310
When Quentin is able to clamber through he
is lured into the middle of the room by Leaven

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.520
and Kazan.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.830
He falls through the door on the floor that
Worth has opened.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.229
With Quentin lying lifeless on the floor,
blood emanating from his head, they continue

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:17.360
on their journey.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.300
The group make it to what they believe to
be a bridge room which, ever so often, moves

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.510
into a position in which they can escape.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.800
Here, at what they believe to be the right
moment, they open a door to the outside.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.810
A striking white light shines through.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:35.080
While Kazan and Leaven start heading out,
Worth remains seated and tells them he wishes

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.080
to stay behind.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.140
He has lost the will to live.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.419
As Leaven tries to persuade him to join her,
Quentin re-emerges from the door behind her

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:45.380
and stabs her using one of the door handles.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.020
He also attacks Worth, severely wounding him.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.060
He then closes in on Kazan who has made it
to the bridge, but is held back by Worth.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:57.050
The cubes change position and in doing so
it tears Quentin in half, whose upper body

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.950
is now on the outside.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:03.170
In the final scene, as Kazan strolls down
the bridge surrounded by light, Worth crawls

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.910
into the middle of the room to die at Leaven’s
side.
