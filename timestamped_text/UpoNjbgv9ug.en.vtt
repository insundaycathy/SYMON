00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.880
that her engagement ring is missing and she is&nbsp;

play a song until jerry returns and messes with&nbsp;
him kayla catches them and stops them from causing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.640
trouble but after she threatens to bring in&nbsp;
exterminators jerry reveals he has prieta's ring&nbsp;&nbsp;

ends up grabbing the ring so she can return it to&nbsp;
prieta terence tells dubros he should fire kayla&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.200
for failing to catch jerry since he spotted him&nbsp;
during the commotion but dubros thinks the wedding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.480
planning is stressing terence out so he puts&nbsp;
him on leave and promotes kayla to his position&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.320
she goes to the roof to find tom and jerry and&nbsp;
tells them they can stay in the hotel as long as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.960
they can prove they can get along without causing&nbsp;
any more damage since the wedding is the next day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.360
kayla sends tom and jerry out into the city for&nbsp;
some time together while she gets the staff ready&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.520
for the wedding the two enjoy themselves even&nbsp;
though tom naturally takes a lot of hits on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.200
streets after the elephants arrive kayla meets&nbsp;
with prieta who admits that she and ben haven't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.320
been communicating well enough and she hasn't been&nbsp;
able to bring herself to tell him that he has done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.160
too much for the wedding fearing it will be a&nbsp;
disaster kayla also runs into ben who expresses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.920
similar sentiments but kayla knows that the two&nbsp;
of them really do love and care for each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:10.320
unfortunately ben miss interprets keller's advice&nbsp;
as to go even bigger than he is already tom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.600
and jerry are taken to the animal pound where&nbsp;
they find butch and his gang they dare tom to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.880
eat jerry to prove that they aren't actually&nbsp;
friends and after tom puts jerry in his mouth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.640
the mouse lights a fire in there that blows their&nbsp;
cover fortunately they are bailed out by terrance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.760
unfortunately he gets them in separate rooms&nbsp;
to spread lies about each other to keep them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.280
turned against one another terence leads the duo&nbsp;
to go to the hotel separately as the wedding is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.960
starting to take place he gets tom to go after&nbsp;
jerry chasing him on top of the wedding cake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.400
chef jackie starts hitting the cake to get&nbsp;
jerry leading him to fly towards the elephants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.440
who promptly freak out at the sight of jerry&nbsp;
this causes them to start stampeding throughout&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:59.280
the hotel before they end up running into the&nbsp;
streets following the disaster prieta tells ben&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.400
the wedding is off and gives him back the ring&nbsp;
kayla is then forced to come clean to dubros&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.920
about lying about her resume and sees herself&nbsp;
out of the hotel before she is officially fired&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.440
tom and jerry realize it was their fault the&nbsp;
wedding was ruined and they finally decide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.200
to set aside their differences to help kayla they&nbsp;
find her and jordan in the market and offer their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.840
services to help put on a wedding in central park&nbsp;
kayla finds out that prieta is heading for jfk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.200
airport so she has tom and jerry chase after her&nbsp;
on a remote controlled skateboard with a drone to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:39.600

to chase her meanwhile kayla talks to dubros&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.880
and apologizes for lying but he's convinced&nbsp;
that she is capable of turning things around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:51.520
even as terence argues however kayla knows taryn&nbsp;
set tom and jerry loose to fight and she promises&nbsp;&nbsp;

to keep it a secret if he helps her out which he&nbsp;
agrees to kayla gets ben and everyone to the park&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:04.160
where prieta arrives and finds everyone she&nbsp;
and ben reconcile and are finally married&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:10.080
during the reception kayla and terence make&nbsp;
amends and caleb is allowed to keep her job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:15.840
she does bring linda back so that she can have&nbsp;
