Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.140
Before we start, WARNING!

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.200
Spoilers Ahead!

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.581
Today, I’m going to recap a 2013 Korean
Drama Comedy movie, called Miracle in Cell

00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:20.020
No. 7.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.230
This movie is based on the real-life story
of a mentally disabled man who was tortured

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.200
and pleaded guilty under duress to the sexual
assault and murder of a 9-year-old girl in

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.240
1972 in Chuncheon city.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.870
So, what did he do to deserve such a predicament?

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.270
Was he freed in the end?

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.160
Let’s find it out.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.899
At the start of the movie, we are introduced
to Ye-Sung, a full-fledged lawyer who tries

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.980
to defend her father’s name.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.170
Her father was falsely accused of sexual assault
and murder of a girl.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.100
She claims that the prosecutor makes false
claims since she is a witness to the whole

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.109
incident.

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.620
To convince the judge, she tells the courtroom
about her past.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.059
6-year-old Ye-Sung and her mentally disabled
father, Lee, visit a shop to buy a Sailor

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.590
Moon backpack which they have looked for for
weeks.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.920
However, a police Commissioner purchases it
first and leaves nothing for them.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.390
Due to his mental illness, the Commissioner
misunderstands him and beats him.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.350
Ye-Sung is a kind and smart girl.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.850
Despite her disappointment of not getting
the bag, she doesn’t ask about it anymore

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.430
from her father.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.280
During his job, the Commissioner’s kid reaches
out to Lee to tell him about a store where

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.390
he can get the same backpack.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.010
Lee follows her but she gets into an accident.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.590
He tries to save her but is misunderstood
by a witness who reports him of sexually assaulting

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.110
and killing the girl.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.080
Even in the police station, he is still concerned
about Ye-Sung who is alone at home.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.330
He tries to leave but is beaten by the police
and kept until the next day.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.830
In the morning, the police make false comments
on his actions, noting that he tries to get

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.790
revenge on the Commissioner by assaulting
his girl.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.920
To add to his predicament, he is forced to
make a false reenactment in exchange for meeting

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.380
his daughter, which is also a lie told by
the police.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.320
Lee is immediately rushed to a prison and
the Warden beats him because of his unreal

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.320
crime.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.959
He is detained in cell number 7 along with
5 other inmates.

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.060
After reading the crime report, the inmates
beat him but stop upon knowing that he is

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.900
sentenced to death.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.130
During working hours, the inmates are tasked
to make soccer balls and use it as an alibi

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.240
to smuggle things with the initiative of the
gang Leader.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.660
By distributing the smuggled things, the Leader
and his gang establish their turf within the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.660
prison.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.280
This invites dislike from another gang leader.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.110
The other gang leader tries to stab the Leader
but is saved by Lee.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.650
The indebted Leader asks Lee to make a wish
and he will grant it.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.210
So Lee asks for his daughter Ye-Sung.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.830
When a church event is held, Ye-Sung is kidnapped
by the inmates and smuggled into the prison

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.100
to meet Lee.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.180
Lee is overjoyed to meet his daughter and
hugs her tightly.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.810
He says sorry for leaving her and explains
that he is being detained.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.580
However, their reunion is cut short because
the church event is disbanded.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.980
The inmates try to smuggle her out but the
church’s bus already left, so Ye-Sung lives

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.760
in the cell with them.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.690
Upon living with them, the inmates realize
that Lee is not an assailant since he loves

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.900
her daughter so much.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.520
2 days have passed, and the cell room looks
more like Ye-Sung’s playground rather than

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.990
a prison cell.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.940
The inmates get along with Ye-Sung and warm
up to her due to her brightness.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.870
The inmates try to smuggle her out once more
on a religious holiday, to avoid punishment.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.790
However, they mistook the day and find Buddhist
monks instead.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.110
In one night, the Warden realises that a girl
is smuggled into the prison.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.300
He commands the guards to look for her.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.410
The inmates try to hide her once more but
are caught by the Warden.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.319
Ye-Sung is sent back to the orphanage and
Lee is confined in a solitary cell.

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.610
That night, a fire breaks out from an attempted
arson.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.400
A prisoner sets his cell on fire and the Warden
tries to save him.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.390
However, the fire gets bigger and the Warden
is trapped instead.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.430
Lee tries to save him but gets injured during
the process.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.140
When he wakes up, he realizes that Lee has
saved him and suspects that his crime report

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.140
is fabricated.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.540
Meanwhile, Ye-Sung comes back to her school
to attend the classes.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.150
Her teacher asks about her problem and Ye-Sung
recommends a parent consultation instead,

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.010
so that she can meet her father.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.000
In the prison, Lee is finally united with
her daughter once more.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.039
Upon realizing that the girl just misses her
father so much, she doesn't bother them and

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.130
lets them talk wholeheartedly.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.590
They enjoy their conversation very much but
the visit time’s up.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.610
The Warden sees Lee’s love towards his daughter
for the first time and is more convinced about

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.970
his suspicion.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.010
He recollects his memories about his only
son who was killed by an inmate.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.480
After their separation, Ye-Sung grieves so
much that she doesn’t want to eat.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.650
Seeing this, the Warden cares for her and
adopts her.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.070
He also tries to prove Lee’s innocence.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.500
He looks into his crime files and finds that
his sworn statement is falsified.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.800
The police was also forced to wrap the case
up in a week which might lead to them exploiting

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.650
Lee’s mental disability.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.850
Seeing the injustice that Lee is facing, the
Warden picks Ye-Sung up and smuggles her into

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.050
the prison.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.520
The inmates spend their time together with
Ye-Sung once more.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.190
In the cell, Ye-Sung teaches the Leader how
to read and write.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.310
She also brings a cellphone with her so that
an inmate can call his wife and his newborn

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.370
baby.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.870
One by one, the inmates have a special bond
with her as they help one another.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.720
During an exercise, Lee is informed that his
final trial is set.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.639
The inmates are determined to train him so
that he can win the trial and be unified with

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.370
her daughter once more.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.440
The inmates start by trying to find out what
happened.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.300
Since Lee wasn’t really aware of what happened,
they have to go through several scenarios

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.750
in order to get the picture of the incident.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.560
They found out that it was winter and the
girl slipped on a frozen puddle.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.490
While she was falling, the girl grabbed a
plastic wrap making a brick fall onto her

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.020
head and killed her.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.240
Seeing the girl unconscious, Lee tried to
perform CPR to save her.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.690
But the Commissioner forces the police to
report it as assault and murder despite Lee’s

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.690
denial.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.900
Knowing the mistreat, the inmates are more
convinced to help him win.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.910
They train him to answer trick questions skillfully
without hiding the truth.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.729
Even though it is hard due to Lee’s illness,
they are still confident that Lee will win

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.710
because he has been mistreated.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.160
Lee studies day and night, in every situation,
to make sure he can live with Ye-Sung once

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.160
more.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.820
The inmates also organize a petition from
the other prisoners to help Lee in his trial.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.940
Meanwhile, the Warden meets the Commissioner
to convince him of Lee’s innocence.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.040
He also asks the Commissioner to re-investigate
the case.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.680
However, he has to obey his superior and agrees
with the verdict instead.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.009
When Lee is training, a public Lawyer comes
to meet him.

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.009
The Lawyer says that he must plead guilty
to save Ye-Sung, because the Commissioner

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:41.669
wants him executed.

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:46.110
He threatens him that the Commissioner will
hurt Ye-Sung instead if he wins the trial.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.229
The Lawyer also abandons the prisoners’
petition saying that it won’t help.

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:53.890
After a while, Lee and the Warden depart for
the courtroom.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.130
In the waiting room, the Commissioner threatens
him to accept his punishment, or he will hurt

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.880
his daughter instead.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.050
Under duress, Lee finally breaks and pleads
guilty to the accusations, to save his daughter.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.300
The Warden tries to convince the judge that
Lee is mentally intimidated, but he is still

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.110
sentenced to death.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.270
In the prison, the inmates are still determined
to save Lee and Ye-Sung.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.140
So they devise a plan by utilizing the upcoming
Christmas event.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.259
They plan to make a hot air balloon to let
them escape.

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:25.680
They work around the clock because Lee’s
execution is near.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.320
They believe that the most innocent man in
the prison is Lee and he needs to be freed

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.820
of the injustice.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.510
They also request all of the other prisoners’
and Ye-Sung’s teacher’s help in order

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.300
to commence the plan.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.310
When the event arrives, Ye-Sung takes her
father’s hand and invites him to the yard.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.350
All the other prisoners are also invited by
the kids to convince the guards that the event

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.020
is still ongoing.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.050
In the yard, a hot air balloon is ready to
take Lee and Ye-Sung out.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.270
As they fly away, the guards become aware
of the attempt but are hindered by the prisoners

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.600
and the school teachers.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.700
However, a rope is stuck on a barbed wire
and their attempt fails.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.449
They use this moment to savour the setting
sun together, for the last time.

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:09.190
In the cell, the inmates celebrate Ye-Sung’s
birthday together.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.150
Each of them give her a gift.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.250
Lee gives her the Sailor Moon backpack that
she has been asking for.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.410
Overjoyed with the present, Ye-Sung thanks
Lee for being her father.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.680
However, their joy is cut short since Lee’s
execution is nearing.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.300
Before going, they thank the inmates for their
care and efforts.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.740
The inmates are saddened to let Lee go but
must hold their tears.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.640
They hide Lee’s execution from Ye-Sung under
the pretense of moving to another facility.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.960
As Lee walks past the hall, the other prisoners
also feel sad for him.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.649
As they are about to separate, Lee tries to
hold his tears in.

00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:46.040
He hugs her daughter for the last time and
walks to his execution.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.570
Ye-Sung waits for her father’s final goodbye,
but Lee doesn’t show up because he is devastated

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.020
by their goodbye.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:56.520
After hearing her daughter calling him, he
comes back to hug her wholeheartedly.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.390
He asks for help because he doesn’t want
to be separated from his daughter.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.640
Over and over, he says sorry and asks for
help from anyone, but the prisoners and the

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.920
guards cannot do anything for them.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.390
Seeing his father crying, Ye-Sung also cries
and asks him to stay, saying that she will

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.010
visit him everyday.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.770
After the event, Lee is still executed for
the false accusations.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.780
Ye-Sung studies hard to be a lawyer and appeals
for the case.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.850
With the inmates’ testimony and the public
support, Lee is found innocent and his name

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.130
is cleared.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:30.510
In the end, Ye-Sung sees her as a child and
her father, flying away on the balloon, as

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.010
if he is off to a better place in heaven.
