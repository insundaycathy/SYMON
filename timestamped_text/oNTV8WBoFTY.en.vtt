00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.560
Welcome back to Mrs Rundown, in todayâ€™s
video I am going to be recapping the events

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.850
of 22 Jump Street, a 2014 Comedy/Action film.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.190
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.640
You have been warned.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.520
Now like the video and subscribe to the channel
if you enjoy this video.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.250
The film starts with a "Previously on 21 Jump
Street" opening, featuring a brief recap of

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.199
the last film in which Officers Schmidt and
Jenko were partnered up and became friends

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.619
after they took down the drug dealers Mr.
Walters and Eric Molson, up to Captain Dickson

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.140
assigning them their newest assignment, going
to college.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.910
Schmidt moans the fact that he and Jenko are
taking online courses instead of actually

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.130
being there.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.010
They then head to Metro City Port to take
on an assignment.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.410
There, they find the wanted drug lord, (The
Ghost), a man who is said to have made connections

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.480
with the Mexican cartel.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.770
Schmidt dresses up as a gang member and gets
in character to infiltrate the gang, but Jenko

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.010
knows he sucks at improvising.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.990
The two meet Ghost and his men in a warehouse,
where Schmidt plays up his role while Jenko

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.540
is unconvincing.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.240
Ghost lets them into his truck to check out
his supply.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.820
The two open a crate and an octopus jumps
on Schmidt's face, inking in his mouth.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.329
In their panic, the two drop their accents
and are found out.

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.250
Ghost and his men shoot at Schmidt and Jenko
and make their escape in the truck.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.999
Jenko hops on top of the truck to catch the
goons, while a nervous Schmidt tries to climb

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:18.149
over.

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.630
His foot gets caught in a net and he falls,
dangling over the edge of the truck.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.920
Jenko walks to the front and breaks the windshield,
nearly arresting Ghost, until Schmidt gets

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.000
on top of the truck and hits a beam, getting
himself and Jenko caught with the net onto

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.950
the beam, letting Ghost and his men get away.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.060
The guys meet with Chief Hardy over their
latest screw-up.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.590
Hardy suggests that this wouldn't have happened
if they just did the undercover Jump Street

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.929
program again like last time.

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.810
He adds that even though nobody had faith
in their reboot, the guys got lucky, and now

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.899
they have double the budget to move ahead
with a new assignment.

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.429
The guys are sent to the Vietnamese church
across the street since the Koreans bought

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.110
back the church on 21 Jump Street, and so
they must now report to 22 Jump Street.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.189
There, the guys are impressed by the high
quality look to the headquarters and see that

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.469
Jenko's nerd friends from high school are
now interns.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.590
They report to Dickson, who tells them they're
going to MC State to investigate the appearance

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.349
of a new drug called WhyPhy (stands for "Word
Hard?

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.349
Yes.

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.349
Play Hard?

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.349
Yes.").

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.849
The guys receive a file on a victim of the
drug, Cynthia Watson.

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.099
She was high on WhyPhy and fell out her window
to her death.

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.689
They are also given a picture of Cynthia exchanging
the drug with an unknown suspect.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.990
Schmidt and Jenko make it to MC State, once
again under their aliases of Brad and Doug

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.240
McQuaid, and get adjusted to their dorm and
returning to college life.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.569
They meet the Yang Twins, Keith and Kenny
(The Lucas Brothers), who have a very interesting

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.970
twin connection.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.150
The guys then head to some classes to try
and find any possible dealers.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.110
Schmidt takes a psychology class and is immediately
thought to be a narc.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.680
Jenko takes a history class taught by a professor
that presses Jenko to question his lectures,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.150
since that's what he thinks college is all
about in order for someone to find themselves.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.319
The professor also admits to sleeping with
two students.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.250
The guys later go to an open mic night for
slam poetry where Schmidt meets a pretty girl

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.209
from his class named Maya.

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.019
He goes up on stage to do a weird poem in
honor of Cynthia, which gets a few laughs.

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.280
With no leads, Schmidt and Jenko realize they
need to consult an expert.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.530
They go to prison to visit Mr. Walters, who
brags about having a vagina and being Eric's

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.269
bitch (the latter denies it and begs the guys
to get him out).

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.109
Walters takes a look at the picture of Cynthia
and the suspect, and he mocks the guys for

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.189
not looking at the picture closely to see
that the suspect has a tattoo on his arm of

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.659
a bazooka with "BOOM" written in a cloud.

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.609
The guys visit a tattoo parlor and ask the
tattoo artist if he remembers giving that

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.579
tattoo to anybody, and he thinks he gave it
to a football player with a red mohawk.

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.459
Jenko recognizes the description to match
a guy from his history class named Rooster.

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.049
The guys try out for the football team.

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.849
Jenko immediately strikes up a friendship
with another player named Zook.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.269
Both Schmidt and Jenko try to keep an eye
on Rooster and get a look at his arm to find

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.689
the tattoo.

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.599
Jenko shows impressive skills on the field,
catching the attention of the coach.

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.739
Zook invites Jenko to a party at his frat
house later that night, with Schmidt tagging

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.370
along despite Jenko telling him he should
stay behind.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.250
Jenko gets in with the frat guys, while Schmidt
gets too close to Rooster in trying to find

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.220
the tattoo and is sent away.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.300
While Jenko parties with Zook and the other
frat boys, Schmidt runs into Maya and hangs

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.190
out with her at the art building.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.710
He ends up sleeping with her in her dorm room.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.920
Meanwhile, Jenko joins Zook and Rooster on
the football field where Jenko finally gets

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.030
a look at Rooster's arm.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.030
He DOES have a tattoo, but it's of Rooster's
high school football team, called the Red

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.210
Herrings.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.000
Turns out that Zook has a tattoo on his arm
as well a bazooka with "BOOM" written next

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.030
to it.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.740
Schmidt wakes up and meets Maya's rude roommate
Mercedes.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.030
She mocks Schmidt for looking old and for
the way his sex with Maya sounded.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.940
She leaves and Maya tells Schmidt that Mercedes
was Cynthia's roommate, and that Maya let

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.370
her stay with her because she felt bad, even
though she hates Mercedes.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.000
Schmidt then joins up with Jenko at the headquarters
to report to Dickson, still with no leads,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.360
though Schmidt brags about having sex to Dickson,
who gives him daps to show approval.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.620
The guys meet up in their dorm, where they're
eating blondies.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.990
The Yang Twins inform them that those are
laced with WhyPhy.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.810
Later that night, the guys sneak out at night
and infiltrate Zook's frat house as they are

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.930
going over who they would like to recruit
for their frat.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.050
As they listen in on the frat, they hear a
great approval for Jenko to join, but no love

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.050
for Schmidt.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.599
Zook thinks they should let him in since he's
always with Jenko, but Rooster thinks he'll

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.210
jeopardize whatever they have going on.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.440
Schmidt knocks over a mannequin and makes
a loud noise, forcing him and Jenko to run

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.190
before Zook finds them.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.889
The guys make it to their dorm but are caught
by Zook and his guys, and then are stuffed

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.120
in a trunk.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.099
There, they begin to feel the effects of the
WhyPhy and start to trip out heavily.

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:52.020
Schmidt experiences a dark and unpleasant
trip while Jenko has a colorful and happy

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.020
high.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.060
When they're pulled out of the trunk, they
find that Zook and the other frat boys are

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.470
merely hazing them for initiation.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.490
They subject Schmidt and Jenko to drinking
games.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.930
Jenko excels and impresses the boys while
Schmidt is uncomfortable and clumsy.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.210
When the last task involves pigs, Schmidt
walks out.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.080
Jenko follows and tries to convince him to
stick around and have fun, but Schmidt wants

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.610
no part of it.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.830
Jenko eventually starts spending more time
with Zook while Schmidt is left alone.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.750
Schmidt receives an unwelcome surprise from
his parents as they visit him for Parents

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.550
Weekend, not realizing he's undercover again.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.550
They meet Maya, and Schmidt's mom embarrasses
him again.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.910
It gets worse when Schmidt finds out that
Maya's dad is Dickson.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.170
They sit down to eat with Schmidt's parents
and Maya's mom,

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.130
which gets awkward after Dickson realizes
that Schmidt slept with his daughter.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.569
He angrily throws food from the tables and
makes a scene.

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:47.949
Maya is angry at her dad for being too controlling,
so while she starts to hook up with Schmidt

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.940
again, he decides they can just talk.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.669
They chat about Schmidt's high school experience
(the undercover one).

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:58.680
At the same time, Jenko is working out with
Zook, trying to get him to spill details on

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.669
Cynthia and WhyPhy.

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:04.129
Zook appears dodgy and insists that he knows
what he's doing.

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:08.360
After talking to Maya, Mercedes shows up again
and tells Schmidt that Cynthia got some sort

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.240
of medication from the psychology professor,
Dr. Murphy.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.180
Schmidt and Jenko sneak into Murphy's office
to find something, but Murphy walks in and

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.050
thinks they are there for a counseling session,
mistaking the two for a gay couple.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.009
The guys sit down for the session, spilling
their feelings toward each other, like Jenko

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:29.550
feeling that Schmidt is too clingy and Schmidt
feeling that Jenko is never listening to him.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.470
Murphy mentions something about embedding,
in which details and such are glossed over

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.639
and ignored or misinterpreted, leading the
two to realize that perhaps Zook is not the

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:41.800
dealer in the photograph, but that he is instead
buying from Cynthia.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.669
They also deduce that she and the other dealers
were hiding the WhyPhy in the library books

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:49.000
since nobody goes there and would not bother
to check them out.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.610
The guys report to Dickson again, who is still
pissed at Schmidt for sleeping with Maya.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.800
When Jenko deduces that fact, he goes wild
and runs around headquarters laughing and

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.050
telling everybody "SCHMIDT HAD SEX WITH THE
CAPTAIN'S DAUGHTER!"

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.509
Dickson gets back at Schmidt by tasing him
in the balls.

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:07.360
He adds that they have no more money in their
budget.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.500
Schmidt goes to the library to investigate
while Jenko heads to the field for a football

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.500
game.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.110
In the library, Schmidt sees Ghost and his
goons waiting for someone.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:20.639
Schmidt texts Jenko to come by, persistently
sending messages after messages until Jenko

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:22.349
leaves the game to join him.

00:08:22.349 --> 00:08:26.390
They make enough noise to attract one of Ghost's
goons to come over.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:30.580
Jenko pretends to give Schmidt a blowjob to
draw attention away from themselves, but Jenko

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.490
gets angry when the goon calls them "faggots".

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:37.110
Jenko headbutts him, and Ghost recognizes
him and Schmidt as cops.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.510
They take out their guns and begin shooting,
forcing the guys to run.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.450
They run out to the campus where Jenko gets
a helmet-shaped car.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.620
Ghost and his goons chase them in a hummer.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:51.780
They go all across the campus, causing an
insane amount of property damage.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.740
During the chase, Jenko tells Schmidt that
he got a scholarship to play football at MC

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.640
State and that Zook invited him to be his
roommate.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.820
They drive onto the football field, and the
brakes are out.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.160
They both jump out of the car where it crashes
and explodes onto the goal post.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.260
Schmidt is taken into custody for questioning,
but not before letting Jenko stay behind so

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.620
he can take the fall for him.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.430
He leaves campus, and Maya is mad at Schmidt
for lying to her.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.720
Jenko keeps hanging out with Zook and the
other college kids while Schmidt goes back

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.910
to park duty.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.390
Dr. Murphy is arrested after traces of WhyPhy
were found in his office.

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.250
Hardy declares the case closed.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.730
However, Schmidt looks into the case file
to dig deeper.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.920
He and Jenko meet up in the park.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.610
Schmidt learns that Ghost has been paying
for a student's tuition, while Jenko informs

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.560
him that a large supply of WhyPhy is headed
for Puerto Mexico for spring break.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.510
They decide to team up again and head down
there to finish the job themselves.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.940
The guys make it to Puerto Mexico and come
to a big party on the beach.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:54.330
WhyPhy is being sold everywhere, and they
find the person taking all the money - Mercedes.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.810
They follow her to a warehouse where they
discover that she is Ghost's daughter, and

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.880
they are organizing a network to distribute
WhyPhy across the country.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.440
Even the Yang Twins are in on it.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.470
When Mercedes sees that they are both high
on the drug, she almost kills them until Schmidt

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.390
and Jenko try to arrest them.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:14.480
They are outnumbered by all the goons, so
Dickson and the rest of the Jump Street division

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.290
come in after following Schmidt's tracking
device.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:21.790
As everyone opens fire, Ghost grabs Mercedes'
bag with the money and runs.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:26.760
Dickson runs after him, but sees Maya in the
warehouse partying with others.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.769
He stops to tell her that the girl always
gets kidnapped during these climactic chases,

00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:34.860
only to have the tables turned when Mercedes
shoots him in the foot and abducts him.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.020
Schmidt and Jenko split up so that Schmidt
takes a Lamborghini (which upsets Jenko since

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:43.730
he spent the whole movie wanting to drive
a Lambo), while Jenko chases after Ghost.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:48.839
He manages to fight off his goons on the beach,
using a stoned girl as a weapon.

00:10:48.839 --> 00:10:53.060
Schmidt awkwardly drives the Lambo to a hotel
where he catches up with Mercedes.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.380
They have an uncomfortable fist fight in a
room where Mercedes keeps trying to kiss Schmidt,

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.300
even though she continuously denies trying
to do that.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.930
She knocks him off her and runs for it until
Schmidt catches up to her.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:08.540
Dickson, having made it out of Mercedes' car,
aims his gun at Mercedes, but she holds Schmidt

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.350
at gunpoint.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:14.450
She is taken down by Maya, who whacks her
over the head with a metal fish.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:19.149
Dickson and Maya arrest Mercedes, leaving
Schmidt to join Jenko in catching Ghost.

00:11:19.149 --> 00:11:22.540
The guys meet up and find Ghost trying to
escape in a helicopter.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.870
A goon shoots at them, with Schmidt trying
to take a bullet for Jenko (as he did in the

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:32.089
last movie), only for him to jump too early,
so Jenko gets hit in his arm again.

00:11:32.089 --> 00:11:36.510
Jenko kills the goon and makes it to the helicopter
as it takes off.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.540
Jenko jumps off the roof and grabs onto the
helicopter, with Schmidt successfully making

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.990
the leap as well.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.769
As they fly over the beach, Jenko slips and
Schmidt catches him.

00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:49.320
He orders Jenko to reach into Schmidt's shorts
to grab a grenade.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:54.050
They slip and fall from the helicopter, but
Jenko manages to throw it into the helicopter,

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.649
destroying it and the whole supply of WhyPhy.

00:11:56.649 --> 00:12:01.710
As the two land in the ocean, they are applauded
by the whole crowd, including Rooster and

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:02.710
Zook.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.160
Dickson congratulates the guys for fixing
their screw-up, and then tells them their

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.420
next assignment - medical school.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.920
Thanks for watching!
