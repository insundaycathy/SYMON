but the rope breaks and matthias falls down below&nbsp;&nbsp;

to mayans for help they point gun at them so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.120
aggressively she throws handful of vines on a&nbsp;
kid the tribe is in chaos and shoots the kid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:20.000
jeff realizes the tribe fears vines and whoever&nbsp;
touches it they kill them later they talk to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.840
amy and convince her to help stacy then amy&nbsp;
is sent below on a shaft to rescue matthias&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.600
the girls lift him and put him on the shaft&nbsp;
and bring him at the top eric starts the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.200
generator and they have some lights now in&nbsp;
the tent girls get some rest and fall asleep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.960
jeff goes down and still sees the tribe there the&nbsp;
next morning jeff sees some movement in the vines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.080
and finds a corpse in it stacy wakes up&nbsp;
and sees vine getting into her wounded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.440
eric pulls it out carefully mathias says&nbsp;
something is wrong amy pulls the blanket and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.000
she finds vines wrapped around both of his&nbsp;
legs the vines have eaten the legs to bone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.080
the phone rings again so they send amy&nbsp;
and stacy down inside the temple to get it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.400
they look for the phone soon they enter a small&nbsp;
cornered room with more vines and find a corpse in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:27.760
it they flip the body and gets the phone however&nbsp;
it's not working strangely they hear the noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.640
coming out of flowers and the flowers were making&nbsp;
the sound a phone call then they are attacked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.840
with vines they too makes it to shaft and the&nbsp;
temple starts closing but they make it to escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.040
eric doesn't believe them jeff&nbsp;
tells them if they try to leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:50.960
they'll be shot as well and matthias is paralyzed&nbsp;
jeff tries to assure them that police the embassy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.680
or the hotel somebody will try to find them&nbsp;
and they have left map in the room as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.480
so then they might come to temple looking&nbsp;
after them they just must survive till then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.040
jeff tells them one person should always be awake&nbsp;
to look after others jeff gives his part of water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.120
to matthias later jeff decides they must cut his&nbsp;
legs or mathias will die of infection in the bones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.240
they vote if they want to do it jeff and stacey&nbsp;
votes to do it mathias screams asking to do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:28.080
later jeff asks both the girls to wait in tent&nbsp;
jeff heats a stone and breaks the bones of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:36.720
matthias's legs with it then he starts cutting the&nbsp;
legs with a knife eric throws upon seeing that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.840
girls come out and starts yelling at them then&nbsp;
we see vines taking the broken legs of matthias&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.400
later that night eric goes to the tent and&nbsp;
tries to comfort girls from what they witnessed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:56.400
jeff meanwhile tries to observe the tribe and&nbsp;
looks for any escape route amy goes to eric and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.680
talks to him a bit about matthias health&nbsp;
and mourns of what they are going through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.840
in the tent stacy hears amy's noise and accuses&nbsp;
them of exchanging hormones they start arguing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:15.280
and stacey snitches on amy that amy kissed&nbsp;
matthias while jeff was not around in meantime&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:22.560
the vine starts suffocating matthias killing him&nbsp;
later they hear vine flowers making some sounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:29.760
the flowers mock the girl's voice like&nbsp;
humans the next morning jeff tells amy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.840
that the tribe is making them quarantine&nbsp;
there so the infection of vines won't spread&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.520
eric comes to them and shows them stacey&nbsp;
being infected with the disease of vines&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:46.320
it might have happened when they were inside the&nbsp;
temple so jeff decides to take it out with knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:52.320
he plucks it out of her skin he then makes&nbsp;
a cut and takes it out of her spine as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.840
later stacey says there is more vines inside and&nbsp;
it's in her head as well then the vines moves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:07.440
under the skin in her forehead revealing that her&nbsp;
fears are true later that day stacey goes outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.800
the tent while other are sleeping and takes&nbsp;
a knife she hears flowers mocking her voice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.960
they come out and find stacy making cuts all&nbsp;
over her body jeff tries to calm her down and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:25.840
she cuts him with a knife eric also tries to&nbsp;
calm her but she stabs him and he dies from it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.840
later she mourns about what she has done the&nbsp;
vines grab eric's body and starts dragging it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.440
stacey begs amy to kill her that she is infected&nbsp;
and the plants start to speak the same thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:45.760
jeff decides to kill her as an act of mercy later&nbsp;
jeff covers amy with blood so she is not easy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.280
to get a hold of he gives her the car keys and&nbsp;
says he will distract the mayans and kisses her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.000
he goes down and lays amy on the ground&nbsp;
he tries to talk to mayan leader about his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.520
life and provokes them they point at him and amy&nbsp;
runs from there soon he is attacked by the tribe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.840
mayans start chasing her in the jungle the&nbsp;
leader shoots him in the head out of mercy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.880
before the vines eat him amy finally makes&nbsp;
it to the jeep and manages to drive away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.840
as she drives we see vines crawling under her skin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.520
the next day two friend of matthias makes&nbsp;
their way in the jungle looking for him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:36.160
then the movie ends however i decided to find&nbsp;
the extended version of this movie and in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:42.880
alternate ending we see a group of people in a&nbsp;
graveyard an old man is blowing whistle as he goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:50.080
next to the grave of amy the flowers start blowing&nbsp;
the whistle back he touches it in the movie ends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.120
this explains the main purpose why earlier&nbsp;
the tribe was not allowing them to escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:01.760
and now we can assume that the vines infected&nbsp;
most of the people until any cure is found if any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.240
let me know in the comments what&nbsp;
would you have done to escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.040
