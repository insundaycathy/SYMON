00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.080
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm&nbsp;
going to explain a sci-fi, horror,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.400
mystery film called "The Lazarus Effect."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.080
Footage shows a group of medical&nbsp;
researchers operating on a dead pig,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.760
trying to bring it back to life. They inject&nbsp;
it with a serum and turn their machine on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.200
but nothing happens. When one of the&nbsp;
researchers jokes about eating the pig,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.480
the pig begins squealing before dying&nbsp;
again, but this time with its eyes open.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.160
At a university in California, Zoe McConnell,&nbsp;
one of the scientists, leads an intern student,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.720
Eva, into their lab to document the team's&nbsp;
progress in experiments and research.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.880
The student meets Zoe's coworkers Niko, Clay,&nbsp;
and Frank, who happens to be Zoe's fiancé.&nbsp;

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.640
&nbsp;
In the documentary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.280
Frank explains that they manage to extract serum,&nbsp;
codenamed "Lazarus," by bonding B-cell tumors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.360
speeding up nerve fiber regrowth. They then&nbsp;
electrocute the serum to be activated and start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.880
neural activation by inserting the serum into&nbsp;
the brain's temporal lobe and charging it with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.720
the right amount of energy, which is enough to&nbsp;
trigger the serum and hope for the best results.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.640
Frank further explains that they developed the&nbsp;
serum to help coma patients retain neural activity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.200
and is now used to bring the dead back to life.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.960
While Clay is fascinated with Eva, Niko seems&nbsp;
smitten with Zoe as he looks at her while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.440
Clay asks him what she thinks about the student.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Zoe plays a piece of classical music as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.240
she prepares for their test experiment. The music&nbsp;
stops, and a silhouette appears behind her. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.800
looks around to check what's going on, and when&nbsp;
she turns back, a man behind a pig mask appears.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.800
It is only Niko fooling around, trying to ease&nbsp;
the tension as he notices her so bothered about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.800
the work. While they share the food that Niko&nbsp;
has brought, Niko asks her about how things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.960
are between her and Frank. Zoe discloses that&nbsp;
it's almost three years since they got engaged,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.080
but they had to put the wedding off since&nbsp;
the University granted them to do research,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.560
and Frank seems to be serious about work. However,&nbsp;
Niko tells her that maybe the universe is telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.240
her something, which she dismisses, saying that&nbsp;
the universe is telling her to finish their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.920
research soon instead.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.840
That night, Zoe has a nightmare about a burning&nbsp;
apartment building, and she seems trapped inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.400
it. A pair of burnt hands protrude from beneath&nbsp;
a door while the dolls are flaming. With a gasp,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.800
Zoe awakens and grabs her sacred necklace. Frank&nbsp;
enters the room to console her for a while,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.320
then heads to bed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.760
The following day, the researchers discuss&nbsp;
how they would improve the last experiment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.040
which was almost a success. The previous&nbsp;
experiment seems to burn the temporal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.120
brain after exposing a large voltage as&nbsp;
an activator. Clay introduces the idea of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.480
putting a bio-insulator around the serum,&nbsp;
delaying the activation so that the brain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.760
won't fry up.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.800
To test his hypothesis, they operate an experiment&nbsp;
on Rocky, a deceased blind dog. They inject the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.960
serum into the test subject, but nothing appears&nbsp;
to happen at first. They then adjust to a higher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.440
voltage, still nothing. However, Eva notices&nbsp;
that Rocky twitches his ears upon watching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.920
through her camera. They do not believe her and&nbsp;
say that it is due to muscle stimulation only.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.600
Niko examines Rocky and announces that&nbsp;
seemingly nothing happened, then suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.160
Rocky begins to bark and move around. Everyone&nbsp;
panics but still manages to calm Rocky down, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.880
Zoe notices that its cataract is gone. Frank warns&nbsp;
everyone not to disclose anything outside the lab.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.800
Meanwhile, they then celebrate their&nbsp;
success with a bottle of champagne.&nbsp;

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.880
Later that day, Frank and Zoe take Rocky to&nbsp;
their home. They observe that he looks sad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.800
and he doesn't want to eat his food. Zoe seems&nbsp;
to worry about Rocky that maybe something about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.920
their experiment went wrong as her guilt&nbsp;
clouds her mind, and she even questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.080
their research. Frank assures her that they&nbsp;
will help many people if the study succeeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.440
Frank continues to work while his&nbsp;
fiancé heads to bed. That evening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.760
while Zoe is sleeping alone in their bed, the&nbsp;
door slowly opens, and Rocky appears on the bed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.600
approaching and watching her sleep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.280
The next day, back inside the laboratory,&nbsp;
the student tries to play with Rocky.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.880
Still, he seems uninterested and anti-social. They&nbsp;
put Rocky under a C.T. scan to further examine his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.040
brain. It turns out that the results show the&nbsp;
same symptom of hyperthyroidism, which is an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.360
aggressive personality. Although the serum should&nbsp;
have dissipated within hours, the team discovers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.040
that it is still in Rocky's brain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.280
Afterward, while Rocky sits in his cage,&nbsp;
Clay is left alone in the lab with Rocky.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.800
For a moment, he turns away from the&nbsp;
dog, and he suddenly hears a crash.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.400
When Clay checks what's going on, he finds the&nbsp;
fridge open with the food all over the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.920
So, Clay immediately returns to see Rocky and sees&nbsp;
Rocky’s cage empty. Feeling scared and worried,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.920
Clay finds Rocky growling at him. The team&nbsp;
returns, and he tells them what happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.680
but no one believes him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.720
The following day, the University's dean&nbsp;
summons Frank to lecture him about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.840
underground experiments, unhappy that he&nbsp;
and his team are attempting to play God.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.600
Frank discovers that someone has been showing the&nbsp;
dean their footage of the attempts of testing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.200
serum on animals.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.880
At the same time, the shareholders show up at&nbsp;
the lab and seize all the team's equipment and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.200
research database. Zoe accuses the student of&nbsp;
telling the dean since this only happened after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.800
she arrived, but Frank says that someone wanted&nbsp;
to take over their project and take credits for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.240
their masterpiece.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.280
However, after learning that a major&nbsp;
pharmaceutical corporation had bought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.880
out the company funding the project, the team&nbsp;
sneaks back into the lab at night to recreate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.280
the experiment using a security pass that Eva&nbsp;
kept. They will do another experiment to document,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.440
serving as proof that they own the rights of the&nbsp;
Lazarus project. Niko hacks into the security&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.920
system to buy them time, while Clay obtains a&nbsp;
second dead dog and prepares it for another test.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.480
When the test subject is ready to be activated,&nbsp;
Zoe activates the voltage. However, the lights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.760
turn off, and Frank finds Zoe lying on the floor.&nbsp;
It turns out that Zoe has been electrocuted. Frank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.320
rushes to her side and notices she doesn't have a&nbsp;
pulse. Niko gives him an adrenaline needle, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.800
Frank injects into Zoe's chest, but she doesn't&nbsp;
respond. Clay brings the defibrillators over,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.520
but they don't work either. Zoe is no longer&nbsp;
alive. While everyone is away and mourning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.400
Frank notices that she was electrocuted because&nbsp;
she was wearing her engagement ring on her finger.&nbsp;

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.560
&nbsp;
Frank, unwilling to let her go, places Zoe's body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.200
on the experiment table. Clay, Niko, and Eva argue&nbsp;
that this is unethical upon knowing that Frank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.480
will inject the serum on her. Still, Frank goes&nbsp;
ahead, accepting whatever consequences await him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.080
Frank tells the rest to leave, but the team wishes&nbsp;
to stay with him to see the procedure through.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.600
A little while later, Frank injects the serum into&nbsp;
Zoe while Niko takes charge of the voltage dosage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.080
When Eva switches the voltage, Zoe is still&nbsp;
not responding. Frank orders Niko to adjust&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.040
the voltage a little higher. Still, Zoe isn't&nbsp;
responding. Niko then notices that the security&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.040
guard is no longer in his station and is currently&nbsp;
approaching them. They immediately turn off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.880
lights and stay hidden until he leaves. Then&nbsp;
suddenly, the team sees Zoe sitting up on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.520
table. Frank comes towards her and examines for&nbsp;
anything out of the ordinary. Zoe then grabs his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.920
wrist and inquires if she has passed away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.280
That night, Frank comforts her and tends to&nbsp;
Zoe's wound in her head while the rest of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.680
team watches her, still shocked that she came back&nbsp;
to life. The student asks her what she remembers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.800
when she died. However, Frank tells her that Zoe&nbsp;
needs to rest. When the guard finally goes home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.960
they observe Zoe by scanning her brain under&nbsp;
the C.T. scan. It turns out that it has a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.520
neural activity happening inside her brain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.240
Feeling overwhelmed by scientific explanations,&nbsp;
the student asks Niko what is going on. Niko&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.680
then explains that Zoe's C.T. scan results&nbsp;
show that more than ten percent of her brain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.760
is active when ideally, only ten percent of&nbsp;
the human brain works. He seems worried since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.720
not many studies support what will happen&nbsp;
if ninety percent of the human brain is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.920
activated.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.480
At the same time, Frank continues to comfort Zoe.&nbsp;
He assures her that everything will be alright,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.040
and she must trust him. Frank then shows her the&nbsp;
necklace and inserts the ring on it. While he puts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.200
the jewelry around her neck, Zoe seems to hear his&nbsp;
thoughts saying something's wrong with her. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.280
Frank explains what she might be experiencing,&nbsp;
Zoe continues what he's about to say, making him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.280
uncomfortable and frightened. Frank then heads&nbsp;
out of the room to inform others, while Zoe is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.280
left alone in the room, confused about how she can&nbsp;
hear his thoughts and even controls the pen on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.520
table. When Zoe tries to concentrate, she appears&nbsp;
to listen to what everyone else is thinking.&nbsp;

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.880
&nbsp;
A little while later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.720
Zoe goes to the comfort room and notices that her&nbsp;
fingertips and the spot where Frank injected the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.480
serum have darkened. She accidentally breaks&nbsp;
the mirror, and her reflection seems to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.880
smirking at her, then suddenly Rocky appears&nbsp;
growling beside her. Zoe looks at him violently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.800
as if she's about to do something terrible then,&nbsp;
suddenly, everyone in the hallway can hear Rocky's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.960
plea. She then heads to Frank and expresses&nbsp;
her concern that something is wrong with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.240
Zoe claims that she felt trapped in the burning&nbsp;
apartment building and was unable to escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.120
Frank dismisses it as a bad dream, just like&nbsp;
what she experienced before. He then injects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.840
her with something that would make her sleep&nbsp;
to help her ease her mind and let her rest.&nbsp;

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.880
&nbsp;
While Zoe sleeps, Eva notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.760
Zoe's eyes move as she puts Zoe under a blanket.&nbsp;
The student seems worried, but she leaves when Zoe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.000
doesn't respond to her. As the student heads out&nbsp;
of the room, she finds herself in the same burning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.480
building inside Zoe's nightmare. Eva walks towards&nbsp;
the hallway and notices a young girl standing in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.080
the middle of it, holding something. She sees&nbsp;
some burning hands reaching out as the little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.040
girl flees. The student tries to approach her,&nbsp;
but the lights in the hallway turn off one by one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.280
It is pitch black, then suddenly, a bright light&nbsp;
appears, and a burning hand grabs her wrist.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.080
She wakes up screaming, and the researchers find&nbsp;
her lying on the floor. She walks out of the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.000
where Zoe sleeps, and she then describes what she&nbsp;
saw, including the burning apartment and people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.120
pleading for help. Niko then notices a visible&nbsp;
burn on Eva's wrist and demands Frank for answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.080
He discloses Zoe's traumatic childhood&nbsp;
experience in which she was trapped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.680
in a burning building and saw her neighbors&nbsp;
sticking their fingers out, trying to escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.520
According to Eva, Zoe may have seen something&nbsp;
before she died, and her soul may be trapped.&nbsp;

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.960
&nbsp;
At the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.080
Zoe is left alone in a room. While sleeping, she&nbsp;
speaks prayers as she's having a nightmare again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.240
However, she stops praying and grabs her necklace,&nbsp;
and slowly floats from the couch. She wakes up all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.280
of a sudden with her eyes going hellishly black.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.280
While Clay takes care of Eva's burn, Niko works&nbsp;
on his computer alone in a room when Zoe suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.200
startles him. She begs him to help her figure&nbsp;
out what's wrong with her, and she uses a kiss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.080
to try to manipulate him. He rejects it because&nbsp;
he knows it is not appropriate. Zoe appears upset&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.320
about something from the past. She says she spent&nbsp;
her whole life trying to make up for one mistake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.960
only to end up in hell. While still feeling&nbsp;
scared and confused, Niko tries to comfort Zoe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.600
but her eyes go all black again, and the lights&nbsp;
dim, and she vanishes. A supernatural force drags&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.680
Nikko inside a massive metal cabinet, trying&nbsp;
to escape from it. Zoe then reappears and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.200
telekinetically crushes the container, killing&nbsp;
Niko inside with blood flowing through it.&nbsp;

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.080
&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Frank, Eva, and Clay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.840
return inquiring about Niko's whereabouts while&nbsp;
Zoe maintains her composure and remains silent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.720
Clay tries to call for assistance, but the&nbsp;
power goes out, as well as the emergency lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.320
While Clay and Frank decipher how they will get&nbsp;
out of the laboratory while the power is off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.640
Zoe insults the student for being there, trying&nbsp;
to be part of their team. This incident gives the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.880
student a hint that she has something to do with&nbsp;
Niko's disappearance. When Clay and Frank return,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.400
Zoe is still playing ignorant of what is&nbsp;
happening. Clay yells at Zoe to tell them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.880
where Niko is, but Zoe uses her supernatural&nbsp;
abilities to choke Clay with his e-cigarette.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.360
While struggling, Clay discovers that it is Zoe's&nbsp;
fault as she winks and smiles at him. Frank and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.200
Eva make a last-minute effort to save Clay, but&nbsp;
it's too late. When they dig the e-cig out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.760
his mouth, they realize Zoe is at fault. They turn&nbsp;
around and look at Zoe, and she's staring blankly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:05.920
at them with no remorse. The lights turn off, and&nbsp;
Zoe vanishes once more. When the lights turn on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.360
they see Zoe summoning the equipment into&nbsp;
the air and throwing them into Frank and Eva.&nbsp;

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.040
&nbsp;
A little while later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.040
the two realize something is seriously wrong&nbsp;
and attempt to hinder Zoe with a syringe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.200
Frank advises the student to inject the needle no&nbsp;
matter what happens. He heads out and discovers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.080
Zoe sobbing in the hallway. Frank approaches her,&nbsp;
telling her that she's still the Zoe he adores.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.720
However, she can read his mind and deduces that he&nbsp;
doesn't believe she's the same. Zoe grabs his head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.040
and squeezes it until his neck snaps. Eva flees&nbsp;
when she sees this while Zoe takes the rest of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.120
serum and injects it into herself.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.440
The lights keep going out, leaving Eva and Zoe&nbsp;
in the dark. A classical piece of music plays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.840
as Eva searches for Zoe. When the student turns&nbsp;
off the music and prepares to get the syringe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.640
Zoe appears upside down, causing Eva to stumble&nbsp;
into the ground. Zoe approaches the scared student&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.640
while speaking prayers when suddenly Zoe throws&nbsp;
her into the burning building once more. Eva&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.200
runs into the little girl in the burning hallway,&nbsp;
who she recognizes as Zoe. Little Zoe gives Eva a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.280
book of matches, which reveals that she's the&nbsp;
one who started the fire. Eva assures her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.720
it was not her fault and that she can correct&nbsp;
the situation by letting the neighbors out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.480
The evil Zoe then enters the hallway with&nbsp;
her skin scorched and her eyes blackened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.120
As Evil Zoe approaches, Little Zoe goes to open&nbsp;
the neighbors' door. However, when she opens the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.760
door, they are blinded by a bright white light.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.240
It appears that Eva manages to inject the syringe&nbsp;
into Zoe, who apologizes for her actions before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.200
collapsing. To make sure, the student injects&nbsp;
another one in her neck, causing Zoe to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.720
Meanwhile, Eva falls over upon hearing&nbsp;
a siren's sound, where a firefighter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.880
arrives with a response team. He walks over&nbsp;
to Eva and consoles her as she cries in fear.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.240
However, Eva notices that Zoe's body is missing.&nbsp;
Eva turns to face the fireman but comes face to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.560
face with Zoe, who then breaks her neck.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.040
A little while later, Zoe lines up Clay, Niko,&nbsp;
and Eva's bodies next to each other as she places&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:50.000
Frank's body on the experiment table. She then&nbsp;
injects the serum from her own body into him. With&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.320
a gasp, Frank comes back to life.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.480
This story is based on the Lazarus phenomenon,&nbsp;
also known as the Lazarus syndrome, which is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.760
delayed return of spontaneous circulation after&nbsp;
CPR occurs. In other words, after cardiac arrest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.400
dead patients experience an unexpected return of&nbsp;
cardiac activity. According to the New Testament&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.800
of the Bible, the syndrome is named after Lazarus&nbsp;
of Bethany, who was brought back to life by Jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.960
Christ four days after his death.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.040
In this story, a serum whose initial aim was&nbsp;
to keep coma patients' brains active turns out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.240
to have a rather unexpected side effect&nbsp;
of resurrecting the recently deceased,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.720
demonstrating a Lazarus effect. It has many&nbsp;
thematic potentials, with the experiment serving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.680
as a focal point for various issues concerning&nbsp;
work, love, and faith. As shown in Zoe and Frank's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.600
relationship, is it possible for two people to&nbsp;
have a long-term romantic relationship if one is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.840
religious and the other is not? Can a partnership&nbsp;
built on shared professional success survive if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.680
it's otherwise ill-fated? Is it possible for&nbsp;
humans to know what happens after they die?

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:48.477
The story addresses these issues when Frank&nbsp;
uses the serum on Zoe after she dies in a lab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.477 --> 00:12:48.600
by accident. She resurfaces, but she does not&nbsp;
appear to be the same person she was before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:48.688
Her behavior becomes increasingly strange,&nbsp;
leading the other scientists to believe that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.688 --> 00:12:48.784
something beyond the grave corrupted her soul.&nbsp;
This could be interpreted as a metaphor that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.784 --> 00:12:52.550
no longer cares about someone she has known for&nbsp;
a long time and learn that Frank is terrified&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:55.912
not of his partner's new behavior but of the&nbsp;
suspicion that he never truly understood her.
