00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.670
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.700
Today, I’m going to explain a crime, drama,
and mystery film called, “The Clovehitch

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.700
Killer.”

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.010
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.910
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.519
In a small remote town in Clarksville, Kentucky,
a neighborhood is haunted by a string of murders

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.170
that happened years ago.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.470
The killer called himself the “Clovehitch
Killer,” after his favorite type of knot.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.260
Even though he stopped killing over ten years
ago, the town still lives in fear and holds

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.220
an annual memorial, headed by their community
pastor, Pastor Randy, for the victims’ families

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.750
and friends.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.399
In this town lives 16-year-old Tyler Burnside
with his devoutly Christian family.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.139
His dad, Don, a handyman and troop leader
of the Clarksville Rangers, which Tyler is

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:46.949
also a member of, his mother, Cindy, and his
little sister, Susie.

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.229
He also has Uncle Rudy, his father’s brother
who lives in an elderly care facility and

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:53.319
whom the family is caring for.

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.079
They are loved and known by everyone in town
and are considered to be much-loved members

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.659
of the community.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.659
After a morning meeting with the scouts, Don
tells Tyler that work has been slow and Uncle

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.729
Rudy’s insurance increased so Tyler won’t
be able to join the leadership camp as planned

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.090
to help with his college applications.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.380
Despite feeling disappointed, Tyler knows
they have to put family first.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.790
Later that night, Tyler sneaks into his parents’
bedroom and steals the keys to his dad’s

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.790
truck.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.479
He meets up with Amy, a girl he goes to church
with that he likes, and they start making

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.460
out in an empty parking lot.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.560
As they make out, Amy finds a picture of a
naked woman in bondage near the passenger

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.560
seat.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.469
Tyler denies that the picture is his but Amy
is quickly weirded out by the situation and

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.210
tells him to take her home.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.799
The next morning, the family picks up Uncle
Rudy and they attend church together.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.759
During the praise and worship, Tyler can’t
help but feel like he’s getting weird looks,

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.479
especially from Amy.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.020
After the service, Billy, one of his churchmates
and also a scout member, approaches him and

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.539
talks about the girl lurking in the parking
lot.

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.450
He feels creeped out by her and tells him
that she does the same report on the Clovehitch

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.939
killings every year.

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.090
Tyler accuses him of having a crush on her,
but Billy responds with disgust saying that

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.020
the girl allegedly did it with five football
players because her mom left the family to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.509
become a stripper.

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.780
Their conversation is cut short by Tyler’s
mom who tells him that they have to go.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.280
As they leave, he gets the same weird look
from the girls again.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.380
At home, Tyler receives a text from Billy
and learns that Amy has told the whole school

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.860
about the photo.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.890
Later that day, the family attends the annual
memorial for the Clovehitch victims headed

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.610
by Pastor Randy.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.890
After the service, Tyler confronts Amy about
the photo and tells her that it isn’t his.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.530
Amy tells him that she only told one person
and didn’t intend for the whole school to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.530
know.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.400
As Amy leaves, the girl from the church named
Kassi approaches him.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.260
Tyler confronts her for being a weirdo but
she retorts back about the photo, prompting

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.879
him to leave.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.080
When his parents leave for the day, Tyler
goes to his father’s shed, feeling curious

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.530
about the photos.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.420
He searches through his father’s things
and finds nothing, but at the last minute,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.500
he spots a loose board on the floor.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.400
He opens it up and finds a dusty old box.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.560
Inside the box were countless bondage magazines
and a single polaroid photo of a woman tied

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.950
up and gagged.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.989
On the photo, written in pen, was a caption
that says, “Nora - Lucky’s favorite.”

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.319
The polaroid disturbs Tyler to the core and
he stashes it back into the box.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.290
Don gets back from the community center and
goes to his shed, only to find that the lock

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.780
has been touched.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.560
Later that night, Tyler lays in bed awake,
thinking about the disturbing picture he’s

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.870
found in his father’s possession.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.240
Unable to sleep, he goes to the living room
and looks up the name he found on the polaroid.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.519
It turns out that Nora Devlin was one of the
Clovehitch Killer’s victims.

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.849
A light turns on and his mother interrupts
his research and sends him back to bed.

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.450
The next morning, his mother sends him to
his father to have the “talk,” thinking

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.950
that her son has been up all night searching
for restricted photos.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.890
At the shed, Don tells Tyler that he knows
that he took his truck last night.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.730
He then tells his son that he understands
the conflicting feelings between being a devoted

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.769
Christian and being a teenager undergoing
puberty.

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.860
He reassures him that it’s normal to have
these thoughts as long as you don’t act

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.890
on them.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.480
Tyler leaves the awkward talk, feeling more
confused than before about his father.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.600
Trying to clear up his name, Tyler heads over
to Billy and tells him that the photo isn’t

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600
his.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.890
Billy doesn’t listen to him and tells him
he should start praying for his sins.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.010
Desperate for help, Tyler goes back to the
church and sees Kassi again, and follows her

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.360
into the woods.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.840
He asks her for her help in investigating
the Clovehitch killings.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.610
Kassi is hesitant at first but she eventually
tells him to meet up with her at 3 at her

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.000
given address and to bring cookies.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.350
Tyler rides his bike the next day to the address
Kassi gave her.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.040
He gives the cookies to her grandmother who
answers the door and heads up to Kassi’s

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.040
room.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.690
She gives him a box full of copies of evidence
from a case and a book that talked about the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.690
killings.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.470
It turns out that her grandmother used to
work on the case and wrote a book about it.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.670
She tells him that every serial killer has
a signature style like a fingerprint, including

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.260
the Clovehitch Killer.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.270
The killer had the same entry points, the
same elaborate ropes on the bodies, and a

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.880
clove hitch knot tied to every victim’s
house.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.210
Kassi doesn’t believe that the killer has
stopped and she’s working to catch him on

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.710
his weakness.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.700
In the evening during family time, Tyler lies
to his family and tells them that he’ll

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.520
be spending his afternoons volunteering as
a tutor, but in truth, he’ll be working

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.560
with Kassi on investigating the Clovehitch
killings.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.790
Tyler spends the next afternoon sifting through
evidence with Kassi in her room.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.030
Unbeknownst to him, Don has followed his son
and is watching his every move.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.250
When Tyler gets back home, Don tells him that
he knows he hasn’t been tutoring but sneaking

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.060
out to meet his girlfriend.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.210
He then tells him that he shouldn’t lie
to his mother and instead invite the girl

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.760
tomorrow for dinner.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.380
The next day, Tyler invites Kassi over for
dinner and asks her to pretend to be his girlfriend

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.610
and not mention any of the investigations
they’re doing.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.830
Later that night, Kassi joins the Burnsides
for dinner.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.020
After an awkward start, Kassi hits it off
immediately with Tyler’s parents.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.090
On the way home, Kassi jokingly asks Tyler
if he thinks his dad is the Clovenhitch Killer.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.070
He looks horrified at the question and tells
her about the magazines, the shed, and the

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.070
polaroid.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.370
She reassures him that it’s normal for adults
to have kinks and there’s no way that his

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.180
dad could be the killer.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.960
When Tyler gets home, he joins his family
in washing the dishes.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.020
He feels a deep pit in his stomach as he looks
at his seemingly normal family.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.280
Despite Kassi’s reassurances, he remains
disturbed at what he has just unearthed.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.230
At midnight, he hears knocking coming from
his window.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.230
It’s Kassi.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.240
She’s come to tell him that the fifth victim
received a note a week before she was murdered.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.190
He takes her to the shed and opens the loose
floorboard, but the box is already gone.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.500
She reaches her hand inside and takes out
a piece of paper.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.330
The two teenagers look shocked as they unfold
a blueprint for what looked like a dungeon

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.570
of horrors.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.490
Kassi takes a picture and leaves while Tyler
goes to one of their vents.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.100
His brain is trying to convince him that this
is all a big misunderstanding but his gut

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.860
is telling him otherwise.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.060
He goes into the crawlspace and finds a false
wooden cover.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.320
He pushes the cover away and squeezes himself
into a small makeshift den.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.970
As he turns on the light, he sees a small
room with an incomplete toilet and shower.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.590
On the side is a box full of bondage magazines,
grotesque sketches, and a small tin container.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.500
Tyler opens the container slowly and takes
out a bunch of driver’s licenses tied together.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.690
With trembling hands, he sifts through the
licenses and sees Nora Devlin.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.510
The worst has been confirmed.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.320
His father, Don, is the Clovehitch Killer.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.330
When morning comes, Tyler lays awake on his
bed.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.480
His father comes in and insists that they
go camping today.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.980
Tyler is reluctant to go, confused about his
feelings for his father, but he eventually

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:28.980
agrees.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.570
In the woods, they bring their rifles, hoping
to practice for Tyler’s rifle merit badge.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:38.300
As they take a break, Don cleans out his rifle
and asks Tyler if he has told anyone.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.110
Tyler tries to deny it at first but he confronts
him and lets him know that he’s aware that

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.010
Tyler has been to his shed and his crawl space.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.780
He calls him out for his son’s lack of privacy
and tells him that what he found in the box

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:49.830
wasn’t his.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.220
Don tells his son that the box belonged to
his Uncle Rudy.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.170
When they were younger, both of them, Don
and Rudy, had an interest in these kinds of

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.170
photos.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.720
When they got older, Don stopped but Rudy
got worse to the point where they had to ask

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.150
him to turn himself in.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:07.150
That’s when his Uncle Rudy tried to kill
himself by crashing his car.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:11.490
Tyler is shocked to learn this as he was initially
told that his uncle got into a car crash resulting

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.910
in his condition.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.240
He asks his father why he has kept the photos
all this time.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.910
Don defends himself and tells him that he
had intended to burn it or turn it into the

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.770
police, but there was never a right time.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:27.330
Eventually, he just stopped trying in order
to save his family from hurt and scandal.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.730
Don then apologizes to his son.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.390
Tyler tells his father that he either has
to turn in the evidence or destroy it once

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:34.729
and for all.

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:39.360
When they get home, Don brings out all the
magazines, photos, and even the licenses,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.880
and burns them all.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.009
Tyler watches, thinking to himself if this
is really the right thing to do.

00:08:45.009 --> 00:08:49.460
The next day, Tyler attends a class tying
knots with his father who continues to pretend

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.259
as if nothing has happened.

00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:54.959
Tyler goes out of class to talk to Kassi who’s
angry at him for ditching him.

00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:58.660
She’s finally figured out that the blueprint
was for the Burnsides’ house and she’s

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.829
actually gone into their crawl space.

00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:04.360
He insists that it’s not him and that his
father has explained everything.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.550
Kassi doesn’t believe him and takes out
the files from the case.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.149
Tyler makes her drop the files and then helps
her pick up the papers.

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:15.070
Billy goes out into the hallway and calls
out Kassi for being deranged.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:18.660
Billy curses him and Tyler immediately lunges
at him on her defense.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.350
A fight erupts and Tyler is sent to Pastor
Randy who reprimands him for his behavior.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.740
When Tyler gets home, he receives an apology
note from Kassi on his window.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.439
The next day, Tyler boards the bus for his
leadership program.

00:09:31.439 --> 00:09:34.279
His father managed to find a way to fund his
retreat.

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:38.300
Tyler bids his family goodbye and climbs up
the bus with an uneasy heart.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.649
Meanwhile, with his son away, Don suggests
to his wife that she and Susie should go visit

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:44.080
her grandmother.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.879
Cindy agrees to take a week or two off and
sets up the plan with her husband.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:51.580
Later that night, the couple makes love but
their moment is cut short when Don starts

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.839
feeling unwell.

00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:56.300
He reassures his wife that it’s nothing
serious and he’s just getting old and they

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.300
share an intimate embrace.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.550
When morning comes, Don bids Cindy and Susie
goodbye.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.930
He is finally alone.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.430
Now, he can go and set out what he really
intended to do.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:10.540
He goes about his work, hangs out with the
locals, and goes shopping.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.899
At the grocery, he meets a nice woman at the
frozen section.

00:10:13.899 --> 00:10:17.800
He keeps an eye on her at the counter and
stalks her all the way to her home.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.720
When he gets home, he goes up to the attic
to take out his old equipment, even his old

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.649
polaroid camera.

00:10:23.649 --> 00:10:27.470
He sets up the camera in the living room and
dresses as a woman in bondage with a mask

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.980
and wig on his head.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.330
He listens to music as he takes several pictures
of himself.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.720
He goes back into the bedroom and looks at
the dresses laid on the bed.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.170
Suddenly, the doorbell rings.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.930
Don changes his clothes and meets Kassi in
the hallway.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:45.249
She’s looking for Tyler and he tells her
that he’s away on his leadership retreat.

00:10:45.249 --> 00:10:48.680
He then takes the camera and asks her if she
wants a picture.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.170
After he takes her picture, Kassi’s phone
rings.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.139
It’s her father.

00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:55.899
She excuses herself and bids him goodbye.

00:10:55.899 --> 00:11:00.370
When Kassi leaves, Don inspects the photos
he’s taken and slams them on the bed.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.610
He throws a tantrum on the bed and screams
in frustration.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:07.610
He was supposed to savor these killings and
enjoy them, but now he couldn’t.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.610
Everything is spiraling out of control and
he hates being out of control.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.589
Something must be done with his son, but now
is not the time to think about it.

00:11:15.589 --> 00:11:19.459
When he comes back from his program, he will
deal with him then, but this time is for him

00:11:19.459 --> 00:11:20.459
only.

00:11:20.459 --> 00:11:23.629
He regains his composure and drives to the
woman’s house.

00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:27.790
In her backyard, he inspects the vent going
into her basement and ties a clove hitch knot

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.579
onto one of her pipes.

00:11:29.579 --> 00:11:34.310
Later on, Don attends church service with
his brother and meets up with the scouts.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.279
When he gets home, he lays out all the equipment
he needs for his killing and calls his wife

00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:39.380
to check up on her.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.329
The woman lays on her living room couch, unaware
of the horror that’s about to happen to

00:11:43.329 --> 00:11:44.329
her.

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:47.670
Don breaks in through the open basement window
and quietly makes his way up to the living

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:48.670
room.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.640
He hovers over the sleeping woman, savoring
the moments before he makes his kill, and

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.470
then turns off the television.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:58.519
The woman wakes up and he immediately points
a gun at her neck and threatens to shoot her

00:11:58.519 --> 00:11:59.740
if she screams.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.540
He tells the woman that he just robbed a bank
and he needs the keys to her car.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.850
He grabs her purse and takes out her keys
and driver’s license.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:11.230
The woman is trembling in terror as she examines
the man who’s about to end her life.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.170
Don takes a picture of her and adds it to
his collection.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.000
He threatens her by saying that if she tells
the cops, he has her picture and he’ll send

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.610
out his friends for him.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:23.949
He orders her to grab his bag and follow him
to her bedroom so that he can tie her up.

00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:27.999
She hesitates but he pushes her against the
wall and sticks the gun to her head.

00:12:27.999 --> 00:12:30.759
She grabs the bag and walks to her bedroom
crying.

00:12:30.759 --> 00:12:34.250
He orders her to tie herself as he places
the gun on the drawers.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:38.209
He ties the woman himself and she cries in
pain at how tight the ropes are.

00:12:38.209 --> 00:12:42.439
He talks to her in his persona, Lucky, and
strangles her with pantyhose, pinning her

00:12:42.439 --> 00:12:44.339
down to the bed.

00:12:44.339 --> 00:12:48.129
After a while, Don drags a chair into the
room and looks at the woman hog-tied on the

00:12:48.129 --> 00:12:49.230
floor.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:53.470
He takes out her underwear and uses it to
tie a plastic bag around her head.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:57.569
He then takes out his camera, sits on his
chair, and takes a picture.

00:12:57.569 --> 00:13:02.529
Out in the hallway, his son, Tyler, comes
in with a rifle aimed at him.

00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:06.309
It turns out Tyler never went to the leadership
program after all.

00:13:06.309 --> 00:13:11.180
After he receives the apology note from Kassi,
he meets up with her at Nora Devlin’s house.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.639
He tells her that he wants to hang out with
her but this Clovehitch stuff has got to stop.

00:13:15.639 --> 00:13:18.660
She invites him to come inside the house and
then kisses him.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.389
He follows her into the abandoned home and
they stay put in the living room.

00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:27.180
Tyler tries to kiss her again but Kassi is
insistent on continuing the investigation.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.449
She tells him that the killer entered through
the basement and killed Nora right there on

00:13:30.449 --> 00:13:31.579
the floor.

00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:35.970
Tyler walks out, unable to take any more of
this, but Kassi tells him that she just wants

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.499
to know what happened.

00:13:37.499 --> 00:13:41.499
He finally gives in and tells her what his
father had told him, that Uncle Rudy is the

00:13:41.499 --> 00:13:44.899
Clovehitch Killer, but he tried to kill himself
and then he stopped.

00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:49.350
Kassi then tells him that she actually found
something when she went into their crawlspace.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.089
She found rope fibers identical to the ones
pointed out in the evidence.

00:13:53.089 --> 00:13:57.079
Tyler accuses her of being obsessive but she
finally reveals that the reason why she’s

00:13:57.079 --> 00:14:01.290
so bent on solving this, is because she believes
that her mother was one of the Clovehitch

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:02.579
Killer’s unknown victims.

00:14:02.579 --> 00:14:06.240
Her father told her that her mother abandoned
them, but she remembers being in the room

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.129
when the killer murdered her mother.

00:14:08.129 --> 00:14:12.100
It was years later when she realized that
her mother’s death was similar to the Clovehitch

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.499
Killer’s victims, but no one would listen
to her or believe her.

00:14:15.499 --> 00:14:19.220
Tyler asks her what her name was and Kassi
says that it’s Crystal.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:24.100
He then tells her that he saw a license belonging
to a Crystal Harper in his father’s possession.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.610
There were 13 licenses that he found and there
are only 10 known victims of the killer, so

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:32.279
Kassi’s mother was definitely one of them,
confirming Kassi’s fears.

00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:36.290
He tells her that they already burned the
evidence to save the family, but Kassi confronts

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:40.300
him one more time, challenging him that if
he has any doubt in his heart at all about

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.100
his father, then he should help her solve
this case once and for all.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.459
This convinces Tyler and together, they form
a plan.

00:14:47.459 --> 00:14:51.249
When he leaves for his leadership program,
he actually gets off the bus and heads over

00:14:51.249 --> 00:14:52.569
to Kassi’s house.

00:14:52.569 --> 00:14:55.269
They begin piecing the pieces of the case
together.

00:14:55.269 --> 00:15:00.170
Don is a handyman so this must explain why
the killer can easily break into the homes.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.230
They follow Don on his jobs and even stalks
him all the way to the supermarket.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:08.160
He sees him following the woman and even notices
his lingering stare.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.240
They ride their bikes home and Tyler sneaks
into the house.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.819
While Don is distracted, he goes to his parent’s
bedroom and installs a G.P.S. tracker on his

00:15:15.819 --> 00:15:16.819
phone.

00:15:16.819 --> 00:15:21.040
Suddenly, his dad comes into the room and
Tyler hides behind the bed.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.630
He watches in shock as he sees his father
wearing women’s clothing.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:28.670
He sends a message to Kassi to help him and
she immediately comes to his rescue by ringing

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.970
the doorbell.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.529
He then bails Kassi out by calling her and
pretending to be her father.

00:15:33.529 --> 00:15:37.550
Back at her place, they keep their eye on
the tracker and his dad’s whereabouts.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.459
Kassi grows tired of waiting and they track
Don back to the woman’s house.

00:15:41.459 --> 00:15:45.810
Tyler insists that his dad is probably just
working on a job, but she insists on going

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:46.810
further.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:50.189
He continues to watch as his father appears
and drives away.

00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:54.709
When he joins Kassi in the backyard, she tells
him about her horrifying discovery.

00:15:54.709 --> 00:15:58.019
Kassi had seen Don tie a clove hitch knot
into the pipe.

00:15:58.019 --> 00:16:01.029
Don is truly the killer and there is no doubt
now.

00:16:01.029 --> 00:16:05.540
They peek into the window and confirm that
the woman from the supermarket lived here.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.829
Later that night and the next day, Don’s
tracker didn’t move.

00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:12.639
The two teenagers return to Tyler’s house
and find that Don had left his phone on the

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:13.639
bed.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:17.110
Tyler takes out his father’s rifle and they
ride back to the woman’s house where they

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.120
find Don’s car on the street.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.809
They break through the same basement window
and quietly explore the house.

00:16:22.809 --> 00:16:27.279
With his rifle out, Tyler and Kassi sneak
behind a counter wall as Don walks in and

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:29.079
takes one of the dining chairs.

00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:33.810
Tyler walks to the bedroom, weapon in tow,
and finally catches his dad in the act.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:37.550
Don reprimands him and tells him that he shouldn’t
be pointing a weapon unless he intends to

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:38.649
use it.

00:16:38.649 --> 00:16:43.100
As Tyler demands his father turn himself in,
he orders Kassi to free the woman.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.999
Don then tries to turn the situation around
and tells him that Kassi is manipulating him.

00:16:47.999 --> 00:16:49.800
He would never hurt anyone.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.089
He tells him that he and the woman are having
an affair and that they were just being kinky.

00:16:54.089 --> 00:16:58.050
Kassi calls Don a liar and runs for the gun
but he grabs her and slams her across the

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.050
wall.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:03.339
He then tells his son that he’s just concerned
that Kassi is unfit to handle a gun.

00:17:03.339 --> 00:17:07.390
He takes out the bullets from the revolver
and coaxes Tyler to hand him the gun.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.870
Tyler, feeling completely conflicted between
his father and this killer, reluctantly hands

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:13.200
the gun to Don.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.420
Don then points the rifle at Tyler and pulls
the trigger, but the gun is empty.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.130
Tyler is horrified at the realization that
his own father had just tried to shoot him

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:22.810
without second thoughts.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:27.550
He lunges at him, trying to pin him on the
bed, but Don soon gains the upper hand.

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:30.980
He pins his son on the floor and strangles
him with one hand.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.080
Tyler struggles as he kicks and scratches
at his shoulders.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.070
Suddenly, Kassi comes from behind and hits
Don’s head with a lamp.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.590
Don collapses on the floor and she gives him
another hit to the head.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:45.880
As she tries to call the police, Tyler stops
her and shakes his head.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.440
Weeks later, Don Burnside is still missing.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.960
Cindy, Tyler’s mother, is on the verge of
a mental breakdown but has managed to keep

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.880
it together for her children, unaware of what
her husband was doing and what her eldest

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.140
had done.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.770
When they go to the community center, Pastor
Randy is waiting for them and tells Cindy

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.130
the grave news.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.910
They have found Don’s body.

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.850
Later that day, Tyler meets up with Kassi
again.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.180
They agree to do nothing for they know the
police will never be able to connect it with

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.500
the Clovehitch Killer because the woman never
saw his face.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.200
She reminds him that this is what he wanted
to happen.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.230
When Tyler gets home, his mother slips into
his bedroom and talks to him.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:25.580
She tells him that the police had found Don’s
body and wanted to talk to him, but she told

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.650
them no.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:30.790
She then tells Tyler that the police didn’t
think it was an accident, but rather a suicide

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:31.790
attempt.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.010
His mother breaks down and he comforts her.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:38.310
After his father’s funeral, Tyler is awarded
as a troop leader and reads a speech in honor

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.680
of his father.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.010
He looks out to the crowd, spouting lies for
only he and Kassi truly knew what a horrible

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:47.320
person Don was and what truly happened to
him that night.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.930
He knows how he and Kassi dragged Don into
the woods, set up the place as if he was camping,

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.110
and laid out his gun as if he was cleaning
it.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:58.090
The police and the people might believe that
Don Burnside accidentally killed himself while

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:02.360
cleaning his gun, but Tyler knows that it
was his own finger that pulled the trigger.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:15.370
And this is a secret that he will take with
him to his grave and do what his father had

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.640
failed to do, protect this family.
