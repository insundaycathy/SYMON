Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.839
Today, I'm going to show you a 2016 American
psychological horror-thriller film titled

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:07.839
Split.

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:08.839
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:11.019
Watch out and take care!

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.780
An aloof girl named Casey sits blankly in
a restaurant for her classmate's birthday.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.580
After the party, the birthday girl, Claire,
tells her father that it was tormenting that

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.000
she had to invite her out of mercy.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.949
Casey boringly calls her guardians on her
phone to pick her up from the restaurant.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.660
Casey doesn't belong to any circle because
she was detached and troublesome.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.980
She had no one else to go home with.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.700
Claire's father ignores his daughter's sentiment
and waits if Casey can ride home along with

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.090
her guardians.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.040
Unfortunately, her guardian's car broke down.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.590
She has decided to take the bus, but Claire's
kind father insists on driving her home instead.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.520
Claire and Casey board the car along with
Marcia, Claire's best friend.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.060
Casey sits next to the driver's seat while
the two girls chitchat their way to the backseat.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.910
Claire's father stops for the car's compartment
and unloads packs of food and gifts when an

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.900
unknown person approaches him.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.640
The compartment is closed with a loud thud,
and a different man climbs into the driver's

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.640
seat.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.229
The confused and suspecting Casey stares nervously
at the man.

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.909
It wasn't Claire's dad.

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.229
Claire stalls the man by telling him that
he got in the wrong car.

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.960
Casey freezes when the man wears a face mask
and sprays a substance to Claire and Marcia.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.829
The two girls have been knocked out of consciousness.

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.799
Casey tries to obliviously break free, but
the man knocks her out swiftly before she

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.170
could.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.640
Casey redeems her consciousness in a room
with a few rays of light.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.030
Claire is cowardly embracing Marcia.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.659
Before they could even engage in a sensible
conversation, the sole door in the room opens.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.689
A man with an eyeglass and a sleek look enters
and takes Marcia with him.

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.689
It was Kevin in the Dennis persona.

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.659
After a brief while, he brings back the crying
Marcia and angrily grunts while closing the

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:45.659
door.

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.390
Marcia briefs Claire and Casey that Dennis
wanted her to dance for him, but she peed

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.719
on herself.

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.979
As Claire reassures the two others that they're
all going to be okay, a traumatized Casey

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.609
shakes as she storms off to a distant childhood
memory.

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:03.549
A bulky man named Uncle John was telling a
hunting tale to a little Casey in a restaurant.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.030
She was with her father that day, and she
thought nothing could go wrong.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.590
Meanwhile, in a psychotherapy clinic, the
news of the three teenager's abduction breaks

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.590
out.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.420
An old psychotherapist named Karen draws to
her computer and sees that a patient named

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.670
Barry books an appointment to see her.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.470
In isolation, Claire is urging Marcia and
Casey to fight back if their kidnapper attempts

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.490
to lay hold on one of them again.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.810
Casey is thinking rationally and carefully
and denies Claire's solution to the predicament.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.670
Claire thinks they are running out of time,
so the three must make a painful move towards

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.670
Dennis.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.700
Apparently, Claire assumes that Casey was
troublesome and resistant again, given their

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.090
situation.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.100
Because they still don't know what the circumstances
are, Casey reassures them that she will help

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.190
them out after a thorough conception of the
solution.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.080
The little Casey was in a tent in the middle
of the woods.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.910
Her father was with her, holding a gun and
teaching her how to hunt her victim.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.850
In Dr Karen's clinic, a man wearing a bonnet
and a loose coat appears with a respectful

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.850
knock.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:00.850
It was the abductor.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.290
Barry tells her that he had a fashion inspiration.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.660
Doctor Karen flips through the colourful pages
of his illustrations.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.590
She tries to vibe, asking him leading questions
to uncover the character behind his lines.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.180
She tells a lie about his workplace, but he
stalls her by faking a worrying sentiment.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.090
The loose and spontaneous Barry starts acknowledging
some sign of a personality shift when he moved

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.130
Karen's stuff into the proper spaces and left
his sketches carelessly.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.940
He steers clear from Dr Karen's clinic.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.730
The girls are still prying on the door's small
space and capture that a lady was staying

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.160
with their abductor.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.320
The lady was talking to Dennis, which the
girls think was their abductor's name.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.090
The lady draws closer to the door and opens
it.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.240
It was their abductor wearing a tight red
turtleneck, a long skirt and heels, in Patricia's

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.240
persona.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.980
The flabbergasted teenagers step back slowly,
all of them confused as to why he was in a

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.480
lady’s disguise.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.230
The lady reassures them that there was nothing
to worry about because Dennis listens very

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.510
well to her.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.280
She claims that Dennis is neither going to
malign nor assault them and shuts the door

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.280
close.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.040
Dr Karen meets with a colleague doctor in
town and discusses the pieces of evidence

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.430
of Dissociative Identity Disorder.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.540
The colleague doctor believes Karen's patients
are not cut out of the normal, but Karen perceives

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.140
them differently.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.030
In their windowless room, Marcia and Claire
figure out that Dennis is having an entire

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.729
conversation with a make-believe character.

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.269
While discussing, a man enters their bathroom
with a pail.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.269
It was Kevin back to his Dennis identity.

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:25.830
He rants how dirty the bathroom was and asks
them to draw close and clean it.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.350
He reassures the girls that he will no longer
touch any of them as he agreed with Patricia.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.199
However, he mentions that they will be a sacred
feast and leaves them wondering who is going

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.250
to consume the three of them.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.289
Later that night, Claire and Marcia disturb
Casey from slumber and points towards the

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:41.289
door.

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.639
There appears the abductor in a yellow windbreaker,
sitting happily in the open door.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.580
It was Hedwig, Dennis’ 9-year-old playful
and childish identity.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.610
He repetitively warns them that someone is
on the move.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.710
By this time, they already knew that their
abductor wasn’t faking out his characters.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.520
The girls notice how submissive and gullible
he is, and asks him questions to find leads.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.030
Casey befriends him and asks him to come close
so she could whisper through his ear clearly.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.240
Casey tries to reverse-engineer the situation
with Hedwig, but the playful identity believes

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.000
she was lying outright.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.949
He innocently reveals that Dennis had been
stalking Marcia and Claire for days, and he

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.499
planned the abduction for a long time.

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:22.259
Casey fibs that Patricia and Dennis were lying
to him and were planning to send Hedwig instead

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.930
for the sacred feast.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.930
She calculatingly convinces him that the girls
in the room are Hedwig's babysitters who are

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.389
willing to protect him from Patricia and Dennis,
but he needs to teach them the way out immediately

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.110
so they could save him too.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.029
The cynical Hedwig shifts his pace back to
the door and closes it.

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:42.310
As Casey peeks through the cracks, she gets
a view of Hedwig fumbling to unlock the second

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.310
door.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.569
The girls start knocking the drywall across
the entire room.

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.889
Claire finds a weak spot in the ceiling and
tears the ceiling apart with her heels.

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.240
Hedwig returns to the room and demands the
girls to let him in.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.900
Claire uninstalls a portion of the steel grid
on the ceiling while the two budges the door

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.070
against the angry Hedwig.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.460
Hedwig changes into Dennis and opens the door
with all his might.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.380
Claire climbs up and navigates the way across
the ceiling, where a shouting Dennis screams

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.840
and chases for her.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.690
She hides in a locker carefully, but Dennis
finds her and demands her to step out of the

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.690
vault.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.550
He asks her to undo her sweaters and takes
her to a separate room which he carefully

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.550
locked.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.449
He returns to Marcia and Casey's room and
repairs the ceiling, warning them that Claire

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.270
will be locked away from them.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.460
He also demands them to undress their skirts
and sweaters.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.870
Meanwhile, Dr Karen is doing a video conference
with his fellow psychotherapists from Paris.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.979
She discusses the clinical evidence among
her patients with Dissociative Identity Disorder

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:42.030
and the realm of possibilities of unlocking
all the identities that the brain can possess.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.110
After the conference, Barry pays her a visit,
but she quickly discerns that he was in a

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.669
different persona.

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:52.469
Dr Karen tricks him that she wanted to talk
to his other personalities, but Barry rebuffs.

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:55.639
She guesses that it was Dennis taking over
Barry's clothing.

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:59.650
Barry reiterates that neither Dennis nor Patricia
is taking over him because they are unstable

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.660
and not allowed to exhibit themselves in public.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.759
Barry is getting frustrated while Karen is
challenging him.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:10.330
After the session, Dr Karen checks over the
CCTV and conceives that Dennis or Patricia

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.909
was really doing an act while taking over
Barry's identity.

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:18.229
Marcia figures out that they need to find
an escape route while they are still alive.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:22.229
While she is talking, Casey dozes off in a
trance of the little Casey on a hunting trip

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:24.389
with her father and Uncle John.

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:26.919
His father just killed a deer in the forest.

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:28.949
Patricia feeds Marcia and grooms Casey and
Marcia.

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:32.360
She invites them out for a proper meal in
the kitchen because they were good girls,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.120
unlike the isolated Claire.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.249
While Patricia prepares the meal, Marcia makes
a daring move to slam Patricia with a stool.

00:07:39.249 --> 00:07:42.930
Dennis takes over and demands Casey to lock
herself in the room and finds the trembling

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.020
Marcia.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.840
He locks her to a separate room as a punishment.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.160
Dennis warns Casey that the Beast is coming
to feast on them.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.639
On another hunting trip, the little Casey
was staring into the woods while her father

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.199
was taking a nap.

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:58.530
Her uncle John holds a gun in front of the
innocent child.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.669
Casey wakes up with Hedwig embracing her from
behind.

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:06.220
Hedwig reveals that Barry and Patricia decide
who stay in the light, but Hedwig is different.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.550
He also says that only Patricia and Dennis
believe in the existence of the Beast.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.930
Unsure of who the Beast is and what it truly
was, Casey asks him if he has ever seen the

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:15.930
Beast.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.999
Hedwig diverts her attention by asking permission
to kiss her.

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.900
She awkwardly permits him.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.430
After agreeing that he was a good kisser,
she asks him if Hedwig could sneak her up

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.330
to his room where they could dance and listen
to music.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.059
But Hedwig leaves for Barry's appointment
with Dr Karen.

00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:35.459
During the session, Dr Karen talks to Dennis
instead of Barry, insinuating that his beliefs

00:08:35.459 --> 00:08:39.520
are absurd, just like what Barry reported
in the previous sessions.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.990
She compliments Dennis to make him trust her.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.940
She discloses that if Dennis does not open
up, all the other identities will eventually

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.310
take over the light all at once.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.240
Dennis opens up that he and Patricia were
ridiculed by all the twenty-two different

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.240
identities.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.100
The reason why he was changing acts deliberately
is to protect the weak Kevin.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.880
She challenges him to tell the Beast's story,
which she believes to be just Dennis' and

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.699
Patricia's fantasy.

00:09:02.699 --> 00:09:07.389
After the session, Hedwig takes Casey to his
room, where she hesitantly enters.

00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:11.310
Hedwig insanely dances to the loud, booming
noise from the stereo.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.149
After dancing, he points towards his sketched
window and accuses Casey of leaving through

00:09:15.149 --> 00:09:16.190
it.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.960
Hedwig hands Casey a walkie-talkie from Dennis.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.639
Casey dials in and reports the situation to
the man answering the recipient walkie talkie,

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:26.130
but Hedwig takes back the walkie talkie.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.380
He escorts Casey to her room.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.640
Dennis appears in his usual formal wear and
eyeglasses.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.780
He explains that the Beast is going to be
pleased once the night is over.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.620
Uncle John was hiding behind a big rock and
calls the little Casey, who was walking in

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.529
the forest without his father.

00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:45.380
He was on his birth suit and asks Casey to
undress, teaching her that they were playing

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.500
animal roles who had no clothes on.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:52.180
When he was done, Casey waited just above
his hideout, holding a rifle.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:56.339
Casey loaded it and aimed it at Uncle John,
who quickly pulled it from her for safety.

00:09:56.339 --> 00:10:00.500
In the middle of the evening, Dr Karen visits
Dennis in his house.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.940
Dennis takes her to Barry's room and starts
spilling out the familiar tale of Kevin's

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.079
traumatizing childhood.

00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:10.540
Dennis came to Kevin's salvage to please his
mother with organization and accuracy.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.970
Dr Karen dispels his fears by convincing him
that Kevin can be rescued in other ways without

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.449
the 23 different personalities.

00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:20.600
Dennis puts her off by depicting the Beast's
resemblance.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.630
Dr Karen mentions the beast feasting on the
impure young women, but Dennis is hesitant

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.940
to elaborate.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.670
Unprepared and scared, Dr Karen halts the
conversation for a proper session.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.230
She leaves for the bathroom and surveys the
rooms across the hallway.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:39.089
She finds Claire in one of his rooms, but
he wings her off using a toxic spray.

00:10:39.089 --> 00:10:42.839
Casey strives to unlock the door from the
insides while the two others buy time to get

00:10:42.839 --> 00:10:44.740
themselves freed.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.370
Dennis goes to a mall for a bouquet of flowers.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.519
While he is on his way home, Casey gets into
a room with a computer, where she discovers

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:54.810
all the videos of the 23 distinct identities.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:59.730
Dennis rides into an abandoned train car,
where he transformed into the 24th identity.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:04.899
He grows taller and bulkier, and he also moves
wilder than any of the 23 personalities.

00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:07.390
He sprints home as the dreaded Beast.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:10.560
Karen wakes up and writes down notes at one
of his tables.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.500
She takes a bread knife with blurred vision
and stabs him from behind, but the blade splits

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.120
into pieces.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.130
The Beast squashes the crying doctor to death.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:23.250
After watching the videos, Casey figures out
the location of the keys and hovers silently

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.069
around the hallways to search for Marcia and
Claire.

00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:29.500
Marcia has already been wrenched with blood
in one of the rooms.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:34.080
Claire was alive in one of the rooms, but
the Beast drags her and consumes her organs.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.079
Casey finds a note from Karen but gets stalled
in horror when the Beast starts crawling the

00:11:38.079 --> 00:11:43.250
wall.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:47.750
She begins muttering his name repetitively,
getting louder each time she sees him weaken.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:52.400
Kevin, the original identity, takes over the
body as he remembers how his abusive mother

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.190
call him out with a whip.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.399
Kevin has no awareness of what the other identities
did.

00:11:57.399 --> 00:12:01.610
Kevin begs Casey to shot him with a gun in
a cabinet but stops her briefly.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:06.250
Casey witnesses how the kind Kevin shifts
to all the significant identities at once.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.459
While Hedwig is on the light, Casey searches
for the gun.

00:12:09.459 --> 00:12:13.630
Casey realizes he's going to transform into
the Beast soon, so she runs across the rooms

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.509
and probes for bullets.

00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:19.361
The Beast has already changed, and before
Casey could load all the shell, the Beast

00:12:19.361 --> 00:12:21.940
grabs her and rips her sweater apart.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.709
She redeems the gun from the floor and stands
back up to lock the cage.

00:12:25.709 --> 00:12:30.090
With wounded calves, she drags herself to
the farther corner of the cell.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.670
Little Casey was sitting quietly when Uncle
John appeared from behind.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.310
It was her father’s funeral.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.459
Uncle John promised her that he will take
good care of her.

00:12:38.459 --> 00:12:41.579
She aims at the Beast, who is moving swiftly
in the dark alley.

00:12:41.579 --> 00:12:45.230
Just like how she was taught to hunt, she
fires at the Beast.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:50.170
With only two bullets in her gun, Casey soon
realizes that the Beast is invincible.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:54.830
The Beast warps the bars with his bare hands,
but he gets a view of the scars on her body.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:58.589
With Casey's purity, the Beast steps back
to leave her alone.

00:12:58.589 --> 00:13:03.139
Later on, a man comes to the basement and
notices Casey's figure in the cage.

00:13:03.139 --> 00:13:06.019
He assists her away from the zoo's main enclosure.

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:09.839
While a medical officer attends to Casey,
the policemen probe Kevin's possession in

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:11.389
the basement.

00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:15.029
Kevin gets into an abandoned room, with all
the significant identities taking over the

00:13:15.029 --> 00:13:16.370
light at once.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.730
They are assessing Kevin's body with the evidence
of the Beast's invincibility.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.699
A news anchor breaks out the awful news of
the three cases of murder of Kevin Crumb in

00:13:24.699 --> 00:13:26.139
the zoo's basement.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:29.899
The world of sceptical people has now been
made aware that the Dissociative Identity

00:13:29.899 --> 00:13:40.410
Disorder really exists.
