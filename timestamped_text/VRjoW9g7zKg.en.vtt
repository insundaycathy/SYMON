00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.699
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:07.089
Today, I’m going to explain a comedy, drama,
and sci-fi film called, “The Bicentennial

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:08.140
Man.”

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.210
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.000
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:21.280
In 2005, the Martin family, husband, Richard,
his wife, and their two daughters, Grace and

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.540
Amanda, acquire a robot butler from the N.D.R.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.710
Robotics company.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:52.540
Richard activates the robot and it introduces
to them the three laws of robotics.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.780
Amanda accidentally names the robot, Andrew.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.670
Richard lets Andrew take the basement as his
room and sets his duties to housekeeping and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.760
maintenance.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.250
When Andrew asks if he would like to turn
on his personality chip, Richard refuses.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.440
The next day, Andrew cleans the basement and
fixes an old phonograph.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.120
Grace doesn’t take well to the robot and
even orders it to jump out of the window while

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.520
Amanda is more sympathetic to him.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.320
Richard reprimands his daughters and teaches
them that even though Andrew is a robot and

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.250
their property, they must take care of him
and treat him like an actual person.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.030
The family goes to the beach the next day
and Amanda plays with her glass horse figurines.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.150
When she hands her favorite toy to Andrew,
he accidentally drops and breaks it.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.430
She becomes upset and Andrew, despite being
a robot, feels compelled to make it up to

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.430
her.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.670
He gathers some driftwood and learns to carve
by reading some books.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.100
He carves up a wooden toy horse and leaves
it on Amanda’s bed.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.400
In return, Amanda gives Andrew one of her
stuffed toys named Woofy.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.590
When morning comes, Richard is intrigued by
Andrew’s newfound creativity and ability

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.400
to make something original.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.090
He soon finds the robot in the basement listening
to an opera from the phonograph that he has

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.560
fixed himself.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.650
Richard takes Andrew to the N.D.R.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.500
Robotics headquarters and meets Dennis Mansky,
the C.E.O.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.690
He tells Mansky that Andrew has exhibited
characteristics such as creativity, curiosity,

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.990
and friendship.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.830
Mansky tells him that this is an anomaly and
assumes that Richard wants money in exchange

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.310
for keeping his mouth shut or else they will
be forced to recall the entire line.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.900
Mansky tells him that they can give Andrew
back to the company so that they could replace

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.920
him, but Richard refuses to hand in Andrew.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.090
Despite Mansky’s efforts to negotiate, Richard
and Andrew leave, stating that there is no

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.170
price for individuality.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.000
Richard then makes changes to Andrew’s workload.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.670
He will no longer just focus on housework
and the children, but instead spend time dedicated

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.220
to his creativity, like creating clocks similar
to Richard’s line of work.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.940
Andrew will also spend time with Richard each
evening where he will teach the robot about

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.840
the ways of human life.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.090
Over time, Andrew continues his creative pursuits
carving different objects, but mostly clocks.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.790
He also learns about humans, how they reproduce,
how to understand humor, and how to tell jokes

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.540
among many other things.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.040
He also learns to play the piano with help
from Amanda.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.660
Several years pass and Amanda grows into a
young woman while Andrew remains the same.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.810
Their friendship has just grown stronger over
the years.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.750
Richard and his wife have grown older too
and their other daughter, Grace, has just

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.710
entered her rebellious phase.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.350
The family then decides to sell the clocks
that Andrew had made through the years and

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.000
Amanda says that Andrew should get the money
since he does all the work.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.990
Richard reminds her daughter that while Andrew
is part of the family, he is still a machine

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.120
and that she shouldn’t invest her emotions
in a machine.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.500
Richard sells Andrew’s clock and helps him
open a bank account with the help of their

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.980
family lawyer.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.310
One afternoon, Amanda visits Andrew in his
workshop and he accidentally cuts off his

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.310
finger.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.550
He reassures her that it’s fixable and then
she tells him the news.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.540
Her boyfriend, Frank, had asked her to marry
him.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.440
She talks to him about her conflicting feelings
about marrying Frank when after all, she has

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.390
feelings for Andrew too.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.870
Andrew is oblivious to the conversation and
this helps Amanda decide on her dilemma.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.890
She will marry Frank.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.440
It is the natural thing to do.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.150
She thanks Andrew for listening to her as
always and asks him to wear a tuxedo and be

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.590
an usher at her wedding.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.970
Andrew accepts her invitation happily.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.200
Richard then takes Andrew to N.D.R.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.380
Robotics for repairs and brings his lawyer.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.440
He threatens Mansky that if they try to replace
Andrew’s brain, an alarm will be triggered

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.320
and the police will be alerted.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.690
Then they will sue them until bankruptcy.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.070
Andrew requests if he could have an upgrade
to his face as well so that he will be able

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.200
to express more emotions.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.340
Mansky tells him that this is a very expensive
upgrade but it turns out Andrew has more than

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.600
enough money in his bank account to cover
the expenses.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.220
Mansky ultimately agrees to the upgrade.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.570
Soon enough, the wedding takes place and Amanda
becomes Mrs. Frank Charney.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.490
Andrew attends the wedding, wearing a tuxedo
for the first time, and greets Amanda with

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.570
a smile on his new face.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.810
After the celebrations, Andrew joins Richard
near the lake as he reminisces about his memories

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.250
with her daughters.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.880
As they watch a recording of their father
and daughter dance, Richard grows sentimental

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.590
and tells Andrew that both of his daughters
have grown old and moved away and how he is

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.050
all alone.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.340
Andrew reminds him that he is still there
and Richard thanks him for that.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:15.990
12 years later, Amanda bore an only son, Lloyd,
who unlike his mother is very hostile to robots.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.020
He dumps sand on Andrew on a beach outing
and refuses to apologize.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.120
Amanda reprimands him and forces him to apologize.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.460
As they sit by the beach, Andrew expresses
his wishes to be declared free.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.580
He doesn’t want to leave the family or stop
working for them, but rather, he simply wishes

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.340
to be free to have a choice.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.870
Amanda understands his plight and helps him
talk to her father.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.860
Later that night, Andrew hands Richard a cheque
of all his savings in return for his freedom.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.250
He explains his desires to him but Richard
becomes upset and accuses Amanda of planting

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.180
these ideas in his head.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.080
She reassures his father that Andrew is free
to make his own decisions and that it is only

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.780
natural for him, over time, to learn, develop,
and eventually grow a sense of self.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.169
The next morning, Richard hands the cheque
back to Andrew and declares him to be free.

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.590
Andrew then packs his belongings and is asked
to leave the house.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.979
Despite Andrew’s insistence to continue
to serve them, Richard tells him that his

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:11.090
service is no longer needed.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.330
With his newfound freedom, Andrew buys a piece
of land near the beach and builds his own

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.330
house.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.560
He spends the next 16 years of his life carving
and learning more about the world, until one

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.260
day, an older Amanda knocks on his door and
tells him that her father has asked for him.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.710
They go to the house and Andrew visits Richard
on his deathbed.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.870
Richard tells him that he was wrong and Andrew
was right in asking for his freedom.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.740
He holds his hand and thanks Andrew for serving
them well all these years.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.080
After Richard’s passing, Andrew talks to
Lloyd, Amanda’s son, who is a lawyer.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.900
He asks for his help in acquiring information
regarding his kind so that he can seek them

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.210
out and he can understand more about his destiny.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.290
Lloyd agrees to help him out on the thought
that Andrew will be gone for a long time and

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.620
will no longer influence his mother.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.460
Andrew wins the case and he sets out on his
journey to search for robots like himself.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.120
Several years pass but he hasn’t met any
robot that’s similar to him.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.960
All this time he has kept in touch with Amanda
and he writes letters to her about his adventures.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.180
As his journey ends, Andrew finds himself
back in San Franciso based on the news of

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.190
a robot that has been recently rebuilt in
the area.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.680
At a marketplace, Andrew sees a female dancing
robot.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.810
He follows her to a rundown warehouse and
learns that her name is Galatea.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.700
While he’s ecstatic to meet a robot who
has the same uniqueness as he does, he is

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.580
soon disappointed when he learns that this
is only because Galatea’s personality chip

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.000
is activated.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.270
She has no individuality outside her own programming.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:40.759
He meets her owner, Rupert Burns, whose father
was an engineer at N.D.R.

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:41.759
Robotics.

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:46.370
His father was the one who invented the technology
so that the robots can mimic human expression.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.960
After his father was laid off, he started
his own robotics enterprise but he soon died

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.759
and Rupert took over.

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:56.050
Andrew learns that Rupert is working on a
suit that robots could wear that would mimic

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.760
the external appearance of a human being,
but no one is willing to fund his project.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.900
Andrew gets an idea and offers to fund Rupert’s
project in exchange for him creating a suit

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.520
especially for him.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.830
With Rupert’s help, Andrew soon gains a
new body, one that resembles a 40-year-old

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:11.930
human being.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.949
Excited by his new look, Andrew returns to
the Martins’ home and is confused to see

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:19.240
a young woman who strikingly looks like a
young Amanda.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.930
Andrew meets the real Amanda, now older than
he is, and she almost instantly recognizes

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:24.930
him.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:29.900
He then learns that the young woman is Lloyd’s
daughter, Portia, making her Richard’s great-granddaughter.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.800
The two friends catch up with each other and
Andrew goes back to living in his beach house

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.110
and even adopts a stray dog who he names Woofy.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.029
Andrew soon visits Portia together with Woofy.

00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:43.269
After a bumpy start, the two start an unlikely
friendship.

00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:48.480
Portia realizes that all Andrew wants is to
be with a friend and seek out a human connection.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.750
After several weeks, Andrew finds himself
at a hospital.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.019
It turns out that Amanda had a stroke.

00:08:54.019 --> 00:08:57.649
He enters the hospital room and finds Amanda
laying on the bed with the wooden toy horse

00:08:57.649 --> 00:08:58.930
in her hand.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.519
Amanda tells him that she’s glad he’s
there and drifts off to sleep.

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:06.490
Andrew bids his old friend goodbye as Portia
checks her grandmother’s pulse.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.750
Amanda has now passed away.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.870
Despite his inability to produce tears, Andrew
can feel his heart breaking, now that his

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.750
oldest friend is gone.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.610
Andrew goes back to Rupert and asks for his
help in producing synthetic organs to make

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.249
him become more human.

00:09:20.249 --> 00:09:23.379
Rupert is reluctant but is willing to take
on the challenge.

00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:28.110
While with Rupert, he also learns to become
more human in his language and expressions.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:33.029
Before the project comes to a close, Rupert
asks him if he is ready for the radical change.

00:09:33.029 --> 00:09:37.930
If Andrew proceeds with this, not only will
he feel happiness, but he will also feel sadness,

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.490
hurt, and pain.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.850
Andrew tells him that there is no doubt in
his mind and he wants to proceed with the

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.170
transition.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:49.240
As the project is in progress, Andrew visits
Portia and they go for a walk together.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.089
She invites him to a party at a building that
she had just finished restoring and he happily

00:09:53.089 --> 00:09:54.100
accepts.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.179
At the party, Portia invites Andrew to dance.

00:09:57.179 --> 00:10:01.300
Under the lights, the two share a passionate
dance, unaware of the growing feelings between

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.300
them.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:07.089
At one of their walks, Portia, feeling conflicted
about her feelings for Andrew, tells him that

00:10:07.089 --> 00:10:11.550
while she considers him as a good friend,
she can’t invest her feelings in a machine.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.029
Andrew feels offended and reminds her that
things can always change.

00:10:15.029 --> 00:10:19.279
He returns back to Rupert and goes through
the final stages of the transition.

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:23.490
Once the change is complete, Andrew visits
Portia and asks her to poke his eye.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.910
Portia does so and he is ecstatic now that
he can feel pain.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.119
He then asks her to kiss him and the two share
a quick kiss.

00:10:30.119 --> 00:10:34.660
Portia feels conflicted about the kiss, bringing
up the fact that she is marrying her boyfriend,

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.699
Charles, in a few weeks.

00:10:36.699 --> 00:10:41.230
She knows she loves Andrew but she wants him
to realize for himself that he loves her too.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.959
She tells him that in order for him to follow
his heart, he must do the wrong thing.

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:48.170
This will help him make mistakes and learn
from those mistakes.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.459
Andrew takes her advice and leaves.

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:54.439
Meanwhile, Galatea becomes hostile against
Rupert and tells him how tired she is of him

00:10:54.439 --> 00:10:56.140
bossing her around.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.630
It turns out that Andrew has removed her personality
chip.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.019
Rupert goes to Andrew and begs him to return
the chip to him.

00:11:03.019 --> 00:11:05.980
Andrew is reluctant but he eventually gives
the chip back.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.980
The two quickly find themselves hiding at
Portia’s engagement party.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:14.370
Andrew talks to Rupert about how much he despises
Portia’s fiancee and Rupert informs him

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.379
that this is him being jealous.

00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:20.839
Andrew realizes that if he’s jealous then
that must mean that he’s in love with Portia.

00:11:20.839 --> 00:11:24.290
Andrew leaves the party with Rupert following
him closely behind.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:28.400
Unbeknownst to him, Portia actually wanted
Andrew to crash in and take her away, but

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.239
he was nowhere in sight.

00:11:30.239 --> 00:11:34.029
Back at his beach house, Rupert informs him
that he’s working on a new upgrade that

00:11:34.029 --> 00:11:38.660
would enable Andrew to fully gain all senses,
including the sexual aspect of being a human

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.300
being, thus making him a complete man.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.310
The next day, Andrew visits Portia at work.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.610
He now understands what she meant about making
the wrong choice.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.439
He declares his love for her and tells her
that he knows that she loves him too.

00:11:51.439 --> 00:11:54.119
She must now do the right thing and follow
her heart.

00:11:54.119 --> 00:11:57.990
When Portia walks away, he asks her to give
him one kiss, and then they can know once

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.360
and for all if they are meant for each other.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.579
She gives in and the two share a deep kiss.

00:12:02.579 --> 00:12:06.459
Portia kisses him back, confirming that she
does love Andrew too.

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:10.769
The next morning, the two lay in bed next
to each other after an intimate evening.

00:12:10.769 --> 00:12:14.470
They eat breakfast together and Portia sadly
mentions how their relationship will never

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.949
be accepted.

00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:18.889
Andrew tells her that now he will need to
do the next step.

00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:22.260
He files a case with the World Congress so
that he can be officially considered as a

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.889
human being.

00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:27.869
Despite having a strong case, congress rejects
his case on the grounds of his inability to

00:12:27.869 --> 00:12:28.999
age.

00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:32.899
No one will like an immortal human, that’s
why as long as he cannot age, he will not

00:12:32.899 --> 00:12:34.809
be declared as a human being.

00:12:34.809 --> 00:12:39.470
Many years pass and Portia grows into a lovely
75-year-old woman while Andrew has remained

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.259
relatively the same.

00:12:41.259 --> 00:12:45.459
Over a game of chess, Portia expresses her
thoughts about her mortality.

00:12:45.459 --> 00:12:49.929
Andrew reassures her that she can now practically
live forever with the existing technology,

00:12:49.929 --> 00:12:51.619
but she doesn’t want to.

00:12:51.619 --> 00:12:54.439
For her, it’s unnatural to live forever.

00:12:54.439 --> 00:12:58.149
Human beings are meant to exist for a time
and then pass on, and that’s how she wants

00:12:58.149 --> 00:12:59.149
to live her life.

00:12:59.149 --> 00:13:00.959
It’s the natural thing to do.

00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:04.220
But Andrew can’t bear to live in a world
without her.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.679
Later that night, he remembers something that
Richard once told him.

00:13:07.679 --> 00:13:11.269
People grow over time, but for him, time is
endless.

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:14.649
Andrew knows, deep in his heart, the right
thing to do.

00:13:14.649 --> 00:13:18.939
He visits Rupert, whose enterprise has now
earned him millions of dollars, and asks him

00:13:18.939 --> 00:13:23.389
to transition him to a complete human being
by injecting blood into his system.

00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:27.760
Rupert tells him that after the process is
complete, he will have around 30 or 45 more

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.300
years to live.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.339
Andrew accepts this fate and the transition
is complete.

00:13:32.339 --> 00:13:37.199
After several decades, Andrew files an appeal
and appears before the World Congress again.

00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:41.920
This time, he is a very frail old man, nearly
around 200 years old.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.809
He tells Congress that he would rather live
one lifetime as a man than live all of eternity

00:13:45.809 --> 00:13:47.209
as a machine.

00:13:47.209 --> 00:13:50.399
All he wants is to be recognized for who he
is.

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:54.130
Congress hears his case and asks for some
time before they make a decision.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:58.509
Time passes on and soon, Andrew and Portia
lay next to each other, both clinging to life

00:13:58.509 --> 00:13:59.509
support.

00:13:59.509 --> 00:14:04.359
Galatea, who is now also more human, attends
to them and turns on the television so that

00:14:04.359 --> 00:14:08.019
they can watch the live broadcast of the World
Congress’s decision.

00:14:08.019 --> 00:14:11.499
They hold each other’s hands as congress
announces their decision to consider Andrew

00:14:11.499 --> 00:14:15.459
Martin as a human being and validate his marriage
to Portia Charney.

00:14:15.459 --> 00:14:18.889
Unfortunately, Andrew passes away before he
could hear their decision.

00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:23.549
Portia looks over at her husband as Galatea
confirms that Andrew has died.

00:14:23.549 --> 00:14:27.269
She tells Galatea that Andrew didn’t need
to hear the congress’ decision.

00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:31.859
No matter what anyone says, Andrew lived a
life that is worthy of any human being.

00:14:31.859 --> 00:14:34.730
She requests that her life support be unplugged
as well.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:42.829
Portia holds on to the love of her life as
she slowly slips away and whispers that she

00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:48.979
will see him soon.
