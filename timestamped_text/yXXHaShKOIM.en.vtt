the changes have sort of been
 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.200 align:start position:0%

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
been released on the ps3 and there isn't
 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.010 align:start position:0%
been released on the ps3 and there isn't
that<00:00:35.190><c> much</c><00:00:35.520><c> difference</c><00:00:35.600><c> except</c><00:00:36.600><c> from</c><00:00:36.840><c> on</c><00:00:36.989><c> a</c>

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
that much difference except from on a
 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.799 align:start position:0%
that much difference except from on a
graphical<00:00:37.649><c> level</c><00:00:38.010><c> and</c><00:00:38.430><c> so</c><00:00:39.120><c> I</c><00:00:39.149><c> thought</c><00:00:39.510><c> I'd</c><00:00:39.660><c> go</c>

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 align:start position:0%
graphical level and so I thought I'd go
 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
graphical level and so I thought I'd go
back<00:00:40.079><c> to</c><00:00:40.290><c> this</c><00:00:40.460><c> what</c><00:00:41.460><c> many</c><00:00:41.760><c> consider</c><00:00:42.239><c> a</c>

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 align:start position:0%
back to this what many consider a
 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.049 align:start position:0%
back to this what many consider a
classic<00:00:42.780><c> and</c><00:00:43.260><c> God</c><00:00:43.950><c> of</c><00:00:44.129><c> War</c><00:00:44.280><c> three</c><00:00:44.640><c> and</c><00:00:44.670><c> see</c><00:00:45.030><c> if</c>

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 align:start position:0%
classic and God of War three and see if
 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.810 align:start position:0%
classic and God of War three and see if
it<00:00:45.300><c> still</c><00:00:45.629><c> holds</c><00:00:46.050><c> up</c><00:00:46.170><c> today</c><00:00:46.230><c> and</c><00:00:46.829><c> if</c><00:00:47.250><c> it</c><00:00:47.430><c> is</c><00:00:47.579><c> as</c>

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 align:start position:0%
it still holds up today and if it is as
 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.330 align:start position:0%
it still holds up today and if it is as
good<00:00:48.420><c> as</c><00:00:48.719><c> many</c><00:00:49.260><c> people</c><00:00:49.530><c> said</c><00:00:49.829><c> that</c><00:00:49.860><c> it</c><00:00:50.070><c> was</c>

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
good as many people said that it was
 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.450 align:start position:0%
good as many people said that it was
back<00:00:50.640><c> then</c><00:00:50.670><c> and</c><00:00:51.210><c> so</c><00:00:52.140><c> starting</c><00:00:52.739><c> off</c><00:00:52.860><c> the</c><00:00:53.039><c> story</c>

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 align:start position:0%

storyline eventually she saw the way she
ties<00:01:04.769><c> in</c><00:01:04.979><c> and</c><00:01:05.100><c> this</c><00:01:05.220><c> plot</c><00:01:05.519><c> seems</c><00:01:05.790><c> a</c><00:01:05.970><c> bit</c>

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 align:start position:0%
so it's quite interesting to go back and
 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.010 align:start position:0%
so it's quite interesting to go back and

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.550 align:start position:0%
games but then the arkham combat came
out<00:05:59.610><c> and</c><00:05:59.910><c> that</c><00:06:00.060><c> was</c><00:06:00.270><c> sort</c><00:06:00.510><c> of</c><00:06:00.570><c> the</c><00:06:00.780><c> step</c><00:06:01.200><c> above</c>

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 align:start position:0%

you're flying through a level and then
 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
you're flying through a level and then
you<00:06:28.110><c> land</c><00:06:28.350><c> in</c><00:06:28.830><c> a</c><00:06:28.950><c> kill</c><00:06:29.160><c> room</c><00:06:29.430><c> and</c><00:06:29.910><c> you</c><00:06:29.970><c> have</c><00:06:30.090><c> to</c>

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 align:start position:0%
you land in a kill room and you have to
 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
you land in a kill room and you have to
fight<00:06:30.480><c> these</c><00:06:30.930><c> like</c><00:06:31.580><c> monsters</c><00:06:32.580><c> and</c><00:06:32.910><c> honestly</c>

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 align:start position:0%
fight these like monsters and honestly
 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.590 align:start position:0%
fight these like monsters and honestly
if<00:06:33.750><c> you'd</c><00:06:34.260><c> landed</c><00:06:34.650><c> like</c><00:06:34.860><c> 5</c><00:06:35.280><c> foot</c><00:06:35.580><c> in</c><00:06:35.700><c> front</c><00:06:36.000><c> you</c>

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
if you'd landed like 5 foot in front you
 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
if you'd landed like 5 foot in front you
wouldn't<00:06:36.930><c> have</c><00:06:37.020><c> had</c><00:06:37.170><c> to</c><00:06:37.290><c> fight</c><00:06:37.500><c> them</c><00:06:37.710><c> and</c><00:06:37.890><c> you</c>

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have had to fight them and you
 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.990 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have had to fight them and you
would<00:06:38.130><c> have</c><00:06:38.190><c> just</c><00:06:38.340><c> went</c><00:06:38.490><c> on</c><00:06:38.610><c> the</c><00:06:38.760><c> next</c>

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
would have just went on the next
 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.090 align:start position:0%
would have just went on the next
objective<00:06:39.180><c> so</c><00:06:39.960><c> it</c><00:06:40.080><c> really</c><00:06:40.380><c> feels</c><00:06:40.770><c> like</c>

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
objective so it really feels like
 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
objective so it really feels like
they're<00:06:41.280><c> just</c><00:06:41.400><c> padding</c><00:06:41.910><c> out</c><00:06:42.090><c> the</c><00:06:42.900><c> game</c>

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 align:start position:0%
they're just padding out the game
 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.670 align:start position:0%
they're just padding out the game
especially<00:06:44.030><c> towards</c><00:06:45.030><c> the</c><00:06:45.120><c> end</c><00:06:45.270><c> there's</c><00:06:46.080><c> so</c>

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
especially towards the end there's so
 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.220 align:start position:0%
especially towards the end there's so
many<00:06:46.980><c> mind-numbing</c><00:06:47.820><c> fight</c><00:06:48.570><c> and</c><00:06:48.900><c> it</c><00:06:48.990><c> just</c>

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.230 align:start position:0%
many mind-numbing fight and it just
 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.710 align:start position:0%
many mind-numbing fight and it just
becomes<00:06:49.530><c> a</c><00:06:49.770><c> slog</c><00:06:50.360><c> especially</c><00:06:51.360><c> when</c><00:06:51.480><c> you</c><00:06:51.570><c> don't</c>

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
becomes a slog especially when you don't
 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
becomes a slog especially when you don't
know<00:06:51.900><c> what</c><00:06:51.990><c> you</c><00:06:52.080><c> hit</c><00:06:52.260><c> in</c><00:06:52.380><c> most</c><00:06:52.590><c> of</c><00:06:52.710><c> the</c><00:06:52.770><c> time</c>

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 align:start position:0%
know what you hit in most of the time
 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.030 align:start position:0%
know what you hit in most of the time

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
and it's just wave after wave of villain
 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.470 align:start position:0%
and it's just wave after wave of villain
that<00:06:56.160><c> you've</c><00:06:56.340><c> fought</c><00:06:56.640><c> throughout</c><00:06:57.000><c> and</c><00:06:57.450><c> you</c>
