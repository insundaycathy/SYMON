00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.870
Hello everyone, this is Mr. Brain Junkie here!
and today we're gonna be talking about a supernatural

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.780
thriller film called death note part 1, be
ready for some spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.200
In the night sky of the Tokyo city, a note
book falls down from above, onto the streets,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.260
and the words death note appears on top of
the cover.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.580
A person picks it up and begins writing a
name on the blank page, while a criminal is

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.100
running away from the pursuit of the police.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.529
The man takes a woman hostage and threatens
to kill her, but suddenly begins convulsing

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.480
in pain and dies on the floor to what appears
to be a heart attack.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.379
The mysterious man writes another name, and
the corrupt government official who avoided

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.139
prosecution dies of a sudden heart attack
as well.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:43.839
The man continues to write names of criminals
on the pages, and the people begin dying one

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.449
by one, regardless of their locations.

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.129
This causes people to panic as the government
thinks it might be a virus or a pathogen,

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.359
but others believe that it's the work of a
god from the underworld know as Kira.

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.659
The incidents received mixed opinions as some
people believe that Kira is a criminal for

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.539
bypassing the law, but many also thinks that
he's a savior of humanity.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.130
a young man who's name is light looks at the
news from the intersection, where the police

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.530
are trying to arrest a man who's taken numerous
people hostage.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.780
He takes out the note book and writes the
criminal's name, and moments later, the hostages

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.600
are freed after the man died mysteriously.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.520
It turns out that he is the deity known as
Kira and the person responsible for the mass killings

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.539
Light is a college student who's recently
passed the bar's examination and desires to

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.830
work in the criminal field of the legal system.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.130
He goes to have lunch with his girlfriend
Shiori, and the two debates about whether

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.090
if Kira is helping humanity.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.469
The girl thinks that no individual should
have the power to execute another person,

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:44.369
as that would defeat the purpose of the legal
system,

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.720
but Light thinks that the laws are flawed
as it allows too many criminals to go unpunished.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.090
Apparently, he hacked into the police database
and saw numerous criminal cases dropped for

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.719
various reasons, and the media kept this secret
as to avoid public outrage.

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.909
Light personally tracked down one of the criminals
and saw the man's arrogance while confessing

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.189
proudly about the killings to his friends.

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.470
The criminal notices light watching them,
and proceeds to intimidate the man, while

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.620
boasting that no one can put him in jail due
to his plea for insanity.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.819
From that moment on, light no longer believes
in the legal system, but what he didn't tell

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.150
the girl was what happened to him after.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.390
He walks out from the bar in shock after the
encounter and throws away his textbook about

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.180
law but at the same time, he notices the black
book that is lying on the floor.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.709
He goes back home and opens the strange book,
only to see a list of rules, where the first

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.010
one states that whoever's name is written
inside will die.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.920
He looks at the news where a criminal was
charged with killing his girlfriend, and proceeds

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.310
to write the person's name on the blank page,
but doubts that anything will happen.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.799
The next morning, after waking up to have
breakfast, light notices on the newspaper

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.099
that the criminal has died mysteriously, and
realizes that the book may have the power

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.860
to kill after all.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.230
Light goes to the criminal he saw in the bar
earlier, and decides to end his life by writing

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.440
the name down.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.799
Shockingly, the man begins screaming in pain
and dies in front of everyone.

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.160
While still in a state of disbelief, light
meets a terrifying creature on his way home,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.189
who claims to be a god of death named, Ryuk,
and the original owner of the notebook.

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.769
The creature explains that anyone who touches
the death note is able to see the death Gods

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.260
and use the notebook's power to kill.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.270
Light inquires about what the monster wants
for the book, but Ryuk tells him to keep it

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.540
without conditions.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.920
However, the creature warns him that the death
note always brings it's user misery and suffering.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.739
Four months, the police investigators are
still puzzled by the deaths, but the chief

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.340
investigator, Yagami, strongly believes that
these are in fact murders by the same person.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.860
He goes to his superior's office and gets
a surprise visit from Watari, who speaks on

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.329
behalf of a legendary detective, known simply
as L.

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.720
The old man takes out a laptop, where L speaks
through to the police officers.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.120
He tells them that the incidents are not naturally
occurring, as it doesn't fit any previous

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.959
models of disasters.

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.469
It's also unlikely that Kira is working with
other, because the chances of getting caught

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.180
increases dramatically with additional accomplices.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.160
With the people that he killed, Kira would
need at least 80 people working under him,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.290
but so far the killer has been successful
100 percent of the time.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.850
When Yagami inquires about the apparent contradictions,
L refuses to explain further and goes back

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:23.850
offline.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.380
The police chief tells Yagami that he'll be
working with L from now on, in the effort

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.750
of capturing the mass killer Kira.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.990
Meanwhile, Light is celebrating the success
of lowering the city's crime rates dramatically,

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.710
and gives Ryuk an apple which the creature
seems to love.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.620
He sees a news flash on tv, where a man who
claims to be L promises the people that he'll

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.500
catch Kira, and proceeds to insult the killer
repeatedly.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.280
In a fit of rage, Light quickly writes the
name of the speaker that's present on the

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.690
name tag, and the man on the television dies
of a heart attack after exactly 40 seconds.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.600
Just when he thinks everything is going as
planned, L begins talking to Kira through

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.460
the television, confirming that the killer
is in Tokyo, as the broadcast was only made

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.470
in the city.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.900
The man that just died was a convict on death
roll, who was arrested in secret without the

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.280
public's notice.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.010
L promises to catch Kira personally and claims
to be the true justice.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.720
This challenge infuriate light, as Ryuk laughs
hysterically at both of them.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.470
At the same time, L informs the investigation
team about further leads that he found regarding

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.270
the killings, after compiling the murders
and their time of death.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.250
The data shows that Kira kills on the schedule
of a university student, as no one has died

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.710
on weekdays when classes are present.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.280
However, Light quickly realizes their findings
as well, when he searches through the police

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.540
database.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.740
This prompts him to begin killing criminals
1 per hour, and throwing off the supposed

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.740
pattern.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.250
The investigators are confused by this, by
L states that this only proves that Kira can

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.010
manipulate the time of death, and also that
he's connected to one of the investigators

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.010
of this case.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.120
One day, light is walking with the death god
in the park, and notices that strangely the

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.950
monster is not eating the apple like usual.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.280
The man quickly realizes that they are being
followed and scolds Ryuk for not telling him

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.070
sooner, but the death God tells light that
he has no obligation to help either side.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.920
At home, Ryuk explains to light that he takes
away the remaining life of anyone who was

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.720
killed by the note book and adds it to his
own.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.840
He also reveals that he can see the names
of everyone and their time of death.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.480
He tries to offer this power to light, at
the cost of half of his remaining life, but

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.330
the man refuses, knowing that this is nothing
but a desperate measure.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.610
Light plans to win their battle by intelligence
alone, and flips through the notebook revealing

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.410
another rule, where he's able to control the
manner in which someone dies in addition to

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.410
the time.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.880
He tries out this ability by manipulating
the convicts into killing themselves in very

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.860
specific ways, which confuses the investigators
even more, but not L, who realizes that Kira

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.220
is experimenting.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.630
After confirming that the method does work
in controlling his victims, he sees a criminal

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.970
on the television and begins planning for
his next move.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.390
The next day, the mysterious man continues
to follow light as he takes the public transit

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.580
with his girlfriend.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.710
The man gets on the bus and sits behind the
main character, but light confronts the person

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.600
directly for following him.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.280
Their conversation is cut short when the criminal
that light saw on television last night takes

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.610
the bus as well, and begins threatening the
bus driver.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.850
Light tells the man behind that he plans to
confront the criminal by himself, which forces

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.710
the man to stop him and show him the badge
as credential, but also revealing his name

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.810
as Raye.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.450
Light drops a piece of the notebook on the
floor, and the criminal begins rushing towards

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.440
them, suspecting that they are trying to save
the bus.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.580
He picks up the paper and threatens to shoot,
but gets shocked when he sees Ryuk at the

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.320
back of the bus, after touching the death
note.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.410
The criminal fires at the deity numerous times
with no effect, and runs off the bus in fear,

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.670
but gets killed by a car that crashes into
him.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:01.260
In turns out that this was part of a specific
note written by light beforehand, and the

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.850
criminal died exactly the way he wanted.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:09.370
He tells the police officer to ask him questions
directly, as he'll never hide from the authorities.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:14.010
Raye goes back home still thinking about the
case, but his fiancé Naomi reminds him that

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.430
they have to go to the church as they are
getting married very soon.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:22.130
She worries about Raye and tells him to be
careful, as Kira is very dangerous, but the

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.390
man laughs and reminds her that she took on
more dangerous missions when she was working

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.390
with L.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:31.850
On the other side, Light realizes that L must've
sent numerous agents following anyone that

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.469
was a potential suspect.

00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:38.089
He thinks that the only way to kill Raye without
suspicions is if he kills all the agents at

00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:39.450
the same time.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.750
After making plans with Raye to see the father,
the man rushes out and tells her that he must

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.500
attend to something else, leaving Naomi with
a strange feeling.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.420
Raye goes to the subway station while his
fiancé follows him onto the train.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.060
He takes an envelope and sits down beside
another man.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.769
To his shock, the documents were left to him
by Kira and when he puts on the earphone,

00:08:58.769 --> 00:09:01.339
a distorted voice confirms being the mass
killer.

00:09:01.339 --> 00:09:05.899
In order to prove that this is real, light
kills the man sitting beside Raye, who's a

00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:08.660
criminal that managed to escaped the legal
system.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.339
Of course, he planned this ahead of time and
positioned the man right beside where Raye

00:09:12.339 --> 00:09:13.930
is supposed to sit.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:18.100
After seeing the man die as predicted, light
tells Raye to write down every single name

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.100
of the agents assigned by L, threatening to
kill him if he doesn't.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.910
The man takes out the pieces of paper prepared
by light and begins writing the names down.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.470
Light then tells Raye to leave the envelope
and exit the train.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.750
Naomi sees her fiancé and calls out for his
name, but the man feels a heart attack and

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.230
faints to the ground.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.899
Before his death, he sees that Kira is actually
the person he was following this whole time,

00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:43.339
and points towards the train before he dies.

00:09:43.339 --> 00:09:46.980
Light goes back to retrieve the envelope and
reveals that he planned for the agents to

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.709
all die the same way.

00:09:48.709 --> 00:09:52.850
In fact, he orchestrated this whole meeting
with Raye as part of the man's death from

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.360
the very beginning.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.180
After realizing that Kira is now killing police
officers, the majority of the investigation

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.410
team resigns, leaving only 6 members left.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:07.050
The group expresses their desire to meet L
in person, as they feel that it's unfair for

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.699
everyone to risk their lives while the mysterious
detective hides in a safe place.

00:10:11.699 --> 00:10:15.160
L agrees to their request and orders Watari
to bring them inside.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.689
When they enter the hotel room, the group
is surprised to see that L is a pale man who

00:10:19.689 --> 00:10:20.970
doesn't really like shoes.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.050
They are further troubled by his demeanor,
which reveals that he treats this as nothing

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.560
more than a game.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.140
However, his deductive reasonings are extremely
impressive as he figured out that Kira can

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.189
control a person's behavior before they die.

00:10:34.189 --> 00:10:38.930
Yagami warns the man that this is not a game,
but L replies that it doesn't matter as their

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.620
objects are the same.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:45.709
At the same time, Naomi also begins searching
for the person responsible for her fiancé's

00:10:45.709 --> 00:10:46.709
death.

00:10:46.709 --> 00:10:50.180
She manages to find the bus driver that was
present during the shooting, and discovers

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.999
that light was the one her fiancé was following.

00:10:52.999 --> 00:10:58.040
The woman eventually finds Shiori and confirms
that light was on the same bus with Raye.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.660
She tells the girl that she thinks light is
connected with all the killings by Kira.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:07.180
On the other side, the investigators begin
reviewing all the footages of the dead agents,

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.329
and L notices that when Raye died, he was
pointing towards the train, as if he knew

00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:12.910
Kira's identity.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:17.689
He tells the team about his findings and reveals
the suspects most likely to be Kira, which

00:11:17.689 --> 00:11:20.189
includes the chief investigator's son.

00:11:20.189 --> 00:11:25.350
L wants to place cameras everywhere inside
the suspect's household, which enrages everyone,

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:30.180
but Yagami eventually agrees, knowing that
it's only way to clear his family's name.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.209
Meanwhile, light begins preparing for L as
he writes down the criminal's names a week

00:11:34.209 --> 00:11:38.509
ahead, just in case if he was put in a position
where he couldn't kill anymore.

00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:43.129
Ryuk is impressed with the man's diligence,
but quickly gets distracted by the television

00:11:43.129 --> 00:11:46.850
as he stares intriguingly at a girl who's
performing for her show.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:51.300
The next day while reading the book of Nietzsche,
Light gets a visit from Naomi.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.249
the woman gives him a business card with a
fake name, and proceeds to accuse him of being

00:11:55.249 --> 00:11:56.249
Kira.

00:11:56.249 --> 00:12:00.930
Light refutes this accusation, but secretly
begins writing the woman's name on the paper.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.970
He tells his girlfriend to leave as he claims
that this is a waste time.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:09.079
However, Naomi stops him while he's leaving
and tells light that the name she gave was

00:12:09.079 --> 00:12:10.079
fake.

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:14.769
She reveals that Raye was her fiancé, and
promises that she will put Kira behind bars.

00:12:14.769 --> 00:12:19.499
Light goes home and before he enters his room,
he notices that someone was inside before,

00:12:19.499 --> 00:12:23.250
by the broken lead on the floor which he placed
earlier on the hinges for security.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.579
He begins thinking about what's going on,
but decides to leave the house to reassess

00:12:27.579 --> 00:12:28.980
the situation.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:33.350
He tells Ryuk to look for the cameras and
promises him apples for his reward.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:38.110
at the same time, the investigators continue
to monitor the household, but finds nothing

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.110
suspicious.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:43.410
L tells the people that the only way to exclude
light from being a suspect is by having a

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.630
murder occur while the man is under supervision.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:50.899
After many days, of watching the family, a
criminal finally dies while light is not doing

00:12:50.899 --> 00:12:52.540
anything suspicious.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:57.120
This doesn't convince L, as the crime needs
to be after the cameras were installed, because

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.470
Kira is able to manipulate the time of death
for his victims.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:05.149
on the 7th day of supervision, light takes
a bag of chips after dinner and begins studying

00:13:05.149 --> 00:13:06.490
while having the snacks.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:10.980
The investigators watches the cameras as they
hear on the news that a criminal was arrested

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.330
for kidnapping.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.809
Surprisingly, moments after the announcement,
the criminal dies of a heart attack, which

00:13:16.809 --> 00:13:19.040
is a signature way of killing by Kira.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.769
The investigators are exhilarated, knowing
that this proofs that light is innocent, as

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:26.069
there is no way he could be responsible for
the man's death.

00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:27.069
However, L is clearly not convinced as he
stares at the camera in shock.

00:13:27.069 --> 00:13:28.069
He tells Watari to remove the bugs from the
household as Kira has clearly figured out

00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:29.069
how to bypass the system.

00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:31.600
The officers congratulate Yagami for clearly
his family's name, but the chief notices that

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.199
L is visibly unsettled by the results.

00:13:34.199 --> 00:13:38.930
It is revealed that Light was able to kill
the criminal after all by hiding a radio inside

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.019
the bag of chips and writing the criminal's
name on the paper.

00:13:42.019 --> 00:13:47.029
Later that day, L receives a phone call from
Naomi, who promises that she's going to reveal

00:13:47.029 --> 00:13:50.100
Kira's identity by risking her own life.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.279
light receives a call from his girlfriend,
telling him to go to the art gallery for a

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:55.279
date.

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:59.069
It turns out that this was part of Naomi's
plan as she points a gun at the girl.

00:13:59.069 --> 00:14:04.449
L monitors the situation quickly, while Yagami
is furious that his son is still the prime

00:14:04.449 --> 00:14:07.240
suspect, and calls the police to surround
the building.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.160
Light rushes to the art gallery, only to find
that his girlfriend is being held at gun point.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.220
Naomi threatens to kill the girl in front
of light if he doesn't admit to being Kira,

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.259
but the main character continues to refute
her accusations.

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:25.110
The police arrives quickly which distracts
the woman, and Shiori runs away at this opportunity.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:29.420
Naomi points her gun at the girl and fires,
shooting Shiori right in the chest.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.420
Light runs towards his girlfriend and cries
while she dies in his arms.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.499
Naomi looks at the situation in shock and
shoots herself as the police tries their best

00:14:37.499 --> 00:14:38.800
to stop her.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.089
However, Light reveals that he planned for
Naomi's death from the very beginning, as

00:14:43.089 --> 00:14:47.139
he noticed that the woman was getting married
in a church when Raye died and discovered

00:14:47.139 --> 00:14:49.540
her real name by visiting the father.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:54.029
Light planned for Naomi to kidnap his girlfriend
and eventually shoot herself at the end.

00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:58.580
When the death god inquires about his sadness
for shiori, Light reveals that he planned

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.180
for her death as well.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:04.009
Since you can't use the death note to make
someone kill, he simply made the situation

00:15:04.009 --> 00:15:08.990
impossible to happen unless the shot that
Naomi fired ends up killing his girlfriend.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.259
He only wrote that Shiori would be killed
by a gunshot, but since Naomi was the only

00:15:13.259 --> 00:15:17.430
one carrying a gun in the whole building,
the death note had to make her the killer.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:21.619
Ryuk is surprised to learn what light did,
and claims that he's much worse than any death

00:15:21.619 --> 00:15:25.029
God that exists, because the girl truly did
love him.

00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:29.259
Yagami tries to comfort his son about the
girlfriends death, and light takes the opportunity

00:15:29.259 --> 00:15:34.250
to ask permission for joining the investigation
team, claiming that he must avenge his girlfriend.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:39.339
A voice yells to welcome light to the team
as both man turns around, only to see that

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:41.699
L has chosen to appear in public.

00:15:41.699 --> 00:15:45.660
He takes out the same chips that light was
eating, showing that he knows about how light

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.560
was able to commit the murders.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:52.079
The two men stare at each other as they both
realize that a new round of battle is about

00:15:52.079 --> 00:15:53.970
the commence.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.699
