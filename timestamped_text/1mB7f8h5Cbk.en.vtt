00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.670
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.260
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of
the 2019 Spanish social science fiction-horror

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.380
film called 'The Platform'.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.350
The film was directed by Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.019
The story is set in a large 'Vertical Self-Management
Center' with a tower-like design.

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.880
Residents, who are rotated every 30 days between
the tower's numerous floors, are fed via a

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.169
platform that starts at the top floor and
progressively lowers down the levels, halting

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.589
for a certain length of time on each.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.730
Because the inhabitants at the highest levels
get to consume as much as they like, the system

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.070
eventually leads to conflict, as each level
only gets the leftovers from the preceding

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.070
one.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.090
There will be Spoilers ahead, so please proceed
with caution.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.930
Goreng awakens in a concrete cell with the
number 48 written on it.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.480
Trimagasi, his cellmate, says that they are
in a 'Vertical Self-Management Center,' also

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.960
known as 'The Pit,' which is a tower-style
facility where food is supplied by a platform

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.450
that moves from the top down, pausing for
a certain duration on each floor.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.360
Others on lower levels can only consume what
those on higher levels leave, and if anybody

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.320
tries to keep any of the food, the cell is
heated or cooled to lethal temperatures.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.600
Every month, people are transferred to a new
level at random.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.090
Goreng chose a book of Don Quixote, while
Trimagasi chose a self-sharpening knife, since

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.039
each tenant is permitted to bring in one item.

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.960
Trimagasi claims that when he and his old
cellmate were sent to level 132, they cannibalised

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.020
a prisoner who had fallen down the shaft.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.670
Miharu, a wounded woman, rides down the platform
one day.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.069
Trimagasi adds that every month, she descends
the hole in pursuit of her child.

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:38.159
Goreng volunteered to serve six months at
the institution in return for a diploma, while

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.240
Trimagasi reveals that he is serving a year
in prison for manslaughter.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.950
The two become friends throughout the first
month, but Goreng wakes up bound to his bed

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.840
on the day of the room shuffle.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.430
They've been transferred to level 171, where
when the platform comes, it'll be devoid of

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.779
food.

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:57.929
Trimagasi says that he intends to cut portions
of Goreng's flesh to support them both, and

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.920
that Goreng may survive if he is complicit.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.860
Trimagasi becomes weaker on the seventh day
and begins severing Goreng's leg, but she

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.390
is assaulted by Miharu as she descends the
platform.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.370
Trimagasi is killed by Goreng after she frees
him.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.330
Trimagasi's flesh is hacked out by Miharu,
who feeds some to Goreng and eats some herself.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.110
She nurses Goreng, but when he inquires about
her kid, she walks off the platform.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.731
Goreng is tormented by Trimagasi the night
before the shuffle, who reveals that they

00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:28.530
are now one and the same and that Trimagasi
would never leave him.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.530
Goreng awakens on level 33 with a woman named
Imoguiri and her dog, Rameses the 2nd, in

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.090
the third month.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.250
Goreng knows her as the officer from the Administration
who interrogated him before incarcerating

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.250
him.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.790
When she was diagnosed with terminal cancer,
she claims she was ignorant of the appalling

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.960
conditions and offered to help.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.240
Imoguiri limits her food and tries to persuade
the guys on level 34 to do the same, but they

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.240
are dismissive.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.890
Goreng threatens to poo on the meal if they
do not comply after two weeks, and it succeeds.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.820
The two start arguing over persuasive techniques.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.320
When Miharu arrives injured one day, Goreng
and Imoguiri tend to her.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.080
Goreng informs Imoguiri about Miharu's quest
for her kid, but Imoguiri informs Goreng that

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.420
minors under the age of 16 are not permitted
to visit the facility, and Miharu entered

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.550
alone.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.290
She also claims to be aware that there are
a total of 200 levels.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.570
The next month, Goreng awakens on level 202
to discover Imoguiri had hung herself.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.070
Goreng, plagued by images of Trimagasi and
Imoguiri, consumes her flesh to stay alive,

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.450
hallucinating Trimagasi telling him to do
so.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.670
Goreng gets promoted to level 6 at the start
of the fifth month.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.230
Baharat, his new cellmate, tries unsuccessfully
to escape by climbing to the top floor.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.540
Goreng encourages Baharat to ride the platform
down with him, dividing the food so that everyone

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.770
gets a part, estimating that there are 250
levels.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.140
They resolve to guard the food until they
reach level 50, at which point they will begin

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.770
to distribute it.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.230
One of the inmates, the wise Sr. Brambang,
persuades the others to send a symbolic message

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.200
to the government by leaving one dish unattended
(a panna cotta).

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.180
They dole out pieces to the inmates as they
descend deeper, attacking any who refuse to

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.550
participate.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.800
They come see Miharu battling two other convicts
on the way and attempt to save her, but she

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.660
is murdered and they are seriously damaged.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.540
Goreng and Baharat keep down until they reach
level 333, where the platform comes to a halt.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.000
Goreng discovers a kid hiding beneath the
bed, Miharu's daughter.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.990
He steps off the platform, cautiously followed
by Baharat, only for the platform to descend,

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.410
leaving them behind.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.139
They give the girl the untouched panna cotta
they had preserved as a 'message' for the

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.970
Administrators at the top, despite Baharat's
reluctance.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.520
Goreng loses consciousness and has a dream
in which Baharat tells him that 'the girl

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.190
is the message.'

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.540
Goreng discovers Baharat dead the next day,
having bled out from his injuries.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.490
When the platform comes, Goreng takes the
youngster with him.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.500
They make their way to the bottom of the hole,
where he sees Trimagasi again, who assures

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.060
him that 'the message requires no bearer.'

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.500
Goreng exits the platform and walks away from
Trimagasi, both turning to watch the girl

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.680
rise to the platform's top.
