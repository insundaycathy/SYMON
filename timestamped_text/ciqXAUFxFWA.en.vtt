00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.960
Hi guys, K-Movie Recapped here.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.049
Before we start, WARNING!

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:06.100
Spoilers Ahead!

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.920
Today, I’m going to explain a 2021 Thailand
Horror-Mystery movie called Ghost Lab.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.930
This movie tells the story of two best friends
who are trying to scientifically prove the

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.740
existence of ghosts.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.250
But once they crossed the line, they regret
their decision.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.170
Watch the movie until the end to see their
shocking experiment result.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.869
The story starts with 2 residency doctors,
who are long-time best friends, discussing

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.750
a recent patient case with 2 other nurses.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.440
The patient is badly burnt all over his body
and his head is nearly split in half.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.600
That patient died on the bed, wailing and
writhing in pain.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.680
Dr. Gla loves ghost stories and thinks that
case is interesting.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.410
But his best friend, Dr. Wee, doesn’t believe
in ghosts because it can’t be explained

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.410
scientifically.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.239
Dr. Wee’s mother has been admitted to the
same hospital he works in for the last 8 years.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.310
He becomes a doctor because of it.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.239
He always takes care of his mother after work,
which makes him doesn’t have any social

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.239
life.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.600
Dr. Gla is his only bestfriend.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.780
On the night, when they are on a night shift,
they discuss more about the possibility of

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.700
the existence of ghosts.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.930
Suddenly, they see something unexpected.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.580
It’s an unknown dark figure, like a person,
but with a burnt body.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.460
They realized that it is the ghost of the
patient they talked about earlier.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.160
Feeling curious, Dr. Gla moves toward it while
Dr. Wee records it on his phone.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.650
But suddenly, that figure is gone.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.490
The video Dr. Wee recorded doesn’t show
anything, the hospital CCTV also doesn't show

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.250
that unknown figure.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.140
On the next day, they talk about that bizarre
event.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.160
Dr. Wee still doesn’t believe it despite
after he saw it with his own eyes.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.850
It can’t be explained scientifically.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.150
So Dr. Gla suggests doing their own investigation.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.150
He asks Dr. Wee to follow him to a room at
the old building of the hospital.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.960
Inside, there are already some investigation
results that Dr. Gla did.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.900
It turns out that Dr. Gla has been doing an
investigation on ghosts.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.280
He has done various experiments at various
locations around the world to prove the existence

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.520
of ghosts.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.960
He told Dr. Wee that his first encounter with
a ghost was when he was still a child.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.680
Not long after his father died, he saw an
unknown figure that looked like his father.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.670
But after that, he hasn’t seen any other
ghost, until last night.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.710
He has a dream to publish a scientific journal
about the existence of ghosts.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.660
Dr. Wee looks interested in ghosts now and
decided to do the experiment together.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.560
After discussing for a while, they concluded
that since the camera can not capture the

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.310
image of ghosts, they need to make the other
see the ghost as well.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.650
But to do that, they need to find a method
to control the appearance of ghosts.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.730
After a week of trying to contact the same
ghost, they haven’t succeeded yet.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.710
They try to do an experiment on the old building
of the hospital and get evidence about poltergeist

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.690
ghosts, but the ghost doesn’t show itself
so it can’t be used as evidence.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.230
They then decide that they need to make some
kind of relationship with the ghost to make

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.630
them appear in front of them.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.350
Dr. Gla suggests making a relationship with
terminally ill patients, hoping that after

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.080
they die, they will show themselves to them.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.600
But Dr. Wee opposes the idea, telling him
that manipulating patients just for the sake

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.660
of the experiment is wrong.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.590
While debating, Dr. Wee suddenly gets a message
that his mother is in critical condition.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.880
Her doctor was able to resurrect her but now
she is brain dead.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.400
Dr. Wee decides to let his mother go and turns
off her life support.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.569
After her mother has passed away, he and Dr.
Gla spend the night in his mother's room,

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.620
hoping that she will contact them.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.790
In the middle of the night, his mother appears,
trying to tell him something.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.740
He couldn't hear what she was trying to say
but not long after that, she disappeared.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.840
Frustrated by the death of his mother and
the fact that their experiment is hitting

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.130
a wall, Dr. Wee suggests a crazy idea.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.460
He offers to kill himself so that he can turn
into a ghost.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.930
Any other ghost doesn’t have the will to
do the experiment, but if the ghost is him

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.400
they can do the experiment as much as they
like.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.780
Dr. Gla thinks that since he started the experiment,
if someone needs to die, it’s him.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.730
They agreed to flip a coin to see who will
have to die.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.920
It turns out to be Dr.Wee.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.430
They then prepared to execute the crazy idea.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.360
Dr. Gla hugs him for the last time and goes
outside the room.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.209
But in the end, Dr. Wee couldn’t pull the
trigger.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.440
He backs down at the last moment.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.260
Seeing that, Dr. Gla goes inside and tells
him not to worry.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.970
He then grabs the gun and shoots his own head.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.020
Some times have passed, but Dr. Wee has not
been contacted yet by the ghost of Dr. Gla.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.890
People start wondering why he killed himself.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.010
His mother and his girlfriend are devastated.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.490
Dr. Wee is frustrated and feels responsible
for the death of his friend.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.060
He decided to kill himself by jumping from
the top of the building.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.350
But just after he jumps, something is pulling
him back to safety.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.610
It’s the ghost of Dr. Gla.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.150
He feels relieved by it.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.669
It’s the first contact between him and the
ghost of Dr. Gla.

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.680
Dr. Wee tries to contact him again, but he
doesn’t respond.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.260
He then tries to do something crazy again.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.940
He tries to cut his finger, but Dr. Gla comes
to save him.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.669
He still can’t see him, but they can communicate
by using the laptop now.

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.389
Dr. Gla told him that he can’t see another
ghost and his visibility is limited.

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.949
He only can see and interact when he is emotionally
affected.

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.850
Not long after that, Dr. Gla disappears again.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.790
Dr. Wee then goes to Dr. Gla’s mother.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.169
When they talk about the death of Dr. Gla,
his mother and sister become sad.

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.680
This makes Dr. Gla emotionally affected and
can interact with them.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.640
Dr. Gla tells Dr. Wee that this is too painful
for him and disappears.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.540
Later, Dr. Wee tries to force him to show
up by cutting his finger again.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.650
But this time, Dr. Gla doesn’t show up and
his finger is amputated.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.370
Mia starts looking for the reason behind Dr.
Gla’s suicide.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.870
She takes the laptop from Dr. Wee.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.810
After realizing that the laptop is missing,
he goes to Mia’s apartment.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.389
There, Dr. Gla interacts with him again and
tells him to tell Mia about everything.

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.740
But Dr. Wee refuses, making Dr. Gla angry.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.340
The lift suddenly stops and falls down.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.949
It almost kills him.

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:08.910
On the next day, Dr. Wee invites Mia to their
experiment room.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.199
He told her that he will tell her everything.

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.410
But when she gets there, he drugs her and
tries to sexually assault her.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.479
He tries to provoke Dr. Gla further so that
he can appear in front of him.

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.290
As expected, Dr. Gla comes and throws Dr.
Wee across the room.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.240
Dr. Gla keeps attacking him and throws him
from the second floor.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.270
Even though his leg is broken.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.380
He still tries to record this evidence on
his phone.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.780
But Dr. Gla grabs his broken leg and twists
it, making him unconscious.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.340
When he wakes up, he realizes that he is in
the morgue.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.740
He lies beside Dr. Gla’s body.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.760
It suddenly moves and strangles him until
he dies.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.420
In the underworld, he meets Dr. Gla.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.639
He tells him to stop the experiment.

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:52.750
They have crossed the line too far.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.290
He doesn’t want Dr. Wee to do more crazy
things just for the experiment.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.780
Dr. Gla is already proud of what he has done
so far and tells him to live his life for

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.780
him.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.940
He agrees to stop the experiment.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.210
He then suddenly comes back to life.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.350
At the end of the story, he tells Mia about
the truth and apologizes for what he did to

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.750
her that night.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.330
She accepts it and says that she is happy
because when she was asleep that night she

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.360
met Dr. Gla in her dream.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.720
He looks happy and is holding a magazine with
his and Dr. Wee’s face on the cover.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.210
He then decides to delete all of the experiment
data and lives his life just like Dr. Gla

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.430
told him at the underworld.
