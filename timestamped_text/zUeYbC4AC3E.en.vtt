00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:14.000
Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here. Before&nbsp;
we start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.240
I’m going to recap a 2019 Korean Horror Mystery&nbsp;
movie, called Warning: Do Not Play. This movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.160
tells the story of a director who tries&nbsp;
to make a horror movie, out of her best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.560
friend’s misfortune. So, what happened to her best&nbsp;
friend? Is the film a success? Let’s find it out.&nbsp;

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.200
The movie starts with Mi-Jung, Who is&nbsp;
sleeping while watching in the theater.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.320
When she wakes up, the movie has finished&nbsp;
and the theater is empty. She is confused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.320
and tries to leave. However, the exit door has&nbsp;
been locked by the guards. Suddenly, there is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.440
strange noise similar to wet muddy feet walking.&nbsp;
She looks for the source of the noise and finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.240
a woman standing in the hallway. She curiously&nbsp;
takes a photo of the woman to look at her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.920
When she looks at the photo, she is surprised that&nbsp;
the woman is a ghost. She runs to the parking lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.760
to run away. While trying to turn on her car,&nbsp;
the lights in the lot go out. Out of nowhere,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.200
the ghost confronts and scares her. Turns out,&nbsp;
all of that was a nightmare and she wakes up.&nbsp;

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.560
Inspired by the nightmare, Mi-Jung tries to make&nbsp;
a script out of it. She is a horror film director.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.400
In the past weeks, she has been chased by her&nbsp;
submission deadline. In the office, her boss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.360
urges her to make a horror film with a theater&nbsp;
as a background. She begs for another two weeks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.480
to meet the deadline. Her boss accepts her plea&nbsp;
because she has won the best film award in Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.720
In a convenience store, Mi-Jung meets her best&nbsp;
friend, Kim, to talk about her deadline. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.280
asks Kim to look for content to save her&nbsp;
career. Kim tells her about a horror film.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.600
It is said that the film was recorded by a ghost.&nbsp;
Kim also explains that half of the audience left,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.280
and some died due to heart attacks. However, when&nbsp;
asked about the film creator, Kim cannot answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.640
her. But Kim knows that the film was used as a&nbsp;
university graduation project by the creator.&nbsp;

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.320
The next day, Mi-Jung visits the university to&nbsp;
find out more about the film and its creator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.840
She asks a Professor who's worked there for&nbsp;
10 years. She directly asks about the rumored&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.440
ghost-shot film. However, since she doesn’t&nbsp;
know the details of the film and the creator,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.880
the Professor cannot help her. Mi-Jung tries to&nbsp;
look for the film in the university’s library too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.320
but with no result. When the night comes,&nbsp;
Mi-Jung visits a local restaurant to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.600
There, she sees a group of students from the&nbsp;
film university. Without hesitation, she asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.480
them about the rumored film. She challenged them&nbsp;
to tell the scariest story of their university.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.680
The first guy says that there is an abandoned&nbsp;
theater near their university. It is rumored&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.320
that an actress named Soon-Mi was burned to death&nbsp;
there, leaving the theater haunted by the Ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.560
The second guy continues the story, he says that&nbsp;
there was a film made for graduation 10 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.840
During the screening, most of the audience passed&nbsp;
out and some died due to heart attacks. To add to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.040
the tension, the Director claimed that the film&nbsp;
isn’t theirs, but is made by a Ghost. The third&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.160
guy adds that the film was accepted to the Bucheon&nbsp;
Fantastic Film Festival, and is titled “Warning”&nbsp;

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.080
The next day, she meets a friend who works for&nbsp;
the Bucheon Fantastic Film Festival, to look for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.800
the rumored film’s footage. It is found that&nbsp;
the film was selected, but the screening was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.560
canceled. The footage is encrypted and put in the&nbsp;
archive. Her friend tries to ask his senior for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.840
approval to help Mi-Jung. While her friend is on&nbsp;
the phone, Mi-Jung tries to look at the footage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.560
she finds the password stuck on the desk&nbsp;
wall. Successfully unlocks the encryption,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.520
she copies the film to her phone and leaves.
Then, she arrives in her apartment and hurriedly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.880
plays the film. In the film, 3 characters enter&nbsp;
the abandoned theater, and two of them are being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.400
killed by the Ghost. Still feeling uninspired,&nbsp;
Mi-Jung finds the Director’s contact in the file.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.520
She tries to call the Director but fails,&nbsp;
so she sends an email to the Director.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.600
The next day, she visits Kim’s workplace&nbsp;
while waiting for the Director’s reply.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.920
Suddenly, a call from the Director comes in. The&nbsp;
Director asks her to delete the email, but she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.040
will only delete it after meeting the Director.&nbsp;
After ending the call, she hastily leaves for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.840
place of the meeting. An unorganized man&nbsp;
shows up that claims to be the Director.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.280
With shaky hands, he lit his cigarette. He has&nbsp;
some scars on his neck, similar to attempted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.280
suicide. The Director directly demands Mi-Jung&nbsp;
to delete her email. After deleting the post,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.360
The Director warns Mi-Jung to not search&nbsp;
about “Warning” any further and leaves.&nbsp;

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.960
Unsatisfied with the result, Mi-Jung&nbsp;
follows the Director to his house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.240
In the seemingly abandoned house, a lot of candles&nbsp;
are lit with crosses hanging on the ceiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.760
A lot of scary drawings are also attached to the&nbsp;
wall. She finds a chained cupboard and tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.200
open it. Luckily, it isn’t locked and the film’s&nbsp;
tape is in it. While trying to find clues, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.960
Director comes home so she hides under the bed.&nbsp;
The Director is driven mad by the Ghost. Mi-Jung&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.000
tries to leave the house but the Director captures&nbsp;
her. He tries to destroy the tape so that no more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.040
people can be hurt by the film. Still curious&nbsp;
about the tape, Mi-Jung grabs it and leaves.&nbsp;

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.560
In the apartment, Kim has successfully opened&nbsp;
the content of the tape. The tape contains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.480
documentation of the film-making. Successfully&nbsp;
helped Mi-Jung, Kim leaves the apartment. Mi-Jung&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.600
fell asleep while watching the film. When she&nbsp;
wakes up, she hears someone knock on her bathroom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.280
door. When she enters the bathroom, the light&nbsp;
turns on on its own. Finding that the bathroom is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.040
empty, she closes the door and the Ghost shows up.&nbsp;
Later, Mi-Jung tries to make a script but suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.960
the lights go out. Her bathroom door opens and she&nbsp;
finds a knife on the tub. She hears a sound in her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.160
living room and when she looks back, the knife&nbsp;
has disappeared. Afraid of what’s happening, she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.200
tries to leave but the door is locked. She hears a&nbsp;
sound again in her room and finds the Ghost there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.760
She takes a photo with the flashlight on,&nbsp;
and the Ghost leaves due to the flashlight.&nbsp;

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.040
In the next clip, 3 persons and 1 cameraman&nbsp;
enter the abandoned theater to shoot the Ghost.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.480
The cameraman finds a shadow on the wall and&nbsp;
talks to himself. He says that he wants to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.600
the world’s scariest film and run away. Turns&nbsp;
out, the cameraman is actually the Director.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.640
Mi-Jung replays the clip and finds that there is&nbsp;
a photo of a girl similar to the Ghost that has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.520
haunted her and the Director. Mi-Jung immediately&nbsp;
goes to the theater to check out her findings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.360
Kim comes to the apartment and watches the clip&nbsp;
too. In the clip, the 3 persons that accompany the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.400
Director are setting up the lighting. Suddenly,&nbsp;
the lighting dims and the Director is hiding at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.840
the corner of the room. He hides there as if he&nbsp;
knows about the next incident. One of them screams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.800
and disappears with a blood trail on the floor.
Meanwhile, Mi-Jung enters the theater and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.160
Ghost gives her a vision about what happened.&nbsp;
Firstly, Mi-Jung sees that the Director hastily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.280
runs out of the building after seeing the crew&nbsp;
kidnapped by the ghost. She follows a blood trail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.160
that leads to a basement. There, she finds the&nbsp;
crew banging his head to a wall while begging for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.280
help. After killing him, the Ghost also kills&nbsp;
his friend by forcing a bat down his throat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.880
Surprised by the events, Mi-Jung runs to the&nbsp;
upper level to find another vision. A girl is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.560
watching how Soon-Mi, the Ghost, died. Soon-Mi was&nbsp;
filming for a clip with a rope around her neck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.200
However, an accident occurred and she was&nbsp;
left hanging in the burning building to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.920
Then, the Ghost suffocates the girl&nbsp;
to death. While exiting the theater,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.720
Mi-Jung passed by the Director. The Director&nbsp;
thinks that Mi-Jung is the Ghost’s manifestation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.320
So he grabs her and drags her to the basement.
In the basement, the Director admits that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.880
knew all along about the killings. Even though&nbsp;
he knew that they would be killed, the Director&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.360
didn’t do anything to help them. The Director&nbsp;
still retrieved the tape and made a name for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.720
himself out of their death. Even in the screening&nbsp;
theater, he was the only one left in the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.760
watching with a big smile. Due to the guilt,&nbsp;
the Director tries to burn himself and Mi-Jung&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.040
to death. But his attempt is thwarted by the&nbsp;
Ghost. The Ghost strangles the Director to death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.560
Mi-Jung frees herself out of the bondage, and once&nbsp;
more records the incident for her upcoming film.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.320
Then, she tries to leave the building. But when&nbsp;
she opens the door, she is transported back into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.680
the theater. The Ghost drags her back into the&nbsp;
inner room and confronts her. After escaping,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.880
she tries to exit the building once more but is&nbsp;
teleported back in again. The Ghost haunts her and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.880
she tries to defend herself with a knife she finds&nbsp;
on the theater floor. Suddenly, a wire appears and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:36.240
strangles Mi-Jung. Knowing that flashlight is the&nbsp;
Ghost’s weakness, she takes a selfie and releases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.600
herself. She is attacked by the Ghost once more.&nbsp;
She grabs a beacon and lights it to burn the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.880
Ghost. While the Ghost is burned to death, Mi-Jung&nbsp;
once more grabs her phone to record the incident.&nbsp;

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.240
A few days have passed, Mi-Jung is seen&nbsp;
working on her film in her apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.360
The room is full of candles and crosses hanging&nbsp;
on the ceiling. Her boss calls her and says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:03.120
the script gets approval to be produced. Mi-Jung&nbsp;
becomes a popular director due to her new film:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.400
Warning. The film tells about the incidents that&nbsp;
she has experienced so far, starting from her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.280
dream, to the Ghost in the theater. It is also&nbsp;
revealed that Kim actually died when trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.080
save Mi-Jung. Kim hurriedly went to the haunted&nbsp;
theater after watching the clip but was trapped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:23.600
in the burning building. At the end of the movie,&nbsp;
Mi-Jung smiles because of her successful film,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.880
regardless of her best friend’s death
