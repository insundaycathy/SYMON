00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.440
Hi guys, Korean Movie Recapped here.&nbsp;
Before we start, I have a small news to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.480
announce. I would like to introduce myself&nbsp;
as the new narrator for our future videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.880
I hope that you can enjoy my narration&nbsp;
as much as the previous videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.640
Thank you, and enjoy the video!
Today, I’m going to recap a 2012&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.560
Korean Heist Comedy movie, called The Thieves.&nbsp;
This movie tells the story of 2 gangs of thieves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.000
who join forces under a leader, to steal a&nbsp;
diamond from a notorious arms dealer. Since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.320
they have an unpleasant past with one another,&nbsp;
their plan is full of trickeries and betrayal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.000
So, how will they steal the diamond? Who will&nbsp;
escape with the prize? Let’s find it out.&nbsp;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.320
The movie starts with Conwoman and Walker,&nbsp;
disguised as mother and daughter, who visit a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.720
gallery to meet the Owner. Walker has been dating&nbsp;
the Owner for months to gain information. Conwoman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.720
asks to look around the facility under the&nbsp;
pretense of assessing her soon-to-be son-in-law.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.280
The Owner agrees and invites her to his private&nbsp;
fault. After they left, Walker readies herself for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.800
the action. Outside of the building, Popeye and&nbsp;
the Operator have set up wire for the Walker to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.960
break in. Walker climbs the building and breaks&nbsp;
in through the vents. In the exhibition room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.440
Conwoman records the beeping sound of the lock&nbsp;
with a decoder and hides it inside the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.840
She also sticks chewing gum to the laser sensor&nbsp;
to block the detector. Walker gets inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.680
room and looks for the decoder. She quickly enters&nbsp;
the vault, swaps the art with a fake, and leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.840
When they get into the room, Walker is already&nbsp;
there to greet them back. After some time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.840
the alarm goes off due to the gum. Owner rushes to&nbsp;
the vault to find the gum and the fake art piece.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.520
He asks the guards to check Conwoman’s&nbsp;
belongings but nothing is found inside. While&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.400
they are leaving the building, the stolen art is&nbsp;
hauled with a wire and Popeye carries it away.&nbsp;

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.760
In the hideout, they sell the art to a Black&nbsp;
Marketer. Suddenly, the police arrive to check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.680
the place. Popeye greets them while the others&nbsp;
hide. The police come looking for the stolen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.680
art and suspects Popeye since he has been&nbsp;
convicted for a similar case in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.440
Afraid of the police, they decide to flee to&nbsp;
China, to join a heist led by a Korean master&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.200
thief named Park. They also invite a convicted&nbsp;
Safecracker who was recently released on parole.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.280
Turns out, Popeye and Safecracker used to work&nbsp;
for Park but they despise him for deceiving them.&nbsp;

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.400
In Hong Kong, they meet the Chinese&nbsp;
who will also join the team.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.000
Conman is the leader of the gang, and the other&nbsp;
three are Flirty, Smuggler, and a safecracker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.560
named Julie. Since they don’t trust the other&nbsp;
team, they diss the others with their own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.160
language, hoping that no one will understand&nbsp;
them. Flirty teases Walker over and over.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.560
Seeing this, Operator who fell in&nbsp;
love with Walker fends him away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.200
Suddenly, Park enters the room to brief them. Park&nbsp;
reveals the target to be the Tear of the Sun, a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.080
valuable diamond in the possession of Tiffany, the&nbsp;
mistress of a powerful crime lord named Wei Hong.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.520
The plan is to steal the diamond while Tiffany&nbsp;
is visiting a casino in Macau, and to sell it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.560
back to Wei Hong, a risky venture seeing that Wei&nbsp;
Hong is known for murdering whoever offends him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.160
Hesitant at first, everyone agrees after finding&nbsp;
out that the diamond is worth $20 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.360
Popeye reveals to Park that Conwoman&nbsp;
and Safecracker will also join the team.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.080
Park agrees for Conwoman to join, but rejects&nbsp;
Safecracker due to their past. The next day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.000
they meet the Informant who is also Tiffany’s step&nbsp;
sister. She says that the diamond is kept inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.600
one of the two vaults in a hotel suite. Thermal&nbsp;
imaging cameras cover every corner of the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.040
Moreover, magnetic field which is synced to&nbsp;
Tiffany’s heart pacemaker secures the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.120
so no one can get inside but her. Before they&nbsp;
leave, Julie puts a bug inside Park’s lighter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.560
Turns out, Julie is actually undercover&nbsp;
police hoping to arrest Wei Hong through Park.&nbsp;

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.560
As Park is resting, he recollects&nbsp;
his past. 4 years ago, Park, Popeye,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.080
and Safecracker worked together in a gold heist.&nbsp;
Park and Safecracker loved each other back then.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.280
When Park was escaping, his wire snapped. Trying&nbsp;
to save her lover, Safecracker ran back inside and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.000
exposed herself to the CCTV. Turns out, Park ran&nbsp;
away with the gold, leaving the rest empty handed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.360
Suddenly, Safecracker enters the room to&nbsp;
negotiate, and Park lets her join the heist.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.760
She also steals the diamond’s buyer list and&nbsp;
shares it with Popeye. They have purchased a fake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.520
one to swap it after the heist. Meanwhile outside,&nbsp;
Walker has been eavesdropping about their scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.560
Having set the trap, Popeye recalls the incident&nbsp;
from 4 years ago. Turns out, Popeye was the one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.080
who cut Park’s wire. He wanted to frame him but&nbsp;
was surprised to know that the gold was with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.720
Having lost her lover, Safecracker fell into&nbsp;
drinking and decided to turn herself in. Popeye&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.880
used the chance to make out with her back then.
The next day, the team prepares their plan. Conman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.960
and Conwoman will act as a Japanese couple&nbsp;
to keep Tiffany accompanied in the casino.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.880
Smuggler will also bet the same amount against&nbsp;
them to break-even. Flirty will be a player who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.160
surveys the premises. Popeye will be the eye&nbsp;
on Tiffany while she is outside the casino.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.840
At night, Walker and Operator visit a bar to get&nbsp;
the master key from the casino’s General Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.640
However, the GM is actually a gay&nbsp;
and flirts with Operator instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.560
They swap their role and copy the key’s data&nbsp;
to make a duplicate. In order to smuggle the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.480
gun brought by Smuggler, they bribe an Old Man&nbsp;
who works as a cleaning service. In the hideout,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.240
Safecracker and Julie are practicing their skills.&nbsp;
They have different styles, Safecracker usually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.560
uses drills and hooks to open the vault,&nbsp;
while Julie trusts her ears and fingers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.440
Meanwhile, Conman shares with the Chinese&nbsp;
team that he doesn’t trust Park and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.760
plan is bound to fail, so they plan to steal&nbsp;
Tiffany’s betting cash during the action.&nbsp;

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.200
In the morning, they set everything up in&nbsp;
place. Park and Popeye made a commotion to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.080
divert the CCTV from Operator, while he set&nbsp;
up the wire equipment for Walker to break in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:31.040
Due to the commotion, Park is blacklisted from the&nbsp;
casino. Meanwhile, Safecracker also picks up the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.800
fake diamond as she planned with Popeye. They plan&nbsp;
to run away using a boat but Popeye only booked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.720
for 1 person instead of 2. In the guest suite,&nbsp;
Conman and Conwoman spend their time together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.080
Conman reveals that he and his partner stole&nbsp;
the Tear of the Sun and sold it to Wei Hong in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.280
Busan. His partner was killed and he only&nbsp;
received $1 thousand from the purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:00.080
Conwoman comforts him and they fall in love. After&nbsp;
they make out, Walker comes in to get into action.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.560
The couple get back to the table to stall Tiffany.&nbsp;
While Walker is climbing to sneak into Tiffany’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.360
suite, Popeye, Julie, and Safecracker wear&nbsp;
special coats to avoid the thermal detector.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.840
Flirty and Smuggler hijack the surveillance&nbsp;
room and turn off the main power.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.920
Walker uses metal pieces to connect the magnetic&nbsp;
field on Tiffany’s door, so that the alarm doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.720
go off. Julie and Safecracker are tasked to open&nbsp;
the vaults. However, they don’t find the diamond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.880
inside any of the vaults. On the casino table,&nbsp;
Conman brings out his gun to steal Tiffany’s cash.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.680
Outside, the police are ready to capture them with&nbsp;
tips from Julie. Suddenly, the Informant delivers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.960
Park’s lighter which was bugged by Julie. After&nbsp;
knowing that they are fooled, the police rush&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.400
into the building to seize them. Turns out, the&nbsp;
diamond is kept inside another vault and Park,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.760
who disguises himself as the Old Man, opens&nbsp;
it and flees. The Informant who claimed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.920
be Tiffany’s step sister is a con artist hired by&nbsp;
Park. Suddenly, the team members receive a message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.280
from Park saying that he will be meeting with Wei&nbsp;
Hong alone. After realizing that it is a trap,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:15.120
they scatter and run off on their own. Walker is&nbsp;
suspected due to her inability to speak Chinese.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Out of his love for Walker, Operator sacrifices&nbsp;
himself and is captured. Conman stays true to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.240
his love and escapes with Conwoman. However,&nbsp;
they get into an accident and die. The rest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.080
of the members are also caught. Popeye, Flirty,&nbsp;
and Safecracker are transported to the prison.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.560
Safecracker uses her lock picking&nbsp;
skill to unlock the others’ handcuffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.360
During the panic, her tools are thrown&nbsp;
away and one of her cuffs is still locked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:50.080
The car fell into the sea leaving her trapped&nbsp;
inside the drowning car. Fortunately, Park comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:56.400
and saves her. She wakes up on a poolside with&nbsp;
a mysterious key from Park. She meets with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:02.080
other surviving members and they plan to steal the&nbsp;
diamond from Park. Meanwhile, the police are on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:08.080
Park’s tail, waiting to arrest him and Wei Hong.&nbsp;
They hear that Park is meeting Wei Hong in Busan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.120
in 3 days. They also ask the Korean&nbsp;
police to help them with the effort.&nbsp;

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.640
The team arrives in Hong Kong to get&nbsp;
Park’s whereabouts from the Informant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.240
They find out that she is living in a&nbsp;
hotel in Busan and go there right away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.680
After being threatened, she spills Park’s&nbsp;
whereabouts to them. Meanwhile, Park comes to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:33.200
agreed place to meet Wei Hong while the police&nbsp;
watch every move he makes. On the other hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.840
Flirty enters the building and jams the elevator,&nbsp;
while the rest of the team disguise themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:43.280
as the elevator service. They break into Park’s&nbsp;
room while Informant keeps Park away from them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.920
Safecracker gets a hint from one of Park’s calls&nbsp;
and finds the diamond in another room. Informant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.640
asks Park about the incident 4 years ago and&nbsp;
Park admits that he didn’t plan on running away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.560
He broke his legs and crawled to the hideout, but&nbsp;
found Safecracker and Popeye making out instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.000
He also reveals that Popeye alone betrayed him&nbsp;
because Popeye loves Safecracker and wants to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.600
take her away. After that, Park realizes that&nbsp;
Informant is bugged and comes back to his room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.200
Safecracker who hears all of Park’s confession,&nbsp;
falls in love with him once more and leaves the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:23.600
diamond. Then, Walker breaks into the room and&nbsp;
finds the diamond. She swaps it with the fake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:29.040
one and leaves. Meanwhile, Wei Hong’s man&nbsp;
and Park make contact and go to his room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.040
While the diamond is being appraised, Park reveals&nbsp;
to Wei Hong that he stole the diamond for revenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.400
Turns out, Conman’s partner who was killed&nbsp;
by Wei Hong is actually Park’s father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.400
The diamond is identified as fake and Park&nbsp;
escapes with the money. The SWAT team also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:52.560
joins the brawl to arrest Wei Hong, and a gunfight&nbsp;
breaks out. Meanwhile, Walker tosses the diamond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:58.240
to Popeye and escapes too. Park falls on top&nbsp;
of the elevator and Popeye tries to kill him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.920
Park fights back and wins. However,&nbsp;
he pities him and doesn’t retaliate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:10.720
He escapes in a police car to a ferry pier. Popeye&nbsp;
tries to run away with the diamond alone but is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.960
chased by Flirty. During the chase, the diamond&nbsp;
falls and breaks after a motorcycle runs over it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.920
Turns out, Walker has prepared another fake&nbsp;
version and swaps it with the real one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.440
She uses her charm on the police and&nbsp;
escapes the building easily. In the pier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:33.520
Park meets Safecracker and comes to her. However,&nbsp;
he realizes that Wei Hong is nearby and flees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:40.480
Julie comes in and tries to arrest Safecracker.&nbsp;
Seeing this, Park reveals himself to lure Wei&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.200
Hong out. Julie quickly chases Wei&nbsp;
Hong instead and shoots him twice.&nbsp;

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.880
In the end, Safecracker finds the stolen&nbsp;
gold from 4 years ago inside her car’s trunk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.240
using the mysterious key from Park. Walker&nbsp;
is in Hong Kong, trying to find a buyer for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:01.920
the diamond. Safecracker invites her to meet a&nbsp;
potential buyer who is actually the gallery Owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.560
Walker flees and drowns herself in the pool.&nbsp;
Park calls Safecracker and says that he is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:14.480
in Hong Kong to steal an item for one last time.&nbsp;
Safecracker finds out that Walker’s hotel bill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:20.320
has been paid by an old man, indicating that Park&nbsp;
is there for the real Tear of the Sun. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.480
Walker is still holding her breath, without&nbsp;
knowing that her prize is being taken away.&nbsp;
