Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:07.770
Today, I’m going to show a 2018 drama, mystery,
and sci-fi film called, “Freaks.”

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.240
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.680
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.509
Seven-year-old Chloe Lewis has lived her entire
life hiding in an abandoned house in the suburbs

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.450
with her father, Henry.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.869
She is forbidden to go outside by her father
in fear of the bad men who killed her mother.

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.900
Despite the isolation and living on canned
goods, Chloe grows up to be a capable and

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.740
independent child.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.970
Every day, Henry drills the escape routine
to her, in case something happens to him while

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.460
he’s on a food run.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.859
Henry made a deal with their neighbors, Steven
Reed, that if anything happens to him, the

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.020
Reeds will be paid a steady amount of cash
as long as they take care of his daughter.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.570
Chloe memorizes the Reeds’ names and information,
as well as little facts about them, ensuring

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.469
that she is just like any other seven-year-old
girl.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.429
As they settle in for the night, Chloe hears
a sound coming from the closet.

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.510
She opens it and sees a woman bound in chains
and screams at it to go away.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.109
The numerous drawings of the woman surrounding
her reveal that Chloe’s been seeing this

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.369
haunting figure for a while now.

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:06.640
Henry comes into the room and tells her that
she’s just imagined it.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.710
He agrees to accompany her but refuses to
sleep, telling her that too much time passes

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.359
outside when he sleeps and he can only protect
her if he’s awake.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:18.860
The next morning, Chloe wakes up to the sound
of an ice cream truck coming from the street.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.229
She looks out the window and sees the Reeds’
daughter, Harper, buying ice cream.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.719
She whispers in her direction, commanding
her to get her ice cream too, and soon enough,

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.329
Harper arrives at their door bringing her
a chocolate ice cream cone.

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.649
Chloe opens the door and just as she’s about
to take the food, Henry stops her.

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.509
Henry then reprimands Chloe and asks her if
she’s been going outside.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.150
Chloe denies this but he doesn’t believe
her, locking her in the closet as punishment.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.880
The next morning, Henry agrees to buy Chloe
ice cream as an apology, but things don’t

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.069
go as planned.

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.319
Henry returns much earlier with the groceries
and a wound on the side of his stomach.

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.499
He tells her that the plan has changed.

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:59.049
They have to stay in hiding for longer now.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.509
Before he can say anything else, Henry passes
out on the kitchen floor.

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.539
A force field erupts from the house and is
sucked back into his body.

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.590
It turns out that Henry has been using a time
bubble around their house, slowing the time

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.510
down in the outside world while keeping the
normal pace inside their bubble.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.340
Even though Chloe is seven years old, it’s
only been three months since her birth in

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.520
the outside world, meaning they’ve been
in the time bubble for seven years.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.450
Using this as a chance to escape, Chloe takes
a one hundred dollar bill and goes outside

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.760
the house for the first time in her life.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.980
She goes straight to the ice cream truck and
meets the owner, Alan, also known as Mr. Snowcone.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.310
Alan bribes her with an ice cream cone and
lets her into the truck.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.340
Together they travel to the park, with Chloe
looking out the window and seeing the outside

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.209
world for the first time.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.569
She also sees a billboard about people called
the “Abnormals,” whose eyes bleed.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.239
She tells Alan that her father’s eyes bleed
too.

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.470
Alan takes Chloe to the park and pushes her
on the swings.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.400
He talks to Chloe, asking her if she’s done
anything special or has anything weird ever

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.720
happened when she’s angry or upset.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.170
He then tells Chloe about her mom, who was
a very special person who had gifts.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.680
As he tries to retell his adventure with her
mother, a police officer interrupts them.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.840
The officer grows suspicious of Alan and asks
him to step away from the girl.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.260
Alan tells him that she’s his granddaughter.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.959
The officer then asks Alan to show his eyes.

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.590
Alan turns to Chloe and tells him that the
officer is one of the bad guys who killed

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.769
her mother.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.120
Chloe becomes upset and starts screaming at
the man to go away.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.730
Surprisingly, the officer puts down his gun,
as if in a trance, and then walks away.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.829
As they drive home, Alan shows her a picture
of her mother and lets her borrow it.

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.140
He hands Chloe crushed sleeping pills and
tells her that the next time she hears his

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.069
truck, she should put it on her dad’s food.

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.909
When Henry wakes up, Chloe accuses him of
lying to her and not telling her that she’s

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.750
special and then yells at him to get out of
her room.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.810
Later that night, Chloe wakes up to sounds
coming from her closet again.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.900
She opens it and sees the apparition of the
chained woman, but this time, she recognizes

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.450
her to be the one in the picture, her mother.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.230
The woman lashes out at her, thinking that
she’s a cruel hallucination done by her

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.540
torturers as Chloe runs off.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.010
She goes to her father and sees him asleep
in front of the television.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.000
She learns more about these Abnormals or as
humans called them, Freaks.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.460
Freaks are beings who look just like humans
but have special powers causing their eyes

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.490
to bleed out when they use them.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.750
They are being hunted down by the government
to be used as weapons.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.670
Later that night, Chloe sees the woman for
the third time and manages to convince her

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.080
that she’s real.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.350
Her mother recognizes her and asks her how
she got in there.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.660
Chloe tells her that she’s in her closet.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.380
Feeling confused, her mother realizes that
Chloe is communicating with her through her

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.510
mind and appearing in her cell as an apparition.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.880
The next morning, Chloe tells Henry about
her mother but he doesn’t believe her.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.160
Seeing no other way to escape, she tries to
drug her father.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.540
Henry realizes what she’s doing and chases
her to the door.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.330
She commands him to sleep and he slips down
to the floor as blood begins to drip from

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.490
her eyes.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.031
She meets with Alan in his truck and he tells
her about his plan.

00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:01.660
There’s no use for people like them to hide
anymore.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.010
They travel to a diner and meet with one of
the government agents called Agent Ray.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.290
Alan poses as a priest who raised Chloe, under
the alias Eleanor Reed, as his own, and asks

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.000
Agent Ray to take them to Madoc Mountain,
a place where they relocated the Freaks.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.890
Chloe goes off script and runs to the diner’s
kitchen.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.940
To save them, Alan blinds one of the dishwashers
and sends him outside.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.980
The agents shoot the guy, thinking that he’s
an Abnormal.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.470
Alan carries Chloe and they turn invisible,
barely escaping with their lives.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.160
Back in their truck, Chloe finds out that
her mother is still alive and Alan was trying

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.870
to find a way into the mountain where her
mother is being held captive.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.320
She demands Alan take her home so that she
can live with the Reeds and he tells her to

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.830
get out of her head.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.030
On their way home, Henry appears in the middle
of the road.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.110
Chloe gets out and is almost hit by a car
but Henry activates his force field just in

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.630
time to save her.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.830
Deciding it’s time, Henry takes Chloe to
the Reeds to fulfill their deal.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.980
Steven agrees and introduces them to Nancy
and Harper.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.130
Nancy soon realizes that Chloe is a Freak
and backs out of the deal saying that she

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.070
didn’t know they were supposed to be taking
in an Abnormal.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.800
Henry and Chloe return back to the house where
Alan is waiting for them, bound to a chair.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.350
Henry is shocked to see her eyes bleeding
and realizing that she’s an Abnormal like

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.380
him too.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.540
Afraid to trust her, Henry puts her in the
closet.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.770
She meets her mother again but she’s taken
away by thugs.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.440
As Henry seals her in the closet, she screams
at her father and tells him that they have

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.010
to save her mother.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.700
She becomes too upset and almost kills him
as she puts him in a trance with a drill into

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.740
his neck.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.360
Alan and Henry argue downstairs as Chloe peeks
into the window and sees that Nancy has already

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.200
reported them to the A.D.F.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.310
She projects the apparition in real-time into
the room and the men are shocked at the realization

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.420
of the extent of Chloe’s powers.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.520
They watch in awe as they watch Chloe force
the officer to stab Nancy in the eye and then

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.850
use his own gun to shoot himself.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.300
This alerts the other officers and they shoot
Nancy, thinking that she’s an Abnormal.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.180
Henry is horrified as he searches for Alan,
who has now taken Chloe and turned invisible.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.110
Chloe escapes his grasp and runs to her room,
finding an apparition of her mother, Mary,

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.830
strapped into a metal bed.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.490
Henry and Alan appear and see Mary alive.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.550
As the doctor tries to kill her, Chloe takes
over his body and proceeds to kill himself.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.010
She then takes control of the officer and
starts freeing her mother.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.050
The doorbell interrupts their reunion and
Henry sees that it’s Agent Ray.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:27.540
He lets her in, trying to pose as a real estate
developer as Chloe tries to help Mary escape.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:32.010
Agent Ray interrogates Henry, but she sees
through his bluff and asks him to sit down.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.640
She threatens him by bombing the house if
he doesn’t follow his instructions as Alan

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.250
sneaks behind her with a gun to her head.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.260
Agent Ray spots this and takes the gun, accidentally
firing it at Henry.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.240
He manages to activate his field but he is
too drained and the bullet pierces through

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.540
his stomach.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.870
Meanwhile, as Chloe tries to help Mary get
out, an officer picks up on their plan and

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.800
Chloe starts attacking him.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.740
This triggers the alarm and Mary runs to escape.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.900
Back at the house, Agent Ray finds Chloe in
the bedroom and fires the gun at her.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.720
The bullet doesn’t hit her but kills Alan
instead.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.700
This upsets Chloe and she forces Agent Ray’s
gun to aim back at her head and then kills

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.810
herself.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.660
Henry knows they’re running out of time,
so he pretends to hold the agent hostage and

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.990
creates a field around the house, killing
down three officers in the process.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.140
Chloe runs to her father and passes out, exhausted
from using her powers.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.300
Mary is now trapped before the final exit
with officers closing in on her.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.550
She calls out to Chloe once again, waking
her up.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.320
Chloe screams and uses her powers as much
as she can to take over the minds of every

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.380
officer at Madoc Mountain, setting the last
piece for her mother’s release.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:41.130
Mary runs outside, finally free, and takes
flight, destroying every agent within her

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.130
radius.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:47.069
A missile has now locked itself into the house
and Henry uses his powers one last time, trying

00:08:47.069 --> 00:08:48.750
to slow down the missile.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.829
He carries Chloe’s body outside as the house
is blown to bits behind him.

00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:57.050
When Chloe wakes up, Henry bids her goodbye
and tells her how much he loves her.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.199
She cries over his dead body as she hears
the gunshots.

00:09:00.199 --> 00:09:03.199
The shooting stops and she is rescued by her
mother.

00:09:03.199 --> 00:09:07.089
Chloe and Mary reunite for the first time
and Mary promises her to hide and protect

00:09:07.089 --> 00:09:08.440
her forever.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.910
Chloe tells her that they don’t need to
hide anymore and they can live wherever they

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:12.910
want.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:26.720
Encouraged by her daughter’s confidence,
Mary wraps her in her arms and they take flight.
