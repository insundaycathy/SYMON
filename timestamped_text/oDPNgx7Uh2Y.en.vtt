saying she is too old for goodnight kisses

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.240
tim goes to the attic where he comes across&nbsp;

tim laments to wizzy that he feels&nbsp;
tabitha is drifting away from him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.520

baby court for an important mission however&nbsp;
tina wants ted to come for help but tim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.840
refuses to get him involved tina then spots&nbsp;
a doll that records voices and gets an idea

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.200
in the morning ted arrives at tim's home in a&nbsp;
chopper under the impression that tabitha fell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.160
off precious and injured herself but that&nbsp;
was just tina forging a voicemail from tim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.000
after the rest of the family fawns over ted with&nbsp;
tabitha giving him a kiss hello to tim's dismay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.680
tim calls ted into the kitchen for a private&nbsp;
discussion as tim tries to explain things about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.520
tina to ted they only argue because ted doesn't&nbsp;
remember anything about his time as a boss baby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.520
tina then breaks out the magic pacifiers&nbsp;
and takes her dad and uncle on a trip

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.680
the three are sent to baby corp where all&nbsp;
the memories come flooding back to ted he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.520
even has a gold statue dedicated to him as he is&nbsp;
believed to have single-handedly saved the company&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.400
tina takes the brothers to a room where they learn&nbsp;
about the mission baby corp suspects something is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.040
going down at the acorn center with the school's&nbsp;
founder dr erwin armstrong apparently planning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.840
something involving the children at the school tim&nbsp;
knows that tabitha may be involved and realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.240
this is why she is overworking herself and&nbsp;
missing out on her childhood when the three return&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.720
home tina gives tim and ted a formula that will&nbsp;
transform them back to their younger selves for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.160
48 hours so that they can pose as students at the&nbsp;
acorn center and plant bugs in armstrong's office&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.960
the brothers argue again as they begin to age&nbsp;
to themselves from the last movie when carol&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.680
and tabitha come back from an errand tim has to&nbsp;
cover up their transformation by saying he and ted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.960
are going on a brotherly bonding trip but carol&nbsp;
reminds tim to be back for his parents arrival&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.400
as well as for tabitha's&nbsp;
winter pageant performance

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.360
that night tim has a nightmare that he is on&nbsp;
trial for being a bad father with everyone in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.040
his family including his parents ted senior and&nbsp;
janus criticizing him while tabitha slips away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.240
from him when he wakes up he realizes he and ted&nbsp;
are late for their first day at the acorn center&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.880
they slip into their old sailor outfits but&nbsp;
miss the bus they end up having to ride precious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.800
through the streets where they cause a lot of&nbsp;
damage like destroying a christmas tree all while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.720
carol is taking the girls to school and tina can&nbsp;
see her dad and uncle nearby involved in the chaos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.040
the brothers make it to the school the two set up&nbsp;
a time for when they will infiltrate armstrong's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.680
office and plant the bug with ted having to go&nbsp;
with the babies and tim ends up in tabitha's class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.920
posing under the name marco's lightspeed a&nbsp;
projection of armstrong teaches tabitha's class&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.960
where she is the top student but faces competition&nbsp;
from snotty kid nathan and his cronie megan when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.000
the time comes for the brothers to act ted manages&nbsp;
to escape the class using glue to climb the walls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.680
but tim gets put in time out inside&nbsp;
the box which terrifies the other kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.320
ted makes it to armstrong's office and is&nbsp;
surprised to see that armstrong was expecting him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.120
it turns out that armstrong is a super smart&nbsp;
baby posing as an adult using a robotic suit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.680
he saw himself as too smart to be tied down&nbsp;
by his parents so he abandoned them and went&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.120
off to establish the acorn center to breed&nbsp;
young geniuses like himself and he thinks ted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.840
would make a viable partner in his conquests&nbsp;
after ted has a run-in with some baby ninjas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.880
armstrong gives ted a tour of the facility and&nbsp;
discusses a plan in which he will eliminate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.720
need for parents once and for all with a new&nbsp;
app that he is having the children work on

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.600
after the school tim convinces an unsuspecting&nbsp;
carol to let him ride with the girls back home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.280
for supper this annoys tina at her dad for&nbsp;
potentially compromising the mission at home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.240
tim tries to hide old childhood pics of him so&nbsp;
they won't recognize him in his current child form&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.520
tim talks to tabitha about her relationship&nbsp;
with her dad and she expresses that she is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.840
embarrassed by him but that she feels she can't&nbsp;
live up to the same creative standards that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.280
said ted senior and janice show up and immediately&nbsp;
notice that marcos looks like tim they also bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.480
up tim time when tabitha worries he won't show up&nbsp;
for the pageant which they explain is tim going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.680
off in his own world to get away from reality the&nbsp;
elder templetons also mention how much closer tim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.120
and ted used to be which the hidden ted overhears&nbsp;
and realized how he missed their bond as brothers

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.600
tim helps tabitha practice for the pageant but&nbsp;
tabitha is too nervous and sings off-key tim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.960
inspires her to see things from his perspective&nbsp;
doing a performance of if you want to sing out and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.520
then tim shows her how to fulfill her potential&nbsp;
he then leaves but sneaks back into the house

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:20.080
tim later rejoins ted and tina where ted says that&nbsp;
baby corp will continue to handle the mission so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.520
the brothers can return to normal and carry on&nbsp;
with their lives tina seeing that the two haven't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.240
reconnected the way she was hoping pretends that&nbsp;
baby corp is calling and saying they won't help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.840
which prompts tim and ted&nbsp;
to finish the job themselves

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.280
the plan is set to take effect during the winter&nbsp;
pageant ted watches with armstrong while tim's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.240
family waits for him ted realizes that armstrong's&nbsp;
app will turn the parents into zombies since they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.840
are recording the pageant using it and his plan&nbsp;
will take effect ted tries to shut down the show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.760
but tim tries to stop him from ruining tabitha's&nbsp;
performance the brothers argue again bringing up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.080
how they stopped being there for each other as&nbsp;
they got older armstrong catches them and throws&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.680
them in the box tabitha goes up and performs but&nbsp;
because the app has already hypnotized the parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.240
nobody really paid attention so she runs away&nbsp;
crying armstrong and his babies then rise from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:20.000
the stage on a giant cake with a countdown taking&nbsp;
effect for when the app will take effect worldwide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.240
tim and ted apologize to each other for&nbsp;
their behavior and they are saved when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.840
they both whistle for precious to break&nbsp;
them out before they drown inside the box

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.720
meanwhile tina talks to tabitha for the first&nbsp;
time and tells her that all the stories their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.360
dad told them were all true the sisters band&nbsp;
together to help their dad and uncle tim and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.040
ted ride precious to the giant acorn&nbsp;
that is releasing the signal to the app&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.880
while tabitha and tina hijack one of armstrong's&nbsp;
bodysuits as the zombie parents begin to close&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:00.640
in on them when pulling the fire alarm to&nbsp;
short-circuit the acorn it doesn't work so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.440
tabitha and tina duke it out with armstrong until&nbsp;
they see candy and soda falling out from the suit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.800
they quickly put diet coke and mentos together&nbsp;
to create an explosion that floods the acorn and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.720
stops the countdown but then tabitha falls but&nbsp;
tim and ted return to their adult forms in time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.400
to rescue her and tabitha gives her dad a thank&nbsp;
you kiss on the cheek a defeated armstrong then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:28.400
watches the templeton family reunite lovingly with&nbsp;
carol and the elder templetons finding tim and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.040
ted with the girls tina then tells the brothers&nbsp;
that her plan all along was to have them reunite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:40.720
with taking down armstrong just being a bonus&nbsp;
sometime later on christmas day the whole family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.520
is together at tim's house except for ted&nbsp;
tim goes outside to find a pile of presents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.720
plus a giant golden statue from ted of tim&nbsp;
when he was a child holding a mug that says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:56.800
world's best dad ted then surprises tim with a&nbsp;
snowball fight which tabitha and tina join in on

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.280
