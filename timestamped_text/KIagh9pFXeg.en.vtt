00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.923
Hi, Israq21 here,

00:00:01.923 --> 00:00:04.678
Today, I will recap a movie called Future World,

00:00:04.678 --> 00:00:10.235
Future World is a 2018 American direct-to-video science fiction action Western film.

00:00:10.235 --> 00:00:13.358
This film tells about post apocalyptic world,

00:00:13.358 --> 00:00:17.317
the robots that have been made are extinct and most people live in the wasteland.

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:22.911
One day, a beautiful android robot with blue green eyes is found that is already rare.

00:00:22.911 --> 00:00:24.672
So what can this robot do?

00:00:24.672 --> 00:00:27.447
Batten Down the Hatches because we are going in hard.

00:00:27.447 --> 00:00:32.201
This is a spoiler content video, Enjoy the video and let’s start the story.

00:00:35.846 --> 00:00:45.876
At the film's opening, a voice-over girl explains that mankind's technological breakthroughs in the development of artificial intelligence and robotics eventually lead to a global war.

00:00:45.876 --> 00:00:53.243
Afterward, the remnants of humanity struggle to survive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland while the surviving machines remain hidden.

00:00:53.243 --> 00:00:56.778
And the movie of Future World is, starting.

00:00:56.778 --> 00:00:59.111
The film starts in a wasteland,

00:00:59.111 --> 00:01:05.452
there is a group of robbers who are about to attack a settlement, these robbers are led by a warlord,

00:01:05.452 --> 00:01:12.139
Then the robbers surround the tribal chief, The Warlord manages to kill the tribal chief in the settlement.

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:18.320
It turns out that the settlement contains a high-tech laboratory that used to have sophisticated robots,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.367
so that's why The Warlord comes to that place.

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:27.376
After looking in many places, finally The Warlord finds a beautiful android robot named Ash,

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:34.099
The Warlord activates the robot, her eyes look so beautiful,
one is blue and the other is green.

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:37.286
This robot is controlled using a handheld  remote,

00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:41.170
She will do anything if The Warlord speaks in front of the remote.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.391
Then the scene moves to a very fertile place, this place is called Oasis.

00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:49.507
There is seen a young boy who is called The Prince.

00:01:49.507 --> 00:01:54.245
The Prince is very worried because his mother or the queen is seriously ill.

00:01:54.245 --> 00:01:56.821
He receives information that to cure his mother,

00:01:56.821 --> 00:02:00.304
he has to go to a place called Paradise Beach.

00:02:00.304 --> 00:02:06.400
Because that's the only place that has a lot of rare medicines, one of which is medicine for his mother.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.775
The prince goes to the wasteland with two of his friends to look for a cure which is in Paradise Beach,

00:02:11.775 --> 00:02:14.594
because the journey they are about to take is very far,

00:02:14.594 --> 00:02:17.661
plus the Prince does not know for sure where the beach is

00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:20.431
First They stop at a place called The Love Town,

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:25.806
they want to make sure, Is the paradise beach is real or just an imaginary place?

00:02:25.806 --> 00:02:32.622
Inside the bar, they are looking for information, he asks a waitress about the location of Paradise beach.

00:02:32.622 --> 00:02:37.564
After That, a Raider comes who realizes that the Prince and his friends are new people.

00:02:37.564 --> 00:02:40.268
The Raider tries to stab the prince

00:02:40.268 --> 00:02:44.184
Rico, the Prince’s Friend, pulls out a handgun immediately.

00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:47.228
The Raider does not believe that it is a real handgun,

00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:51.495
because in the present, handguns and bullets are rare items in the wasteland.

00:02:51.495 --> 00:02:55.737
Because he doesn't want to believe it, Suddenly the Raider is shot by Rico.

00:02:55.737 --> 00:02:59.696
from that incident,the owner of the place who is called Big Daddy,

00:02:59.696 --> 00:03:01.776
tries to negotiate with the prince.

00:03:01.776 --> 00:03:05.220
He offers to tell The prince where the paradise beach is.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.688
Then He takes the prince and his friends to the back of the place,

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:12.049
He said that the prince will be met with a girl who knows where the beach is,

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.288
but the condition is that the prince must meet her alone.

00:03:15.288 --> 00:03:18.405
It turns out that the girl is a robot named ash,

00:03:18.405 --> 00:03:20.568
the robot also teases the prince,

00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:24.473
the prince is tempted until finally the robot takes the prince's handgun,

00:03:24.473 --> 00:03:27.586
She shoots Prince’s friends outside.

00:03:27.586 --> 00:03:34.797
The prince is held at handgun point and brought to the Warlord, it turns out that this is all a Warlord's trap.

00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:39.177
The prince is tortured and forced to talk about where he got these rare items,

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:44.139
because the prince is dying, he speaks honestly that he came from a place called Oasis,

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.546
there they have fertile land and objects that are rare in the wasteland.

00:03:47.546 --> 00:03:51.212
Now the Warlord makes the prince his prisoner.

00:03:51.212 --> 00:03:55.034
After that, they force the prince to show him where he came from.

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:59.852
On the way, very unexpectedly, Ash saves the prince,

00:03:59.852 --> 00:04:04.124
she beats the driver and runs away from the Warlord's minions.

00:04:04.124 --> 00:04:07.465
Warlord and his minions are chasing Ash and the prince.

00:04:07.465 --> 00:04:10.406
Until finally they manage to survive.

00:04:10.406 --> 00:04:15.847
The reason Ash helps the prince is that when she looked into the prince's eyes while teasing him that time,

00:04:15.847 --> 00:04:19.344
she saw the prince's eyes that were so honest and loving.

00:04:19.344 --> 00:04:25.429
It turns out that Ash is damaged during the escape, leaking fluid from a gash in her abdomen,

00:04:25.429 --> 00:04:33.416
she is very weak now. But she and the Prince continue their journey until they eventually manage to find shelter that was once a church.

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:38.834
Ash is curious about what it is like to have a soul, so she asks him to be taught how to pray,

00:04:38.834 --> 00:04:45.187
but when Ash wants to pray, suddenly she passes out when her systems shut down because she is badly damaged.

00:04:45.187 --> 00:04:50.173
The next day, the Prince fashions a stretcher to make it easier for him to carry Ash

00:04:50.173 --> 00:04:57.116
Then the prince continues his journey while dragging Ash's body through the wasteland without food and drink until he eventually finds the ocean.

00:04:57.116 --> 00:05:00.610
he also equates the ocean with the postcard he had,

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.517
it turns out that the place he dreamed of is real.

00:05:03.517 --> 00:05:11.716
But unfortunately, There his hopes are shattered when they are taken prisoner again by another group of wastelanders residing in the ruins of the seaside resort.

00:05:11.716 --> 00:05:15.645
When he wakes up, the Prince meets Mila, the Drug Lord,

00:05:15.645 --> 00:05:17.837
who offers him the cure but at a cost,

00:05:17.837 --> 00:05:23.167
She also explains that now the prince is in the city of Drugs or commonly known as Paradise beach.

00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:25.902
Mila takes the prince to his medicine room,

00:05:25.902 --> 00:05:29.165
where she explains that the medicine he wanted is very rare,

00:05:29.165 --> 00:05:31.990
the prince is given a condition that he must join them.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.737
She injects him with a syringe and he passes out after experiencing hallucinations.

00:05:38.684 --> 00:05:45.173
On the other hand, Ash is taken to Lei, a mechanic and a prisoner of the Drug Lord, who will repair Ash.

00:05:45.173 --> 00:05:50.549
After repairing and injecting energy into Ash's robot, finally She reactivates Ash.

00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:53.901
Ash is very grateful to Lei for saving her.

00:05:53.901 --> 00:05:59.061
Afterward, Ash is taken before the Drug Lord who fawns over how valuable she is.

00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:02.726
Mila also teases Ash so she can help her as much as possible.

00:06:02.726 --> 00:06:06.413
Ash is just silent listening to Mila's temptation.

00:06:06.413 --> 00:06:11.988
The next day, when the Prince wakes up, he is already in a battle arena.

00:06:11.988 --> 00:06:20.166
Mila forces the Prince into a gladiatorial battle with one of her minions saying that if he survives he gets the medicine in her minion's stomach and goes free,

00:06:20.166 --> 00:06:23.732
but if the prince loses, he will die.

00:06:23.732 --> 00:06:27.825
The battle starts, the prince who is still half conscious is beaten up.

00:06:27.825 --> 00:06:32.175
To make the fight more exciting, Mila throws a machete at the Prince.

00:06:32.175 --> 00:06:39.914
The prince tries to beat his opponent with the machete, and Fortunately the prince manages to stab and kill his opponent.

00:06:39.914 --> 00:06:43.982
The prince cuts open the man's stomach and takes the medicine for his mother.

00:06:43.982 --> 00:06:50.426
Afterward, The Prince is free now, He can go back to Oasis so the prince invites Ash to go home together,

00:06:50.426 --> 00:06:54.642
but Mila forbids Ash to go, She says that Ash is staying with her.

00:06:54.642 --> 00:07:00.393
The prince begs Ash to come with him, but Ash just says, Leave!

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:09.183
in the evening, Lei manages to escape by cutting the chains of her prisoners.

00:07:09.183 --> 00:07:14.366
Lei goes to free Ash who is chained up in a cell but her attempt to saw the chains proves futile.

00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:17.170
She feels hopeless and Ash tries to comfort her.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.905
Ash accepts her fate to remain a prisoner

00:07:19.905 --> 00:07:24.528
Lei says that she really wants to be like Ash because She has no feelings and no worries.

00:07:24.528 --> 00:07:28.392
Lei asks Ash, Could you feel this?

00:07:28.392 --> 00:07:32.911
then Lei kisses Ash and asks again, Could you feel the kiss?

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:35.954
Lei apologizes for kissing Ash.

00:07:35.954 --> 00:07:40.103
but apparently Ash returns the kiss and says that she liked this feeling.

00:07:40.103 --> 00:07:43.250
So Ash decides to repay Lei for her kindness,

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.073
And she is licking her bottom cave,

00:07:45.073 --> 00:07:48.505
They are making love until they feel satisfied.

00:07:48.505 --> 00:07:52.151
The next morning, Mila discovers Ash and Lei together,

00:07:52.151 --> 00:08:00.149
in a jealous rage, She orders Lei to wipe Ash's memory of the event and reprogram her into a loving companion for herself instead.

00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:07.224
Outside, the Prince returns and tries to sneak back into the resort just as the Warlord arrives and attacks the complex.

00:08:07.224 --> 00:08:10.825
Then Mila injects over-power painkillers into her body.

00:08:10.825 --> 00:08:14.555
In a drug-addled fury, Mila faces off with the Warlord,

00:08:14.555 --> 00:08:20.670
she does not feel anything, Until the warlord ends up killing her with the Prince's handgun.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:26.618
During the distraction, the Prince tries to help Lei and Ash escape, but the warlord sees him,

00:08:26.618 --> 00:08:31.994
When Ash wants to fight against Warlord, Suddenly she is controlled using the handheld remote,

00:08:31.994 --> 00:08:34.821
so they are all captured.

00:08:34.821 --> 00:08:39.162
Outside, The Warlord tries to retake control of Ash with the remote,

00:08:39.162 --> 00:08:40.924
ordering her to kill her friends,

00:08:40.924 --> 00:08:46.628
When ash is about to kill them, they keep saying it's not you, it's not you, it's not you.

00:08:46.628 --> 00:08:50.395
suddenly Ash's eyes changes and Ash kills his men instead.

00:08:50.395 --> 00:08:57.181
She stabs the Warlord with a machete and then escapes with Lei and the Prince on a pair of the Raider's motorbikes.

00:08:57.181 --> 00:09:00.832
The Warlord is still alive and gives chase,

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:05.792
On the way, Ash tells the Prince to stop.

00:09:05.792 --> 00:09:09.928
She turns around alone and throws her wand at Warlord's motorbike,

00:09:09.928 --> 00:09:11.288
Warlord falls,

00:09:11.288 --> 00:09:12.357
Nice.

00:09:12.357 --> 00:09:14.337
Ash also walks like a model,

00:09:14.337 --> 00:09:15.936
then punches the Warlord,

00:09:15.936 --> 00:09:18.633
wow, it looks like fun to be punched again.

00:09:27.216 --> 00:09:29.670
Finally she kills him in one last stand.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.465
All his minions are very sad to see their warlord die.

00:09:33.465 --> 00:09:40.399
The three eventually make it back to Oasis where Ash tells the Prince she's leaving to find others like herself that are out there somewhere.

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:44.126
Then they hug, and Ash says, you gave me a soul.

00:09:44.126 --> 00:09:46.668
Now Ash and Lei leave the prince

00:09:46.668 --> 00:09:48.247
They go to the wasteland.

00:09:48.247 --> 00:09:51.290
The Prince returns to his mother and gives her the medicine.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.242
His mother recovers and now they are happy.

00:09:54.242 --> 00:09:56.187
In a mid credit post scene,

00:09:56.187 --> 00:10:00.007
Ash returns to Love Town and frees the s_x slaves,

00:10:00.007 --> 00:10:02.757
who get revenge on Big Daddy by attacking him.

00:10:02.757 --> 00:10:05.544
