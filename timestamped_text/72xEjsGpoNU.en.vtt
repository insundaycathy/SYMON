00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.010
Years after the events of the series, Jim
Phelps and his team, the Impossible Missions

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:14.750
Force (IMF), attempt to retrieve the CIA non-official
cover list from the American embassy in Prague.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.960
Their mission fails: Phelps is shot, his wife
Claire dies in a car bombing, and the rest

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.270
of the team except Ethan Hunt are eliminated
by unknown assassins.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.949
Meeting with IMF director Eugene Kittridge,
Hunt reveals his awareness of a second IMF

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.140
team sent to monitor them, and learns the
job was a setup to lure out a mole within

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.890
IMF, who is believed to be working with an
arms dealer known as "Max" as part of "Job

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.890
314."

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.250
As Hunt is the only member left, Kittridge
suspects him of being the mole, and Hunt flees.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:55.850
Returning to the Prague safe house, Hunt realizes
"Job 314" refers to Bible verse Job 3:14,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.690
"Job" being the mole's code name.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.170
Claire arrives at the safe house, explaining
she escaped the bomb after Phelps aborted

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.510
the mission.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.920
Hunt arranges a meeting with Max, and warns
her that the list she possesses has a tracking

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.030
device.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.980
He promises to deliver the real list in return
for $10 million and Job's identity.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.620
Hunt, Max, and her agents escape just as a
CIA team arrives.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:30.710
Hunt recruits two disavowed IMF agents: computer
expert Luther Stickell and pilot Franz Krieger.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.880
They infiltrate CIA headquarters in Langley,
steal the real list, and flee to London.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.850
Kittridge, detecting the theft, has Hunt's
mother and uncle falsely arrested for drug

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.240
trafficking.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.910
He provides media coverage of the arrest,
forcing Hunt to contact him from Liverpool

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.980
Street Station.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.130
Hunt allows the CIA to trace him to London
before hanging up, but is surprised to find

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.640
Phelps nearby.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.070
Phelps recounts surviving the shooting, naming
Kittridge as the mole.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.250
Hunt realizes Phelps is the mole, having discovered
that Phelps stole a Gideons Bible from a Chicago

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.369
hotel.

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.560
He also suspects Krieger as the one who killed
the other IMF members on the Prague job, but

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.560
is unsure whether Claire was involved.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.230
Hunt arranges with Max to exchange the list
aboard the TGV train to Paris the next day.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.810
On the train, Hunt remotely directs Max to
the list.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.910
Max verifies it and gives Hunt the code to
a briefcase containing the payment along with

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.510
Job in the baggage car.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.420
Ethan calls Claire and tells her to meet him
there.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.000
Meanwhile, Stickell uses a jamming device
to prevent Max from uploading the data to

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.630
her servers.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.770
Claire reaches the baggage car, finds Phelps
and tells him Ethan will arrive shortly.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.380
She questions the idea of killing Ethan, since
they will need a fall guy for the money, when

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.709
Phelps reveals himself to be Ethan in disguise,
exposing her as a co-conspirator.

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.100
When the real Phelps arrives and takes the
money at gunpoint, Hunt dons a pair of video

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.630
glasses that relays Phelps to Kittridge, blowing
Phelps' cover as the mole.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.240
Phelps threatens to kill Ethan, but shoots
Claire instead when she intervenes.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.930
He climbs to the roof of the train, where
Krieger is waiting with a helicopter and a

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:21.930
tether.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.290
Hunt connects the tether to the train itself,
forcing the helicopter into the Channel Tunnel

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.460
after the train.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.250
Hunt places an explosive chewing gum on the
helicopter windshield, killing Krieger and

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.990
Phelps.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:42.850
Kittridge arrests Max and recovers the list,
then reinstates Hunt and Stickell as IMF agents,

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.510
but Hunt resigns.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.000
As he flies home, a flight attendant approaches
him and asks, through a coded phrase, if he

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.220
is ready to take on a new mission, just as
she asked Phelps at the beginning.
