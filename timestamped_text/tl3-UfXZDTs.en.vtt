00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.480
On October 29, 2018, Michael Myers, who&nbsp;
has been institutionalized at Smith's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.400
Grove Psychiatric Hospital for 40 years&nbsp;
following his killing spree in Haddonfield,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.080
is being prepared for transfer&nbsp;
to a maximum-security prison.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.520
True crime podcasters Aaron Korey and Dana Haines&nbsp;
visit the hospital, and, during their encounter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.160
Aaron displays the mask that Michael wore in 1978&nbsp;
to him, to no effect. The following day, as he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.760
being transferred, Michael purposely crashes&nbsp;
the bus, kills a father and son for their car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.320
and returns to Haddonfield.
In Haddonfield, Laurie Strode is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.600
still living in fear of Michael; she is drinking&nbsp;
heavily, rarely leaving her fortified house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.080
and alienating herself from her daughter&nbsp;
Karen, whom the state took away from her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.680
at age 12. The only person she keeps in&nbsp;
contact with is Karen's daughter, Allyson.&nbsp;

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.240
On the morning of October 31, Michael sees Aaron&nbsp;
and Dana visiting his sister Judith's grave. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.120
follows them to a gas station where he kills them&nbsp;
both, as well as a mechanic for his coveralls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.440
before recovering his old mask from&nbsp;
Aaron's car. Deputy Frank Hawkins,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.680
who arrested Michael in 1978, tries to convince&nbsp;
Sheriff Barker about Michael's danger after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.960
learning that he has escaped. Laurie also learns&nbsp;
of Michael's escape and attempts to warn Karen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.720
but Karen dismisses her concerns,&nbsp;
urging Laurie to move on with her life.&nbsp;

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.240
Later that night, Allyson finds her boyfriend&nbsp;
Cameron cheating on her at a costume party and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.080
leaves with his friend Oscar. Meanwhile, while&nbsp;
babysitting a boy named Julian, Allyson's best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.160
friend Vicky and her boyfriend Dave are attacked&nbsp;
by Michael. Vicky sacrifices herself to protect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.160
Julian. Deputy Hawkins and Laurie overhear&nbsp;
the incident on the radio and go over to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.680
house. Laurie sees Michael, coming face-to-face&nbsp;
with him for the first time in 40 years. Laurie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.520
shoots Michael in the shoulder before he flees.
Dr. Ranbir Sartain, Michael's psychiatrist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.120
persuades Sheriff Barker to help in the hunt for&nbsp;
Michael. Meanwhile, on the walk home from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.000
party, Michael finds and kills Oscar, but Hawkins&nbsp;
and Sartain arrive just in time to rescue Allyson.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.280
Hawkins then tries to kill Michael, but Sartain –&nbsp;
who has become obsessed with Michael's enigmatic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.320
motivations – attacks and leaves Hawkins for&nbsp;
dead. It is revealed that he orchestrated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.600
Michael's escape to study him "in the wild."&nbsp;
However, Michael kills Sartain and Allyson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.040
flees from the scene. Michael then ambushes and&nbsp;
kills two police officers arriving at the scene.&nbsp;

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.480
Michael drives the dead officers' car to Laurie's&nbsp;
house, where she and Karen have met with Allyson.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.200
When Laurie's son-in-law Ray goes outside to&nbsp;
greet who he believes are the two officers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.000
Michael strangles him to death. Laurie manages&nbsp;
to get Karen to safety before she engages in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.640
showdown with Michael. Laurie severely injures&nbsp;
Michael, but he stabs her in the abdomen and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.360
pushes her over a balcony. When Michael goes&nbsp;
to check Laurie's body, he finds it missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.560
Allyson arrives and calls out for her grandmother,&nbsp;
luring Michael and allowing Karen to shoot him in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.680
the jaw. Laurie suddenly reappears and attacks&nbsp;
Michael, trapping him inside the safe room with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.440
Karen and Allyson's help. The trio sets the house&nbsp;
ablaze, and Laurie says goodbye to Michael before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.640
she begins to faint and lets her daughter and&nbsp;
granddaughter quickly hitchhike a passerby vehicle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.080
to take her to the hospital. A final shot of the&nbsp;
burning basement is shown, with Michael nowhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:44.240
in sight. In a post-credits scene, Michael's&nbsp;
breathing is heard, indicating that he survived.
