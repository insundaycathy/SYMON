00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.040
Welcome to Slash Forward. If there were anything&nbsp;
better than going on holiday in Mexico with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.720
group of your best buds, it would probably&nbsp;
be spending a portion of your time there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.080
exploring the rich history of the region’s&nbsp;
long-forgotten ancient cultures. Of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.560
if in so doing you happened to find&nbsp;
yourselves forcefully relegated to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.040
the top of a mysterious pyramid and, over&nbsp;
time, found your skin to be crawling with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.960
little wormlike larvae that have to be cut&nbsp;
out from deep below the surface of your skin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.760
that might tip the balance toward making the&nbsp;
trip not worthwhile. We’ll get a more concrete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.720
understanding of what all this entails as we&nbsp;
take a tour through the 2008 film The Ruins.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.120
Set in a remote rainforest, a group of college&nbsp;
friends accompany a recent acquaintance to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.160
secluded archaeological site to round out their&nbsp;
trip. But, by disturbing the grounds, a community&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.120
of locals force them to the top of the pyramid&nbsp;
and keep them there for unknown reasons. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.600
group then finds themselves struggling to survive&nbsp;
under threat of being killed for trying to leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.840
insufficient rations to sustain them atop&nbsp;
the structure for more than a day or so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.440
and Jeff’s insatiable desire to prove the value&nbsp;
of his first year medical school education through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.480
constantly trying to cure his friends of what&nbsp;
ails them by cutting off pieces of their bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.800
Be sure to drop a like or a comment on the video&nbsp;
if you happen to have an annoying friend like that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.840
and, while you’re here, check out some of my other&nbsp;
videos. They go down so easy. Let’s get to it.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.960
We open on a woman in a cave, or perhaps some&nbsp;
ruins, crying out for help. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.480
no one ever comes, and then she’s&nbsp;
dragged off into the darkness.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.800
Then we take a sweeping view of a rainforest&nbsp;
before zooming in on a gang of nubile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.680
young friends hanging out and playing Gin -&nbsp;
as was so popular with college students back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.320
in 2008. Jeff and Stacy finish up their&nbsp;
game as Eric returns with margaritas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.240
But all of this is put on hold when Amy&nbsp;
realizes she is missing one of her most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.640
important earrings. Observed from across&nbsp;
the way, this is the perfect opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.080
for a save by Mathias - a swarthy gentleman&nbsp;
of Germanic descent. He produces the precious,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.120
missing trinket and is rewarded with a drink,&nbsp;
which leads naturally to casual conversation.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.320
Mathias is alone today, because his bro went to&nbsp;
visit his girlfriend - an archeologist working at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.040
an excavation site. They were looking to sitesee&nbsp;
a local treasure that’s more off-the-beaten path,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.960
so he invites them to accompany him tomorrow&nbsp;
if they’re interested. After a brief survey,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.000
they unanimously agree to partake in what the&nbsp;
locals would likely consider a desecration.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.200
That night the gang prepares for&nbsp;
their excursion by getting blasted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.000
Jeff is first back to the room, leaving Mathias&nbsp;
to pick up the slack left by Jeff’s unwillingness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.320
to dance the night away. Pretty soon,&nbsp;
Eric and Stacy are peeling Amy off him.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.360
The next morning Jeff finishes his run to find&nbsp;
Mathias and Dmitri copying the map so Dmitri’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.640
cabal of Hellenes can catch up with them once they&nbsp;
sleep off their drink. Jeff then runs up to gather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.040
the troops. Feeling sick and generally sullen&nbsp;
about the idea that Jeff will be leaving for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.560
med school, Amy takes some convincing to get her&nbsp;
going. But Jeff is a persuasive man and natural&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.360
leader, so soon we find them hopping off the&nbsp;
bus at the last civilized stop on their journey.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.080
They find a cab, but the taximan warns them&nbsp;
to steer clear of that particular pyramid,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.400
but what do the locals ever really know about&nbsp;
the various sites and attractions surrounding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.800
their town? And soon they’re heading down the old&nbsp;
dusty trail. They get dropped off at Heinrich’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.040
Jeep where it is officially remote enough to&nbsp;
preclude the possibility of using cell phones.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.680
For all except Mathias, who has a specialty&nbsp;
phone specifically for this purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.600
Once that’s established, they begin the&nbsp;
eleven mile hike into the dense rainforest.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.320
In no time at all they reach the last major&nbsp;
landmark before arriving at their destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.560
They are observed from afar by some curious&nbsp;
children. While they attempt to communicate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.320
with them, Mathias finds the trail, which had been&nbsp;
intentionally covered over with some large fronds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.280
The girls do wonder about this, and consider&nbsp;
whether it is wise to carry on, but their second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.080
thoughts are overruled and the group continues&nbsp;
under the watchful eye of a young Mayan girl.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.400
And see? They find the site very quickly, making&nbsp;
this simple trip completely worthwhile in every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.520
possible way. They have only just begun to ponder&nbsp;
which stairs they will climb first when a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.960
serious man busts through the treeline, dismounts&nbsp;
and shouts at them in an unknown language.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.480
Jeff is an expert at dealing with people, so he&nbsp;
offers up some dinero. This offering is declined,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.160
and then some more horsemen emerge. They&nbsp;
try to impart that they’re simply there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.440
to meet up with their bro, but&nbsp;
this also doesn’t do the trick.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.040
As they try to pierce the language&nbsp;
barrier and find a common understanding,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.280
Amy snaps some choice photos to try to capture the&nbsp;
essence of this confusing moment. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.520
it only adds to it as they are worked into&nbsp;
a frenzy. Thinking they desire the camera,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.000
Dmitri attempts to help deliver it to them,&nbsp;
but instead absorbs an arrow and a headshot.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.400
It then becomes unclear whether their attackers&nbsp;
are warning them away or forcing them up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.040
but when even more armed reinforcements arrive&nbsp;
they elect to go up. At least that way there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.760
is still a chance that they might find Heinrich.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, both tents are empty and, even with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.640
such a clear line of sight, they don’t get any&nbsp;
better signals up here. Also, Mathias’s phone was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.880
confiscated by the man. They check to see if there&nbsp;
is any safe way down, but they find themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.920
surrounded. Then, Heinrich is sighted - covered&nbsp;
head to toe by an invasive weed with an arrow in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.720
his chest. The group is dumbfounded by the sudden,&nbsp;
drastic, negative change in their situation.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.680
Jeff watches and notes that many locals seem&nbsp;
to be gathering outside and setting up a camp.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.400
Meanwhile, Eric wonders what happened to the&nbsp;
archaeologist while they also notice that Mathias&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.720
seems to be having an allergic reaction of some&nbsp;
type from touching the plants. Despite the poor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.440
outlook, Jeff remains optimistic that either&nbsp;
Dmitri’s friends will soon be there to help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.120
or the hotel will notify someone when&nbsp;
they fail to check out the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.320
His assertiveness here makes&nbsp;
him the leader by default.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.200
But then, they hear a ringing. Mathias points out&nbsp;
that Heinrich had a fancy phone similar to his,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.760
and it appears to be getting a signal even deep&nbsp;
within the stony structure. So they scramble to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.880
try to safely descend into the pit before it&nbsp;
goes off. Unfortunately, despite their intent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.600
they experience the opposite outcome. They have&nbsp;
to push past their initial shock when signs of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.000
life begin to emanate from the dark. Jeff sets to&nbsp;
checking the remainder of the rope for structural&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.560
integrity so they can lower one of the girls into&nbsp;
the pit. I mean, he would go himself, but he’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.200
manning the crank. If he left, who would crank&nbsp;
then? Stacy volunteers and is soon descending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.440
deep into the heart of the pyramid. They reach the&nbsp;
end of the rope, but she’s not yet at the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.080
However, with Mathias begging for help, she&nbsp;
goes ahead and hops down and in her white pants!

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.120
She works to get some light down there, so she can&nbsp;
more easily extricate the glass currently making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.080
love to her knee. Meanwhile, up top, they work&nbsp;
on figuring out how to make some extra rope while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.520
down under Mathias reveals that he can’t feel his&nbsp;
legs. Stacy calls up this news and also reports&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.640
that it smells like shit down there, which Mathias&nbsp;
tries to determine if he should take as an insult.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.680
Jeff immediately springs into action despite Amy’s&nbsp;
protests about the dangers of moving someone with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.480
a broken spine. Desperate for an alternative she&nbsp;
runs down to ask for help, but finds the language&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.680
barrier to still be a hindrance. Upon reaching&nbsp;
peak frustration she throws some weed at them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.960
hitting a young boy. Their instant reaction&nbsp;
gives some hint as to what their major deal is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.000
you all have.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.720
As the sun goes down, Amy is lowered with a&nbsp;
makeshift backboard via an elongated rope.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.960
They are still a few feet shy of rock bottom,&nbsp;
but Stacy insists on getting this wrapped up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.920
so they can get the hell out of there. So&nbsp;
they very carefully prepare to lift him, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.200
ultimately provide an extreme&nbsp;
chiropractic manipulation.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.120
Now that he’s up, Jeff recommends not moving&nbsp;
him again, and also thinks they should look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.200
for some Aspirin. In doing so, he finds&nbsp;
Dmitri’s plane ticket for the next day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.080
providing additional encouragement&nbsp;
that his countrymen should be there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.720
tomorrow to try to find him&nbsp;
after he misses his flight.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.320
They then bed down for the night, taking&nbsp;
shifts to keep an eye on the locals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.160
Sometimes from very close up.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.720
The next morning Jeff chooses violence - showing&nbsp;
them vines what he thinks about them. Then Stacy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.360
wakes up feeling an unusual tingle in her leg.&nbsp;
This time, it ain’t Eric. When the leaves fail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.160
to brush off she realizes that the vines&nbsp;
didn’t just creep on her, they crept up in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.960
her. Eric gently pulls it out as Mathias also&nbsp;
senses something wrong with his legs. When they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.600
go to check them out, a similar, horrifying&nbsp;
problem is revealed. As they process this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.000
Eric recognizes that they have spores growing on&nbsp;
their clothes as well, but then they’re distracted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.080
again when a ringing sound reminds them that while&nbsp;
they were in the pit, they never got the phone.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.480
Jeff makes quick preparations to send the ladies&nbsp;
in and search it out as it may represent their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.520
only chance for salvation. Once down there, they&nbsp;
light up and venture into the weeds - driven on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.320
by the constant ringing of the phone. They are&nbsp;
startled by a shuffling noise from the thick bush,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.360
which probs wasn’t her. And, while this&nbsp;
unknown victim does have a fairly modern phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.080
it isn’t the one that’s currently ringing. So&nbsp;
they continue on, until Amy comes to discover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.400
that the sound is actually emanating from&nbsp;
the undulating stamen of the flowers.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.400
The vines then make their move, and the attack&nbsp;
forces them to climb back through the brush as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.240
the vine system attempts to hinder their&nbsp;
escape. They’re cranked up just in time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.280
and relay the unfortunate phone news. Amy’s&nbsp;
sole focus is now on getting off that pyramid,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.200
as they recognize that they’re being forced&nbsp;
into an involuntary quarantine. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.160
Jeff remains insistent that the safest option&nbsp;
is to continue to wait, assured by his privilege&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.720
that someone must already be searching out&nbsp;
the missing gringos. So, they hang in there.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.280
With all future goals and activities now moot,&nbsp;
they narrow in on surviving while rationing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.320
conserving their resources. Stacy mentions that&nbsp;
she still has the strange feeling of the vine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.040
being inside her probing around. But Jeff is&nbsp;
focused on the danger of sepsis developing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:32.160
in Mathias’s dirty leg wounds. Intoxicated by&nbsp;
the allure of becoming the talk of med school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.880
he is encouraged to perform a double field&nbsp;
amputation of Mattie’s legs under the auspices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.680
of saving his life. There is some reluctance from&nbsp;
the group, but Mathias gives his full consent.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.000
Jeff gives a complimentary bite&nbsp;
leather, mostly for ceremonial purposes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.800
as he insists that Mathias wouldn’t have any&nbsp;
feeling in his legs. Despite his assuredness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.080
when he brings the stone down to break the bone,&nbsp;
it certainly seems like he’s feeling everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.640
Jeff sets to work amidst the screams,&nbsp;
and sloppily, but with drive and purpose,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:06.320
disconnects his lower extremities. Once done,&nbsp;
any sense of satisfaction is quickly forgotten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.920
in the face of the horror presented by&nbsp;
the vines coming to take their meal.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.720
That night Jeff goes back down to work some things&nbsp;
out with their captors. While up top Eric provides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.440
a little comfort to Amy, resulting in Stacy&nbsp;
insisting that she heard them making love in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.840
moonlight - and right in front of her, which is&nbsp;
so disrespectful. While they’re all distracted by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.400
this, the vines take advantage of the opportunity&nbsp;
and finish off Mathias. Jeff pulls them out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.880
but it proves to be too late. Stacy then gets&nbsp;
real dramatic about having some vine in her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.160
and they’re all taken aback when the&nbsp;
flowers begin to mimic her in concert

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.480
The next morning the survivors observe as the&nbsp;
tribesmen salt the soil around the pyramid to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.640
keep plant growth contained. Jeff also&nbsp;
notes how creatures of various types&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.200
seem to know to stay away from the area,&nbsp;
indicating it must be very old. Then Eric&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.920
calls everyone over for an update on Stace,&nbsp;
who does, in fact, have some of that stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.720
creeping around inside her. This gives Jeff&nbsp;
a prime opportunity to get to cutting again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.600
He goes in deep and really does a job of&nbsp;
cleansing her body. I mean, she’s gotta&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.560
feel at least a little better, right? She must,&nbsp;
because she wants to keep cutting everything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.360
even beyond Jeff’s threshold, so you know it’s&nbsp;
bad. He insists they stop, but she’s definitely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.840
showing additional signs of infection, which&nbsp;
they confirm for her by refusing eye contact.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.160
This prompts Eric to declare his intent to make&nbsp;
a break for it that evening, no matter what.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.800
But later on, during nap time, Stacy goes out&nbsp;
on her own to look for her friend, knife, while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.960
under the influence of the flowers. The others&nbsp;
wake up and emerge from the tent to find her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:40.000
engaging in a significant mutilation event with&nbsp;
the knife, which she also employs against all who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.600
try to stop her. After Eric bleeds out internally,&nbsp;
the vines again come to clean up the mess that’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:51.280
left over. Stacy begs to be put out of her misery&nbsp;
and, having not yet taken the Hippocratic Oath,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.600
Jeff obliges as the locals listen to the&nbsp;
hell unfolding at the top of the pyramid.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.560
After a bit we return and find Jeff slathering&nbsp;
Amy in blood, providing instructions for her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.200
escape plan, including how to reach the Jeep. He&nbsp;
then takes her down, making a big show of saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.280
goodbye to her at the foot of the pyramid, and&nbsp;
then playing like he’s thinking about making a run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.160
for it. He’s really just laying down a distraction&nbsp;
to facilitate her escape, but he does too damn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.640
good a job of acting, as they end up filling him&nbsp;
with arrows before he is returned to the vines.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:23.120
Meanwhile, Amy has broken through the barrier and&nbsp;
goes tearing through the woods as arrows whiz by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.040
all around. She manages to make it to the&nbsp;
trailhead and drive off in the Jeep. But,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.920
as she begins to feel the relief of her escape,&nbsp;
her affliction is revealed. Shortly thereafter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.320
Dmitri’s buddies emerge into the clearing,&nbsp;
completely unaware of what’s in store.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.720
The Ruins is another one of those movies that just&nbsp;
kind of came and went. Although its box office&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.840
was fairly good in comparison to the budget, it&nbsp;
wasn’t a massive hit. Despite that, I think this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.640
is one that deserves to be held up as a stand out&nbsp;
from that time period. It takes a fairly simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.960
premise and does a really good job of delivering&nbsp;
on it. There are a few places where it could have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.680
been tightened up a bit. The confusion about what&nbsp;
the pyramid protectors wanted was done very well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.840
but I think they went a bit overboard&nbsp;
telegraphing the issue by having Amy just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:09.280
fully submerge herself in the vines. Especially&nbsp;
since they made the issue so overt later when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.360
the little boy had to be executed. If they had&nbsp;
relied on that later scene to clarify things,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.080
they could have maintained a little more suspense.&nbsp;
Also, the story is very much character-driven,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.840
since it revolves around a small group of&nbsp;
people in a tight location. Despite that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.640
they devote two scenes to Eric and Stacy’s sex&nbsp;
life, which didn’t really add anything to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.200
story. It’s not necessarily bad, but it just seems&nbsp;
like this time could have been spent in other ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.840
to build up other, more relevant aspects.&nbsp;
Although, I suppose it’s possible that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.640
served a practical purpose in potentially making&nbsp;
the film more marketable overall. Either way, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:45.680
think these are minor issues. The film was overall&nbsp;
pretty good and it went hard when it needed to.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:14:01.920
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;
