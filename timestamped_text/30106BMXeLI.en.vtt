00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.500
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.080
Today, Iâ€™m going to explain a drama, mystery,
sci-fi film called "The Vast of Night."

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.520
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.240
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.030
In Cayuga, New Mexico, a young disc jockey
named Everett lends his equipment for a high

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.690
school basketball game.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.450
He notices the lights flicker in the gym,
worrying that it could affect the event.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.400
Everett lends a recorder to Benny and Sam,
who are the school's sports commentators.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.359
Everett agrees to help a student named Fay
test out her tape recorder before Mrs. McBroom

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:32.359
finds him.

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:35.960
She takes Everett to the lockers, where Arlo
is trying to fix the electric wiring.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.340
But Arlo asked for Emmett, not Everett, starting
an argument between him and Mrs. McBroom.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.719
Everett leaves, knowing that he can't help
them.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.850
As the audience arrives at the gym, Everett
walks out with Fay to test her tape recorder.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.200
Fay records random sentences and is glad to
hear that the recorder works.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.030
Upon Everett's insistence, Fay practices being
a reporter by interviewing a family that just

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.710
parked in the parking lot.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.300
Everett confidently jokes around with the
family while Fay still feels awkward.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.859
While they continue practicing interviews,
they meet with Mr. Stemmons, but Everett claims

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:06.200
the recorder is broken, scaring Fay.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.660
Once they're out of earshot, Everett admits
that he lied, wanting to get out of the conversation

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.950
with a boring person like Mr. Stemmons.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.520
Fay feels bad about lying, but Everett thinks
it's preventing people from embarrassing themselves.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.650
They're stopped by Pappy Fred and his family,
who Fay attempts to interview as well.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.860
Fay is excited when Everett gives her an idea
of starting her show.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.780
Pappy Fred's wife, Marjorie, tries to get
Fay to spill gossip, but her husband gets

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.780
pissed.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.600
Everett pulls Fay out of the scene, not wanting
to get involved.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.860
While heading to the telephone exchange where
Fay works, she shares articles from the science

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.950
magazine that she's been reading to Everett.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.140
The articles suggest self-driving cars, hyperspeed
trains, and pocket-sized T.V. phones in the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.560
near future.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.210
Upon reaching the telephone exchange, Everett
bids her goodbye, heading back to his radio

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.080
station to start his program.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.490
Inside, Fay chats with her co-worker about
her tape recorder and the basketball game

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.640
at the gym.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.110
When her co-worker leaves, Fay sets up her
desk, beginning her shift as a switchboard

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.500
operator.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.560
She takes a call, but the line disconnects
as soon as she answers.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.700
To pass the time, she turns on the radio and
listens to Everett's program, but the frequency

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.700
distorts.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.950
A strange humming comes from the radio, confusing
Fay.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.290
She answers another call but instead hears
Everett's radio program on the other end before

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.440
the line distorts again with no one answering.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.420
Concerned, Fay calls another switchboard operator
named Winnie, letting her listen to the distorted

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.660
frequency.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.950
Before Winnie can identify it, Fay gets another
call and answers it.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.380
On the other end, a panicked woman describes
a large object above her land and the wind

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.040
gushing like a tornado.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.900
She tells Fay to call the police while she
hides in the cellar before the line disconnects.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.240
After the call drops, Fay listens to the electrical
humming intently, studying its pattern.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.200
When she gets no answer from the police station,
she calls another operator, Josie, who tells

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.130
her that a trucker asked the police for help.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.710
According to the trucker, a whirlwind caused
the truck to spill its contents all over the

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.710
road.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.900
Hearing that no officers are available, Fay
answers Winnie's call.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.620
Fay tells her about the other woman's call,
but the line drops suddenly.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.730
This time, she calls home and talks to her
sister's babysitter, Ethel, asking if she

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.010
can listen to the radio to check the sound.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.460
Ethel suggests that she call Everett instead,
then the line drops again.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.000
Fay calls her neighbor, Grace, asking if she
can check on Ethel, concerned about her and

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.130
her sister.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.310
Grace agrees, promising to call back.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.130
Suddenly, the radio starts playing again.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.840
Fay listens to it as she waits for Grace's
call, still concerned about the strange electrical

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.710
hums and the calls that keep dropping.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.330
Plagued by her thoughts, Fay finally gives
Everett a call to ask for his help.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.319
She lets him listen to the humming sound and
tells him about the strange woman's call and

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.090
all the calls that got cut.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.430
Everett plays back his radio program's recording,
finding the same humming.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.800
The two wonder if it's a military code that
got caught in their frequency.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.340
Hoping to learn more, Everett plays the sound
in his program, asking the listeners to call

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.940
if they know anything about it.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.940
As the sound plays, Fay lights a cigarette
and waits.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.610
Back at the school gym, most of the townsfolk
cheer for their high school basketball team,

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.720
with Benny and Sam commentating on the game.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.530
Behind the school, Everett hangs outside his
radio station when the phone rings.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.140
Fay announces that he has a caller, a guy
from out of town named Billy.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.840
Everett puts Billy on the program to tell
his story.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.190
Billy was in the military and was assigned
jobs that he didn't understand.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.500
One night, his superior woke him up and loaded
him on a carrier plane.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.290
The plane picked up other men from different
bases before arriving at their destination.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.200
He and the others were then loaded into a
bus with blackened windows, preventing them

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.560
from seeing where they were going.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.120
They were taken to an unknown desert filled
with tents and bunkers, similar to a testing

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.120
site.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.130
A superior warns them that everything they
see and do there is classified.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.480
For days, Billy and his group dug a large
square hole and built walls and windows for

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.850
a viewing room.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.750
One day, Billy woke up, and something enormous
was suddenly in the hole that they dug up,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.800
covered in a tarp.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.780
The thing was kept under strict surveillance,
preventing anyone from seeing what's inside.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.800
Billy and the rest were then ordered to build
a ceiling over it before being sent back to

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.320
their original posts.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.780
But before their plane took off, the radio
played the same humming sound.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.530
Once the plane leaves, the men below covered
the airstrip with dirt to cover their tracks.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.150
The sound disappeared when they got far enough.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.410
After Billy got back home, he got sick and
developed lung disease, believing that the

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.590
area caused it due to radiation.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.500
Billy met with one of the other guys he worked
with at the desert, who confirms that he got

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.550
sick too.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.980
The man recounted being taken to the Colorado
River, where a river barge carried something

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.370
twice its size.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.760
Upon reaching a makeshift radio station by
the river, they unloaded the cargo onto two

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.990
army trucks.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.630
The same humming sound started on all the
radios again until the army trucks left.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.820
Then, Billy met a radar operator at the Walker
base, who claims that the sound wasn't military

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.139
from any country.

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.670
It was coming from space.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.300
He claims that the signals have been coming
back and forth for years as if communicating.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.810
Suddenly, Billy's call gets cut.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.250
Everett pauses the program to ask Fay what
happened.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.990
But Fay can't call him back cause she doesn't
know where he lives.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.310
To their surprise, Billy calls again.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.890
He refuses to give them his real number and
name.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.020
He admits that he shared his story with Everett
because he wanted someone to listen to their

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.020
story.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.250
He reveals that he's an African-American man,
and all those who were detailed in those strange

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.970
tasks were also African-American or Mexican.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.949
Billy thinks that they were chosen on purpose
because no one will listen to them if they

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:53.510
shared the stories.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.090
Everett demands more evidence that the story
is real.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.870
Billy continues that the radar operator didn't
stop investigating the signals after he retired.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.330
He recorded the sound and made copies sent
to all the other soldiers who encountered

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.330
it.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.419
When Billy received his copy and played it,
he became frightened as it is the exact sound

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:08.639
from the desert.

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.830
Billy burned the tape, not wanting to be caught
with it.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.620
However, someone in Cayuga was also stationed
in one of these details, and he probably still

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.919
has his tape.

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.010
Billy identifies him as Raymond Buck, who
already passed away.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.830
Fay remembers that his wife donated all his
tapes to the library.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.380
Despite Everett pointing out that no one will
watch the switchboard if she leaves, Fay insists

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.449
on finding that tape, given that everyone
is at the game tonight and no one will call.

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:33.490
Billy tells them they should find the tape
and play it soon, as whatever keeps playing

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.310
that sound won't stay for long.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.280
Brimming with curiosity, Fay holds her breath,
waiting for Everett's decision.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.620
When Everett tells her to go, she immediately
leaves her post and runs to the library.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.110
Fay heads to a house and takes a spare key
to the library.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.190
Then, she takes a bike as she makes her way
to the library.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.090
Upon reaching it, she collects all the tapes
from the basement.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.970
When she heads out, Everett is outside with
a stolen car.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.460
They drive back to the radio station, and
Fay picks up the phone, asking Billy which

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.780
tape it could be.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.940
The line gets cut, but Fay cannot reconnect
him until she goes back to the switchboards.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.780
Everett tells her not to go and play the tapes
until they find the right one instead.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.930
Everett takes the tapes one by one, playing
them to check what they contain.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.360
Fay asks him if he's worried that this broadcast
will get him in trouble, but Everett admits

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.889
that he doesn't care.

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:19.360
Whatever happens in the broadcast will be
enough to land him a better job elsewhere.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.550
Fay dreams of going to a bigger city too but
doesn't think she'll be able to go to college.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.520
Everett finally finds the correct tape, listening
to the humming sound.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.020
He broadcasts it on the radio station, asking
Billy to call them again if it's the correct

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.020
one.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.710
The hum grows louder until the station's power
goes out.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.160
Fay is scared in the dark, agitating Everett.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.630
They head outside and see light everywhere
else except for the station.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.410
Everett and Fay drive back to the telephone
exchange as they share theories on what the

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.560
sound is.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.470
Fay reaches the switchboard, where numerous
calls are waiting.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.430
She tends to all the calls hurriedly, with
many of them claiming that there's something

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.729
in the sky.

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:56.520
They head back out and meet with passersby,
Bertsie and Gerald, who have been following

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.370
the strange object in the sky.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.000
They share information until the switchboard
rings again.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.880
The woman on the other end, Mabel, asks to
speak to Everett.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.100
Mabel claims that she has more information
about the humming sound, but she insists that

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.430
he visits her house, where she'll tell her
story.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.139
Interested, Everett asks for her address and
heads to her home.

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:17.680
Everett drives with Fay to Mabel's house while
Bertsi and Gerald stay to keep watch.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.890
They reach the home and enter, seeing the
pitch darkness inside.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.750
The two approach Mabel's sitting room, where
she's reading something in a foreign language.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.300
Mabel offers them a seat and agrees to broadcast
her story about the people in the sky to Everett's

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.460
radio program.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.120
When she was a little girl, an empty passenger
train was found near Cayuga.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.050
People assumed the Apaches took the passengers,
naming the event as the Boles Acres Raid.

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.789
A few days later, a wounded woman who'd jumped
off that passenger train was found.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:44.509
Mabel's friend, Charlotte, and her family
helped the woman.

00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:47.869
While waiting for a representative in El Paso
to take her, the woman stayed in Charlotte's

00:08:47.869 --> 00:08:48.869
room.

00:08:48.869 --> 00:08:51.449
At the time, Mabel also stayed with Charlotte's
family.

00:08:51.449 --> 00:08:54.649
One night, they heard the woman sleep talking
in a strange language.

00:08:54.649 --> 00:08:58.519
After that night, the woman disappeared, having
stolen a horse to escape.

00:08:58.519 --> 00:09:02.949
When Mabel grew up, she fell in love with
Claude, who worked for the telephone company.

00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:04.959
But she got pregnant before they could marry.

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:08.540
Claude was assigned out of town, promising
to return for her and their child.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:13.749
But he died while on the job, leaving Mabel
to raise their son, Hollis, on her own.

00:09:13.749 --> 00:09:17.179
One night, as she's nursing Hollis, the baby
spoke his first words.

00:09:17.179 --> 00:09:20.110
It was the exact words the woman from the
train said in her sleep.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:24.160
As Hollis grew up, he fixated on objects and
would hardly respond to others.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.459
Occasionally, Mabel heard him say those strange
words in his sleep, prompting her to write

00:09:27.459 --> 00:09:28.629
them down.

00:09:28.629 --> 00:09:31.199
When asked what they meant, Hollis didn't
know.

00:09:31.199 --> 00:09:34.949
When Hollis was four years old, the wind blew
hard outside, followed by a sound similar

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:36.509
to a giant windmill.

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:38.930
Hollis stared at the window, not responding
to her.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.339
An idea popped into her mind, and Mabel read
the strange words to him.

00:09:42.339 --> 00:09:45.800
Hearing her, Hollis stared up at the ceiling,
mouthing the words with her.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.889
When Mabel stopped reading, Hollis snapped
out of the trance and continued to play as

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:50.240
if nothing happened.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.110
Mabel read the words to him again in the next
few days, but he didn't respond at all.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.060
She figured that something was outside their
house that night, telling Hollis something

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.619
that she couldn't hear.

00:09:58.619 --> 00:10:01.589
When Hollis was nine years old, Mabel sensed
that it was back.

00:10:01.589 --> 00:10:04.160
That evening, Hollis walked outside and vanished.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.050
Mabel followed his footprints until they stopped,
but Hollis was nowhere to be found.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.720
This led people to assume that Mabel killed
her son.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.170
Mabel admits that she'd never heard the sound
they broadcasted before, but she insists that

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.329
she knows more.

00:10:15.329 --> 00:10:17.980
Mabel believes that the people in the sky
are there now.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.379
From what she's experienced, they only visit
small towns and only at the time when people

00:10:21.379 --> 00:10:23.910
gather, like how the town gathered for the
game tonight.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.470
The people in the sky talk to those who are
alone while they sleep, playing with their

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.470
minds.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.259
She blamed them for other people's selfish
acts, believing that they meant this so conflict

00:10:31.259 --> 00:10:33.000
will remain on the planet.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.380
At the end of her story, Everett thanks her
and excuses themselves to leave.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.309
Mabel requests for them to take her to the
ship in the sky to find her son.

00:10:39.309 --> 00:10:41.519
Still skeptical, Everett denies.

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:44.790
Instead, Mabel gives him the note where she
wrote the strange words, asking him to say

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.560
it to anyone they encounter tonight.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.239
However, Everett doesn't take it and leaves.

00:10:49.239 --> 00:10:53.279
Heading outside, Fay is ecstatic, thinking
of borrowing a video camera to capture footage.

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:56.360
But Everett is at his wit's end, not buying
the stories.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.649
Fay's eyes widen as she remembers checking
on Ethel and her sister.

00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:04.319
She runs back to her house and picks up her
sister, Maddie, and realizes that Ethel is

00:11:04.319 --> 00:11:05.929
nowhere in sight.

00:11:05.929 --> 00:11:09.119
Fay heads to the neighbor's house, where she
asks Gretchen to borrow her father's camera.

00:11:09.119 --> 00:11:12.459
Everett arrives, angered at Fay for taking
Maddie with them.

00:11:12.459 --> 00:11:16.439
He still doubts Mabel and Billy's stories,
but Fay is adamant about knowing more.

00:11:16.439 --> 00:11:19.800
They head back to the switchboard center and
receive a call from a panicked Ethel.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.199
She tells Fay that she's watching something
in the sky.

00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:26.319
Gerald and Bertsie arrive, telling them that
the object is moving away from the town.

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:29.139
Fay and Everett get into their car as they
follow the object.

00:11:29.139 --> 00:11:32.529
Fay shares Ethel's story, describing that
the object in the sky is round and is hiding

00:11:32.529 --> 00:11:33.889
in the clouds.

00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:36.699
Everett tells them about Mabel's claims that
there are people in the sky who are abducting

00:11:36.699 --> 00:11:37.869
other people.

00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:41.239
He rewinds his tape recorder, playing the
foreign language that Mabel was saying before

00:11:41.239 --> 00:11:42.239
they met her.

00:11:42.239 --> 00:11:45.769
Suddenly, Gerald and Bertsie look up at the
car's roof, frozen.

00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:48.370
Fay yells to stop the recording as the car
swerves.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:51.920
She holds onto her baby sister, ordering Everett
to take the wheel from Gerald, who's still

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.920
dazed.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.179
Finally, they park the car safely.

00:11:55.179 --> 00:11:58.429
The confused Bertsie and Gerald heavily apologize
for what happened.

00:11:58.429 --> 00:12:01.519
But Fay is frightened and takes her sister
into the woods, with Everett following close

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:02.519
by.

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:05.879
Tired, Fay kneels on the ground, clutching
her sister as she cries.

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:09.959
Everett stays by her side, calming her, but
notices burnt branches on the ground.

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:12.730
He checks the trees, with some still glowing
with embers.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.949
They search the woods and found a circular
clearing in the branches as if something crashed

00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:16.949
through.

00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:21.000
With this new discovery, Everett now believes
that the people in the sky are real.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.829
Realizing they're in danger, Fay and Everett
run through the woods, hoping to get to safety.

00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:27.959
They stop at a clearing where Everett spots
something in the distance, and slowly walks

00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:28.959
to it.

00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:31.670
They turn and see the flying alien spaceship
close by.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:35.259
Frozen in fear, the two watch the spaceship,
with another flying over their heads to meet

00:12:35.259 --> 00:12:36.259
with it.

00:12:36.259 --> 00:12:38.639
Everett drops his recorder, stunned at the
sight.

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:41.709
The wind picks up, circling them like a small
tornado.

00:12:41.709 --> 00:12:45.259
Everett holds Fay and Maddie in his arms protectively
as the night darkens.

00:12:45.259 --> 00:12:48.670
Back at high school, the game is over, and
the townspeople head to their homes.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.670
The power in Everett's radio station comes
back as if nothing happened.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.369
In the clearing, Everett's tape recorder is
covered in dirt.

00:12:54.369 --> 00:13:04.689
Everett, Fay, and Maddie have disappeared.
