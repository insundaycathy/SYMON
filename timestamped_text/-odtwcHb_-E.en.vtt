Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and
gentlemen; now today I wanted to talk

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.019
about a film that I feel like a lot of
people got right but not all of it and I

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.570
wanted to clear up any misconceptions
that you or other people might have

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.440
about it and I have to give thanks to
users

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.410
Quaker Joy, Kate Kim, TN and Blackout

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.890
for the points made throughout
this video and the topics of today's

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.180
video are gonna be about the Japanese
stranger –the old man–, Moo-Myeong

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.610
the mushrooms, the deleted ending as well as Il-Gwang, and the photos but first here's a very

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.160
brief and very quick summary of
The Wailing (2016)

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.800
So there's a Japanese man who has recently arrived to

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.030
this quite little Korean town in the mountains, living by

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.820
his lonesome in the woods but since he's
arrived things have gotten weird

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.359
a terrible and mysterious illness is
spreading throughout the town infecting

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.739
townspeople with a rash and a terrifying
urge to kill ending fatally for both

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.180
the victims and the murderer

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.760
We followed Jong-Goo, a loving if
indifferent father and police officer

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.820
investigating these murders and in in his investigation he

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.880
encounters a strange woman in white named Moo-Myeong

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.500
Who directs him to investigate the Japanese stranger

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.420
who haunts Jong-Goo's dreams...

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.940
however during the course of his investigation. 
Several things happen

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.820
For one, Jong-Goo finds evidence that the Japanese guy is a killer;

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.140
finding photographs of the murdered
victims–they find photographic evidence

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.350
that points towards the Japanese guy
being a killer and secondly Jong-Goo's

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.920
daughter Hyo-Jin becomes possessed by an evil spirit

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.530
so Jong-Goo hires a lavishly dressed
exorcist named Il-Gwang to exorcise her

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.610
which doesn't go well and it's then
later that Jong-Goo and his friends have a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.750
terrifying encounter with an
honest-to-god zombie and they end up

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.430
killing the Japanese man believing him
to be the cause of the curse and it's

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.310
only later that Il-Gwang convinces Jong-Goo
that no, it's not the Japanese man that's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.108
the cause of this it's in fact the woman
in white: Moo-Myeong

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:07.100
and Il-Gwang himself actually runs into Moo-Myeong

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.929
and has a terrifying encounter vomiting up copious

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.700
amounts of blood and flees the town only
to return when he's terrorized by a

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.129
swarm of locusts and ultimately, the film ends with us finding

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.689
out that Moo-Myeong and the Japanese guy
are some sort of supernatural entity

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:29.480
with Moo-Myeong being a "good guy" and the
Japanese guy being the Devil

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.400
So by the end of the film it's heavily implied
that the old man is now a demon or the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.709
Devil himself however earlier in the
film it's actually the demon or the

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.139
devil who is possessing the body of the
Japanese stranger however every so often

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:50.689
the demon either relinquishes control or
the Japanese guy's spirit actively

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.069
fights for control over his own body
which allows the Japanese man to perform

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.139
that ritual which is meant to drive the
demon from his body into the body of Mr. Park.

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:04.579
the cadaver in the photo and
Moo-myeong's presence helps drive the demon

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.959
out of his body as well allowing this
Japanese stranger to reclaim total

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.310
control over his body which is why he
acts so differently after being chased

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.329
after that whole scene (The ritual).
He's no longer possessed by the demon

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.009
however he dies sometime after falling
onto the truck and being pushed off the

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:27.590
highway by Jong-Goo allowing the demon or
the Devil to fully possess the body of

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.629
the Japanese stranger and we see its
true form at the end of the movie as the

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.370
priest – a character I didn't mention in the
summary – fully acknowledges and believes

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.109
in the supernatural status of the
creature which brings me to a few othe points

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.820
Moo-myeong and belief

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.000
Now this movie combines aspects of Christianity

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.459
and Korean shamanism, all of it embodied
in Moo-Myeong who I'm pretty sure is some

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.720
sort of land God or local guardian
spirit of the town meant to protect it

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.153
and in fact some of her actions actually
references the Bible

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.000
she throws stones at Jong-Goo
which is a reference to John Chapter 8 Verse 7

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.160
"He who is without sin, may cast he first stone"

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.880
referring to Jong-Goo as a pure man who
doesn't easily give in to sinful desire

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.880
having no sex drive, not eating a lot, working 'hard enough', and not being lazy

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.000
as well as being willing to spend a lot
of money for the sake of his daughter

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.820
she also references the rooster crowing 3 times,
which is a reference to John Chapter 18

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.520
where Peter denies knowing Jesus three
times which heralds the crucifixion of

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.570
Christ but in the movie this manifests
itself as Jong-Goo refusing to believe

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.910
Moo-Myeong spiel about trapping the demon
and this ends up getting him killed by

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.920
Hyo-Jin now possessed by another demon (spirit)
implying that Moo-Myeong's powers work on

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.180
faith and that if you have faith and you
believe you will and can be protected

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.740
but if you were to ever waver in your
faith and sin, bad things will happen to

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.420
you and depending on what you believe in
bad things will happen to you as the

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.960
priest finds out the end of the movie
when he confronts the devil

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.450
Now  something that is mentioned earlier in
the film is that there are these

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.500
mushrooms that were consumed by the
victims of the mysterious disease with

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.000
the mushrooms contributing symptoms of
paranoia, rashes, and murderous intent

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.740
leading to a misconception that the
movie's plot was kick-started by a case

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.910
of fungal infections in other words
there's a theory that this movie is just

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.640
a hallucination by Jong-Goo and I wish to
debunk this and I will admit there are

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.090
several scenes where the people in the village
do eat something that might have

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.050
been contaminated by the mushrooms and
although it would explain a lot of the

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.860
weird things that happen in this film
and Jong-Goo's sudden change in demeanor

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.150
as a result of hallucinations or a
fever dream on Jong-Goo's part but it

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.720
doesn't adequately explain very
supernatural aspects of this film it

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.460
doesn't explain how an ostensibly dead
Japanese man comes back to life nor does

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.320
explain how lightning comes out of
nowhere to strike some random guy in the

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.930
middle of the woods nor does 
it explain how there are locusts

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.600
of a highway or the fact that the protective
garland–that charm that Moo-Myeong

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.350
hangs over Jong-Goo's gate ends up
rotting as soon as Jong-Goo crosses the

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.820
threshold and the cherry on top is that
there was a deleted ending that depicts

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.380
Il-Gwang and the Japanese stranger
getting into a car and driving off with

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.600
Moo-Myeong looking on clearly distraught
more or less confirming my suspicions

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.919
that she's in fact a land God who's
restricted to protecting those in her

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.280
territory which is why she can't chase after Il-Gwang and the demon

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.270
So Il-Gwang is the exorcist that
was hired to expel the spirit

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.330
possessing Hyo-Jin, Jong-Hoo's daughter
however Il-Gwang isn't as benevolent as he seems

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.289
Yes! He might be a good shaman, in fact

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:51.800
Jong-Goo paid top dollar for his services
Il-Gwang isn't a "good" shaman

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.940
If you catch my drift

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.199
because throughout the movie we
see him do things that aren't so

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:59.759
befitting of someone of his station: he
swears and he wears extravagant clothing

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:03.930
even though he prays to Buddha and some
the tenants of traditional Buddhism is

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.849
to not be extravagant, be a civil
person (don't swear) and do not kill

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:13.560
living things but what do we see we see
him wear brand-name clothing, we see him

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.370
get paid an exorbitant amount of money
to do the ritual and he swears and of

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.139
course he kills a chicken to do his
ritual hinting at his less than holy

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:26.009
nature but there are hints that he's
aligned with the Japanese shaman / demon

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:29.969
he wears a very familiar fundoshi, the
underwear that he Japanese man wears the

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:33.599
throughout the film and then later he
changes into darker clothing after the

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:38.280
ritual hinting at his two-faced nature
and he even violently vomits a blood

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.259
when he's near the "holy" Moo-Myeong, getting
rid of his impurity so to speak and he

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:47.400
tries to run away but he's frightened
back into helping the demon after the

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.280
demon sends a horde of locusts after
his car

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.460
So the kicker is that at the end of the film, we see Il-Gwang gather a set of photos

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:59.720
that the Japanese man claimed to have burned; photos of the dead victims

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.693
which are gathered up and put
back into the trunk of his car before driving off

00:08:03.693 --> 00:08:05.000
Why do these photos matter?

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:08.219
Well, for 1) they're a major source of
evidence that points towards the

00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:12.960
Japanese man being the cause of the murders and
mysterious deaths around the village but

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.349
there's an old belief in some cultures
and that cameras are able to capture

00:08:16.349 --> 00:08:20.759
your soul in their photographs thus
these photos are either the physical

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:25.680
representation or a manifestation of the
captured souls that were taken by the

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.509
demon who has enlisted the help of Il-Gwang in collecting these Souls

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:33.899
this explains why he takes a photo of Jong-Goo
at the end of the film and why he has

00:08:33.899 --> 00:08:38.490
all those photos and the purpose of his
ritual: his ritual wasn't to get rid of

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:42.990
the evil spirit possessing Hyo-Jin it
was to get rid of Hyo-Jin's spirit which was

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.620
fighting against the ritual as she begs
her father, her "abeoji" (daddy)

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.540
a word she hasn't used since she's been possessed
to stop the ritual which although is stopped

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.660
ultimately fails to stop the full
possession of Hyo-Jin

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.380
