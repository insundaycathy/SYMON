00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.740
Story Recapped here. Today, I’m going to
explain an action, horror, mystery film called

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.340
“The Bad Batch.” Spoilers ahead! Watch
out and take care.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.020
In an unknown barren wasteland in the post-apocalyptic
United States, a P.A. system announcement

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.370
addresses U.S. R.C.S. employees to avoid prolonged
physical contact with Bad Batch inmates and

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.860
limit their eye contact with them for no longer
than ten seconds. Shortly, one of the prison

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.860
guards calls the inmate's number 50-35 to
50-40 to step into the room to get their corresponding

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.510
serial numbers. Arlen May Johnson, an average-looking
juvenile teenage girl, steps inside and receives

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.500
a tattoo on her neck, just behind the right
side of her ear, bearing the letters 'BB-50-40'

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.180
tagging her as "Bad Batch 50-40."

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.000
On that same day, two prison guards escort
Arlen to an unknown desolate area where they

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.960
detain all the Bad Batch inmates. The guards
quickly lock the gates behind her, and she

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.380
suddenly finds herself in the middle of a
vast, dry, and barren wasteland. With nowhere

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.250
else to go, she grabs her water container,
straps on her backpack, and starts walking.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.690
Along the way, she finds an interesting pamphlet
that reads: "Find the DREAM and find COMFORT."

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.850
She then soon finds an abandoned car, which
she thinks is strange. Feeling exhausted,

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.350
she seeks refuge inside it. Moments later,
Arlen notices a rumbling sound from an oncoming

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.840
vehicle and checks the rearview mirror, where
she sees two people in a golf caddie moving

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.840
towards her. As the caddie gets closer, she
feels something off about it and suddenly

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.830
senses great danger is coming her way. Arlen
tries to escape, but the enslavers manage

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.530
to capture her just as she starts running.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.229
Arlen wakes up and finds herself tied in chains
and gagged. She then tries to look for someone

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.440
who could help her, but as she looks at the
surroundings, she instead discovers that she

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.540
is in some odd community. She sees shelters
made from debris and people behaving strangely

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.180
than normal. One of her captors approaches
her. As her captor reaches for her hand, Arlen

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.690
struggles to resist, but amidst her solid
resisting effort, the captor triumphantly

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.310
administers some anesthetic into her arm.
Seconds later, Arlen feels a tingling sensation

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.541
on her fingers and suddenly feels dizzy, almost
losing her consciousness again. Her captor

00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:43.570
draws out a hacksaw and cuts through her arm
without hesitation. She hysterically screams

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.610
as her captor is amputating her arm. Though
the anesthetic suppresses the sensation of

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.450
pain, she cries as she loses her arm permanently,
and after which her right leg follows. Arlen

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.479
now fully understands that she is inside a
strange, terrifying community of cannibals.

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.700
After spending several days and nights in
the cannibal community as a captive, Arlen

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.659
has unceasingly been hearing agonizing screams
from other neighboring captives. Despite her

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.129
traumatic condition, she brilliantly devises
a plan to escape. The following day, Arlen

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.279
covers herself up with her feces, hoping that
her captor will unchain her from the walls.

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:16.069
True enough, after seeing her state, the captor
unchains her and drags her outside to wash

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.069
her.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.689
As the captor fetches a bucket of water, Arlen
quickly snatches a two-foot-long metal bar

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.389
lying on the ground and hides it behind her
back. She times for the right opportunity

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:28.779
to strike, and within seconds, Arlen brings
her captor unconsciously down to the ground.

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:32.559
Using the same metal bar, she unceasingly
pounds her captor's head. After making sure

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:36.489
that her captor is dead, Arlen crawls around
to look for something to help her escape.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.829
She sees an old box full of scraps, immediately
digs on it, and fortunately finds an old skateboard

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.439
that she can use. She then rides it with her
back and finally manages to escape the community.

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.799
A few moments after her escape, under the
scorching heat of the sun, the thirst for

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.349
water consummately takes its toll, and she
loses her willpower to move further. Then

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.269
a shabby wanderer with a shopping cart filled
with scraps suddenly appears and approaches

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.200
her. Sensing her vulnerability, the man takes
her to a new community called "The Comfort."

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.590
Five months later, Arlen moves on with her
new life and becomes a permanent resident

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.590
of the community. With her new prosthetics
installed, living in a brand-new and friendlier

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.689
community has never been easier. Though the
place is quite similar to the cannibal community

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:10.689
that she escaped from, The Comfort is also
mostly built from debris and scraps. Make-shift

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:11.689
houses made from old camper trucks combined
with junk materials are also prevalent in

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:12.689
the area. However, the big difference in this
community is that the people living here lead

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:13.689
a more decent life than those of the cannibal
community.

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:14.689
The people in this town don't eat other people,
they eat regular food like ordinary people,

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:15.689
and most especially, they respect one another.
There is an existing economy inside The Comfort

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:16.689
where people have jobs, others run their businesses,
while others offer their services. People

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:17.689
in this community have their residences, and
they even have a public park where they can

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:18.689
spend their time recreating and playing. People
living inside The Comfort respect and value

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:19.689
each other's lives and co-exists with one
another.

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:21.680
On the other hand, a mysterious Miami Man
compels to abide by the harsh reality of their

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.019
society as he lives inside the cannibal community,
also known as "The Bridge." He illustrates

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.449
the ways of living inside the Bridge as he
breaks a young girl's neck, butchers her entire

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.760
body, and prepares a meal out of it for his
family to feed.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.970
One day, out of nowhere, Arlen suddenly feels
the perplexity of her desires, of what she

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.109
truly wants for her life and what she truly
wants to become. She somehow perceives that

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.329
she seems unsatisfied living her life inside
The Comfort. Uncertain of what to do, Arlen

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.870
loads her 38 caliber gun and decides to take
a walk outside the safeguarding walls of The

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.950
Comfort as she welcomely feels the dismal
air that surrounds the desolate desert on

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.309
her skin.

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:57.769
She then arrives at a dumpsite where she finds
a woman and a child, which happens to be the

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.329
family of the mysterious Miami Man from earlier,
scavenging for usable scraps. Slowly and carefully,

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.000
Arlen moves towards them and asks where they
came from. The woman defensively avoids answering

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.319
the question. Arlen becomes suspicious and
accuses her of being a Bridge person. The

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.489
woman continues to avoid the confrontation
and replies that they are just looking for

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.840
plates. Arlen asks her if her kid eats people
too. The woman poorly reasons out that they

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.250
are just trying to survive, same as her. Her
words offend Arlen and intensify her resentment

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.090
towards them, and without second thoughts,
Arlen shoots the woman on the head. Able to

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.380
witness everything, the child who is with
the woman tries to wake her up, uncertain

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.300
about the reality of the situation. After
seeing the child's reaction, Arlen then decides

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.070
to take the child inside The Comfort.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.020
Meanwhile, the mysterious Miami Man suddenly
feels uneasy ― so he goes to look for his

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.289
family.

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.190
Inside The Comfort, the child finds a vendor
that sells live rabbits. As Arlen notices

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.449
the child's fascination towards the creatures,
she pays for one of them to compensate for

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.250
what she did. Arlen tries to make the child
comfortable by being nice to her, but the

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.870
child just stolidly gazes at her while petting
the rabbit. She tries to break the ice by

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.290
introducing herself, but the child seems to
show less care to almost no interest at all.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.669
Unable to contain her emotions, Arlen harshly
tells the child that nobody cares for her

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.789
anymore, and she could have just left her
in the desert. The child then looks at her.

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.599
As Arlen stares at the child, she suddenly
softens, changes the topic, and asks if she

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.469
likes the rabbit and wishes to keep it. And
at last, the child responds with a nod.

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:20.169
On the other side of the community, the mysterious
Miami Man arrives at the dumpsite and finds

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.540
his woman lying lifeless on the ground. Alongside
is the shabby wanderer from earlier, who took

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.160
Arlen to The Comfort, minding his business,
scavenging for usable scraps. The Miami Man

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.400
then calls him, shows a sketch portrait of
his child, and asks if he saw her. The wanderer

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.289
smiles and gestures with his hand that he
wants something in return for the information.

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.560
Then he suddenly poses in front of the Miami
Man as if telling him to make a sketch portrait

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.020
of himself. In a state of disbelief, the mysterious
Miami Man goes for the deal and starts to

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.240
sketch and finishes it within a few seconds.
The wanderer smiles astonishingly while looking

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.120
at the result. Then he suddenly snatches the
sketch pad and writes the words: FIND COMFORT.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.189
On that very same day, Arlen and the child
already seem to get along pretty well. Both

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:01.630
of them prepare themselves for the street
party that is set to happen at midnight. Then

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.509
the night of the street party begins. A grand
entrance from a man who dresses like Elvis

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:10.580
Presley, the headmaster of a sub-community
within The Comfort known as "The Dream," speaks

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.360
to the people, telling them that they were
dumped into the middle of the desert because

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.819
they're Bad Batch, basically non-functioning
members of society. Then he subsequently explains

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:22.170
that because none of them weren’t good enough,
smart enough, young enough, healthy enough,

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.030
wealthy enough, and sane enough for them to
call them freaks and parasites of society.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.449
As the people of Comfort assent to it, the
headmaster concludes his speech by convincing

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:32.440
them all that it is time to wake up and find
The Dream.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.469
Arlen seems to be lost in her thoughts, thinking,
what is this that they call “The Dream.”&nbsp;

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:39.749
Then she notices people lining up in front
of a young lady who feeds them with an unfamiliar

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:42.999
pill.&nbsp; And out of curiosity, she then joins
them and takes a pill.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:47.979
Meanwhile, in the middle of the party, the
child loses her rabbit in the crowd. As the

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:51.510
child searches for it, she ends up at a place
where the headmaster is standing. He then

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.349
grabs the rabbit and gives it to her. She
immediately takes it back. Seizing the opportunity,

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:59.710
the headmaster deceptively leads the child
inside The Dream.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.780
Arlen then notices that she's lost the child.
However, her intoxication from the pill makes

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.120
her lose the ability to reason. Though incapable
of making a sound judgment, her subconscious

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.590
mind strongly suggests looking for the lost
child, which leads her outside the walls of

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.620
Comfort again. The mysterious Miami Man suddenly
approaches her. Unaware of her surroundings,

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.819
she stands right in front of him, disregarding
any danger, and tells him how they're all

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:22.400
in a dark place, afraid of their kind.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.880
The following day, already sober from the
pill, Arlen wakes up and notices that her

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.840
prosthetics are missing. The mysterious Miami
Man appears before her and tells her that

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.129
she is far away from The Comfort, and without
her prosthetics, she is unable to go anywhere.

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:37.979
He then shows a portrait of his child and
asks if she has seen her. Arlen lies and tells

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:42.250
him that she hasn't seen the child. Naively
believing Arlen, the Miami Man forces to make

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.660
a wager with her that he will only give Arlen's
prosthetics back and take her to The Comfort

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.689
if she agrees to look for his child. Arlen
agrees with it, and they begin their journey.

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:54.809
At midday, a stranger on a motorcycle suddenly
appears. He then tries to offer the Miami

00:07:54.809 --> 00:07:58.779
Man a container of gasoline in exchange for
Arlen's leg. The tension suddenly rises as

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:02.169
both men stare at each other. The stranger
decides to get ready to fight as he pulls

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:06.259
out a long thick chain that he wears from
his body. Seeing the stranger's aggressiveness,

00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:10.189
the Miami Man decides to yield and hands Arlen
over. He then grabs the fuel container in

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:14.719
exchange, turns his back, and walks away in
the opposite direction. Feeling triumphant,

00:08:14.719 --> 00:08:19.259
the stranger carries Arlen back to his motorcycle.
Then in a split second, the Miami Man takes

00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:23.189
his knife out and throws it directly towards
him, delivering him to his end. Confident

00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:26.749
that the stranger is no longer alive, they
continue with their journey.

00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:31.069
The night comes, and they set camp. As they
prepare to settle down, Arlen tries to engage

00:08:31.069 --> 00:08:35.149
the Miami Man in a conversation by bluntly
asking how he became a Bad Batch. He goes

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:39.250
silent for a moment, collects his thoughts,
and opens up with Arlen. As the night goes

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.240
deeper, they become more comfortable and closer
with each other. Seizing the opportunity,

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.730
she suddenly snatches the knife away from
him and threatens to kill him. Without showing

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.990
any agitation, he drives himself closer to
Arlen, provoking her to do it. Staring at

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.430
each other for a while, the mood suddenly
changes from fear and hate into a bizarrely

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:59.070
romantic moment. Then suddenly, out of nowhere,
a man from The Comfort suddenly appears and

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.070
shoots the Miami Man in the chest. The man
intends to save Arlen and convinces her to

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.990
return with him to Comfort.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.459
Back in Comfort, the uncertainty of Arlen's
current state of emotion increases, whether

00:09:08.459 --> 00:09:11.940
or not she is happy with the security and
peace inside The Comfort, the obscurity of

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.980
her desires puzzles her. Then one day, she
decides to return to the place where she left

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.680
the Miami Man. She arrives only to find the
man's sketch pad and a bloodstain on the ground.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.060
As disappointment flashes all over her face,
she brings the sketch pad along with her back

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.170
to The Comfort.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:29.660
Meanwhile, the shabby wanderer from before
finds the Miami Man from a distance. Seemingly

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.110
lifeless on the ground, the wanderer examines
his body. Disregarding any prejudices, he

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.690
decides to take him under his care.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.340
Arlen then indulges herself in the Miami Man's
sketch pad and finds different kinds of sketches

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.940
of people, animals, and plants. Later on,
she finds the child's portrait she once lost

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.110
at the street party and prompts a strong emotion
from her, probably her conscience. She then

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:53.110
decides to make copies of the child's sketch
portrait and begins to search. She asks and

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.560
shows the child's picture to the people around
Comfort, expecting to get information about

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.889
the child, but to no avail. After spending
hours of long exhausting searching, she seems

00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:05.259
to feel that all hope is lost. And finally,
as she sits to rest, a group of young women

00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:08.870
from The Dream suddenly walks past her and
finally sees the lost child surprisingly together

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.170
with them.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:14.320
Later on that same day, Arlen shows herself
at The Dream's front door. As they grant her

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.940
entry, she then steps in, about to know the
answers to her biggest dilemma ― to find

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:18.949
out what The Dream is.

00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:22.430
“The Dream” is a mansion complete with
amenities commissioned to the Elvis Presley

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.250
impersonator who was seen earlier during the
night of the street party. The mansion itself

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.731
is a small community of women living a lavish,
much more comfortable life than inside The

00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:30.959
Comfort.

00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:33.930
As Arlen enters the mansion, she discovers
an institution of illegal activities. She

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:34.930
sees a woman tending narcotic shrubs, mass
production of pills made from illegal substances,

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.259
and multiple pregnant women. Then the headmaster
arrives and makes a weird remark as he approaches

00:10:37.259 --> 00:10:40.930
to meet her. Then he continues to explain
that what she sees around her is the economy

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.241
of The Comfort. He further continues a conversation
with delicate and sensitive issues. And as

00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:46.630
Arlen listens, she gets lost in her thoughts.
The headmaster notices her disposition and

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.570
confronts her about not liking the place.
About to answer back, she suddenly loses the

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.050
right words to say at the moment. He then
elucidates that it costs a lot for her to

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:58.460
be here in The Comfort. He asks her where
she would rather be. Not able to answer, Arlen

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.329
instead stands up and sits beside him. He
continues to enthrall her by telling her that

00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:05.720
everything she has done has put her where
she is right now. Then he demonstrates his

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.480
wisdom by first holding a cherry tomato in
his hand. He then explains that it starts

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.320
as a seed, and as you take care of the garden,
it takes care of you back, if you feed it,

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.060
and it feeds you back. He then adds a few
maxims of his statement that few things in

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.750
the world operate like it — fair and square.
Then he finally explains that The Dream is

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.089
life itself, and life is The Dream. Then he
concludes the conversation by accepting Arlen

00:11:25.089 --> 00:11:26.570
to be a part of their elite community.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:30.519
In her mind, Arlen celebrates triumphantly
to succeed her sole purpose in walking in

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:34.000
front of The Dreams door&nbsp; — to infiltrate
the mansion and achieve all the means necessary

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.079
in getting the Miami Man's child out of the
so-called "The Dream."

00:11:37.079 --> 00:11:41.540
After Arlen sets her room, she goes impatiently
inside the bathroom. She removes her prosthetics

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.290
and pulls her gun out. Then she tells the
headmaster's consort to get inside the bathroom

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.800
because she feels nervous about what is about
to happen. And as the consort is about to

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.701
come in, she suddenly points the gun at her
pregnant belly and holds her hostage. She

00:11:52.701 --> 00:11:55.790
demands the headmaster to bring the child
out as she threatens to scatter his unborn

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:59.870
child all over his walls. Without a choice,
the headmaster brings the child down from

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:03.520
the stairs and hands her over to Arlen. She
then takes the child and keeps his consort

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.750
hostage until she clears a path out from The
Dream. Arlen pushes more of her luck and further

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.750
demands an escape vehicle with a promise that
she will release his consort once they can

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.480
safely reach outside The Comfort. After all
of her demands are met, they then drive outside

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.240
the walls for good. And as promised, she then
leaves the headmaster's consort to return

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.759
home but keeps the vehicle for herself.

00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:18.339
After driving for several hours, the Miami
Man suddenly shows up on a&nbsp; motorcycle approaching

00:12:18.339 --> 00:12:22.079
them. The child rushes towards her father
and embraces each other, pouring their hearts

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:26.130
out. After their sentimental reunion, the
child runs back to the vehicle, gets her rabbit,

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.240
and introduces it to him. After acknowledging
his child's gesture, he then decides to go

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.640
back to the Bridge with her.&nbsp;
Arlen stops them and asks if she can tag along.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.970
Hearing it in disbelief, the Miami Man brushes
her off and suggests that she needs to go

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:42.389
back to The Comfort. He continues to explain
that there is only death for her in this place.

00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:45.840
She then shows her determination to stay,
and without a word, Arlen grabs to hold his

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.440
hand. The child then tries to break their
intimate moment and suddenly demands spaghetti.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.519
Not knowing where to get one, the Miami Man
takes the child's rabbit and roasts it instead.

00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:56.860
The child cries as they feast on the rabbit.
She continues to cry as she consumes the meat.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.050
Peculiar as it is, the three are ready to
transition into the next chapter of their

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:11.920
lives, and they begin their journey by sharing
their first meal as a family.
