00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.800
you have just been tricked into entering&nbsp;
the ultimate gambling tournament going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.320
find out that this is a death game and&nbsp;
you'll need to outsmart your opponents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.600
stab anyone in the back and risk everything just&nbsp;
to stay alive what do you do when you're gambling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.760
with your life if a single mistake will turn&nbsp;
you into a slave i'm going to break down the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.120
mistakes made what you should do in how to beat&nbsp;
every death game in kaichi the ultimate gambler&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.440
this kid has no luck kaiji here to spend the last&nbsp;
of his money on a losing lottery ticket but it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.640
only the beginning of a no-good very bad day he&nbsp;
walks past several mercedes in the parking lot and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.200
starts kicking them out of jealousy two other guys&nbsp;
get out of the car and he realizes he's made the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.920
biggest mistake of his life chasing him through&nbsp;
the street he's caught and held down until his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.160
loan shark arrives they take him to an office&nbsp;
where the loan shark tells him that his friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.520
borrowed her money and disappeared and since kaiji&nbsp;
here signed a guaranteed payment on a loan for 300&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.560
000 yen he's now responsible for paying back&nbsp;
over 2 million in interest he doesn't have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.800
money and starts to break down crying all&nbsp;
right if this guy still has his death note&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.880
then now would be a really great time to use it&nbsp;
because his day is getting worse by the minute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.480
but he actually had a way out of this and&nbsp;
overlooked something really important in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.000
japan it's illegal to charge more than 20 interest&nbsp;
annually and if he owes 2 million that's a rate of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.400
160 if i were him i would have taken the documents&nbsp;
as evidence to report the extortion and pay the 20&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.040
it's still a lot of money but it's better than&nbsp;
gambling your life away the loan shark tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.120
the kid there's a gambling ship that's leaving&nbsp;
in four hours and if he wins the game that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.760
can start a new life and she'll erase his debt&nbsp;
he takes the deal and goes to the harbor where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.200
this massive ship is docked he has one last chance&nbsp;
to make things right but he has no idea he'll be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.840
gambling with his life kaiji here is taken to&nbsp;
a room full of other competitors who are just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.720
as desperate as he is and willing to do whatever&nbsp;
it takes to win an announcement is made welcoming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.280
the players as this man tonight tells them that&nbsp;
in order for them to play they'll be alone three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.360
of these stars which are worth 1 million yen each&nbsp;
however the interest rate is a brutal 1 per minute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.360
ok this is sketchy nobody takes you off the street&nbsp;
and puts three million yen in your hands unless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.760
you are the actual commodity here and not the&nbsp;
player we are being bought and sold for something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.760
larger here and we need to keep that in mind if&nbsp;
you want to survive because with this much money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.400
on the line you have next to no control over what&nbsp;
happens to you and that makes for a very dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.920
game they're all given three stars and a hand of&nbsp;
12 cards and will be playing rock paper scissors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.400
they have to pair up and play a card laying it&nbsp;
down on the table for each win they gain a star&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.640
from the loser and whoever still has three or&nbsp;
more stars after all 12 cards are played will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.160
win and go back home debt-free but they only have&nbsp;
30 minutes as the host leaves the game begins and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.760
the players start going nuts okay while everyone&nbsp;
is scrambling we should take a moment to observe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.800
our competitors first we need to pick out the most&nbsp;
insecure and predictable person in the room this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.280
guy here seems pretty desperate so i would choose&nbsp;
him to play now it would be normal to assume that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.360
this is a game of chance but it's not patterns&nbsp;
of this game have actually been studied and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.600
they've found that when a player wins one round&nbsp;
they're more likely to play the same thing again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.400
this is called a win stay lose shift strategy&nbsp;
and i would use it to beat them if you lose the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.320
first round the best thing to do is switch to the&nbsp;
card that beats what your opponent just played&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.000
this will take advantage of your opponent's&nbsp;
most probable game strategy and you're more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.560
likely to win there's also another element&nbsp;
of human psychology here that we can exploit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.960
it's a very natural instinct to want to keep your&nbsp;
options open so i would expect that the last three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.000
cards in anyone's hands are going to be all three&nbsp;
options of rock paper and scissors as soon as they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.760
play one i know what the other two cards are&nbsp;
and have better odds of beating them everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.240
is gambling their stars away without any strategy&nbsp;
when kaiju hears someone screaming this guy begs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.880
to be let go and they all watch as his player gets&nbsp;
dragged away by one of the guards and taken into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.640
a dark room it's only been three minutes and he's&nbsp;
already lost all his stars the door slams shut and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.520
all they can hear are his screams that's when this&nbsp;
man funai grabs kaiji here and tells him he has a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.080
strategy to beat this game if they were together&nbsp;
and only play the same cards at the same time it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.560
will be a draw this lets them use all their cards&nbsp;
and keep their stars so they shake on it and start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.680
playing all right if we're here to win he's just&nbsp;
giving you the best chance you'll get all night i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.160
would play a winning card on the first play take&nbsp;
a star and walk away i'm not here to make friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.880
i'm here to make money the man instructs kaiji&nbsp;
here to play rock scissors paper in that order in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.600
the first turn is a draw they keep this pattern&nbsp;
going and the plan is working until funai here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.720
suddenly plays a winning card he apologizes for&nbsp;
the mistake and tells him to use rock next so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.600
he can get his start back but on the next turn&nbsp;
the guy plays scissors and funai here wins again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.040
he takes kaiji star and the kid is not happy he&nbsp;
shoves into the floor and punches him as both men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.920
notice that some blood has landed on kaiji's last&nbsp;
card he gets restrained by the staff and he tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.240
them what happened but they don't care no rules&nbsp;
were broken and he's only got himself to blame&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.480
for being tricked okay this was a great con now&nbsp;
kaiji's only got one star and one card left but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.400
there's a silver lighting here because the staff&nbsp;
were totally fine with them abusing the rules and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.120
playing all draws i would start to reconsider&nbsp;
every rule we were told and what wasn't said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.280
so i would look for two types of people to take&nbsp;
advantage of the first are those who have three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.520
stars and want to get rid of their cards but are&nbsp;
too scary to play and lose this guy here gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.440
caught trying to flush them down the toilet which&nbsp;
is against the rules but giving them to another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.520
player isn't and he would definitely give us his&nbsp;
cards if we offer to take them then the second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.680
type of victim is someone with two stars but has&nbsp;
no cards left because they'll be desperate to win&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.000
a third star now if we just got a bunch of spare&nbsp;
cards from this guy then we can sell them to that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.160
guy from one star and he would buy them because&nbsp;
it's its only way to win as long as we're discreet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.160
with our trades and find the right victims we&nbsp;
could repeat this several times back and forth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.600
and get rich without playing a single game with 15&nbsp;
minutes left funai here reveals to everyone that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.720
kaiji's last card is scissors anyone who has rock&nbsp;
can beat him but then the kid reveals that funai's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.600
last card is rock and they should all beat him&nbsp;
instead the other players are skeptical sufunai&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.240
here suggests everyone reshuffled they all agree&nbsp;
and russia to join but kaiji here notices this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.720
helpless man on the ground and comes up with a&nbsp;
plan food i redeals everyone new playing cards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.520
but kaiji sees a man save one card for himself&nbsp;
after the shuffle the man approaches and asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.160
to play a second time offering two of his stars&nbsp;
but kaiji here raises it to three stars betting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.200
both his and this guy's stars combined so the man&nbsp;
agrees to play with three minutes remaining fuji&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.920
puts down his last card teasing kaiji for being&nbsp;
tricked again but this time kaiji has the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.560
laugh when he plays paper he won and takes three&nbsp;
of his stars giving one of them to his partner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.600
okay this was a brilliant gamble but it only&nbsp;
worked because kaiji was being highly observant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.480
here he knew food i saw the blood on his card and&nbsp;
organized a shuffle just to clear his suspicion so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.880
that he could play kaiji using the same winning&nbsp;
card but kaiji secretly wiped the blood off and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.080
traded it for this guy's paper card putting blood&nbsp;
on it the trick funai with only 30 seconds left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.480
kaiji and the old man split up the remaining&nbsp;
cards and play each other in one final game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.280
they draw each time getting to keep their stars&nbsp;
and use all their cards just as time runs out but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.920
the old man forgets he had one last card in his&nbsp;
pocket and he's not going to be able to pass the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.320
kid decides to do the honorable thing and takes&nbsp;
mutual responsibility for the loss he's brought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.520
into the back room where they inject a microchip&nbsp;
into his arm and brand him all right the obvious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.000
thing to do here is throw this guy under the bus&nbsp;
it's just not right to make two players lose from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.160
a single card but if we insisted on being a loser&nbsp;
then at the very least we should claim that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.040
card belongs to us and to let the sky go otherwise&nbsp;
it's an incredible waste of opportunity here and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.080
they're both going to pay for this mistake very&nbsp;
soon kaiji along with all the other losers are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.200
moved underground and forced to work as slaves in&nbsp;
a labor camp for 15 years to pay off their debts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.680
there's no way out and they're being monitored&nbsp;
24 7. they go back to their dormitory where kaiji&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.320
here receives his first paycheck this underground&nbsp;
labor camp uses a different currency and is only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:46.320
worth a tenth of a yen he'll never be able to save&nbsp;
up enough money to get out okay the first problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.520
i see is too much individuality so far they only&nbsp;
seem to be controlled by the foreman here and a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.600
few staff members there must be more security down&nbsp;
here but they're still outnumbered by the labor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.400
force if things are this hopeless and they have no&nbsp;
chance of saving up enough money to earn their way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.960
out then i would start planning for an uprising we&nbsp;
need to make friends with the other work crews and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.600
figure out who the leaders are if we convince them&nbsp;
to join the rebellion they can use their influence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.400
over their crews to start gathering equipment&nbsp;
scouting locations for possible escape routes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.640
and figure out the guard's routines we also need&nbsp;
to know which way the construction vehicles come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.120
from and the layout of the underground tunnels&nbsp;
there must be an elevator or ramp system big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.760
enough to bring these vehicles down here directly&nbsp;
we should coordinate a day where we all rebel then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.560
hijack the construction vehicles and drive them&nbsp;
out of here to the surface as in any revolution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.600
many of us will die but i'd rather die my feet&nbsp;
and keep living on my knees he gets back to work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.080
when an explosion goes off and shakes the entire&nbsp;
underground network he takes his injured friend to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.240
the medic but when he sees all the workers here&nbsp;
left untreated he realizes these patients don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.960
have enough money to buy medicine the air is so&nbsp;
bad down here that they're all getting sick but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.040
the boss is tempting workers into spending their&nbsp;
money so that they never get healthy or pay off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.240
their debt they need to escape this place for any&nbsp;
hope to survive but they're in luck as the doctor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.320
points to a message in the corner written in blood&nbsp;
and tells them there's only one way out and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.760
called brave man road okay brave man road sounds&nbsp;
too brave for me but there's something here that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.320
kaiji is not considering yet this medical area has&nbsp;
something way more valuable than everywhere else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.400
and that's medicine it's pretty clear that honest&nbsp;
labor will get us nowhere so i would plan on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.440
stealing all the medication i could first observe&nbsp;
which drugs are being sold to which conditions and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.680
figure out which of these drugs are the strongest&nbsp;
and most profitable then come back and admit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.160
yourself by faking that condition the medication&nbsp;
will be brought out of storage to be sold and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.640
can steal enough of it with a distraction to then&nbsp;
sell to our co-workers and undercut the rates they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.720
would all want to buy it for the cheaper price so&nbsp;
they'll keep it a secret for us as well and we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.520
make money a lot more quickly than before later&nbsp;
that day kaiji here considers what he's learned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.240
and when the foreman comes by to extort him for an&nbsp;
advance on his salary he flips out making a scene&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.640
he calls the foreman a crook for manipulating them&nbsp;
but kaiji's interrupted when some guards announced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.880
that this man has been chosen to compete on the&nbsp;
braveman road and they learn that whoever wins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.280
will go back to the surface hearing this kaiju&nbsp;
decides to volunteer and take back his freedom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.480
even if it kills him joining several other workers&nbsp;
they're taking up an elevator to the 50th floor of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.120
a skyscraper where they're told the rules of this&nbsp;
new game all they have to do is deliver these cash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.440
vouchers to a designated location at the star&nbsp;
site hotel and exchange them for cash but to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.040
get there they must cross this crane that leads&nbsp;
to the building next to them and make it to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.520
other side they'll get 10 million cash if they do&nbsp;
but the men are too scared to cross it until kaiji&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.920
here volunteers the others are inspired to join&nbsp;
him until the host reveals that their bridge to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:35.200
freedom is electrified as well inside the building&nbsp;
a table of rich guests are watching the event for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.640
entertainment so the workers aren't allowed&nbsp;
to use their hands when they cross the beam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.440
okay this one would defeat me because i'm super&nbsp;
scared of heights but if we can move past the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.200
fear factor here then there might actually be&nbsp;
a way to do this without falling now we can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.960
touch the beams with our hands but we also learned&nbsp;
in the first game that they're totally fine with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.520
you bending the rules to your advantage as long as&nbsp;
you accomplish the task and entertain the guests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.360
what we need here is more stability and if we can&nbsp;
add more points of contact with the bridge then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.120
we'll have a better chance at this this building&nbsp;
is pretty high up and if you've ever been to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.000
top of a skyscraper it can get pretty windy if the&nbsp;
wind is catching on your clothes it adds drag and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.240
can throw you off balance so if we minimize&nbsp;
our frame then there will be less resistance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.800
now tyro walkers use giant poles to lower their&nbsp;
center of gravity and spread out their mass to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.520
decrease the rotational inertia unfortunately all&nbsp;
these guys have are the clothes on their backs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.680
so that's what we need to use to achieve the&nbsp;
same goal i would tie all my clothing together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.080
in a long rope and swing it under the bridge that&nbsp;
catch it on the other side now we have added two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.480
points of contact with the bridge and lowered our&nbsp;
center of gravity like a tightrope walker so this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.720
will let us shuffle ourselves forwards with more&nbsp;
stability if we lean too far in any direction we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.040
can simply pull the cloth rope and correct our&nbsp;
balance the rich viewers might not like this but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.320
it's definitely worth trying if it means we won't&nbsp;
fall to our deaths kaiji here has a big idea he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.320
pulls this marker out of thin air and draws a line&nbsp;
to everyone's shoes to help them align themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.320
to the bridge and keep their balance they all feel&nbsp;
more confident to make it across now and start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:02.160
walking out onto the bridge one by one okay kaiji&nbsp;
here is doing some great thinking unfortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.400
it's the wrong strategy drawing a line down the&nbsp;
middle of your shoe seems like a good idea but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.480
the problem is if your foot is perfectly centered&nbsp;
then you have to balance yourself with the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.200
narrow part of your foot this makes it extremely&nbsp;
difficult to adjust your balance if you start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.920
leaning left or right the better strategy here is&nbsp;
to angle your foot sideways so that if you begin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.000
to sway you have more width across the walkway&nbsp;
and can use more of the muscles in your feet to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.240
maintain your balance we can take a lesson from&nbsp;
skateboarders here they don't face forward or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.640
line their feet straight they angle themselves and&nbsp;
it gives them extremely good balance so we should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.760
use the same strategy kaiji here almost falls and&nbsp;
manages to catch himself but that's when they see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.560
storm clouds flash in the distance player one&nbsp;
starts to lose his balance out of desperation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.280
he jumps forward onto the electrified bridge and&nbsp;
falls to his death that's one down and nine to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:52.560
go player six here tries to hold on to the bridge&nbsp;
and shocks himself causing him to fall off player&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.120
5 chickens out and turns back grabbing the man&nbsp;
behind him and they both plummet to their deaths&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.280
eventually there's only three players left in&nbsp;
the game as it starts to rain they all continue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.040
to make their way across the bridge but the&nbsp;
older tells kaiji here he can't continue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.600
he asks him to take his money voucher and exchange&nbsp;
it for his daughter before falling off the bridge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.680
okay if i'm being honest this old man never had&nbsp;
a chance he's too old and unstable to survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.160
this walk and helping him will only put us at&nbsp;
risk if he wants to save his daughter he needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.480
to walk towards me to hand it over because i'm&nbsp;
not changing my direction and walking backwards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:30.160
on a slippery metal pole in the rain 200 meters&nbsp;
above the ground it's also highly unlikely that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.360
this slave driving corporation will let me redeem&nbsp;
both coupons for a combined 20 million yen so the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.640
best move here is to let this guy ishida die and&nbsp;
keep walking forwards to focus on surviving the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:45.200
remaining players continue crossing and make it&nbsp;
to the other side they're just about to win but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.680
kaiji senses that something is not right about&nbsp;
this he warns the other player but it's too late&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.720
the door suddenly flies open and they're blown&nbsp;
away by a wind blast there was one last trick the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.920
organizers of the death game set up while kaiji&nbsp;
here is left hanging his friend falls to his death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.920
climbing back up the ledge he crawls into the&nbsp;
building and finds the members of the corporation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:08.640
applauding his performance the chairman of the&nbsp;
company walks in and kaiju here chews them out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.760
for their cruelty he demands they pay him his&nbsp;
20 million but the host refuses deducting nearly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.240
all the money from kaiji's voucher to pay off&nbsp;
his debt he yells at the host that the old man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.200
who fell proved he wasn't a loser because in his&nbsp;
last dying moments he was thinking of someone else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.160
the chairman here finds the kid interesting and&nbsp;
decides to set up one last game for him okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.320
these guys are obviously horrible people and most&nbsp;
of them should be shot but it's hard to stay mad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.040
when we're definitely better off right now than&nbsp;
we were days ago this poor guy keeps ending up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.760
in apocalyptic scenarios and at this point maybe&nbsp;
the best thing for him to do is move out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.640
country there aren't any battle royales in brazil&nbsp;
which holds the largest japanese community outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:52.240
of japan the government promoted emigration as a&nbsp;
national policy into the late 1960s to get rid of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.040
poverty and overpopulation and kaiji here fits&nbsp;
the bill as soon as he walks free he's going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.280
remember how miserable his life was and will fall&nbsp;
to the same bad decisions and he'll probably blow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.160
all his money on scratch cards so there's no point&nbsp;
going back without a boat mode of cash kaiji sits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:11.280
down and they tell him he'll be playing e card&nbsp;
against the host tony gawa there are two sets of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:17.680
five cards one plays as the emperor and the other&nbsp;
plays as the slave the game is simple they'll play&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.960
three rounds and each player picks a card and puts&nbsp;
it down on the table two citizens will result in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.920
a draw which means the round continues while a&nbsp;
citizen beats the slave and the emperor beats&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.960
the citizen but because the slave has nothing to&nbsp;
lose it's the only card that can beat the emperor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.040
the host explains that he cannot choose his&nbsp;
cards randomly and must look at the card and make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.360
a decision before putting it on the table he's&nbsp;
offered the choice to play as the emperor or as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.880
a slave which pays 10 to 1. he decides to take the&nbsp;
slave and he's put himself at a disadvantage the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.680
slave player must go first and kaiji's opponent&nbsp;
will get to seize facial expressions so the odds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:57.920
of winning are extremely low okay this is daunting&nbsp;
tonight here runs his entire underground gambling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.000
empire and has watched and studied people's&nbsp;
gambling habits and life and death situations for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.120
a long time he has a huge advantage and we need to&nbsp;
find a way to remove that if this is going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.760
a fair game now before we started he made a point&nbsp;
to mention that we aren't allowed to be random in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:17.440
our strategy and he also said that we must look at&nbsp;
the card before we put it down this is a big deal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.160
because it tells everything about his own strategy&nbsp;
he needs to read her expressions and body language&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.800
to make his decision now when the stakes are&nbsp;
this high trying to control or fake your micro&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.120
expressions is a lot more difficult than you&nbsp;
might think when we are under extreme stress our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:36.000
emotions tend to leak out so i would simply pull&nbsp;
my shirt over my head to cover my face so that i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.160
could still see the cards but he couldn't see my&nbsp;
expressions at all because it's going to take away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.720
his advantage and help me win and if the chairman&nbsp;
here thinks it's entertaining he might approve of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.680
the tactic they start the game and kaiju here&nbsp;
plays his first card but without hesitation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:55.520
the host plays his own and they draw he plays his&nbsp;
next card without even looking the host place is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.000
something strange is going on as the host doesn't&nbsp;
even look up to analyze the kids expressions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.800
on the third turn kaiju here goes for the win and&nbsp;
puts on a slave card hoping the host will play the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.240
emperor but the host can read his mind he turns&nbsp;
over a citizen taking away any chances of kaiji&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:15.040
winning the chairman wants to see more and gives&nbsp;
a loan to kaiji here so that he can continue play&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.440
but he's warned that this time if he loses he'll&nbsp;
have to work underground for the rest of his life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.720
okay before playing another round we have to&nbsp;
remember who our opponents are these guys have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.440
bent the rules either for their own entertainment&nbsp;
or to screw over the players it's fair to assume&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.920
that this game is stacked against you so at this&nbsp;
point i will be looking for any signs of cheating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.240
i would inspect the table and the room for any&nbsp;
cameras or sensors as well as any noticeable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.800
markings on the cards he might even have an&nbsp;
earpiece so i would ask anyone standing behind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.200
me to clear the area so they can't tell him what&nbsp;
my cards are but even if i didn't find anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.440
tonegawa here has already dropped hints that&nbsp;
should make us suspicious by telling us he can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:56.880
read our minds if this is somehow true he wouldn't&nbsp;
be letting us know this the man definitely knows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.520
how to keep every advantage a secret so his&nbsp;
opponent doesn't adjust his strategy and kaichi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.080
here is about to figure out that this wasn't&nbsp;
a careless comment but a calculated one this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.480
second time around kaiji decides to go against&nbsp;
expectations and play the slave on the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.840
turn but as he's about to place it he notices his&nbsp;
opponent isn't even looking at his own cards the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:21.280
man is looking at something else entirely when the&nbsp;
host finally plays his hand it's a citizen card&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.320
and in one turn he's ended kaiji's life the kid&nbsp;
gets dragged out but as he reaches the elevator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.880
he remembers the man wasn't wearing the same watch&nbsp;
as before and realizes it must have been what he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:36.080
was looking at he was using the implanted chip&nbsp;
in kaiji's shoulder to monitor his physiological&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:41.120
responses to the game the whole thing was a setup&nbsp;
he's been tricked into betting his life away but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:45.920
as he lays on the floor he begins to form a plan&nbsp;
asking to go to the bathroom he meets the loan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.920
shark and tells her he's figured out how to win&nbsp;
this time it convinces her to give him another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.960
loan walking back into the room kaiji asks for one&nbsp;
final round and he's got the money to back it up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:00.400
tonight resists but the chairman is interested and&nbsp;
orders him to play okay we still don't have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.200
upper hand here but we can even the playing field&nbsp;
this guy can track my physiological responses to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.520
each card i play and there are four meters on&nbsp;
this watch measuring heart rate blood pressure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:14.480
body temperature and perspiration when people are&nbsp;
put in stressful situations their body produces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.800
adrenaline triggering their fight or fight&nbsp;
response this makes their heart beat faster and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.800
increases their blood pressure if we want a chance&nbsp;
at baiting this man we have to manipulate his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.520
meters by keeping her heart rates high so he can't&nbsp;
see any fluctuation based on my decision making if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.480
i start taking short rapid breaths my pulse will&nbsp;
get faster creating a simulated panic response&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:38.000
this will throw tonight off his game giving me&nbsp;
a better chance to win before they begin kaiji&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
slams his head into the mirror and they think&nbsp;
he's gone crazy but it's all a part of his plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.240
he takes three of his citizen cards and hides them&nbsp;
on his chair before flipping the remaining two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.360
left on the table with tonight distracted by the&nbsp;
chairman kaiji switches a citizen card for his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.800
slave just as the man turns back around the host&nbsp;
checks his watch and sees his sensors going wild&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.280
fired up the kid slams his hand on the table&nbsp;
spilling blood all over his carts the loan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:07.200
shark tells him to calm down so he wipes his cards&nbsp;
and prepares to play the game of his life okay he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.280
shouldn't be calming down he's cut himself pretty&nbsp;
well but his vitals might go right back to normal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.080
after a few minutes i would want to guarantee we&nbsp;
had a level playing field for the entire game so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:20.640
i would go one step further and take one of these&nbsp;
glass shards to cut the microchip out of my arm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:25.040
they might object but this will make it impossible&nbsp;
for tony gawa to cheat even after my heart rate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:30.240
has calmed down he lays down his first card and&nbsp;
the kids fight heart rate is affecting his sensors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.320
nervous the man isn't sure what card to choose&nbsp;
but when they flip their cards the first turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:39.440
ends in a draw kaiji confidently plays his&nbsp;
next card when the host notices the blood state&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.000
he remembers that kaiji bled on his slave&nbsp;
and citizen cards earlier so there's a 50&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.880
chance it's the slave the man puts on a citizen&nbsp;
hoping to win for the turn end and yet another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.760
draw the next card he plays doesn't have a blood&nbsp;
stick so it should be a citizen but he's not sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:58.400
so he decides to play it safe and it's another&nbsp;
draw with two cards remaining kaiju here places&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.720
another card with a blood stain and tony gawa&nbsp;
here thinks it must be the slave but realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.040
that this could be a trick if the kid might&nbsp;
have switched his slave for a citizen card at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:12.480
the beginning of the match then both blood same&nbsp;
cards were actually citizens tonight here places&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.280
emperor card confident that he's one but kaiji&nbsp;
here has outplayed him he's just won the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:22.240
and it's taken tonight here completely by surprise&nbsp;
he tricked the man into thinking he swapped his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.800
card when he actually never changed them having&nbsp;
lost the match the host is sentenced to a lifetime&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.600
of working underground like all the other losers&nbsp;
in kaiji receives all the money he was promised&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.680
later he goes out to celebrate with the loan shark&nbsp;
over dinner and he gives her the money he owes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:41.280
but as they toast to his new and improved life he&nbsp;
suddenly blacks out okay this woman should not be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.120
trusted because she's already tried to screw you&nbsp;
over and now that you have lots of money there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.720
an even greater chance of that happening if&nbsp;
you're going to let a woman take this much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.960
money away from you then at least make her do&nbsp;
it through an alimony settlement after a long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.760
and unhappy marriage when he wakes up he finds a&nbsp;
loan shark is gone and she's stolen all his money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.920
the only thing she left him is to lose change&nbsp;
with a message saying she's cleared his debt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:11.840
with interest kaiji walks the city a free man but&nbsp;
he's got no idea that the games have only begun

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.040
you
