00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.130
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:08.180
Today I will show you an action, mystery,
sci-fi film from 2015, titled Self/less.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.340
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.250
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.330
Damian Hale, a successful businessman and
billionaire, is looking through large glass

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.570
windows in his skyscraper apartment in NYC.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.079
Behind him, a nurse is getting ready to leave
and is picking up her tools.

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.670
The billionaire has terminal cancer and barely
6 months left to live.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.649
Later, during lunch with his best friend Martin,
they discuss his illness and how he still

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.669
hasn’t told his daughter Claire about it.

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.980
Damian doesn’t have a good relationship
with Claire because he was a workaholic while

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.860
she was growing up and didn’t spend enough
time with her.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.100
Martin thinks that if Claire knows about the
illness, she will forgive him and they will

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.870
quickly make amends.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.460
Before Damian and Martin ways, the billionaire
asks his friend whether he heard of “shedding”

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.120
and Martin says no.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.650
While in his limousine Damian tries to call
Claire but she doesn’t answer.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.260
Then he pulls a business card of a company
named Phoenix Biogenetic and remembers the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.600
conversation he had with the company owner
– Dr. Albright.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.940
The doctor’s primary mission in life is
to offer humanity’s greatest minds a way

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.890
to extend their life and fulfill their full
potential.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.650
He has created a device that can transport
consciousness from one body to another – a

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.429
process known as shedding.

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:14.079
The company provides new bodies genetically
engineered to perfection to everyone willing

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:15.850
to pay big money for them.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.659
Damian remembers how he asked the doctor why
their service was still illegal.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.020
Albright said that he asked the wrong questions.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.820
The right question would be: “Do you feel
immortal?”

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.460
After going through these memories and wondering
whether to take Albright’s offer, Damian

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.740
goes to see Claire who is running a non-profit
organization.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.969
Wanting to make things right before dying,
he gives his daughter money but doesn't tell

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.569
her about the illness.

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.950
She refuses to take the money because she
thinks he’s manipulating her, expecting

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.310
his checkbook to solve every problem.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.499
Later Damian is sitting in his office, disappointed
with how things turned out with Claire.

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:50.520
Desperate to have another chance at life,
he continues to research shedding and Phoenix

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.520
Biogenic.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.749
He discovers that the procedure was invented
by Dr. Jensen and watches a video of him explaining

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.409
the philosophy behind it.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.159
Jensen wanted to free the mind from the body
and allow people to live even after the body

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.159
dies.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.859
But as Damian is researching shedding, he
starts coughing blood and faints.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.070
The illness is starting to consume him so
when he wakes up with breathing tubes attached

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.950
to his nose, he decides to call Albright and
schedule the procedure.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.100
Albright explains how after the switch, he
can’t contact anybody and that his old life

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.100
won’t exist.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.620
He also instructs him to come to New Orleans
and publicly fake his death.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.480
The next day, Damian’s on a plane and calls
Martin, asking if they can have lunch in New

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.830
Orleans.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.610
Before meeting him, he goes to the New Orleans
graveyard and buries a mysterious box near

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.860
one grave.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.380
At lunch with Martin, Damian fakes a seizure
and falls on the floor.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.810
Martin gets scared and calls 911.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.080
But instead of going to the hospital, the
ambulance vehicle takes the billionaire to

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.630
Phoenix Biogenic.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.360
They quickly start the procedure so they inject
Damian with a needle and put him in the machine

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.750
fully conscious.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.520
The strong lights and loud sounds make him
even more uncomfortable, but his perception

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.240
is quickly transferred into the new young
body.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.400
When Damian turns his head, he sees his old
body unconscious and dead.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.610
Shocked and disgusted, he throws up.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.670
Albright tells him that it will take a few
days to adapt while Damian starts hallucinating.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.530
Objects start morphing and he sees a picture
of a field with horses.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.810
The doctor then sarcastically says that death
has side effects.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.360
Damian now has to stay in the hospital and
go through training and physical therapy to

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.300
get used to his new body.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.940
Since he can’t go back to his new life,
Damian also has to learn a fake biography

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.590
and use a new name – Edward Kidner.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.891
After a brief phase of confusion and desperation,
he starts liking his new handsome self, but

00:03:27.891 --> 00:03:30.450
the hallucinations and headaches don’t go
away.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.110
Albright tells him that his mind still hasn’t
got used to the new neural structure so he

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.110
gives him pills that will help the transition.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.800
If Damian doesn’t take them, he might die
or have severe migraines and hallucinations.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.850
Also, he must stay in New Orleans to meet
with Albright regularly and get his weekly

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.320
pill supply.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.710
After Damian completes the training, he is
dropped at a large beautiful house in New

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.580
Orleans that is now his.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.170
Damian a.k.a. Edward, is quickly adapting
and sooner than later, starts playing basketball

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.350
in the neighborhood.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.350
There, he meets Anton who lives right next
to him and offers to take him out.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.030
That same night they go to a club and every
woman is staring at Damian who is now a handsome

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.180
young man.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.650
But he still isn’t used to answering questions
about his life, job, and age so people think

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.980
he’s a little weird.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.840
Despite this, Damian gets into a new routine
much sooner than expected.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.120
He starts hanging out with his friends, playing
basketball, sleeping with beautiful women,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.680
getting his pills, clubbing, and simply enjoying
life.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.020
After a while, this new routine doesn’t
satisfy him anymore, especially since he can’t

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.120
see his daughter.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.610
Distracted by his sadness, one day he forgets
to take his pill and soon after, starts hallucinating.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.480
He sees flashbacks of the army along with
images of a small town with a pumpkin tower.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.660
In his hallucinations, he also sees a mother
with her sick little daughter living in the

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.930
countryside.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.660
Since the hallucination is too vivid and strong,
Damian thinks it’s a memory.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.190
Later, he describes what he saw to Dr. Albright
who insists it’s just a mix of his old memories

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.850
and his current emotions.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.520
As a way to draw his attention to something
else, the doctor gives him tickets to Hawaii

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.340
and doubles his medication.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.740
He allso tells him that he saw a sick little
girl because he misses Claire and that the

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.930
Latina woman from his hallucination is probably
some one-night stand from his youth.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.460
But, Damian didn’t tell Albright that the
woman was Latina so he immediately stars suspecting

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.570
the doctor.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.710
He knows something is wrong so later tries
to find the pumpkin tower online.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.350
Turns out, there is an exact tower in a small
town in St. Louis.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.930
Looking for answers, he decides to trick Albright
and go to St. Louis instead of Hawaii.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.460
Before leaving, he goes to the graveyard and
digs up the box he buried.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.330
In it, there is money, documents, and credit
cards so he takes some and heads toward the

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.330
airport.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.020
One of Albright’s men follows him but Damian
quickly escapes his sight and catches a flight

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.460
to the small town.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.710
A few hours later, he arrives right at the
pumpkin tower he saw before.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.169
Next to the tower, he notices a house and
knocks at the door, but there’s nobody there.

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.889
Sensing there’s more that meets the eye,
Damian decides to enter the property and inside

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.139
sees medical bills and parts of a respirator
machine.

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.090
Most importantly, he sees a picture of Madeline
and Anna, the mother and daughter from his

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.460
hallucination.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.260
He also sees his new self in one of the pictures.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.730
Turns out, the body wasn’t genetically engineered
but was an actual person with a life.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.340
As he’s dealing with the uncomfortable truth,
Madeline returns home and points a gun at

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.770
him from behind.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.580
He tells her to calm down and slowly turns
toward her as she falls on the floor, crying

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.330
in disbelief because she thought her husband
was dead.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.400
As he tries to explain, Albright’s men come
into the house, knock out Madeline and try

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.020
to kidnap Damian.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.790
His friend Anton comes too since he was part
of the Phoenix Biogenetics and was spying

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.340
on him the whole time.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.270
Anton explains that Madeline’s husband,
Mark, agreed to give his body for money that

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.150
would cover his daughter’s treatment.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.580
Damian is shocked and confronts Anton, explaining
why Albright is a murderer.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.190
The spy then gives a coldhearted metaphor,
telling him that it’s normal to be upset

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.870
because he bought a new car and just found
out the car had a few miles on it.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.710
Also, even though he is angry, there’s no
point in coming back to the house since they

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.949
will assassinate Madeline and burn her property.

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:57.280
Luckily, the billionaire has a strong moral
compass so decides to trick Albright’s men

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.740
and save Madeline.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.770
He pretends to take his pills so he goes to
the bathroom and attacks one of the men there.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.130
With the help of Mark’s army instincts,
he kills a few of Albright’s men and goes

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.230
to wake up Madeline but loses his pills during
a fight.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.840
Anton and the others try to burn the house
down but Madeline and Damian go under the

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.550
platform and start shooting them in the legs.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.510
Soon after, Damian kills everyone and runs
toward the car with Mark’s wife.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.150
Damian lies to her and pretends to be her
husband, saying he agreed to do some dirty

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.840
work to pay for Anna’s medicine.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.870
Both of them head off to save Anna who is
at school.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.461
Anna also thinks Damian is her dad so she
runs toward him and hugs him, yelling that

00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:33.100
she knew he wasn’t dead.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.100
Later, the three of them book a stay at a
motel where Damian uses a computer to find

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.139
more about Phoenix Biogenic.

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:43.240
He discovers that Albright was a student of
Jensen and also finds the address of Phyllis,

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.950
Dr. Jensen’s wife.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.090
Because he doesn’t have any pills, he gets
a migraine and starts hallucinating again.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.830
Madeline gets worried but Damian knows what
to do.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.880
He decides to visit Phyllis and learn more
about the company.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.580
The next morning, they take the car and go
to the nursery home where Jensen’s wife

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.580
is staying.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.090
He poses as a student that’s doing research
about Jensen’s work and asks Phyllis to

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.669
give him the doctor’s old papers and documents.

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:09.280
The old woman has Alzheimer so she believes
Damian and starts telling him all sorts of

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.430
information.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.030
He finds out that Albright visits her every
week so he quickly figures out that Jensen

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.870
is using Albright’s body.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.930
He asks Phyllis to call Albright and invite
him to come.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:23.139
When the doctor arrives, Damian points a gun
at him, demanding more pills.

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:25.190
But Albright tells him a bitter truth.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:30.130
The more pills he takes, the more Mark disappears
along with his fighting skills and army training.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.589
Without the pills, Damian’s mind will fall
into oblivion and Mark will take over the

00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:34.589
body.

00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:37.940
Damian then kidnaps Albright and demands he
takes him to the lab.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.930
But as they start walking through the hallway,
Albright’s men attack and disarm him.

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:46.280
As they are taking Damian to a dark vehicle,
Madeline arrives and hits one of Albright’s

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.280
men.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.680
Turns out it was Anton in a new body.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.980
It’s not his first shedding and that’s
why he can quickly adapt to new vessels.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.260
Damian fights off the other guard but before
the young couple runs away, Anton warns Madeline

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.420
that Damian is hiding something and tells
her to ask him about their daughter's birthday.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.170
When Damian and Madeline get into their car,
the concerned mother insists they pull over

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.070
as soon as the coast is clear.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:11.110
She wants to get something straight, especially
after the interaction with Anton.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:15.130
She asks Damian about Anna’s birthday and
other details about their life together.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:19.020
When he can’t give any answers, he starts
explaining the situation while Anna observes

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.100
their fight from the car wondering whether
everything is okay.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.140
Madeline gets very agitated and angry because
Damian manipulated her and because she has

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.830
to disappoint her daughter.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.840
She doesn’t want to explain to Anna how
the man who looks exactly like her father

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.270
is in fact a stranger.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.860
But Albright’s men want to kill her too
so even though she doesn’t like or trust

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.460
Damian, she has to work with him to survive.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.320
The billionaire then thinks of plan – to
ask help from Martin and place Anna and Madeline

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.010
in a safe location.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.020
When they arrive at his friend’s mansion,
Damian convinces Martin of the truth by describing

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.300
details only the two of them know.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.010
Martin then agrees to help and organizes their
escape.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.010
Later, Damian tries to figure out how to explain
to little Anna that she’s never going to

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.670
see her father again.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.550
But he starts bonding with her, building new
beautiful father-daughter memories.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.050
He teaches her how to swim and they have a
great time together while Madeline observes

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.149
them from the window, happy.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:11.930
Since he is in her husband’s body, she feels
attracted to Damian so she asks to listen

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.610
to his heart and kisses him.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.220
Damian feels uncomfortable and so he starts
telling her about his previous life in order

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.300
to shift her attention from Mark.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.710
He opens up about his relationship with Claire
and they have an honest heart-to-heart conversation.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.399
But suddenly, Damian notices that all the
mirrors in the house are covered.

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:31.090
He knows that Martin’s son died two years
ago and quickly starts suspecting that something

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.200
is wrong.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.490
He runs and tries to find Anna who’s in
a large kid’s room playing with a little

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:36.490
boy.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.170
Damian immediately figures out that Martin
brought his child to Phoenix Biogenetic as

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.220
well, and gave him a new body.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.620
Turns out, Martin ratted them out to Albright
and that the killers are waiting outside to

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.760
kill them.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.390
But Damian confronts his friend and tells
him that the little kid’s body is not created

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.590
in a lab.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.270
It was a real person and someone else’s
child.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.300
Martin is shocked and disgusted so he decides
to help them, this time for real.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.270
He takes Madeline and Anna to a safe location
on foot through a forest while Damian drives

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.940
off in a car as bait.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.339
Soon after, he gets into a car chase with
Albright’s men who are trying to capture

00:11:07.339 --> 00:11:08.690
and kill him.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:12.030
After shooting and crashing their cars into
each other, all of them get into a massive

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.290
car accident.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.880
Damian gets out of the car and makes sure
everybody is dead before going to the diner

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.170
where he’s supposed to meet Madeline and
Martin.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.270
However, Martin’s the only one who arrives.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.959
He explains to Damian how Madeline and Anna
got ahead of him in the forest.

00:11:25.959 --> 00:11:28.930
They asked for help from a mysterious car
on the road.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.470
Little did they know, it was Albright’s
men so they got kidnapped and Martin couldn’t

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.480
do anything because they were far away.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.540
Damian also learns Martin planted the business
card from Phoenix Biogenetic as a way to help

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.540
him.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.720
Most importantly, he discovers that Martin
cracked the formula for Albright’s pills

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.050
and that he can engineer them from scratch.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:49.100
But Damian starts wondering whether he should
continue to take pills, especially since that

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.700
way, he’s killing Mark.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.430
He puts off that decision until later since
now he’s priority is to save Madeline and

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.430
Anna.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.220
The plan is to say off the pill for 12 hours,
hoping to use Mark’s memories to find more

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.600
information about the lab’s location.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.590
During his withdrawal, he sees a Mardi Gras
floats storage near Albright’s lab so he

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.840
heads to New Orleans to find the storage.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.750
The next day, he goes to New Orleans and finds
the lab exactly next to a Mardi Gras storage.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.120
He breaks in and attacks a few guards without
anybody noticing.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.070
But in the room where the machine transfers
consciousness, he sees two new bodies.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.149
Suddenly, Albright appears behind a glass
wall.

00:12:23.149 --> 00:12:26.950
He sarcastically tells Damian that Madeline
was the perfect body match for a new client

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.130
and that Anna’s organs won’t be wasted.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.779
Damian gets angry and shoots at the glass
that separates them when suddenly, two of

00:12:32.779 --> 00:12:34.930
Albright’s men appear and disarm him.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.810
His body will now be used as a new vessel
for Anton’s consciousness.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:43.520
Before stepping into the machine, Damian finds
a bullet and swallows it without anybody noticing.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.440
Next thing we know, Anton wakes up in Mark’s
body.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.300
Albright starts asking questions to determine
whether it’s really Anton.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.190
After he’s convinced, he sends him on a
mission to assassinate Madeline and Anna.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:58.089
But when Anton enters the room they are staying
at, he kills the guards instead and saves

00:12:58.089 --> 00:12:59.760
the mother and child.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.640
Turns out, it was Damian in Mark’s body
all along.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.779
The three of them start running away and fight
off Albright’s men.

00:13:05.779 --> 00:13:10.070
Soon, they end up in a room which separates
them from Albright with a glass wall.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.510
Damian tells the doctor that he carefully
listened to instructions before the first

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.510
procedure.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:18.120
He remembered that the transformation won’t
work if there is metal on the bodies.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.510
By swallowing a bullet, he managed to remain
in Mark’s body.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.500
Albright doesn’t think that Damian will
kill him because he’s the only one who has

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.930
the pill formula.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.120
But he doesn’t know that Martin cracked
the code, so Damian burns the doctor with

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.390
a torch.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:34.190
After they escape the lab, Anna and Madeline
go to a safe destination Martin found for

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:35.190
them.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.740
But Damian doesn't come along.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.120
Instead, he goes to see Claire.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.110
He poses as her father’s friend and starts
opening up.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.500
He tells Claire that Damian regretted not
spending time with her as a child and that

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.690
he was proud of her.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:50.470
Then, he gives her a letter and leaves but
not without glancing at her one more time

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.070
from outside the window.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:55.220
The next thing we see is Damian waking up
in a hotel room.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.550
He is confused and finds a video of himself
on a computer.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.460
Turns out, Damian isn’t in Mark’s body
anymore.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:05.110
The billionaire decided to get off the pill
and allow Mark to take over, giving him back

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.120
the life that was taken from him.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.710
Mark is in shock but he feels extremely grateful.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:16.850
He then goes to join Madeline and Anna who
are now living on a beautiful tropical island.
