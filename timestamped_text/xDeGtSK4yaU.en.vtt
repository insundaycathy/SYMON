00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.030
Welcome back to Movie Recapped.

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.780
Today I will show you a crime, thriller film
from 2013, titled Runner Runner.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.810
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.370
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.930
The story begins at Princeton University,
where student Richie Furst tells us he is

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.290
the guy to see when it comes to gambling.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.010
Richie is at the library when one of his teachers
approaches him: he gambled more than he should've

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.580
and lost, so he asks Richie for help.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.980
But Richie can't, he's only a referral.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.630
He shares his story then: he used to work
on Wall Street until the firm that employed

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.880
him blew up and he lost everything.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.690
We cut to a montage of various news headlines
that talk about gambling: they comment on

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.760
the new phenomenon that is online gambling,
how it's become incredibly common among college

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.540
students that use it to be able to afford
their college tuition, how casinos have gone

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.239
from seeing online gambling as competition
but now they have their own sites and own

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.140
revenue from them, how teenagers are the main
victims of these sites, the tales of there

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.340
being hackers that can see opponents' hands,
and lastly, they mention Ivan Block, king

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.940
of online gaming, being now on the FBI target
list but still immune to any potential charges

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.870
thanks to his operating outside federal jurisdiction
in Costa Rica.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.860
Back with Richie, he returns to his dorms
to find an urgent e-mail from the dean, asking

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.610
him to come to his office for an important
talk about his future in Princeton.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.890
Moments later, we find him in the middle of
that meeting with the dean and a fellow student

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.510
Richie referred to the gambling site in the
past.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.710
It was this young man that told on him when
his father found the gambling expenses on

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.320
his credit card, which Richie doesn't appreciate.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.820
Now the dean is scolding him for promoting
gambling on campus instead of working on his

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.500
master on finances.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.520
He reminds Richie gambling and bookkeeping
are forbidden on campus, and if Richie continues

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.130
with this little business of his, he'll be
forbidden on campus as well.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.800
The dean dismisses the other student then,
and Richie tries to defend himself saying

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.330
he didn't do anything wrong: he hasn't stolen
from anyone, he's just an employee for a website.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.250
Hhe needs this money to pay for his tuition
since he's not eligible for financial aid

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.970
because of his old job.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.090
This isn't good enough for the dean to get
off his case, but because professors have

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.950
talked highly of Richie and his grades are
pretty good, he is given one last chance:

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.840
he must close shop or say goodbye to Princeton.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.890
Richie returns to his room, where he realizes
he only has one choice: he must gamble all

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.000
his remaining money to get the amount he needs
to pay his debts.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.170
He starts playing poker online for a good
amount of hours while his friends cheer him

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.990
on, including Craig.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.900
The beginning is good: Richie knows all the
tactics and statistics, and he's playing on

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.160
more than one table at the same time.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.650
But little by little, his friends leave his
side and so does his luck: there's a particular

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.860
player that is sweeping the floor with him.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.210
That person is amazingly good - so good that
it's unrealistic.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.690
It feels like this person knew Richie's hand
at all times, and it makes him feel like he

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.470
got stabbed in the eye.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.770
Frustrated as he can be, he goes to one of
his friends in IT to ask for his opinion.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.180
His friend confirms what Richie has been suspecting:
that strange player had cheated.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.670
He needs to do something about it, so he decides
to visit his dad, Harry, who has gambled since

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.680
young and has an addiction problem.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.910
They haven't seen each other in years, so
Richie's visit comes as a big surprise.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.200
Harry thinks Richie is there to play, but
he's wrong: what his son wants is to know

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.310
if Harry has any contacts in Costa Rica that
could get him close to Ivan Block.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.069
But Harry knows nothing.

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.120
Days later, we see Richie leave the dorms
with his bags, intending to go to Costa Rica

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.410
to find Block.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.780
Craig tries to stop him by mentioning how
much of a crazy idea that is.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.200
Richie, sounding rather naive, says it's about
integrity in the business.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.550
Craig says an important guy like Block isn't
just going to receive Richie and give him

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.950
his money back, but Richie doesn't listen.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.790
This is his last chance.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.410
Hours later, Richie arrives Costa Rica, where
a gaming convention is being hosted.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.420
Outside the airport, he meets two fellow referrals:
Pet and Andrew Cronin.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.459
Neither of them knows how to reach Block.

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.070
Meanwhile, at a sauna house, Block is chatting
with two politicians, who accuse him of being

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.070
homesick.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.400
He denies this and tells them he's living
the best life, convincing them to comment

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.209
on his issues with the committee before sending
them off to a massage.

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.650
Richie takes a taxi at the airport that drops
him at the very humble hotel he's staying

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.650
at.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.330
In the balcony of his room, he bleaches and
inks some special papers, obviously with a

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.770
plan in mind.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.880
Hours later, he shows up at the gaming expo,
where he overhears a man asking a beautiful

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.670
woman, Rebecca Shafran, about Block since
she's his business partner.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.950
The man isn't successful, but that doesn't
Richie from trying too.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.880
He manages to impress her enough to get an
invitation to the company's party.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.620
The following night, during the party, Richie
approaches one of the security cameras and

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.780
takes out his bleached sheets of paper.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.669
They look empty at first but when he applies
UV light to them, a message appears that says

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.129
he has proof that was cheated out of his money
on Block's website.

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:24.409
Security picks him up and takes him to Block,
Rebecca is there too.

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:28.009
Richie explains his problem and tells him
about his proof: the results from the software

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:29.810
his friend at IT ran.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.629
He also tells Block that instead of going
to the news or the internet, he's come directly

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:34.629
to Block.

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:38.969
Block takes the report and tells him he appreciates
the gesture before simply dismissing him.

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:43.460
The next morning, the same security guys pick
up Richie and take him to Block's fancy boat.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.870
Block explains that it was some of his programmers
that cheated and were fired.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.009
The money has been returned to Richie's account,
but Block doesn't want Richie to leave yet.

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.490
He's impressed by his guts, honesty and intelligence,
and wants him to work for him, promising good

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.490
money.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.710
Richie accepts.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.379
We see a montage of Richie's new life next.

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.080
He's doing extremely well in this new job,
taking over a head position and even being

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.949
able to bring his friends Pet and Andrew to
work with him.

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.620
He's got everything he wants, except for one
thing: Rebecca.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.120
Soon we learn Block isn't as honest as he
looks.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.240
He pays a visit to Costa Rica gaming director
Herrera, whom he's been consistently bribing

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.880
to keep other politicians off his back.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.409
Herrera asks for more money, explaining how
the situation in the government is tense:

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:27.500
they don't like the kind of people these "gringos"
and their gambling bring to their country.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.729
Block is very angry by this, and leaves without
really agreeing to pay the rise.

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.509
Later that night, everyone is at yet another
party.

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:37.310
Richie approaches a dice table to help with
a vexed player.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.809
He takes over the dealer with Rebecca's support
and manages to make the guy lose and leave.

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:45.180
Rebecca and Richie move to the bar then, where
she tells him she's very impressed by him

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.370
but also that it's her job to be close to
him, it's only professional courtesy.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.440
Richie doesn't believe her.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.379
Through a text, Block invites Richie to join
him on the footbridge, where he's feeding

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:56.309
chickens to some crocodiles.

00:05:56.309 --> 00:06:00.270
He tells Richie about a guy coming from London:
Brett Sheck, or Shecky.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.111
He's a super affiliate for another website,
and Block wants him working for him, so he

00:06:04.111 --> 00:06:07.169
gives Richie the mission of bringing him over
to their company.

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:08.949
Richie accepts the job.

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.629
Days later, Rebecca is watching Richie leave
the place in a jeep, and Block approaches

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:14.999
her to ask her about her interest in Richie.

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:18.360
She says they're friends, and wonders if Block
wants her to stay away.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.349
He denies it, telling him to do whatever she
wants, because that's what he does too.

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.029
The jeep takes Richie to his destination,
but as soon as he comes out of it, he's jumped

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:27.379
on and kidnapped.

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:30.919
He's taken to an abandoned building where
he learns who is behind all this: Agent Eric

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:32.699
Shavers from the FBI.

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.319
He tells him he's kidnapped him so Block wouldn't
see them together, and that he wants Richie

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:39.990
to work as an insider in Block's company,
which is committing all kinds of crimes like

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.880
racketeering and bribing.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.119
Richie doesn't want anything to do with that,
but Shavers offers a deal and threat at the

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:49.190
same time: if Richie works for him, he'll
make his disciplinary issues at Princeton

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.279
disappear.

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:54.689
If he doesn't, he'll mark Richie as a felon
and he won't be allowed to re-enter the country.

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:58.349
After being freed, Richie hurries to find
Block, who is in the middle of a basketball

00:06:58.349 --> 00:06:59.349
game.

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:03.650
Richie tells him about his encounter with
the FBI, and Block isn't surprised by this,

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.339
since Shavers has been on his back for a while,
this encounter happened to him and other employees

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:08.380
as well.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.800
He tells Richie he can leave if he wants,
but he should think it over: they aren't doing

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.479
anything wrong, they're helping people get
the money they need to survive, Shavers is

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:19.930
just jealous and is trying to use Richie because
he doesn't have jurisdiction on this country.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.439
Block manages to convince Richie to stay.

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:25.439
The meeting with Shecky happens a few days
later at a bar.

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:29.100
He asks for the same deal he has with his
current company, which Richie can't give him,

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.759
so he asks for a day to see what he can do.

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:36.169
Shecky accepts if it's only one day, because
soon he must return to his pregnant wife.

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:39.669
Later at night, Richie meets with Block at
a casino to tell him how things with Shecky

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:42.460
went, and asks him for more room to negotiate.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.179
Block turns him down, because if they give
Shecky whatever he wants, all affiliates will

00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:47.629
ask for the same.

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:51.899
If Richie truly wants this bonus, he'll do
whatever needs to be done to get the deal.

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:56.300
The next day, Richie gifts Shecky an afternoon
alone in a boat with a crew of beautiful.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.659
He tells him to call him if he changes his
mind about the deal and leaves him to have

00:07:59.659 --> 00:08:00.659
fun.

00:08:00.659 --> 00:08:04.770
Hours later, at Shecky's hotel room, we see
Richie's plan come to light: he recorded Shecky

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:08.189
sleeping with the girls in the boat, and now
he is bribing him to sign for his company

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:10.279
so he won't tell his wife.

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:13.419
Devastated, Shecky has no other option but
to accept.

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:17.849
Hours later, back at Block's place, he congratulates
Richie for getting Shecky and his clients,

00:08:17.849 --> 00:08:19.969
and gives him extra cash as a bonus.

00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:23.129
That night, Richie goes to a party where he
meets Rebecca.

00:08:23.129 --> 00:08:27.400
After drinking and dancing, Richie and Rebecca
have a chat: there's obvious attraction between

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.509
them, but they think they can't do this.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:33.110
A moment later they end up making love behind
the bar's garden wall.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.779
In the morning, they make their way back on
foot.

00:08:35.779 --> 00:08:38.440
Rebecca tells him how Block and she built
all this together.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.570
They used to be in a relationship, but not
anymore.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.350
Later that day, back in Richie's place, he
finds Pet and Andrew arguing.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.949
Pet has bags with him and is ready to leave.

00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:52.320
When Richie asks why, Pet explains he was
kidnapped by the FBI too and now he's scared

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.150
he won't be able to return home, so he's going
back before he's blocked.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.699
Richie tries to tell him Shavers has nothing
to them but Pet doesn't listen: he's already

00:08:59.699 --> 00:09:02.350
got a position waiting for him on Wall Street.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:06.000
Andrew hears this and retrieves some money
he's hidden in cereal boxes, since maids never

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.639
check there, and gives it to Pet to invest
for him.

00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:11.240
Pet leaves after saying his goodbyes.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.620
Richie gets a call from Block then, who has
a special job for him.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.319
We see Richie going through the steps as Block
explains it through voice-over.

00:09:18.319 --> 00:09:22.430
Richie must go to the casino, get a key from
one of Block's security guys, Willson, then

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:27.240
go to the Cage and open box 765, retrieve
the contents of that box and take them to

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.639
Mr Herrera.

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:32.810
He does so later at night, visiting Herrera
at a bar where there are cops as well.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.440
Richie gives Herrera the suitcase and he passes
it to one of his officers, who takes it to

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.220
another room for control.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.160
He comes back to tell his boss there isn't
enough money.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.940
Herrera asks Richie about the rest and when
Richie says that's all, Herrera gets angry

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.839
and wonders if Block is trying to send him
a message.

00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:51.350
Richie doesn't know what to do, so he tells
Herrera he'll let Block know he's unhappy

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.649
and pays for everyone's tab.

00:09:53.649 --> 00:09:57.600
Herrera pretends to be satisfied by this and
sends Richie off, but he's jumped on by Herrera's

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.040
people as soon as he makes it outside.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.690
After they finish, Herrera says he's sending
a message to Block too.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.720
He rushes back to Block's place, where Richie
confronts him, angrily accusing him of sending

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.149
him to be beaten.

00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:13.129
Block doesn't care, he tells him that if he
wants a safer job or a cleaner conscience,

00:10:13.129 --> 00:10:16.459
he can go work somewhere else, because this
is how the gambling business works and he

00:10:16.459 --> 00:10:19.370
would send Richie to be beaten up again if
necessary.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.660
Richie leaves, and Willson asks Block if he
knew this would happen.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.110
Block explains things are escalating: six
months ago, Herrera wouldn't have touched

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:29.470
anyone Block knows, so they better move up
the timetable.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:33.300
The next day, we see Richie at the airport,
trying to leave the country.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.839
But he's stopped at customs and taken to an
interrogation room where a cop plants illegal

00:10:36.839 --> 00:10:38.740
substances in his bag.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.279
Shavers arrives then and Richie finally admits
the agent was right about everything and that's

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:45.160
why he's trying to leave, but Shavers doesn't
let him.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.649
He says he can get him out of this but Richie
needs to truly help them.

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:52.110
Since that cop isn't under Block's payroll,
Richie wonders why he doesn't arrest him since

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.380
cops do have jurisdiction here, unlike the
FBI.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.060
The officer reacts by pushing back with the
table.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.399
He can't arrest him because Block will just
pay judges and jury off and he'll lose his

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:02.529
job.

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:05.840
Richie has no other option but to accept to
help Shavers.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.060
Richie returns to the company and goes to
see Andrew, who tells him he's been doing

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.080
some serious look into the company's software
and has discovered something huge: Block is

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.339
running a Ponzi scheme; the players' accounts
have no actual money, and Block uses the money

00:11:17.339 --> 00:11:20.940
as his own bank account, keeping just enough
to allow players to cash out when they need

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:21.940
to.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.259
One of Block's people interrupts their talk
and takes Richie to see Block, who is aware

00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:27.209
Richie is trying to run away.

00:11:27.209 --> 00:11:29.870
Block's found footage of Richie's father at
a casino.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.139
Henry owed money to some dangerous people
and he was about to be arrested before Block

00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:35.129
saved him and paid for his debt.

00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:38.850
With the debt belonging to Block now, so does
Richie's father, which is clearly a threat

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.000
to Richie even if he doesn't put it in those
exact words.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.220
Richie says thank you, pretending to appreciate
the gesture.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:49.129
After leaving the office, Richie visits his
dad at the hotel Block put him in.

00:11:49.129 --> 00:11:52.779
Henry takes him to the balcony and tells him
he knows what all this is really about.

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:56.310
He gives Richie permission to run away without
worrying about the consequences, he's lived

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.129
enough and he's ready to go.

00:11:58.129 --> 00:12:01.069
But Richie cares about his dad, so he stays.

00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:04.899
In order to save himself and his dad, Richie
starts working on a plan.

00:12:04.899 --> 00:12:08.570
Since payoffs and bribes are how the casino
business works, he starts doing some bribing

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.949
of his own, passing money to various cops
and people under the Willson's careful watch.

00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:16.709
Back at the company, Richie gets a call from
Andrew, telling him Shavers approached him

00:12:16.709 --> 00:12:18.980
and admitting he was right about everything.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.579
Andrew has found more evidence of criminal
activity but doesn't tell him what it is,

00:12:22.579 --> 00:12:25.000
just asks him to go see him in person.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.449
Richie intends to do exactly that but Willson
gets in his way and drags him into a boat

00:12:28.449 --> 00:12:31.160
ride to go see Block by a river harbor.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.959
Herrera and one of his men are there, hands
tied up, and Herrera asks for his friend to

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:37.360
be freed because the problem is with him.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.819
Block ignores his request before covering
them in chicken fat for a bet: they throw

00:12:40.819 --> 00:12:44.500
them in the river and see how long it takes
for the crocodiles to get them.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.660
Richie tries to stop them to no avail.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.890
The clock ticks and the crocodiles don't come,
for a moment Block thinks it's just a legend

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.870
but he's quickly proven wrong: some crocodiles
do arrive and attack.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.210
Willson shoots them away but they only manage
to save Herrera.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:02.189
Richie is disgusted and upset by all this,
but pretends to be fine.

00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:06.250
Later that night, Richie returns to his apartment
to find it rumbled it up and Andrew nowhere

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.250
in sight.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.940
Rebecca arrives then and after checking she
wasn't sent by Block, Richie tells her Andrew's

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.800
disappeared and that he was cooperating with
the feds, which he's sure Rebecca knew, but

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.129
she denies it.

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:19.600
Richie says he can't trust her, that she knew
Block was going to use him.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.209
To prove him wrong, Rebecca reveals that Block
and her will leave the country in a week and

00:13:23.209 --> 00:13:26.389
will leave the company and all its problems
under Richie's name.

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:29.920
She only learned about all the crimes after
she was too far in, too many paper trails

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.399
incriminated her.

00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:35.170
She apologizes and Richie tells her that if
she means it, she will help.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.940
The bribing of cops and people continues the
next few days, including secret meetings with

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.209
Rebecca and also Herrera's people.

00:13:41.209 --> 00:13:45.220
They tell Richie Herrera has left the country,
so Richie bribes them as well.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.399
His last visit of the day is to El Capitán,
and after having a drink with him at bar,

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:52.449
Richie is chased by the FBI as soon as he
steps outside.

00:13:52.449 --> 00:13:56.129
They corner him in an abandoned building and
ask him about Andrew, Richie tells them he's

00:13:56.129 --> 00:13:59.509
disappeared and calls them out for not protecting
his friend and dad.

00:13:59.509 --> 00:14:03.519
The cop punches him for that comment and almost
throws him off the building, but Shavers saves

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:06.509
him and asks the cop to take a picture of
them together with his gun.

00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:10.629
He blackmails Richie then: he has 48 hours
to give him evidence on Block or that picture

00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:12.379
will ruin his life.

00:14:12.379 --> 00:14:16.420
Richie hurries back to his apartment and tries
to find Andrew's USB-stick, he finds it inside

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.970
a cereal box and checks it on his computer.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.180
There's enough evidence there to put Block
and himself away for life.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.529
He meets Rebecca a few hours later and tells
her what he's found out while she tells him

00:14:25.529 --> 00:14:29.730
they're packed and leaving to Antigua in 48
hours, but she's still with Richie.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.250
Block interrupts them then, so Richie leaves.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.810
He returns to his apartment and grabs the
last of the money that he takes to El Capitán

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:36.939
at a bar.

00:14:36.939 --> 00:14:40.980
When he's leaving, Willson finds him and threatens
him because he knows who El Capitán is and

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.040
what he does.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.879
The people Richie has been paying off come
in to save him.

00:14:44.879 --> 00:14:48.379
While he watches them, Shavers calls Richie
and tells him they found Andrew, hurt but

00:14:48.379 --> 00:14:49.610
alive.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.529
Richie tells him that he'll give him something
better than evidence.

00:14:52.529 --> 00:14:56.639
We cut to the company then, which is now empty
and being raided by the police.

00:14:56.639 --> 00:15:00.199
Block timed it all perfectly, having left
before the cops arrived.

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:03.690
Block calls Richie from the airport and Richie,
at the office, pretends not to know what's

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.019
going on.

00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:08.629
Block tells him he'll be arrested and the
problems are his now, he's leaving.

00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:12.999
We see him board his private plane with Rebecca,
they leave after Willson doesn't show up.

00:15:12.999 --> 00:15:16.850
Meanwhile, Richie pays off one of the raiding
cops to allow him to enter the company's port

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.019
and climbs on a plane as well, where his dad
is waiting.

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:23.650
Both planes arrive at the same airport hours
later, and Richie confronts Block when he

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.800
steps out.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.149
He comments on how Block planned all perfectly
to manipulate him, but Block doesn't care,

00:15:29.149 --> 00:15:31.240
he says he owns this place too.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.320
Richie reveals his plan then: they aren't
in Antigua, they're in Puerto Rico, American

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.629
territory.

00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:40.560
Rebecca was part of this plan and so was the
pilot of Block's plane: El Capitán.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.220
The FBI arrives and Shavers arrests Block,
but no Richie because he's a cooperator.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.829
He does intend to debrief him though, but
Richie is leaving with Rebecca on her plane.

00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:53.050
Shavers send cars after him, but stops the
chase when an envelope arrives and finds the

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.720
USB stick with the evidence inside.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.029
Richie is free.

00:15:57.029 --> 00:16:03.760
The movie ends with Richie and Rebecca enjoying
the plane ride and planning their new life.
