a hidden place on top of the cupboard the police&nbsp;
immediately cordoned off the scene and launched an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.400
investigation so ben had to stay with his sister&nbsp;

at the launch the two old elderly appealed&nbsp;
to their fans to help find their daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.640
the case of amy's disappearance sparked public&nbsp;
debate at the same time the police made an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.720
important discovery after the investigation the&nbsp;
policewoman found a strange letter in the closet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.520
which seemed to have some kind of clue written&nbsp;
on it ben explained that it was a little game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.520
of treasure hunt between him and amy every year on&nbsp;
their wedding anniversary amy would break down the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.240
location of the hidden gift into several clues&nbsp;
and hide them in envelopes leading to the gifts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.880
this letter should be the first clue this year ben&nbsp;
soon had an answer and he brought the policewoman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.200
to his office it turned out that ben teaches in&nbsp;
a university as a part-time teacher in the office&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.280
then they did find a second envelope with clues&nbsp;
inside pointing to a brown hut the policewoman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.240
also found sexy red underwear in the corner of&nbsp;
the office which made ben extremely embarrassed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.000
ben said he did not know the location of the&nbsp;
little brown hut but that night he sneaked off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.160
alone to his father's old house it turns out that&nbsp;
ben's father's name is brown so ben knows that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.760
the brown hut refers to his father's house the&nbsp;
third envelope was on the table of the cottage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.520
at this moment the police tracked it down then&nbsp;
panicked and hid the envelope in his pocket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.640
faced with the police's question he&nbsp;
explained that this is his father's old house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.080
he would come over once a week and the exterior of&nbsp;
this cottage is blue it's definitely not a brown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.160
cottage after saying that ben drove away and&nbsp;
the police used a flashlight to shine the hut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.120
which was indeed blue however it is obvious&nbsp;
that he got to be guilty of something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.160
not only the police but also the crowds think that&nbsp;
ben was suspicious the media issued two photos of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.800
him one was taken at the press conference of&nbsp;
ben giggling next to his wife's search notice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.960
the second is a photo of him with the reporter&nbsp;
still with a silly smile how can a man still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.440
laugh when his wife is missing would the murderer&nbsp;
be himself everyone pointed their fingers at ben&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.480
to come the public opinion ben attended amy's&nbsp;
blessing events he explained that the smile on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.120
the photo was just out of politeness and&nbsp;
then with a sad face he told how much he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.680
was worried and missed his wife the crowd of&nbsp;
onlookers was finally moved by it just then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.640
a female neighbor suddenly jumped out and loudly&nbsp;
questioned what ben had done to his pregnant wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.280
the whole crowd was stunned why had ben never&nbsp;
mentioned such important news about the pregnancy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.920
ben himself was so confused that&nbsp;
he had to flee the scene in a hurry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.760
seeing that he could not defend himself the police&nbsp;
soon came back to the door and they now suspected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.360
that this was not a case of disappearance but&nbsp;
a case of murder the number one suspect is ben&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.120
as the investigation progressed more suspicions on&nbsp;
ben all of the family's property is in amy's name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.920
including the ben's bar second ben's credit&nbsp;
debt is high he also suddenly bought a life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.760
insurance for amy third if the kidnapper and&nbsp;
amy had a fight how could all the furnishings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.360
be neat and tidy except for the chairs and&nbsp;
coffee table obviously the struggle marks in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.280
the living room came from deliberate faking and&nbsp;
the real crime scene was in the kitchen besides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.920
lumino testing showed that there was a large&nbsp;
amount of blood residue cleaned off the floor and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.160
these blood stains matched with amy's the hospital&nbsp;
visit record showed that amy was indeed pregnant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.200
in addition the police found an unburned&nbsp;
diary and a bloodstained stick in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.120
fireplace of ben's father's cabin the diary&nbsp;
was filled with amy's accusations against ben&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.920
ben was thus discontented and became&nbsp;
increasingly indifferent to his wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.520
amy tried to use the child to keep their marriage&nbsp;
together but when he learned that his wife was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.760
pregnant her husband not only did not have a trace&nbsp;
of joy but coldly pushed her to the ground it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:36.080
obvious that ben did not want the child at the&nbsp;
end of the diary amy wrote i think he will kill me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.240
in this case the murder's motives are all clear&nbsp;
a terrible kill his pregnant wife's husband in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.440
order to get rid of the marriage and get the&nbsp;
high insurance payments in the face of police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.600
questioning ben denied it repeatedly and finally&nbsp;
broke the cup in anger refusing to answer any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.480
questions and remaining silent is the right of&nbsp;
the suspect so the police can do nothing about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.000
him the only thing that can be done now is to find&nbsp;
the body so that evidence can be found to bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.240
the killer to justice but where exactly is amy&nbsp;
in fact she did not die at all amy is hiding in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.960
another city secretly focusing on the farce which&nbsp;
is all her revenge on her scum husband not long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.000
after the marriage amy found out that the perfect&nbsp;
guy is just ben's disguise when they're in love&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.400
he is actually a lazy person and a philanderer amy&nbsp;
knows that she is not ben's ideal wife candidate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.080
the two imperfect people put up with each other&nbsp;
until another cool girl appears at school who was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.840
younger and more energetic amy could not stand it&nbsp;
any longer so this highly intelligent woman had a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.880
bold plan the first step to make good relations&nbsp;
with the gossipy neighbor reveal the secret of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.880
her husband as a domestic violence bastard the&nbsp;
second step is to secretly max out your husband's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.400
credit card making the illusion that he is short&nbsp;
of money and cajole him to sign on her insurance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.040
the third step is to compose a diary and&nbsp;
carefully fabricate the image of a miserable wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.400
in this way the motive and evidence for killing&nbsp;
his wife to cheat the insurance payments are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.360
available the next step is to set up the scene of&nbsp;
the murder on the day of the wedding anniversary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.320
the show officially began amy first extracted&nbsp;
her own blood and splashed it on the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.600
then broke the coffee table in purpose to make&nbsp;
a fake kidnap scene then throw her diary and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.840
would stick into the fireplace leaving both&nbsp;
things half burnt to make the police think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.720
that the husband didn't have enough time to&nbsp;
destroy the evidence and weapon a memorial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:38.320
day scavenger hunt is the best way to lead the&nbsp;
deceased had better be a poor pregnant woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.400
amy invited a pregnant female neighbor to her home&nbsp;
as a guest and took the opportunity to extract the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.960
other woman's urine which was then sent to the&nbsp;
hospital for leaving a pregnancy record after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.640
doing all this amy disguised herself and took a&nbsp;
black car to a strange city then rented a small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.320
cheap hotel and secretly observed the development&nbsp;
everything was exactly as she had envisioned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.320
although the case was not yet closed ben had&nbsp;
become the acknowledged murderer the media are all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:12.160
over the case public opinion is in an uproar the&nbsp;
crowd is furious and ben has become a street rat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.240
but amy's plan is not over yet she is ready to&nbsp;
throw herself into the seat three months later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.680
so as to make the husband's murder&nbsp;
charge and send him to the gallows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.840
she will not make ben's life easy&nbsp;
since he didn't treat her well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.520
however the plan failed to catch up with the&nbsp;
change amy was pleased until being noticed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.800
a group of gangsters living next door to the&nbsp;
hotel they found out that amy was hiding her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.680
identity so she did not dare to call the police&nbsp;
then they robbed her of all the cash with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:48.480
amy became penniless at once she had no choice&nbsp;
but to go to his ex-boyfriend and lie that she had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:54.560
been abused which is why she planned this runaway&nbsp;
the ex-boyfriend not only believed the rhetoric&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.920
but also prepared a luxury villa for her but when&nbsp;
she got there amy realized that he wanted to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:05.040
the opportunity to imprison her the house is full&nbsp;
of cameras the door is equipped with a combination&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:11.360
lock she simply cannot go out after she came in&nbsp;
on the other side ben finally solves the puzzle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.440
in the third letter the clue that points&nbsp;
to the small woodshed of his sister's house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.240
it was filled with his favorite expensive gaming&nbsp;
equipment those are stolen from ben's credit card&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.680
ben finally realized the fact that he had&nbsp;
been fooled by his wife but these things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.400
could not be used as evidence at all because&nbsp;
he cannot prove that these were bought by amy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.240
he can only sit on his own financial problems dot&nbsp;
however then also that he couldn't cope with this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:44.160
clever woman with his own intelligence dot so he&nbsp;
spent a lot of money to find an experienced lawyer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:50.400
after hearing what happened the lawyer directly&nbsp;
asked ben to go to amy's ex-boyfriends hoping to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:56.000
dig up the negative information of this woman so&nbsp;
that they can easily worsen amy's reputation the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.120
ex-boyfriends are simply not willing to help ben&nbsp;
so ben had to find another ex-boyfriend of amy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.440
this guy told ben that amy has a strong desire to&nbsp;
control he chose to break up because he could not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.720
stand each other at that time amy became angry&nbsp;
and even falsely accused himself of assaulting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.760
her ex-boyfriend so he left a criminal record&nbsp;
and cannot find any evidence of innocence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.200
the ex-boyfriend told ben that it&nbsp;
seems to be useless to defame her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.040
the lawyer gave ben another idea that is to&nbsp;
take the initiative to admit their mistakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:32.240
to clear their own image of a bad guy to do this&nbsp;
the lawyer gave ben special training in acting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:38.400
carefully designed every line every expression&nbsp;
in the following media interview ben's acting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.920
skills exploded perfectly portrayed the image of&nbsp;
a prodigal husband he also tearfully applied for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.920
a confession to his wife sincerely apologized and&nbsp;
called on amy to return to him as soon as possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:55.360
this works the direction of public opinion on the&nbsp;
internet reversed many people began to praise ben&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.240
for his commitment and deep love even amy couldn't&nbsp;
help but look at her husband differently after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:06.400
watching the show of course she was not impressed&nbsp;
by ben but such a good at disguise merit in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.760
heart of the man is the perfect husband in her&nbsp;
own minds thinking of this amy suddenly did not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.680
want to die again she wanted to return to ben now&nbsp;
the rich ex-boyfriend who imprisoned her becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:23.280
the only obstacle soon she comes up with a new&nbsp;
plan as the rich ex-boyfriend leaves the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:28.880
amy started her show she first tied a rope around&nbsp;
her ankles then hurt herself with a wine bottle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:34.640
then poured red wine on his skirt to disguise&nbsp;
it as blood then she ran under the camera probe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.680
and let out a whale of pain leaving evidence&nbsp;
of his captivity and abuse with superb acting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.720
when the ex-boyfriend came back amy&nbsp;
slashed his neck and caused him to death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.640
in this way amy smoothly escaped from the&nbsp;
villa covered in blood to return to her husband&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.840
under the crowd of countless reporters the&nbsp;
couple embraced each other with deep emotion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.840
afterward the two came to the police station and&nbsp;
amy told the police that it was her ex-boyfriend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.000
who had kidnapped and imprisoned her and&nbsp;
used every means to inflict violence on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.960
her she had to find an opportunity to kill the&nbsp;
perverted maniac in order to protect herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.360
the surveillance in the villa the bruises&nbsp;
on her body all proved that amy did not lie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.960
as the evidence was overwhelming and the&nbsp;
experience described by amy was so vivid that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:26.080
it could not be seen as false the police finally&nbsp;
decided that she was justified in self-defense and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.800
acquitted her and the disappearance case came to&nbsp;
an end amy showed up again in the spotlight with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.240
a wound after coming back home and closing the&nbsp;
door she removed all the pretense calmly admit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:42.480
that the ex-boyfriend is just a poor scapegoat&nbsp;
she was the one who cut his neck after saying that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.960
amy proudly advised her husband not to try to&nbsp;
leave her because the two of them have been&nbsp;&nbsp;
