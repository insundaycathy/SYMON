00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.040
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going&nbsp;
to explain an American dystopian action film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:15.920
called “Chaos Walking,” Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care! 
 
&nbsp;

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.400
The movie is set on a planet far, far away from&nbsp;
earth called the New World. A planet where the sun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.600
never sets. It is the year 2258 AD. Searching&nbsp;
for a better life, some humans left earth and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.280
colonized a part of the planet. Humans have&nbsp;
found everything they had back on earth and more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.320
in the New World. When humans first entered the&nbsp;
new planet, they realized that all men have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.200
afflicted with a condition called the Noise. This&nbsp;
condition causes everyone to see and hear a man’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.720
thoughts. Although this condition lays bare one’s&nbsp;
secret thoughts and hence can be a disadvantage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.680
one can do other cool things like&nbsp;
creating 3D holograms using their noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.640
which others can see with their naked eyes. 
The human colonists were involved in a bitter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.240
civil war with the native humanoid species&nbsp;
referred to as The Spackle. In the war,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.040
the spackle ostensibly killed all the&nbsp;
female human colonists while half the men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.240
survived. Since then, the first wave of&nbsp;
human colonists lost contact with the earth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.880
and the outside world. Todd Hewitt is a young man&nbsp;
who lives in the human colony called Prentisstown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.000
Todd lost his mother and father at a young age&nbsp;
in the war and lives with his adoptive fathers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.320
Ben Moore and Cillian Boyd. Unlike his fathers,&nbsp;
Todd has never seen a woman. He spends most of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.600
time helping his fathers in the field. One day,&nbsp;
he aspires to be a man like the colony’s mayor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.640
David Prentiss. Unlike other men, Prentiss&nbsp;
has mastered the art of controlling his Noise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.880
making his thoughts difficult to see and&nbsp;
hear. Other prominent residents of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.840
town include the eccentric preacher&nbsp;
Aaron and David Prentiss’s son Davy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.960
Todd doesn’t see eye to eye with Davy as both&nbsp;
always compete to win the mayor’s approval.
&nbsp;

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.080
One day, the second wave of human colonists&nbsp;
arrive onboard a mothership. They send a small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.520
scout ship carrying three human crew members to&nbsp;
investigate the planet and make contact with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.880
first wave of human colonists. Unfortunately,&nbsp;
upon entering New World’s atmosphere, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.640
scout ship catches fire and crashes deep in the&nbsp;
woods near Prentisstown. While helping his dad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.920
Todd spots someone stealing food from his barn.&nbsp;
He chases the thief into the woods with his dog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.280
Manchee. He eventually loses the thief but comes&nbsp;
across the crash site. He speculates that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.640
survivor must have been the thief. He immediately&nbsp;
rushes to inform the mayor about the spaceship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.360
On his way, he tries to keep quiet, but the other&nbsp;
men hear and see his thoughts about the crashed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.160
ship, and they all head to investigate the crash&nbsp;
scene and scavenge some parts of the ship. 
&nbsp;

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.800
After learning that the survivor didn’t have any&nbsp;
noise, Mayor Prentiss concludes that it must be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.320
a girl and orders his men to look for her. 
While Todd is alone, the girl reveals herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.840
Todd is scared, shocked, and enchanted to&nbsp;
see a girl, as he has never seen one before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.400
But unable to control his noise, Todd&nbsp;
unintentionally alerts the town dwellers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.960
about her whereabouts. The girl runs deeper&nbsp;
into the woods, but Prentiss surrounds her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.320
with a 3D hologram cage and captures her.
Prentiss takes her to his home and expresses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.760
his condolences to her over the loss of the other&nbsp;
two crew members. The girl learns about the noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.640
and the war with the Spackle, which resulted&nbsp;
in the massacre of all women of Prentisstown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.720
Prentiss asks her about her mission, and she&nbsp;
tells him that she came here on a scout ship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.000
sent by the mothership to make contact with the&nbsp;
first wave colonies. The mothership is the largest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
ship in the second colonists’ fleet and holds 4000&nbsp;
people. It will soon come to rescue her. The girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.720
starts getting suspicious of Prentiss’s intention&nbsp;
when he keeps pressing her more about the ship,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.760
inquiring about its landing site and time. 
Prentiss is suddenly forced to go outside to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.360
address the men, who are creating a lot of noise&nbsp;
and burning with curiosity about the female guest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.160
Before leaving, Davy is charged with keeping&nbsp;
an eye on her. The spoiled brat starts going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.080
through the girl’s bag and unwittingly toys&nbsp;
with one of her gadgets, which causes it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.280
to shoot sparks, helping her disappear.
While escaping, the girl overhears Prentiss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.400
talking to the town’s influential preacher Aaron&nbsp;
from under the floorboards. Prentiss says he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.600
fed up with living in “exile.” He plans to seize&nbsp;
her colony's mothership and use it to take over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.800
the rest of the planet. He says they must prevent&nbsp;
her from contacting and warning the mothership.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.440
Meanwhile, the preacher is convinced that the&nbsp;
girl is an angel descended from heaven to punish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.000
the men of Prentisstown for their “sins.”
As Prentiss and others venture out to look for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.040
the girl, Todd steals the girl’s bag from the&nbsp;
mayor’s home, hoping to find some “cool stuff.”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.640
After returning home, Todd starts going through&nbsp;
the bag, but to his surprise, he finds the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.760
hiding in his barn. Suddenly, one of Prentiss’s&nbsp;
men comes looking for the girl after spotting her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.360
jacket nearby. Todd lets the girl hide and sends&nbsp;
the man away. Ben and Cillian learn about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.840
girl and lock her in the barn. They tell their&nbsp;
son he must give the girl back to Prentiss to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.840
avoid attracting any trouble, but Todd refuses&nbsp;
to comply. Todd has started liking the girl and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.120
insists on helping her. Ben and Cillian eventually&nbsp;
relent, releasing this might be the only chance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.160
Todd will get of starting his own family.
Ben tells Todd to take the girl to Farbranch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.480
another human town on the planet, which&nbsp;
Todd never knew existed. Cillian worries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.880
that people there are hostile to Prentisstown&nbsp;
men, but Ben assures him that they won’t harm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.600
Todd as long as the girl accompanies her. 
But before Todd could leave with the girl,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.720
Prentiss and his men arrive looking for her. The&nbsp;
girl escapes on a motorcycle while Todd chases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.720
after her on a horse. Upset at Todd for hiding&nbsp;
the girl, Prentiss kills Cillian. Giving Ben a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.640
chance to save his own and Todd’s life, Prentiss&nbsp;
then asks him to help find Todd and the girl.
&nbsp;

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.200
Todd eventually catches up to the girl. After&nbsp;
losing their motorcycle and horse to an accident,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.400
they both set out on foot to Farbranch,&nbsp;
accompanied by Todd’s dog. Along their journey,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.000
Todd finally gets to know a girl. He is amazed by&nbsp;
her strength and at times finds himself struggling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.040
to keep up with her speed. She initially doesn’t&nbsp;
trust him, but Todd eventually wins her trust&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.800
and hunts a snake for lunch for her. She finally&nbsp;
tells Todd that her name is Viola. She was born&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.000
on the mothership, and her parents died during&nbsp;
the 64 year-long journey from Earth to the New&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.960
World. Viola’s grandparents signed up for the&nbsp;
journey, hoping to find better opportunities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.120
on the far away planet. Enroute to Farbranch, Todd&nbsp;
is attacked by a Spackle. Todd subdues the Spackle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.080
and proceeds to kill it, but Viola teaches&nbsp;
him kindness and asks him to let it go.
&nbsp;

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.880
They arrive at Farbranch and learn that it&nbsp;
is inhabited by men, women, and children.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.840
They are greeted by the town’s mayor Hildy.&nbsp;
Unaware of Farbranch’s dislike for Prentisstown,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.520
Viola discloses that Todd is from Prentisstown.&nbsp;
Todd is immediately put in handcuffs while Hildy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.480
talks to Viola in private. The town’s men&nbsp;
confront Todd, but after talking to Viola,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.240
the mayor tells them to back off.
Prentiss and his men continue to pursue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.720
Todd and the girl. Preacher Aaron is&nbsp;
becoming increasingly unstable and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.640
at times, clashes with Prentiss. Mayor Hildy&nbsp;
gives Todd and Viola shelter and food. She also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.520
tells them that Viola can make contact with her&nbsp;
mothership from Haven, the first human settlement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.480
in the New World, which Todd didn’t know about&nbsp;
either. Viola decides to head for Haven the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:34.160
morning. Seeing her so adamant about leaving, Todd&nbsp;
starts wondering what if Viola stayed with him and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:42.880
kissed him instead. Of course, Viola hears his&nbsp;
thoughts, and Todd, embarrassed, apologizes. 
&nbsp;

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.240
After dinner, Hildy gives them separate rooms to&nbsp;
rest, but the thought of Viola leaving doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.920
let Todd sleep. He finds his mother’s journal that&nbsp;
Ben put in his bag and shows it to Viola, who also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.400
is still awake. Viola asks him what his mother&nbsp;
has written, and Todd reveals that he doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.920
know because he can’t read. Prentiss town’s mayor&nbsp;
Aaron burned all the books when Todd was a child.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:11.840
He felt that being born with a noise was enough&nbsp;
of an education. Viola offers to read it for Todd.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:17.840
Todd’s mother's name is Karyssa. Karyssa writes,&nbsp;
“My dearest Todd. I begin this journal on the day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.560
of your birth. You’re the most beautiful thing&nbsp;
I’ve seen in New World. I wish your pa were here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.440
to see you, but the Lord saw fit to take him. 
You’re going to be tall, strong, and handsome&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.080
like your pa. The ladies of New World won’t know&nbsp;
what hit ‘em. There’s a man named David Prentiss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.480
who convinced us all to find a settlement on&nbsp;
the far side of the swamp so that the noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.600
from the rest of the New World won’t reach us.&nbsp;
Prentiss seems so full of secrets and shame,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.720
and this place doesn't allow that. He’s better&nbsp;
at making his noise disappear than any man here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.360
It’s so loud here all the time. The men can’t&nbsp;
stand women knowing everything about them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.480
and them not knowing anything about us. Almost&nbsp;
all the men here, they’re breaking down. Prentiss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.440
and Aaron are getting inside the men’s heads.&nbsp;
They’ve given all us women a curfew. The men are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.960
turning on us. Aaron, our holy man, said women&nbsp;
don’t have Noise because we’ve got no souls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.320
I can see what’s coming clear as day. If&nbsp;
things go wrong, keep searching for hope.”
&nbsp;

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.040
Todd realizes that the women were not killed by&nbsp;
the native aliens, but rather by Prentiss and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.720
men of Prentisstown. He feels angry and betrayed&nbsp;
that everything he had been told was a lie. 
&nbsp;

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.520
Prentiss and his men arrive at Farbranch&nbsp;
demanding Viola. Hildy and other Farbranch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.960
town dwellers distract them while Todd and Viola&nbsp;
try to escape. Preacher Aaron discovers them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.520
forcing them to hide inside a storeroom.&nbsp;
A Farbranch woman helps them keep Aaron&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.760
and other men away with a rifle. 
Prentiss sends Ben to convince Todd to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.440
surrender Viola in exchange for sparing Todd’s&nbsp;
life. Todd confronts Ben about the journal. Ben&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.240
admits that he tried but couldn’t do anything&nbsp;
to help the women. It was chaos. The best he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:57.840
could do was keep Todd safe. Ben apologizes to&nbsp;
him for keeping him in the dark and tells Todd,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:03.280
“Let me protect you now.” Prentiss gives Ben&nbsp;
and Todd an ultimatum to bring the girl out. 
&nbsp;

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.760
Ben appears from the store, followed by&nbsp;
Viola. As she proceeds towards Prentiss,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.560
he tells her he is pleased to see her again.&nbsp;
But to Prentiss and other mens’ astonishment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:18.720
Viola suddenly disappears into thin air. It was&nbsp;
a 3D hologram noise created by Ben to distract&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:24.000
Prentiss and others while the real Viola,&nbsp;
Todd, and Manchee fled from the back door. 
&nbsp;

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.480
However, Preacher Aaron spots them and starts&nbsp;
chasing them. They come across a boat and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.880
escape through the river. Aaron continues to&nbsp;
pursue them and knocks them over the boat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.760
Todd manages to save and get away with&nbsp;
Viola, but unfortunately, the psychopath&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:44.160
Aaron kills Manchee, further enraging Todd.
Manchee’s death extremely upsets Todd, but Viola&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.280
comforts him, and they continue on their journey&nbsp;
to Haven. The support towers for a monorail built&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.320
by first wave colonists show them the path.
On their way, Viola and Todd come across the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.280
ruins of the first colony ship. Prentiss and his&nbsp;
men begin to catch up with them. Todd suggests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.600
they keep moving, but Viola tells him that they&nbsp;
don’t have much time left, and they can use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.560
ship’s emergency transmitter. They scan the&nbsp;
ruins and eventually find the transmitter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.200
but Viola learns that the antenna is&nbsp;
damaged. Viola loses hope, but Todd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.800
offers to repair it. He climbs on the antenna and&nbsp;
asks Viola to be on standby to send the signal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.600
Todd manages to fix the antenna as Prentiss&nbsp;
and his men arrive with Ben. Prentiss threatens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.120
to kill Ben should Todd not surrender, but Ben&nbsp;
tells his son not to cave in to his demand.
&nbsp;

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.880
Meanwhile, Preacher Aaron sneaks&nbsp;
into the ship and attacks Viola.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.000
Aaron regrets killing the women of Prentisstown.&nbsp;
He laments not being able to tell the voice of God&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.320
from the Noise. He believes he is a&nbsp;
sinner and pleads with Viola to kill him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.840
and purify him. Left with no choice, Viola&nbsp;
immolates Aaron with one of her gadgets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:54.080
As he burns, the preacher exclaims, “I am baptized&nbsp;
with fire! I’m the sinner”, and passes away. 
&nbsp;

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.280
Viola then sends the SOS signal to the mothership&nbsp;
while Todd surrenders himself before Prentiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.560
Prentiss asks Todd about the girl, but this&nbsp;
time, Todd manages to hide his noise. Angered,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:10.000
Prentiss shoots his father, and Todd immediately&nbsp;
rushes to Ben's side. Ben again apologizes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.360
Todd for keeping him in the dark&nbsp;
about his mother and slips him a knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.000
before passing away. Todd attacks Prentiss&nbsp;
with the knife, but he is sent rolling down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.280
losing the knife in the process. Todd runs for&nbsp;
cover, but Prentiss wounds him with the gun.
&nbsp;

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:28.000
Todd then sneaks up on Prentiss from behind but&nbsp;
only to realize that it is his illusion. Prentiss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.080
then proceeds to shoot him, but Todd distracts&nbsp;
him with an illusion of his mother and other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:37.280
women of Prentisstown, calling him a coward.&nbsp;
They back Prentiss up on the edge of a cliff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:42.640
Viola then appears and attacks him with a pipe.&nbsp;
He dodges the strike and grabs the pipe but loses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:48.640
his balance in the process. Viola then frees&nbsp;
her grip, and Prentiss falls to his death. 
&nbsp;

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:54.080
As Viola tends to a badly wounded Todd, the&nbsp;
colony mothership arrives, causing Davy and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.455
remaining Prentisstown men to flee in fear.
Todd later gains consciousness in the mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.455 --> 00:13:05.360
ship's medical room, fully healed with Viola by&nbsp;
her side. Viola reveals that she is going to live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.800
in the New World with him and takes&nbsp;
him to meet the other colonists.
