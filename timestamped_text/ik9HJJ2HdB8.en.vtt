00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.230 align:start position:0%
not that apocalypse this is a new one
so<00:01:28.799><c> considering</c><00:01:29.200><c> we</c><00:01:29.280><c> have</c><00:01:29.360><c> seven</c><00:01:29.600><c> siblings</c><00:01:30.079><c> i</c>

so considering we have seven siblings i
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.590 align:start position:0%
so considering we have seven siblings i
figured<00:01:30.479><c> we'd</c><00:01:30.640><c> cover</c><00:01:30.880><c> them</c><00:01:30.960><c> in</c><00:01:31.119><c> order</c>

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
figured we'd cover them in order
 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.270 align:start position:0%
figured we'd cover them in order
to<00:01:31.759><c> just</c><00:01:31.920><c> keep</c><00:01:32.079><c> everything</c><00:01:32.400><c> on</c><00:01:32.560><c> track</c><00:01:32.799><c> so</c>

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
to just keep everything on track so
 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.670 align:start position:0%
to just keep everything on track so
starting<00:01:33.600><c> with</c><00:01:33.680><c> number</c><00:01:33.920><c> five</c><00:01:34.240><c> i</c><00:01:34.400><c> can</c><00:01:34.640><c> explain</c>

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.270 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:01:37.840><c> number</c><00:01:38.079><c> five</c><00:01:38.240><c> in</c><00:01:38.400><c> my</c><00:01:38.479><c> opinion</c><00:01:38.880><c> is</c><00:01:38.960><c> the</c><00:01:39.040><c> best</c>

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
