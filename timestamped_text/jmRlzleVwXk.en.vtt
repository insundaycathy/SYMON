00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.599
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:06.740
Today I will show you an Action, Drama, Sci-fi
film from 2012, titled Chronicle.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.450
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.360
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.839
Andrew has just bought a new camera and explains
to his drunken father (Richard) behind the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.760
door that he will be filming everything from
now on.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.140
His mother is terminally ill and bedridden.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.980
Matt, Andrew's cousin, picks him up and drives
him to school.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.870
Matt questions Andrew's filming, but awkwardly
accepts it when he claims it's just something

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.220
he does now.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.320
Although Matt is the closest thing to a friend
Andrew has, he still avoids him at school.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.500
There is a campaign going on.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.420
He eats breakfast alone in the bleachers and
films the football team and cheerleaders practicing.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.890
One of the girls scolds him for being creepy.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.570
On his way to his locker, he is ganged up
on by school's bullies.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.890
One of them takes his camera and films Wayne
slapping him.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.880
On the way home, Matt invites Andrew to a
party he wants to attend.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.370
He is hesitant, but Matt insists because this
is his last chance to do something for once,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.390
since he's already a senior.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.200
Andrew says he'll think about it.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.799
Matt then suggests that maybe he should leave
the camera behind since it might alienate

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.280
people from him, but Andrew insists it's important.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.950
That night, Andrew sits in his room watching
his video footage.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.469
His drunken father Richard bursts into his
room, slaps and throws Andrew off his chair,

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:21.090
and demands that he open the door when he
says so.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.899
Neither his family life nor his school life
are particularly good.

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.149
Afterwards, Andrew decides to attend the party
Matt was talking about.

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.549
At the party, Matt insists that he get away
from him and go socialize with people.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.109
He is embarrassed to be with Andrew.

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:40.359
Andrew's filming catches the attention of
Casey, who is also filming the party.

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.319
Matt shows up and tries to make a pass at
her, but completely fails.

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:45.689
Andrew makes fun of him.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.709
However, as the party continues, a drunk partygoer
takes notice of Andrew and claims he's filming

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.069
his girlfriend.

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.920
He sprays him with a drink and spits on him.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.149
Andrew leaves the rave in despair and cries
outside.

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.209
Andrew is approached by Steve Montgomery,
the school's popular star quarterback and

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.810
future politician, to accompany him to record
something strange he has found in the nearby

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.129
woods: a hole in the ground from which a loud
and strange sound emanates.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.819
Andrew is hesitant, but when he hears that
Matt will be there, he agrees.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.480
The three enter the hole and discover a large,
blue glowing crystalline object.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.050
When Steve touches it, the object turns red
and the group is plagued by nosebleeds and

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.050
pain.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.599
When they are thrown out of the cave by a
force, the camera cuts off.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.900
Weeks later, Andrew films himself with a brand
new camera, Matt and Steve displaying telekinetic

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.900
abilities.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.959
They perform a ball test, where Matt tries
to stop the ball with his mind, but fails.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.430
To get revenge, Matt throws the ball sideways
and hits Steve.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.349
Andrew takes his turn and stops the ball in
its tracks.

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.659
They suffer from nosebleeds when they overexert
themselves.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.670
Of the three, Andrew is the one doing the
best with his newfound abilities.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.790
While Matt has trouble putting two Lego pieces
together, Andrew has no trouble building an

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.040
entire tower in seconds.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.130
They return to the hole, but find that it
has collapsed.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.040
The sheriff's department is sealing off the
area for safety reasons.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.870
As he rides along with Steve in his car, the
two become closer.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.890
Steve also questions Andrew's filming habits
and believes he is putting up a barrier around

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.280
himself.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.840
Andrew thinks that's probably what he wants.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.230
Andrew tells Steve about his unhealthy home
life with his sick mother and drunk father.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.030
Later that night in Andrew's room, Richard
argues loudly with someone on the phone and

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.030
reveals that he is struggling financially
to keep his mother healthy.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.030
Andrew looks distraught as he levitates the
camera.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.749
Andrew is at the docks with his mother.

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:39.230
She knows she does not have long and is trying
to strengthen her son.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.209
As Andrew talks to Matt while skipping stones,
he asks him if Matt is thinking of making

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.370
something more of their power.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.060
At the bleachers, Matt theorizes that their
abilities function like a muscle that gets

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.810
stronger with use.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.739
Andrew suggests taking their abilities out
of the backyard.

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.170
The three boys develop a close friendship
and begin to use their abilities to play pranks,

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.579
such as scaring children by unleashing toys
on them at a market.

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.650
They try to pull a piece of gum out of a man's
mouth, which they fail to do.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.650
Twice.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.060
In a coffee store, they also find that they
can create an invisible barrier around themselves

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.380
that protects them.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.139
Andrew makes a silhouette of the Virgin Mary
and scares the waitress.

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.350
In a parking lot, they move a car.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.730
The lady is confused when she returns.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.390
However, things go too far when Andrew pushes
a rude trucker off the road and into a river.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.120
Steve rescues the man from the river and Matt
calls the authorities to get the man medical

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.120
treatment.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.660
They are shocked and outraged that Andrew
would go so far.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.820
Andrew does not understand their anger.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.920
Matt reminds him that he put a human being
in the hospital.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.850
Matt then makes three rules: they never use
their powers against living beings, they never

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.980
use them out of anger or rage, and they probably
should not use them in public anymore.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.030
Despite Andrew's objections, he's overruled
when Matt insists that's exactly what they

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.690
need now that they are getting stronger, and
Steve agrees.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.070
The next day, Steve asks Andrew and Matt to
meet with him.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.100
On the way there, Matt makes it clear that
while he's not mad at Andrew, he still thinks

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.860
that now that they are getting stronger, they
should think before they do anything.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.110
Although they meet where Steve said they would,
he is not immediately found until Steve reveals

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.050
himself to them floating in the sky, having
learned how to fly.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.840
Although Matt has a harder time keeping up,
Andrew is the first to get it right immediately.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.380
Not long after, all 3 are in the air, floating
in the clouds and having fun.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.300
A passing plane knocks Steve to the ground,
but Andrew saves him from a fatal fall.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.900
They admit to each other that this was the
best day of their lives and agree to fly around

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.490
the world together after graduation.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.140
Andrew expresses interest in visiting Tibet
for its peaceful nature.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.870
Steve and Matt agree.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.000
Matt goes to Casey's house and tries to appeal
to her, claiming he's not the nerd he used

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.030
to be.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.700
Meanwhile, Steve and Andrew sit on top of
the town needle.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.360
Steve praises his skill with the ability he
has.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.340
They talk about their possible futures and
how Andrew's relationship with Matt was different

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.840
before high school.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.250
They were close friends before Matt started
avoiding him.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.970
In a way, Steve is a friend that Andrew never
had.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.270
Steve encourages Andrew to enter the school
talent show to gain some popularity.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.380
Before he goes, his mother shows her admiration
for his friends, but his drunken father is

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.050
suspicious of how Andrew gets to school without
Matt driving him.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.490
He thinks he's up to something and tells Andrew
he's on to him.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.860
At the talent show, Andrew baffles his classmates
by disguising his powers as an impressive

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.800
display of magic tricks.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.290
He drops cards and then collects them back.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.190
Rope dancing while juggling.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.160
That night, the trio celebrates at a house
party where Andrew is in the center of attention.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.380
After having drinks with his classmate Monica,
Andrew and her go upstairs to pop that cherry.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.870
Casey is also at the party and they hit it
off when Casey invites Matt to go somewhere

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.130
else with her.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.740
Meanwhile, Steve goes upstairs to congratulate
Andrew on his success, but he hears Monica

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.850
scream in disgust as she storms out of the
room with vomit on her blouse.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.470
He goes into the room and finds Andrew sitting
there humiliated.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.200
Steve tries to comfort him that this kind
of thing happens and not to worry, but Andrew

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.910
angrily pushes him out of the room.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.680
Andrew becomes increasingly withdrawn and
hostile.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.920
His father eventually discovers Andrew's camera
and berates him for keeping such an expensive

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.810
item for himself while he struggles financially.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.990
He also falsely accuses Andrew of wasting
all his money and claims Matt and Steve are

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.919
not his friends, calling him an embarrassment.

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:24.000
Andrew counters and calls him an idiot.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.030
This infuriates Richard even more, so he physically
attacks him.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.100
Andrew uses his ability to overpower him,
throwing him against a wall and claiming that

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.370
he could crush him if he wanted to, and throws
the defeated Richard to the ground.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.030
His rampage causes Steve and Matt's noses
to bleed and hurt.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.520
Matt ignores the nosebleed to continue his
date with Casey, but Steve is drawn to Andrew,

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.060
who is adrift in the middle of a storm.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.730
Andrew asks how he found him and explains
how the nosebleed led him to him.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.700
He notices Andrew's black eye and realizes
his father did it to him.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.580
An emotionally distraught Andrew tells him
to stop pretending to care about his situation

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.090
because he does not think Steve was his friend
to begin with.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.160
Steve reminds him that he's always been there
for him and Matt, but Andrew grows increasingly

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.170
frustrated and keeps telling Steve to leave
him alone until Steve is suddenly struck by

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.780
lightning and killed.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.270
At Steve's funeral, Matt confronts Andrew
about the suspicious circumstances of Steve's

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:20.820
death: even though Steve was killed by lightning,
the news has not reported lightning strikes

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.710
and his body was found in a field, but there
was no reason for him to be out there.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.930
He's also outraged that Andrew is filming
at a funeral and demands that he turns off

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.849
the camera, but Andrew refuses and tells Matt
to back off.

00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:37.419
He denies knowing about it or being responsible
for it, but Matt does not believe him.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:41.740
It later turns out that Matt was right when
Andrew privately asks for forgiveness at Steve's

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.320
grave, believing that his abilities are possessing
him and that he misses him.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.820
Andrew distances himself from Matt and feels
alone and unpopular at school again.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:55.030
After being bullied again by Wayne, he uses
his powers to rip several teeth out of Wayne's

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.260
mouth.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.920
Andrew begins to see himself as a predator
and feels that he should not feel guilty about

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.530
using his powers to harm weaker people.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:06.820
As his mother's condition worsens, Andrew
goes to get his mother's medication.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.660
Before he leaves, Matt shows up in Andrew's
room and confronts him about the incident

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.220
at school with Wayne.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:16.630
Annoyed, Andrew tries to brush him off, but
Matt gets aggressive and reminds him of the

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:17.630
rules.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:22.150
Andrew, finally fed up with Matt, aggressively
assures him that he's not breaking the rules

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.440
and tells him to stay out of his life.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.750
At the pharmacy, Andrew finds out his mother's
medication is too expensive.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:33.100
As a result, he decides to use his powers
to steal money for her medicine, equipping

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.100
his fathers firefighter suit.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.090
After robbing some local thugs, he robs a
gas station where he accidentally causes an

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.770
explosion that sends him to the hospital where
the police investigate him.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:47.140
At his bedside, his grieving father informs
the unconscious Andrew that his mother has

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.140
died.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.180
Furious, he blames Andrew for her death and
accuses him of forcing him out of the house

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.770
to look for him when his mother needed him.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.340
Believing that Andrew can hear what he is
telling him, he demands that Andrew gets up

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.420
and apologizes to him for taking him away
from her in her final time of need.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.590
Andrew wakes up, grabs his father's hand,
and blows up the outside wall of the hospital

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.840
room.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.590
Matt is attending a family birthday party
with Casey when he suddenly gets a nosebleed

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.970
and senses that Andrew is in trouble.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.990
He sees a report on the TV news about the
explosion at the hospital and knows Andrew

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.990
is involved.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.900
Matt and Casey head to the hospital and find
Andrew hovering outside the building with

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.160
his father dangling above the ground by his
ankle.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.230
Andrew accuses his father of driving him insane
and drops him, only to be rescued by Matt.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.250
Andrew proceeds to wreak havoc with his powers,
picking up Matt's car and nearly killing Casey

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.300
before Matt saves her life.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.170
Matt confronts Andrew at the Space Needle
and tries to talk some sense into him, telling

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:45.270
him that it's not too late to turn everything
around and they can start over.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:49.120
Andrew disagrees and berates Matt for abandoning
him when he needed him.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.630
Matt admits his mistakes, but is willing to
make amends if Andrew stops his attacks.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.800
He tries to remind Andrew that this is not
who he is, but Andrew declares himself the

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.090
Apex Predator and attacks Matt.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:04.660
The two fight across the city, breaking through
buildings and flinging vehicles as Matt continues

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.530
to try and talk to the injured and angry Andrew.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.540
He begins to use his powers to destroy the
buildings around him, threatening many other

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.540
lives.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:17.270
Unable to get through to Andrew, Matt snatches
a spear from a nearby statue and impales Andrew

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.930
with it, killing him.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.960
The police surround Matt, but he flies away.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.500
Some time later, Matt lands in Tibet with
Andrew's camera.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.870
Matt positions the camera to see a Tibetan
monastery in the distance and says, "You did

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:30.870
it."

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.730
Before flying away, he says goodbye to "Andrew"
and leaves the camera behind to continue recording

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.130
the quiet scene.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.130
The end.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.680
Thank you for watching!
