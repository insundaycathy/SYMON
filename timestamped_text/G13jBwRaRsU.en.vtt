Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.220
Today, I'm going to explain a mystery, sci-fi,
thriller film called "Super 8."

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.509
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.540
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.630
In 1979 at Lillian, Ohio, a tragic accident
in a steel mill costs the life of Elizabeth

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.550
Lamb, leaving her teenage son, Joe, with her
husband, Deputy Sheriff Jack.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.929
Her co-worker, Louis Dainard, shows up at
the wake but is immediately thrown out by

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:25.640
an angry Jack.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:34.800
Four months later, Joe and his friends, Charles,
Preston, Martin, and Cary, work on a zombie

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.489
movie to enter a Super 8 film competition.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.930
Hoping to add emotional value to the plot,
Charles adds a new character to the movie:

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.320
the protagonist's wife.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.129
When Joe returns home from Charle's house,
he finds his father mourning in the bathroom,

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.130
still unable to cope with their loss but refuses
to let his son see him in this state.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.469
That evening, the two have dinner at a diner.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.809
Disapproving Joe's interest in making movies,
Jack suggests for Joe to spend the summer

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.460
in a baseball camp instead.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.109
Joe dislikes the idea but doesn't say so.

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.399
After dinner, Joe paints on his action figures
until Charles calls him.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.920
The friends meet up with Louis's daughter,
Alice, who isn't happy to see Joe, fearing

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.830
that he'll tell his father about her driving
without a license.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.470
After Joe promises that he won't snitch, Alice
agrees to drive the group to the train station.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.650
Upon arriving at the station, Charles eagerly
gets everything started.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.181
Preston and Cary set up the lights and effects,
Martin runs his lines with Charles, and Joe

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:23.850
puts makeup on Alice.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.030
They film Martin portraying a detective investigating
a zombie virus and Alice playing his wife,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.850
who's against him getting involved.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.920
Alice's teary performance has the boys stunned
and speechless, even after she's finished.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.240
A train horn sounds from afar, and the boys
frantically scatter to film a scene with the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.070
passing train in the background.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.080
The train's rumbling muffles their dialogue,
yet the extra effect excites Charles.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.800
Joe looks back and spots a truck that turns
into the railway.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.030
The truck crashes into the train, exploding
into a roaring fire.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.140
The kids run away, dropping their camera that
continues filming.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.970
The train's derailed cars block their path,
making the boys turn back, separated from

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:56.970
Alice.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.130
Debris and flames fly everywhere, covering
the boys with soot as they run to escape the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.130
wreck.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.390
Train cars crash onto the station and fly
over their heads, with one blocking Joe's

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.390
path.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.590
He sees it marked as explosives, giving him
little time to run for cover before it explodes.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.520
Alone in the wreckage, Joe spots a train car
moving as if something large is inside.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.870
He pulls out a silver necklace from his pocket,
clutching it in his shaky hands.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.000
The door flies overhead, and he waits for
something to come out.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.420
When nothing comes, he goes to look for his
friends.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.010
The boys reunite, but Alice is nowhere in
sight.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.590
Joe sees debris with blood on the side, and
the boys assume that it's Alice's.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.250
But she appears behind them.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.100
It turns out the blood was fake and came from
Joe's bag.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.600
Among the wreckage, they find strange white
cubes spilling out from the containers.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.090
Joe informs the rest about the truck that
purposefully collided on the train.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.160
Inside the truck, they recognize the driver
as their biology teacher, Dr. Woodward.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.240
In his hand is a map of the United States
with dates and times written on it.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.800
Dr. Woodward takes the map back and reveals
a gun, scaring them.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.150
He warns them not to speak about the event;
otherwise, they and their parents will be

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.150
killed.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.330
The military gathers at the scene, alerting
them.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.570
Dr. Woodward aims the gun at them, convincing
them to flee.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.490
Alice heads straight for the car, but the
boys retrieve their equipment first before

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.500
getting in.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.790
The soldiers arrive, missing the car that
drives off, unable to get the license plate.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.700
All that's left of the kids' presence is empty
film boxes.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.770
The boys panic in the car, distracting Alice
while she drives.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.730
They all vow not to say anything about what
just happened.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.020
After dropping them off in their homes, Alice
tells Joe that she regrets joining them before

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.110
leaving.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.650
Late that evening, electrical posts malfunction
around the neighborhood.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.740
The next day, Jack wakes up Joe as he prepares
for work.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.000
While the two talk, the white cube that Joe
took from the wreckage moves on its own without

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.310
them noticing.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.180
After Jack leaves, Joe heads to Charle's house,
finding his family in chaos at the breakfast

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.180
table.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.860
He joins Charles by the T.V., watching the
news cover the train crash last night.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.130
Both are still in disbelief at what they witnessed.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.860
An idea sparks in Charles' mind when Joe comments
how the train crash looks like a disaster

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.860
movie.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.930
His disbelief turns into excitement, wanting
to head back to the wreckage to film more

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.030
scenes.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.400
After Charles gets his film developed, Joe
heads to Alice's house, hoping to convince

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.930
her to join them again.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.490
Louis arrives, yelling for Joe to go away.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.920
Before Joe leaves, Alice promises to join
them on the next filming.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.620
Later that day, they shoot action scenes with
the train wreckage as their background.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.260
Using the camera to get a closer look, Joe
recognizes the hooks on the train's cars,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.280
realizing it as an Air Force train.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.811
With this clue, plus the map that Woodward
had, Joe wonders if he drove into the train

00:04:17.811 --> 00:04:19.750
tracks to destroy something.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.290
Charles stops the conversation, reminding
them about Woodward's warning.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.510
Back in the wreckage, the military set up
camp and retrieve the white cubes from the

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.510
train cars.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.540
Jack demands Colonel Nelec for information,
but the colonel remains tightlipped about

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.570
the event.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.750
Jack shares his suspicions with Sheriff Pruitt
at the police station, who dismisses his concerns,

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.900
thinking that he's simply on edge due to his
wife's recent death.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.070
That evening, Sheriff Pruitt witnesses dogs
running away from something while loading

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.760
up his car at the gas station.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.430
Suddenly, his car powers on while the gas
meter's bell ding wildly.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.960
He hears something from the side of the store
and jumps when the dumpster zooms past him.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.940
The police car outside shakes then the lights
flicker, alerting the clerk, Breen.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.010
Breen finds the sheriff's car wrecked, but
the sheriff is nowhere around.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.190
A mechanical clicking alerts him, and he attempts
to escape but is captured.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.350
In Joe's house, Joe uses makeup to turn Alice
into a zombie for the next scene.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.100
Charles and Cary ask if they can blow up Joe's
Air Force train model to add to their scene.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.560
He reluctantly agrees.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.840
The power fluctuates in the house, concerning
them as it had been happening around town

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.260
throughout the day.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.270
Alice practices acting like a zombie on Joe
with Charles watching the two grow close.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.320
In the gas station, Jack investigates the
chaos.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.330
Recognizing the sheriff's gun, Jack puts an
A.P.B. on both Sheriff Pruitt and Breen.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.760
More reports of strange occurrences circulate
the town, including car engines, generators,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.130
and dogs going missing, including Joe's dog,
Lucy.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.950
When Joe returns home, he finds Jack and other
police officers discussing the events.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.260
Over-hearing that the military is investigating
tire tracks, Joe's heart sinks, realizing

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.520
that they're looking for them.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.970
Outside, an electrician learns about the neighboring
towns' missing electrical wires.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.840
While he's fixing an electrical post, a mysterious
mechanical sound comes from the nearby junkyard.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.660
Metal objects fly around until an oven crashes
nearby.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.030
He raises the lift to get a better look but
sees nothing in the vast night.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.400
Under him, the lights start to flicker, and
the lift malfunctions.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.670
Something roars from the dark and slams against
the lift.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.050
The lift shifts to the side, with the electrician
nowhere in sight.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.810
The next day at the town hall, the Lilian
residents complain about the power fluctuations

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.740
and stolen electrical items.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.100
One theorizes that it's part of a Russian
invasion, opting for another man, Mr. McCandless,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.770
to share about hearing military chatter from
his radio.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.080
Jack pulls Mr. McCandless away from the crowd
to get more information.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.870
Jack heads back to the police station, ordering
officers to gather radio and scanners to check

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.240
the frequency.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.510
Louis interrupts him, warning him not to let
Joe near his house or his daughter again.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.449
In Joe's house, he shows Alice his miniature
models after doing her zombie makeup.

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.460
Alice brings up the necklace he was holding
during the train crash, learning that it was

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.770
his late mother's.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.100
Back in the station, Jack learns that the
missing dogs are found in various locations

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.280
out of town as if they were avoiding something.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.640
The radios receive frequency from the Air
Force, where they learn about Operation Walking

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.210
Distance.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.110
Soldiers clear out Woodward's house while
the group gathers outside to film a scene.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.090
A police car approaches them, and Jack pulls
Joe away from his friends and retrieves his

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.220
camera, despite Charles' protests.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.460
With Joe in the car, Jack walks to Nelec,
demanding information about Walking Distance.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.620
Hearing this, Nelec agrees to talk in private
at another time.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.370
Jack takes Joe home, warning him not to be
friends with Alice anymore.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.970
Louis is a known troublemaker, yet Joe's mother
became friends with him, which Jack believes

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.230
was a mistake.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.900
Joe defends Alice, refusing to listen to his
father.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.310
Jack doesn't relent, however, insisting on
his rules before leaving to deal with the

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.790
military.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.250
Scared and confused, Joe heads to the town
graveyard and sits by his mother's tomb until

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.190
dark, missing life when she was still around.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.639
A rattling noise from a nearby garage catches
his attention.

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:41.950
He shines his flashlight on the windows, seeing
something moving inside.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:46.490
Meanwhile, Jack heads to the airfield to see
Nelec, but he's put under arrest instead.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.660
Inside the camp, Nelec interrogates Woodward
on what he knows and who filmed the crash

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.669
that night.

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:53.910
The two argue about the past, ending with
Woodward warning him that Woodward will also

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.940
be watching when Nelec sees "him" next.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.300
Knowing that he won't say any further, Woodward
is euthanized.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.160
That evening, Alice climbs into Joe's bedroom
window.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.310
She advises him not to let Charles blow up
his train model for the movie, pointing out

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.389
how Charles bosses him around.

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:10.590
Alice admits that she cares about him and
doesn't want him to be pushed around.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:14.380
Joe's projector suddenly powers on, signaling
that the electricity is back.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.280
They watch a home video of Joe's mother from
when he was younger.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.390
The images have him reminiscing about his
mother while Alice tears up, trying to keep

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.759
her feelings back.

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:25.560
Finally, Alice confesses that her father missed
his shift after getting drunk the day of the

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.780
accident, which forced Elizabeth to take over.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:32.279
She breaks down, confessing that she sometimes
wished her father was the one who died instead.

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:36.300
The video ends, and a rattling brings their
attention to the white cube on his desk.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.589
It moves on its own, humming as it does.

00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:42.389
The cube zooms past them and out of the room,
creating a hole in the wall.

00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:46.369
Alice sneaks back into her house, but Louis
is still awake, demanding where she's been.

00:08:46.369 --> 00:08:49.759
He's drunk and smoking in the living room,
yelling for her to leave as her mother did.

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:52.339
In tears, Alice takes her bike and rides away.

00:08:52.339 --> 00:08:55.490
Louis tries to catch up with her, regretting
his words to his daughter.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.639
With his car behind her, Alice attempts to
lose him, but their chase ends with Louis

00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:00.189
crashing the car.

00:09:00.189 --> 00:09:02.449
Alice stops, worried about her father.

00:09:02.449 --> 00:09:04.740
Something reaches down to her, and she screams.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.240
Louis clambers out of the car to her rescue,
but Alice is nowhere to be found.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.629
Meanwhile, the military uses flamethrowers
to burn down the field near the town.

00:09:12.629 --> 00:09:15.209
Operation Walking Distance is now in effect.

00:09:15.209 --> 00:09:18.939
The next day, Joe tells Charles about the
cube, but he wants nothing to do with it.

00:09:18.939 --> 00:09:22.269
Charles is pissed that Joe refused to let
them blow up the train model upon Alice's

00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:24.410
advice and that his dad took his film.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.399
While they're arguing, Joe's missing cube
is stuck to the water tower nearby.

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:31.639
Making their way to Charles' house, Joe encourages
his friend that they can still finish the

00:09:31.639 --> 00:09:32.639
movie.

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:36.139
Charles drops the act and admits to being
upset about Joe and Alice getting close.

00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:39.639
It turns out Charles convinced Alice to be
part of his movie because he liked her.

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:42.959
While they're arguing, they play the reel
from the train station that accidentally recorded

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:44.499
part of the crash.

00:09:44.499 --> 00:09:47.579
Charles starts to apologize about getting
upset when Joe notices something strange in

00:09:47.579 --> 00:09:48.619
the film.

00:09:48.619 --> 00:09:52.050
On the screen, a giant alien creature emerges
from the train.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.929
A siren sounds all around the town.

00:09:53.929 --> 00:09:58.370
People are evacuating due to a wildfire nearby
that may reach the town's chemical plant.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.570
Joe and Charles join the evacuation, led by
the military.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:06.059
As caravans exit the town, carrying the residents,
large red trucks drive into the town.

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:09.279
The residents are taken to the Greenville
Air Force Base, serving as the evacuation

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:10.399
center.

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:13.540
Charles reunites with his family, but Joe
can't find his father.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:17.199
Instead, he finds the frightened Louis, telling
him that something took Alice, but no one

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:18.529
else believes him.

00:10:18.529 --> 00:10:22.019
Joe plans to rescue Alice despite his friends'
insistence that it's dangerous.

00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:26.540
They convince the camera shop worker, Donny,
to drive them back to town.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.110
Meanwhile, Jack is kept in isolation.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.360
He subdues a soldier and takes his uniform
to infiltrate the camp.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.920
He blows up a truck for diversion and takes
one of the military jeeps to escape.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.300
His jeep passes by Donny's car, where the
boys deduce that Woodward hid files about

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.089
the alien in the trailer behind the school
where he keeps confiscated items.

00:10:43.089 --> 00:10:46.519
The night falls as the friends head to the
school and break into Woodward's trailer.

00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:49.610
They head to the biology room, where they
play the films and read the documents from

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:50.790
his trailer.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.850
Cary finds a cassette tape where Woodward
describes a subterranean creature that wants

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.990
to rebuild its ship, made out of the shape-shifting
cubes.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.570
It's been trying to return home since 1958
but has been held captive and experimented

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.570
on by Nelec.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.860
Its experiences on Earth taught it to see
humankind as the enemy, but the creature made

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.860
contact with Woodward, allowing him to understand
it.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.940
Woodward attempted to free the creature but
was discharged from the project for doing

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:11.940
so.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.319
His crash on the train was his last attempt
to free it.

00:11:14.319 --> 00:11:17.379
Suddenly, soldiers barge in and take the boys
into custody.

00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:20.800
Nelec confiscates Cary's explosives and Joe's
mother's necklace before sending them back

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.540
to the evacuation center.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.220
When he spots the kids being taken into the
military bus, Donny attempts to call for police

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.250
backup.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:32.379
Jack finds Deputy Rosko at the evacuation
center, informing him how the Air Force caused

00:11:32.379 --> 00:11:34.370
the fire to evacuate the town.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.730
Rosko interrupts him to report Joe and his
friends being taken from the school by military

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:38.730
personnel.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.880
Jack confronts Preston, the only one who stayed
behind.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.839
Upon Joe's instructions, Preston diverts his
attention to Charles' film to prove the alien's

00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:46.839
existence.

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:50.249
Meanwhile, the boys sit at the back of the
bus, wondering what the military will do to

00:11:50.249 --> 00:11:51.249
them.

00:11:51.249 --> 00:11:54.800
Something crashes against the bus, throwing
it to the side until the vehicle stops.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.600
They watch the soldiers take tracking guns
to tag the alien.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.559
At Nelec's command, a soldier slowly steps
out but is ambushed by the alien.

00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:04.630
The creature flips the bus to its side, disabling
the soldiers.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:08.569
The boys frantically search for a way out
until Joe spots a broken window to climb through.

00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:11.899
Joe climbs out, seeing the creature up close
as it digs through the bus.

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:15.179
The boys escape the scene, leaving Nelec cornered
by the alien.

00:12:15.179 --> 00:12:19.139
Out of bullets, Nelec drops his gun and remembers
Woodward's dying words before the alien bites

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:20.139
him.

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:24.379
With the alien gone, Joe retrieves his necklace
while Cary gets his explosives back.

00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:27.990
Donny arrives, confessing that he's stoned,
and allows Joe to drive instead.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.829
The road is blocked by tanks that fire into
the darkness.

00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:33.860
With the car trapped and Donny unconscious,
the boys leave him behind.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.069
They run through the war zone, dodging explosions,
bullets, and armed men.

00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:41.089
They hide in a neighbor's house, but an explosion
knocks them out.

00:12:41.089 --> 00:12:44.420
With Martin's leg injured, Joe insists Charles
stay with him while Joe and Cary head for

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.689
the cemetery.

00:12:45.689 --> 00:12:49.139
Joe and Cary reach the cemetery and break
down the garage door nearby, seeing a deep

00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:50.369
pit inside.

00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:54.610
Meanwhile, Jack takes Louis out of the evacuation
center to help find their children.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:58.009
While driving, Louis says that he came to
Elizabeth's funeral to apologize for what

00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:59.009
happened.

00:12:59.009 --> 00:13:03.240
Jack stares down the road quietly but finally
admits that Elizabeth's death was an accident.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.429
Back at the cemetery, Cary and Joe use sparkles
to climb down the hole and search for Alice.

00:13:07.429 --> 00:13:10.339
They follow the sound of buzzing and find
a cave filled with the stolen electronics

00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:11.730
and missing people.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.379
Based on the tunnel systems they walked through,
Joe deduces that they're under the water tower.

00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:18.249
The alien arrives, taking one of the captives
with it.

00:13:18.249 --> 00:13:21.489
Finding Alice among the captives, Joe goes
to her while Cary prepares firecrackers to

00:13:21.489 --> 00:13:22.939
distract the alien.

00:13:22.939 --> 00:13:26.059
The firecrackers erupt, diverting the alien's
attention away.

00:13:26.059 --> 00:13:29.220
Joe slaps her awake, telling her that Louis
was worried about her.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.369
Alice hugs Joe, relieved to be rescued.

00:13:31.369 --> 00:13:35.180
They wake up others as Alice explains, reading
the alien's thoughts when she was captured,

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.420
confirming that it just wants to go home.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.629
Sheriff Pruitt leads them out of the tunnel
system, but the alien captures him.

00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:43.910
The others run away but reach a dead-end,
cornered by the alien.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.519
Mustering up courage, Joe confronts the alien,
telling it to go home.

00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:49.629
The alien picks him up but doesn't hurt him.

00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:53.410
Instead, it listens to Joe's encouragement,
saying that it can still live and return home

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.519
despite everything it experienced.

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:58.269
Something inside the tunnel powers on, alerting
the alien.

00:13:58.269 --> 00:14:00.350
It sets Joe down and leaves.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:04.739
Back in the town, metal objects are magnetized
into the water tower, including cars, guns,

00:14:04.739 --> 00:14:06.899
and the rest of the white cubes from the train.

00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:10.290
The items circle the water tower, forming
the alien's spaceship.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.790
Louis and Jack arrive and reunite with their
children; any anger is overpowered by their

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.499
relief that Joe and Alice are okay.

00:14:15.499 --> 00:14:19.279
The people watch the alien head inside the
spaceship and start it.

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:21.139
Elizabeth's necklace flies off from Joe's
pocket.

00:14:21.139 --> 00:14:24.559
He grabs it in midair and stares at his mother's
photo from the locket.

00:14:24.559 --> 00:14:28.170
With his father by his side, Joe decides to
let go of his mother, allowing the necklace

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.350
to join the spacecraft as it takes off.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.809
The ship launches into the night as Alice
and Joe hold hands, watching the alien finally

00:14:33.809 --> 00:14:42.699
free to return home.
