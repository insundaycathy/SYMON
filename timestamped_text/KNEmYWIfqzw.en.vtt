00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.650
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.020
Today I will show you a Crime, Drama, Thriller
film from 2014, titled The Gambler.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.720
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.599
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.779
Jim Bennet is sitting at his grandfather's
deathbed, he is drawing his last breath.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:19.560
He is one of the richest people in California,
he leaves his grandson no inheritance.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.589
Jim says he will miss him, but he calls his
crap.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.220
Jim does not care about his grandfather's
wealth, he's just sad that he's dying and

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.830
relives the last memories of him in his head.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.890
Jim visits an underground casino with tight
security.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.050
He exchanges his stack of dollars for chips,
goes to a blackjack table, and bets all the

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.789
chips on the first hand.

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:40.520
On the next hand, he doubles his bet.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.879
Again he looks at the camera and doubles his
bet as if to taunt the security guards.

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.879
After losing one of his hands, he still looks
like he wants to double his bet, even with

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.629
no chips, Jim calls the dealer an amateur
and demands a double.

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.949
He loses 80000 on a single hand, owing to
casino 40000.

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.469
Neville comes up to him and asks him what's
going on, maybe if he wants to gamble for

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:01.930
one round.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.570
Neville bets 10000 against Jim's 500 on a
high card, Jim loses and seems unfazed by

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.110
what just happened.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.790
Neville points out that he's a guy who likes
to lose.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.920
So he proposes a loan to him, which he declines.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.340
He goes to the owner of the casino (Mr. Lee)
and asks for another loan.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.770
Mr. Lee explains to him that he came to the
casino with $10000, but instead of paying

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.000
his loan, he gambled it away.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.020
The total amount he owes is 240000 and he
wants it paid back in 7 days.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.720
Jim comes back to Neville and asks him about
the stake he offered, 50000, he says his interest

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.630
is high, Jim does not care.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.420
He pays off his debt to the casino of 40000
that he lost earlier and takes 1 blue chip

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.890
(10000) from the chip register and goes straight
to the blackjack table.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.590
Dealer glances at pit boss if she may deal.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.870
As before, he doubles his bets and goes on
a roll.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.430
After going from 10000 to 80000, he gets a
winning blackjack hand that pays him 3 to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.640
2, and he decides to bet it all on roulette,
black.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.640
It rolls red and he loses.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.850
One of the waitresses is Jim's student (Amy),
who Jim recognizes.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.659
After the loss, the crowd disperses and Mr.
Lee is displeased.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:13.159
In the morning, he leaves the casino owing
to two large gangs.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:17.430
7 days left
He's heading straight for the campus.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.200
Jim is a literacy professor standing freely
in front of his class, and there he sees Amy.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.410
He seems natural and confident.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.599
Jim discredits novel writing as a profession,
saying it's mediocre, there are plenty of

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.500
happy electricians, if you are not a genius,
do not bother.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.150
He points to one of the boys in the class,
his name is Dexter, he is a good tennis player,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.519
he asks him what he is after, the game or
the money, fame or virtue?

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.120
Continuing this train of thought, he quotes
an author, Vespasian - Dear God, I think I

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.550
am becoming a god.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.310
Before saying Amy beats him to it on her laptop.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.790
Jim notes that Amy is the most well-read person
in this class.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.650
Noting that he barely writes adequately compared
to her.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.290
He asks her why she hides her writing talent
and tries to fit in.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.540
She says it's safest to be in the middle.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.799
He starts to question her family situation
and when he does not see any advantages, like

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.889
her father or mother being writers or rich,
he asks why she is better than the rest of

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:14.889
them.

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.590
He ends the lecture by telling her to sit
where she belongs, in front of the class,

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.200
or she should not bother showing up at all.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.689
Jim is visiting his mother, Roberta.

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:27.299
She is playing tennis against Dexter, a boy
in Jim's class.

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.939
He's her coach, she talks a good game and
says if he gives her one more point she'll

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:32.279
fire him.

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.620
Jim is only there to demand money from her.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.409
Roberta knows Jim is in trouble, she'd buy
it if he was looking for meaning in life,

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.180
but that's different, she points out he's
not narcissistic or stupid, he's her son,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.230
so what's the point of his behavior.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.999
She has said goodbye to people she loved before.

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:51.159
Jim: Yeah, whatever happened with dad.

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.640
He implies that she can be a cruel woman.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.389
She tells him she will not give him any more
money.

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.569
Jim kisses her on the cheek and leaves.

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:59.950
She looks crushed.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.810
When he gets a call from Neville about his
debt, he throws his phone into a pond.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.970
6 days left.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.709
A man picks up Jim and drives him to Frank's.

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.799
He is a loan shark who lends large sums of
money.

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.599
After calculating how much Jim earns, he puts
him in his place and says that his yearly

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.709
salary does not even cover it.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.860
He lists everything about Jim, birth, education,
intelligence, talent, looks, family money

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.180
- is it all a real burden to him?

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.880
Frank assumes Jim is dancing with the devil
because there is no reason he should owe Neville

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.480
and the Koreans money.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.650
Basically, he's self destructive.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.310
With the loan Frank offers Jim, he would get
$260000 and would have to pay 10% interest

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.310
weekly.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.840
Where would he get the money?

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.970
Jim just says that he will get the money.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.440
Frank tells him that he will lend it to him
if he humiliates himself, to put it in a nutshell,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.310
if he says He is not a man.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.460
Jim leaves.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.370
He's in a lecture hall when Amy walks in and
sits down, asking him if he meant what he

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.710
said in the lecture about her having talent.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.550
He answers over the loudspeaker, absolutely.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.870
Amy basically tells him that he's a genius,
but for some reason, Jim just can not accept

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.870
that.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.640
He comes closer and tells her she has to leave,
he can not have her here, it’s inappropriate.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.050
Amy leaves without her bag and comes back
with Jim's book and asks him to sign it.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.410
She wants to know the truth about him, but
he will not open up.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.310
Amy asks him out, he declines and she leaves.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.380
5 days left
Neville calls Jim, who has heard that he has

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.890
approached Frank for a loan, and inquires
about his debt to him.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.230
He says he did not like the terms, so he didn’t
get the money.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.200
In class, one of his students who is always
on the phone (Lemar) says that he doesn’t

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.660
understand killing oneself and asks him how
he can be depressed driving a BMW A1.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.290
Jim asks him, “does it look like I am happy?”

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.910
He's not happy because he's teaching the modern
novel to a classroom full of students who

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.280
do not care.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.740
He might as well be stark naked on the desk
and no one would care.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.090
He's in this class pretending to teach and
the students are pretending to learn.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.390
He dismisses the class because he feels defeated
and asks Lemar to stay behind.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.430
He asks him what he needs to do to stop using
his phone.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.790
The school told Jim to give him a good grade
even if he fails because he is a star basketball

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:08.910
player.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.770
Lemar explains that Jim is not the only one
who has problems in his life.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.200
He understands the message he is sending - all
or nothing.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.800
To be or not to be.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.670
It's the same for him, he needs to go pro
because he has a knee problem and his family

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.370
needs money, all or nothing.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.930
It's as if Jim recognizes himself in Lemar.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.850
Jim's car is towed as collateral for Neville's
loan.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.520
Jim's mother arrives and hands him a new phone.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.680
He is pissed that she is in his house.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.560
She asks him if he still needs help with the
money, he says that's already been taken care

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.560
of.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.860
When she says a thug has been in her house,
he writes down the amount he owes them.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.110
Jim says if he does not pay, they'll break
every bone in his body and go after his family,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.250
to which Roberta slaps him and tells him he's
a disgrace.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.780
They visit the bank.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:58.420
Roberta asks the bank clerk for $260,000 in
cash and to not ask any questions.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.880
She tells Jim that this is the last money
she will ever give him and that she will disown

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.980
him if he ever asks for more.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.540
Jim does not care about his mother, he tells
her that they are only talking because of

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.990
her finances.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.310
She walks away defeated.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.430
4 days left.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.890
Amy drives up to Jim, who is sitting on a
bench, and tells him that if she has to engage

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:21.360
in an inappropriate relationship to get him
out of his job, she's ready to go.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.900
Some time later they are at a deserted location,
Jim asks Amy, “What if I told you I am not

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.620
a gambler?” she says that she has seen him
as a professor, and he is not one of those,

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.020
she believes him.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.181
Jim is a perfect example of how someone who
starts out with no problems whatsoever, go

00:07:36.181 --> 00:07:38.150
out of their way to have them all.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.620
He asks Amy to help him start over.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:46.390
They visit a local casino, at the blackjack
table he trades $10000 for chips, bets $500

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:51.550
and after getting a total score of 18, he
asks for a double, he gets a 3, but it still

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.870
feels like he is playing for a loss.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.680
On the next hand, he goes all in and loses.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.960
He keeps re-buying and losing.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.460
After a while, Amy finds Jim and asks, "Everything?"

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.590
He grins.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.050
He explains his true feelings to Amy.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:10.590
He wants it all, total victory, there is no
grey area, you either take it all or lose

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.700
it all, and he would rather die than not achieve
it.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.090
Just as he finishes, Amy kisses him.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.250
Later, Neville ambushes Jim in an alley, he's
looking for his money.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.120
After Jim tells him he does not have his money,
Neville asks him if he knows Lemar.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.710
At home, he receives a message from Neville
saying that the number he gave him is not

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:29.710
Lemar's.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.440
Jim grabs a gun and takes a swig of whiskey.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.209
2 days left.

00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:36.829
Jim wakes up with Mr. Lee's gang in his house.

00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:41.370
They are worried that Jim will try to do something
to himself before he pays back his debt.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.519
Jim sits down in front of Mr. Lee and says
that there is only one way to pay back the

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:48.709
debt: He has to lend him another $100,000.

00:08:48.709 --> 00:08:52.920
They take this as an insult and throw Jim
in a full bathtub and drive away.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.370
As Jim leaves the bathroom, he sees that they
misspelled Munday and scoffs.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:02.240
At the pawnshop, Jim wants to sell his watch
and asks for $3500.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.990
He will not haggle, just answer yes or no.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:09.370
When the owner counters with $1200, he leaves
immediately.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.089
Neville's men kidnap Jim right outside the
shop.

00:09:12.089 --> 00:09:13.870
He is tied to a chair.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.300
Neville asks him how he's going to pay him
back and Jim jokingly says he's going to write

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.730
another book.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.250
Neville asks if he would give him the money
if he lit a cigar and stubbed it out on his

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.250
eyeball?

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.029
“Do I look like a magician?”

00:09:25.029 --> 00:09:27.730
Neville's muscle man comes up and slaps Jim.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:32.079
Neville wants Lemar to throw tomorrow's basketball
game so they do not win by more than 8 points

00:09:32.079 --> 00:09:33.389
because he'll bet on it.

00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:36.830
If Jim does not do what he says, he will kill
Amy.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:41.550
At campus, Jim packs his stuff and tells Amy
to hold out her hand and say goodbye.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.959
If he gets to her then he's done, if he does
not then he's dead and what do you do with

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.189
the dead... you bury them.

00:09:47.189 --> 00:09:49.079
Amy turns and leaves.

00:09:49.079 --> 00:09:52.260
Jim walks out of the school and gives away
his watch to a random student.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.170
He sees Lemar and offers him money if he throws
the game tomorrow.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:00.240
Jim asks him because he knows Lemar needs
the money and it's his decision.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.740
Jim comes to Frank, he's out of options.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.879
Frank asks him if he has the sense to leave
if he has to.

00:10:05.879 --> 00:10:08.779
Frank likes Jim, so he changes the terms.

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:12.550
He'll only give him the money if he's able
to say "get screwed" to anyone, even Frank

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.610
himself.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.430
If he gives him the money and he does not
pay it back, then there are no more rules,

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.169
then he can not say "screw you" to anyone.

00:10:20.169 --> 00:10:22.029
He'll wipe out Jim's entire bloodline.

00:10:22.029 --> 00:10:25.399
Do you understand the gravity of your situation?

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:30.730
Jim says "screw you" and Frank hands him the
keys to a car with $260,000 in it.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.680
Jim is standing in front of a nail salon Mr.
Lee is in with the money bag.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.490
He goes inside and instead of handing him
the money, he tells him he wants Mr. Lee to

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.769
loan him and he will get him his money.

00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:45.639
He gets beaten up by Mr. Lee's men and still
speaks disrespectfully to Mr. Lee and demands

00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:47.689
$150000.

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:50.389
Mr. Lee laughs and gives him the money.

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:51.389
Last day.

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:56.399
Jim gives Lamar $150000 to throw the Wildcats
basketball game.

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:59.009
Neville is watching, Jim is in the stadium.

00:10:59.009 --> 00:11:03.680
In the first half, Lamar plays like he always
does, making Neville uncomfortable.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.569
When Lamar starts missing easy throws, he
gets booed by the crowd and is substituted.

00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:13.550
Lamar feels humiliated, the Wildcats had a
14 point lead and now they are losing.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:17.439
Lamar is back in the game, he remembers Jim
saying it was still his call and he decides

00:11:17.439 --> 00:11:18.870
to win the game.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:23.410
If the Wildcats win the game by less than
8 points, it's still considered a toss-up.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:27.709
In the final seconds, Lamar has the ball and
he throws, misses and wins the game for the

00:11:27.709 --> 00:11:30.019
Wildcats and Nevilles bet.

00:11:30.019 --> 00:11:33.709
Some time later Jim sits in Neville's office
and asks if they are even.

00:11:33.709 --> 00:11:37.639
He hands him his money with interest and when
Neville inquires where he got the money, he

00:11:37.639 --> 00:11:39.439
says he got it from Frank.

00:11:39.439 --> 00:11:43.130
Neville knows what kind of man Frank is and
is disgusted with Jim.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.120
Jim had sent Dexter to Las Vegas to bet all
the money he got from Frank on a Wildcats

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.480
win by 7 points or less.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:53.570
Jim calls Frank and tells him he got his money
and they need to meet in Koreatown.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:55.639
Reluctantly Frank agrees.

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:59.620
Jim grabs all the money he can and heads to
underground Korean establishments.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.199
The casino section.

00:12:01.199 --> 00:12:05.009
There he meets Mr. Lee, whom he tells he got
his money and points out that Frank is there

00:12:05.009 --> 00:12:07.050
too, and he owes them both money.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:10.970
He does not have enough to pay them both,
so he'll bet it all on roulette, either he'll

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.060
pay them both back or none.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.189
Mr. Lee and Frank can not do anything to Jim
because Koreatown is run by another gang of

00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:18.300
mobsters.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:22.910
He takes out all the cash, the room goes silent,
places it on the roulette table and says "all

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.059
on black".

00:12:24.059 --> 00:12:27.550
The leader of the Koreatown gang nods like
he's taking the bet.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.439
The ball lands on black.

00:12:29.439 --> 00:12:33.270
With a sigh of relief, Jim turns and tells
him that the money is for the two gentlemen

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.769
and that he is not actually a gambler.

00:12:35.769 --> 00:12:40.829
Jim leaves Koreatown, Frank pulls up near
him and says "here is $100000, there was a

00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:43.639
little extra from his bet, and it's on him."

00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:45.019
Jim says screw you.

00:12:45.019 --> 00:12:50.629
Jim is not a real gambler, he is someone who
uses gambling merely as a means of self-destruction.

00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:52.990
His primary goal is to lose everything.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.560
Nobody who wants to win, doubles up on every
single hand.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.230
Jim was seeking the loss.

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:07.600
He runs all the way across town to Amy's house
and knocks on her door.
