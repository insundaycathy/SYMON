00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.619
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:07.049
Today, I'm going to explain an action, adventure,
and fantasy film called "Coma."

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.410
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.019
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.070
An architect wakes up in his room, which appears
normal to him initially, but everything is

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.700
not what it seems.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.810
As he begins to look around, he sees disintegrated
parts of the room.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.570
But to his confusion, it regenerates as soon
as it comes into his view.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.850
He becomes more bewildered when he gets outside,
where he comes across people who appear to

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.990
be missing parts of their bodies.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.230
On the streets, the arrangement of the roads
and buildings are in disarray.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.140
Some are upside down, while others are tilted
in different directions.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.500
As the Architect goes further, he comes across
a decayed structure and begins imagining what

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.210
it used to look like.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.740
As he stares at it, the building starts restoring
itself right before his eyes.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.930
Suddenly, a monstrous black creature jumps
down from a building and starts running towards

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.010
him.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.630
Before the beast could reach him, he is stunned
by a powerful blast.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.170
With the monster gone, two men and a woman
rush over to him and carry him to safety.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.920
They all start running as other creatures
continue to chase them.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.570
The group manages to kill another monster,
but another soon corners them.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.780
Seeing no other way to escape, the man they
call Pilot decides to activate an explosive

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.140
device and blows himself up next to the creature.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.159
With the monsters no longer in pursuit, the
Architect starts asking questions about what

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.440
happened to him.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.580
The woman, who calls herself Fly, reveals
that they are all in a coma.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.650
She explains that all the structures around
them are memories of comatose people.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.090
The people who are missing parts of their
bodies are also memories.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.540
As she continues to explain their situation,
Fly notices a wound on the Architect's face

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.659
and heals it by hovering her hand over his
head.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.940
They get inside a dilapidated bus that functions
as a wormhole that transports them directly

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.229
to their base.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.890
As soon as the team gets out of the vehicle,
a woman named Spirit starts asking them about

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.300
Pilot.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.490
Phantom, who leads the squad in their missions,
tells Spirit that Pilot sacrificed himself

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.600
to kill one of the monsters they refer to
as Reapers.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.420
As the group argues over Pilot's loss, their
top leader, Yan, emerges and assures them

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.719
that the sacrifice was worth it.

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:17.670
As Fly shows the Architect around the base,
she explains how they keep themselves safe

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.010
from the Reapers.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.239
The paths leading up to the building are always
blown up so the creatures wouldn't find them.

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.010
However, the routes always reappear because
someone would remember them.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.700
Fly notes that their leader is searching for
an island that would keep them safe from the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.569
Reapers, so they have to go out to look for
people who can help them get there.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.340
The Architect comes across a room and sees
large holes with a view that seems out of

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.360
place.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.120
Fly tells him that those are dreams that materialize
when they go to sleep.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.400
As she shows the Architect his room, she reveals
that newcomers usually go through an initiation.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.189
Yan, however, already decided to let the Architect
join without the initiation.

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.950
Fly says that Yan had been able to leave the
coma before, and he's the one who taught the

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.620
group to survive.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.379
After the Architect goes to sleep, he starts
dreaming about the last moments before an

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.959
accident that seemed to have caused his coma.

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.549
He wakes up to find an overturned vehicle
in his room, along with a hole that gives

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.529
him a view of the building that he saw in
his dream.

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:15.569
As he approaches the hole, Phantom warns him
that he could get lost in there if he goes

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:16.569
inside.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.709
He tries to make the Architect feel at ease
in his new surroundings.

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.919
However, Phantom senses that the Architect
and Fly seem to be getting too close to each

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.620
other, so he tells him to stay away from her.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.609
Phantom is not in a romantic relationship
with Fly, but he thinks that he's getting

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:31.609
close.

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.739
The Architect tells Phantom to let Fly make
her own decisions, so the squad leader gets

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.489
angry and takes the newcomer outside.

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.079
In the yard, Phantom points out that some
people in coma develop extraordinary abilities,

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.829
which usually manifest when they're in grave
danger.

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.949
He orders a man named Gnome to shoot him with
a makeshift cannon to demonstrate his ability.

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:56.089
When Gnome fires, Phantom immediately catches
the projectile with his bare hand.

00:03:56.089 --> 00:04:00.279
Gnome proceeds to shoot two rounds at the
Architect, hitting him each time.

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:04.669
Gnome then brings out a training machine that
the Phantom operates with remote control.

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.569
The robot hits the Architect several times,
making him fall to the ground.

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.939
As he tries to block the attacks from the
machine, faint glowing lines appear over him,

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.569
but they fade away quickly.

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.329
Phantom stops attacking him and assigns him
to a team led by a man named Cable.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.460
The following day, Phantom prepares a team
to retrieve explosives from a submarine from

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.699
Cable's dream.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.520
The Architect sulks in a corner because he
wasn't allowed to join the team.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.860
Cable tells the Architect that they're lucky
they don't have to come with Phantom because

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.110
they're a lot safer staying behind.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.270
As Cable advises the Architect, Yan interrupts
him and explains what he discovered about

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.830
their strange world.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.139
He found out that time moves much slower in
a coma compared to the waking world.

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.729
Yan surmises that months could pass by in
their current state, but only one day had

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.210
elapsed in reality.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.039
Yan claims that he had been there for fifteen
years and asserts that people can even survive

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:55.590
for thousands more.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.889
He tells the Architect that he'll be able
to do what he wants in this strange world.

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.710
After speaking with Yan, The Architect approaches
the Phantom and tells him that he wants to

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.860
come with them.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.020
On their way to the submarine, a man they
call the Astronomer starts telling the Architect

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.930
about his theory about dreams.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.639
The Astronomer explains that dreams contain
their memories about their real lives even

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.699
though they don't remember their past.

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.050
He believes that they will be able to wake
up from the coma when they explore their dreams.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.800
Spirit detects the Reapers in their vicinity,
but the Astronomer assures them that they

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.710
are out of the monsters' reach.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.419
They explain to the Architect that Reapers
can sense humans through a particular signal

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:32.629
they emit.

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.169
Gnome points out that he created the "whistle"
so one of them can use it to lure the creatures

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.909
and blow themselves up.

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.970
The Astronomer tells the Architect that Reapers
are coma patients who are brain-dead and only

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.949
kept alive by life-support.

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:49.110
They soon arrive at the submarine port, which
is guarded by armed men from Cable's memories.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.319
Spirit creates a diversion by using her ability
to conjure up an illusion.

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.230
They wait for the other guards to finish their
rounds, but Phantom gets impatient and throws

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.830
an explosive at them.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.669
The explosion alerts the other guards, forcing
the squad to engage them in a firefight.

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.629
The team manages to take out all the guards,
but the Astronomer fears that the firefight

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:10.389
might have attracted the attention of the
Reapers.

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.449
The group starts retrieving the torpedo from
the submarine, with four of them holding the

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:18.139
chains to lift the armament while Cable detaches
it from the ship.

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.419
With minutes more to go, Spirit suddenly senses
Reapers within the vicinity.

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.159
Phantom orders the group to take care of the
Reapers and leave Gnome behind to hold down

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:27.410
the chains.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.939
The chain, however, is too heavy for one person
to hold, so the Architect asks for help.

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:37.319
In his frustration, Phantom shoots the chain
and breaks it, causing Cable and the torpedo

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:39.260
to slip from the submarine.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.949
Due to the distressful situation, the Architect
suddenly manifests his ability and saves Cable

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:48.830
by creating a ramp out of thin air, allowing
him and the armament to slide down safely.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.979
The squad evades the Reapers and takes the
torpedo back to their base.

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:57.069
That night, Phantom asks the Architect whether
he can use his ability to build a wall that

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:01.360
would protect them in combat or even a bridge
that would allow them to go anywhere.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.180
Yan contends that there's a better way they
can use the Architect's abilities.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.139
He suggests that the Architect can build an
entirely new island for them instead of using

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:11.759
the sites that have been constructed from
their memories.

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:16.050
He argues that a new place built from scratch,
unattached from any memory, would be safe

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.389
from the Reapers.

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:21.060
The Architect agrees to build the place and
assures them that he can do it.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.970
Yan announces that they'll be leaving their
base in the morning.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.360
He then appoints the Astronomer as the new
squad leader due to Phantom's recklessness.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.539
Furious from losing his position, Phantom
threatens to reveal Yan's secrets to the whole

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:33.770
group.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.979
While everyone else sleeps, the Architect
tries to create something with his mind but

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:38.979
fails.

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:43.320
Fly sees him and realizes that he hasn't learned
to control his abilities yet, so she chastises

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.150
him for telling Yan that he can build the
island.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.039
She points out that the Architect was able
to come up with a blueprint when he was concentrating

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:53.090
and moving his hand, so the Architect tries
again.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.430
He starts thinking of a 3D layout until it
manifests and slowly turns into a model of

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.690
a spiral-shaped building.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.620
Fly inspects the model and asks the Architect
if she could see his memories.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.810
When they get to his room, she notices the
overturned car and surmises that the Architect

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.380
had been in an accident.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.300
The Architect reveals that before he fell
into a coma, he was in the car to meet with

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.620
a potential client, but the meeting turned
out to be a trap.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.651
He had previously wanted to wake up, but he
had since changed his mind, knowing that he

00:08:20.651 --> 00:08:23.280
is free to do whatever he wants in the coma.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.219
Fly says she only has a few memories of her
past, but she remembers that she can't be

00:08:27.219 --> 00:08:29.090
with the person she loves.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.450
She leans in to kiss the Architect, saying
that the coma has made it possible.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.460
The following day, the residents prepare for
the journey to the new site.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.350
While the others are busy, Phantom takes a
whistle from Gnome's bag and hides it in his

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.350
jacket.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.920
As they go on their way to the new location,
Spirit detects the presence of Reapers.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.380
The group splits up and tries to look for
a different route.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.910
The Astronomer asks the Architect to go up
the hill and get back to them when he sees

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.140
an airplane.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.130
When the Architect gets there, a Reaper slowly
approaches him from behind.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:04.910
A man named Tank fights off the creature and
takes the Architect back to the group.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.150
Phantom intercepts them and tries to plant
the whistle on the Architect.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:12.410
The squad, however, figures out that the Phantom
planted the explosive.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.380
When they confront him, they notice that his
body is disintegrating.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.320
Finding himself in a desperate situation,
the Phantom tells the residents that Yan was

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.160
responsible for putting them all in the coma.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.390
Yan shoots the Phantom, but he is still able
to run away despite the fatal shot.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:31.640
A Reaper catches Gnome and kills him, causing
other members of the group to panic.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.520
The Architect tries to protect the group,
but Yan pulls him and orders him to return

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.700
to the bus.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.890
Phantom, realizing that his body is already
falling apart, tries to call the attention

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.470
of a Reaper using the whistle, but the creature
ignores him.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:49.480
The squad gets cornered by Reapers as they
approach the bus, so they run in another direction.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.030
As the Architect runs after the group, he
starts waking up.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:57.320
As he opens his eyes, he sees a picture of
an Egyptian temple on the wall.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.960
He starts recalling the events that led to
his coma and found himself going through his

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.570
architectural designs as Fly drives him to
his client.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:09.570
Fly warns him that the client is a notorious
sect that might use his designs malevolently.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:14.900
When they reach the gates of the sect's headquarters,
a man, who introduces himself as a disciple,

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.400
approaches them and tells them that only the
Architect can go inside.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.440
Fly hands him a taser as he gets out of the
car.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.940
Inside the building, the disciple tells him
that their headquarters was once a hospital

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.980
before their organization took over.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.940
They soon walk into a hall where the Architect
meets the sect's Teacher, Yan.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.940
After discussing his designs, Yan leads him
to a ward the organization keeps coma patients.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.370
The Teacher hints that he wants to give his
followers a new life by putting them in a

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:41.450
coma.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:46.040
When he asks the Architect to be a part of
the experiment, he refuses and tries to leave.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.080
Two doctors try to subdue him, so he uses
the taser on one of them and runs back to

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.220
the car.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.080
As Fly drives away from the headquarters,
they collide with a truck.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:00.360
The Architect, now fully awake, finds himself
and Fly in the ward with other patients.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.451
Yan explains that Fly was put in a coma just
a couple of hours before the Architect, but

00:11:04.451 --> 00:11:06.830
months had already passed when he got there.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.500
He reveals that the religious sect was only
a cover to help them raise funds for their

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.730
operation.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.660
He assures the Architect that his plan to
build a new city was real.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.851
Yan walks over to Phantom's bed and discloses
that he had fully recovered his memory, but

00:11:19.851 --> 00:11:23.010
he decided to stay in a coma until a Reaper
caught him.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.760
The Architect begs Yan to let him and the
others go, but the leader insists on putting

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.630
him back in a coma to finish building the
island.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:34.010
The Teacher swears that he won't keep anyone
against their will if the Architect returns.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:38.240
As soon as the Architect agrees to Yan's terms,
the doctors inject the man with a drug to

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.190
stimulate his brain to recover his memory
faster once he's comatose.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:46.490
Yan promised to show the back door to the
Architect if he does everything he asks.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.570
After waking up in his apartment, the Architect
uses his abilities to get back to the field

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.190
and help the squad.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.860
As they walk on their way to the site, the
Architect tells them about their comatose

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.860
state.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.630
But before the Architect could reveal any
more of Yan's plans, the leader arrives and

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.750
tells him to start building the island.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:07.170
Once the Architect finished, Yan starts revealing
what each squad member was doing before they

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.730
went into a coma.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:13.080
Spirit had been experiencing hallucinations
and convulsions almost daily, so she has been

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.580
sent to an asylum.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.480
Tank had lost his family in an accident, and
he almost got locked up for trying to shoot

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.660
his neighbors.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.960
The Astronomer is an autistic who cannot leave
his house and has to be cared for by his aging

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.960
parents.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.410
Yan points out that the Architect had problems
of his own.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:31.220
He hasn't made any money from his beautiful
designs because potential clients think that

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.100
they're way ahead of their time.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.210
He reveals that Fly intends to leave him because
he was becoming moody due to the lack of interest

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.890
in his creations.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.060
Spirit and the Astronomer express their desire
to stay in a coma, but Yan says he can't let

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.710
them be a part of it because they might reveal
what they know to his other followers.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.470
They promise to keep the secret, but the leader
refuses to take the risk.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.480
Tank starts to disintegrate as a disciple
turns off his life support.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.310
The leader advises them to bid each other
goodbye before the disciple unplugs another

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.720
machine.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.770
When he goes outside, the Architect sees the
Egyptian temple depicted in the picture he

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.670
saw in front of his bed.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:08.790
Waiting for them outside the temple is Yan,
who stops them from escaping.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:14.330
The Architect uses his ability to drop a large
slab on Yan, but he breaks it before it hits

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:15.330
him.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.180
Fly's body starts to wither away while the
leader strangles the Architect.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:23.490
As Yan uses his ability to disintegrate the
Architect, a Reaper stabs the leader in the

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.490
back.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.810
After Yan disappeared, the Reaper starts morphing
its shape to resemble Phantom and refrains

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.860
from harming either the Architect or Fly.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.579
When he goes outside, the Architect sees the
Egyptian temple depicted in the picture he

00:13:32.579 --> 00:13:33.579
saw in front of his bed.

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:34.579
Waiting for them outside the temple is Yan,
who stops them from escaping.

00:13:34.579 --> 00:13:35.579
The Architect uses his ability to drop a large
slab on Yan, but he breaks it before it lands

00:13:35.579 --> 00:13:36.579
on him.

00:13:36.579 --> 00:13:37.579
Fly's body starts to wither away while the
leader strangles the Architect.

00:13:37.579 --> 00:13:38.579
As Yan uses his ability to disintegrate the
Architect, a Reaper stabs the leader in the

00:13:38.579 --> 00:13:39.579
back.

00:13:39.579 --> 00:13:40.579
The Reaper morphs its shape to resemble Phantom
and refrains from harming either the Architect

00:13:40.579 --> 00:13:41.579
or Fly.

00:13:41.579 --> 00:13:42.579
The Architect walks towards the temple and
wakes up, leaving Fly behind as she starts

00:13:42.579 --> 00:13:43.579
to disintegrate.

00:13:43.579 --> 00:13:44.579
After becoming fully conscious, the Architect
goes straight to Fly's bed and wakes her up.

00:13:44.579 --> 00:13:46.120
As they get up to leave the hospital, the
disciples arrive in the ward, only to find

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.380
that the Teacher has passed away.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:52.620
Back at home, the Architect has started to
design ordinary buildings to attract potential

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.620
clients.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.710
Although no one has contacted him about his
proposals, he assures Fly that there's no

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.180
need to worry about money because he has another
job.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.080
The couple soon learns that there will be
no charges against Yan's sect due to a lack

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.840
of evidence against them.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.210
Furthermore, the religious organization is
still growing steadily despite the allegations

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:11.420
against its leaders.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.880
The Architect says he's not worried about
the sect anymore.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.330
As they prepare to go out, Fly tells him there
was a letter addressed to him.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.460
The Architect tells her that he already saw
it and it only contained documents from an

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.830
old project.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:35.670
He sees a leaflet from Yan's organization
and locks it away in his drawer.
