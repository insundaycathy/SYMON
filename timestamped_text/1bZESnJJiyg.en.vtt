00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.500
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.120
Today, I'm going to explain a drama, fantasy,
horror film called "Tale of Tales."

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.120
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.270
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.590
In the kingdom of Longtrellis, the townspeople
are preparing to entertain the King and Queen.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.780
The King and the rest of the court are visibly
happy with the performances, but the Queen

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.910
doesn't share everyone's uplifted mood.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.530
When one performance ends with a jester spilling
a bucket of water on a pregnant woman, the

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.449
Queen hastily leaves the room.

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.411
With tears at the corner of her eyes, she
marches away from the crowd with the King

00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:31.000
and his servants following her.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.290
The Queen reaches their chambers and starts
breaking items out of anger.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.590
When the King finally reaches her, he comforts
her as she weeps.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.420
That evening, a necromancer visits the royal
couple, offering them a way to finally conceive

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.480
a child.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.219
He explains that the birth of life must cost
a death to maintain the balance of the world.

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.260
The Queen is prepared to sacrifice her life
to give birth, eager to hear the man's solution.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.730
The necromancer promises that the Queen will
be instantly pregnant if she eats a sea monster's

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.500
heart, which must be prepared alone by a maiden.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.050
To carry out the instructions, the King sets
out into the river and to the sea, wearing

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.230
armor that allows him to breathe underwater.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.440
At the bottom of the sea, he finds a pale
reptilian creature sleeping.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.390
Slowly, he approaches the beast and stabs
it with his spear.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.840
The creature wakes up, angered by the pain,
and throws the King off.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.030
The King gets up, unable to see amidst the
blood mixed in the water.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.780
Finally, he sees the creature just before
it swings its scaled tail at him before perishing

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.220
from the wound.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.510
With the creature dead, the King's men cut
out its heart and lay it before the King,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.400
who bears a gash across his stomach.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.920
The King laughs, knowing that he succeeded,
before succumbing to his wounds.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.400
The Queen approaches him and takes the creature's
heart in her arms, barely looking at her fallen

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.560
husband.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.090
As the Queen instructed, a maiden prepares
the monster's heart, which still beats even

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.450
after being cut out.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.829
As soon as the maiden puts the heart into
a pot of boiling water, she begins to feel

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.920
strange, clutching at her belly in pain.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.060
Determined to carry a child, the Queen devours
the heart, her hands and face covered in its

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.060
blood.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.479
On the next day, both the Queen and the Maiden
give birth.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.310
Holding her son, the Queen is delighted, finally
having her wish come true.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.180
The King of Highhills and the King of Strongcliff
attend the funeral for the King of Longtrellis.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.710
During his wake, the Queen of Longtrellis
fawns over her son while the maiden carries

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.710
her own.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.180
Sixteen years later, the Queen of Longtrellis
plays with her son, Elias, in the garden maze.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.569
She struggles to keep up with him, allowing
him to hide along with his friend, Jonah,

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.180
who looks exactly like him.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.669
Elias and Jonah climb over the maze, leaving
the Queen wondering where her son has gone

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:23.669
to.

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.860
She heads back to the castle and spots Elias
riding a horse with Jonah.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.919
Elias and Jonah hide from the knights who
are looking for the prince.

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.279
Being able to breathe underwater, the two
boys evade the knights easily.

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:35.799
The Queen calls in the maiden, who is Jonah's
mother.

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.680
The Queen threatens to banish both Jonah and
his mother if Jonah continues to see Elias.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.029
Elias finds Jonah's mother in tears as she
walks out of the courtroom, leading him to

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:46.069
question the Queen's insistence on separating
him from Jonah.

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.079
But the Queen reminds him that she is both
his mother and his Queen; thus, he should

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.129
obey her.

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.069
The Queen warns Elias that if she sees him
with Jonah again, they will both regret it.

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.060
Meanwhile, the King of Strongcliff wakes up
after a night of drinking and pleasure.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.269
He stumbles inside his castle, intrigued by
a woman's singing.

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.449
He looks out the window and spots a woman
in town who hides from him when he makes suggestive

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:05.650
remarks at her.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.299
Determined to get her attention, the King
sends the woman an expensive necklace, unaware

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.010
that the woman is old.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.159
The woman, Dora, and her sister, Imma, fawns
over the necklace.

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.370
That evening, the elderly sisters prepare
for bed when the King of Strongcliff knocks

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.370
on their door.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.459
He expresses his desire for Dora, whom he's
fallen for after he heard her sing.

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.319
Knowing that he won't be happy to see Dora's
appearance, Imma is about to confess when

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.709
Dora stops her.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.709
Dora teases the King, wanting to take advantage
of the opportunity.

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.260
She promises that she will offer him a piece
of her if he returns in a week.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.079
Confused yet overcome with desire, the King
agrees.

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.540
In the kingdom of Highhills, the princess,
Violet, plays a song that she composed for

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.540
her father.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.939
The King of Highhills becomes distracted when
a flea continues to appear despite him swatting

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:48.939
it away.

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.989
Violet sees her father's distraction, concerned
yet continues to sing.

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.299
After the song is over, the King heads to
his room and tends to the flea.

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.859
He places it in an ornate box, fascinated
by the tiny insect.

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.319
As days go by, the King of Highhills is more
focused on caring for the flea than on his

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.319
kingdom.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.290
Meanwhile, Violet's tutor reads a romantic
novel to her, which grows her interest.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.359
One afternoon, Violet insists on getting married,
but she gets discouraged when the King doesn't

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.129
share her eagerness.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.540
After Violet complains about her supper, the
King takes her leftovers to the flea, which

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.540
has grown gigantic.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.330
The flea, hidden in his chambers, enjoys the
meal while the King is pleased as if caring

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.590
for a child.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.169
Back in the kingdom of Longtrellis, the Queen
and Prince Elias watch a bear perform circus

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:28.169
acts.

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.800
Seeing her son laugh, the Queen is glad, thinking
that he's distracted enough not to disobey

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.200
her further.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.699
That evening, the Queen prepares for an event
and asks Elias for help.

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.139
While he helps her put on a pair of earrings,
the Queen catches a whiff of his scent, baffled

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.860
at what she smells.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.120
When he leaves, the Elias that helped her
was apparently Jonah, who meets with Elias

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.259
in his room.

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.231
The real Elias is ecstatic with the news,
thinking that they can both pretend to be

00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:51.380
King once Elias ascends the throne.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.009
Unbeknownst to them, the Queen listens to
their conversation through the window.

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.370
Having heard enough, she knocks on his door,
causing the two boys to switch clothes hurriedly.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.870
The Queen enters to remind Elias that she
has sacrificed a lot to give him life despite

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.110
having only carried him in her womb for a
night.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.139
When her words don't sway Elias, she tells
him that no one would love him as much as

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.000
she does before leaving.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.740
With the Queen gone, Elias and Jonah share
confused looks before Jonah heads out to return

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.810
home.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.710
Jonah climbs down the stairs and into the
butchery.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.750
There, the Queen ambushes Jonah, hunting him
down with a fire poker.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.409
Jonah evades and hides behind the hanging
meats as the Queen continues to search for

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:25.409
him.

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.760
Jonah crawls away from the scene, avoiding
the wrathful Queen.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.050
On the next day, the Queen and Elias pose
for a royal painting, but the prince is distracted,

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.360
seeing Jonah bid his mother goodbye outside.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.930
Unable to ignore this, Elias follows Jonah
and asks why he's leaving.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.879
Jonah dodges his question but plunges a knife
into a tree root where water spouts out.

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:44.880
He promises Elias that as long as the water
is clear, he is well.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.979
With that, Jonah leaves his friend, with the
Queen watching from a distance.

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.430
Days later, a few kids play with ducks on
the tree where the water spouts.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.090
Elias shoos them away and checks on the water,
glad that it's still clear.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.469
Back in Strongcliff, Dora and Imma attempt
to make her finger look younger to deceive

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:02.080
the King, but when Dora fails, she weeps.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.800
The King of Strongcliff arrives, waiting at
her door.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.639
Out of options, Dora uses Imma's younger-looking
finger to deceive the King, which he lustfully

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.789
fawns over.

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:13.120
The King demands her to show more, driving
Dora to a corner.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.030
Pretending to be a shy maiden, Dora tells
him that she will spend the night with the

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.180
King only if he meets her in total darkness.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.039
The King eagerly agrees.

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:23.449
That evening, Imma helps Dora prepare before
joining the King in his bed.

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.319
Imma prays for Dora to be safe despite fooling
the King, then goes to bed, feeling alone

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:29.550
for the first time without her sister.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.080
That morning, the King wakes up and sees Dora
clearer.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.879
When he sees her disfigured and aged appearance,
he demands the guards throw her out, accusing

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:37.280
her of being a witch.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.830
As the King commands, the knights throw her
out of the window, saved only by her blanket

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.460
that gets caught on the tree branches.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.130
A passing witch laughs at Dora's condition
before rescuing her.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.240
Once Dora is on the ground, she weeps in both
pain and heartbreak.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.100
The witch carries her to her chest and nurses
her like a mother.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.449
When the witch leaves, Dora is fast asleep,
turning into a beautiful young woman.

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:00.319
Later that day, the King of Strongcliff hunts
in the woods when he finds the younger Dora.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.370
Immediately, he falls in love with the enchanting
woman.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.080
At the kingdom of Highhills, the King calls
his doctor to heal the gigantic flea.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.389
The doctor is confused, having never seen
a creature like it before.

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:13.729
But it's too late; the giant flea dies, leaving
the King mourning.

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:17.449
He tells the doctor to keep the creature's
existence a secret before he goes.

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:20.419
In the morning, Violet picks out a dress that
her father sent.

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:23.580
The King of Highhills finally agrees to let
her marry, but her husband will be chosen

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.039
by a tournament, though he is sure that the
game he chose will be difficult to win.

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:30.050
Violet worries that she will not love the
man who wins or that she'll be stuck with

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.050
her father if no one wins.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.270
The King has the gigantic flea skinned and
uses its hide for the tournament, promising

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.940
that whoever guesses which animal the hide
was taken from will marry his daughter.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.780
Violet watches mournfully as men she doesn't
like walk up to the hide and take their guess.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.560
When she spots a nobleman that she likes,
Violet asks her father the correct answer,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.150
promising that she won't tell anyone.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:52.400
The King finally relents, telling her that
the hide came from a flea, but Violet is underwhelmed,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.909
thinking that he is lying.

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:57.880
The crowd gasps when an ogre steps up to guess.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.789
Believing that no one would be able to know
the correct answer, the King allows the ogre

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:03.830
to take part in the contest, much to Violet's
dismay.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.010
The ogre sniffs the hide carefully, then answers
that it's from a flea.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:11.020
The King's smile dissolves, now bound to let
an ogre marry his daughter.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.530
Violet rushes away, climbing over the castle
walls.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.840
The King finds her standing on the edge, ready
to take her own life.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.319
He pleads for her to stop, claiming that he
didn't expect anyone to guess.

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:23.590
Hoping to save his daughter, the King apologizes
and tells her that it's perhaps God's will

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.650
for her to marry the ogre, that it'd bring
her happiness.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.099
Violet accuses him of being less of a beast,
given that he doesn't care for his child.

00:08:30.099 --> 00:08:33.110
This angers the King, asserting his authority
on her.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.579
With her voice breaking, Violet accepts the
marriage and leaves.

00:08:36.579 --> 00:08:39.530
Marching out of the castle, Violet cries and
meets her new husband.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.820
The ogre drags her out to the woods and carries
her to the mountain.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.830
They arrive at his cave, but Violet hesitates,
frightened by the sight of numerous animal

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:46.830
bones.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:51.140
Later that day, Violet remains in her corner,
mournful of the life she's pushed into.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.370
The ogre pulls her back into the cave and
forces himself on her.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.029
In the kingdom of Longtrellis, the tree sprouts
blood, alerting Elias that something happened

00:08:58.029 --> 00:08:59.029
to Jonah.

00:08:59.029 --> 00:09:02.990
He rides alone into the woods, leaving his
mother and her subjects to look for him.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.910
Elias arrives in a town and is mistaken to
be Jonah.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.750
Jonah's mother and her friends are glad to
see him safe, telling him that he'd been gone

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.360
for five days.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.480
Back in the kingdom, the necromancer tells
the Queen that Elias and Jonah are inseparable.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.000
He warns that her violent desires will require
violence, which the Queen is willing to pay.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.790
In the woods, Elias continues to search for
Jonah.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:25.420
Hearing him, Jonah calls out from a cave but
cannot move due to his injury.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.209
Instead of Elias, a strange creature finds
Jonah, cornering him into a hole.

00:09:29.209 --> 00:09:31.810
Elias sees Jonah and carries him away from
the beast.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:35.420
The monster stops when Elias uses his body
to shield Jonah, allowing the prince to stab

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.550
the creature.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.670
It instantly dies, letting the two leave and
reach the town.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.290
Elias goes, knowing that his friend is safe.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:47.160
Back in the cave, the monster slowly disintegrates,
leaving the Queen of Longtrellis' body behind.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.970
In Strongcliff, a servant brings Imma a dazzling
dress, giving her an invitation to the royal

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.980
wedding sent by the future Queen.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.240
Thinking that Dora succeeded in seducing the
King, Imma happily accepts.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.579
Imma attends the wedding that evening, nervous
about being around noblemen and ladies.

00:10:00.579 --> 00:10:04.040
When the King and his new Queen arrive, Imma
is confused, seeing the tall young woman in

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.440
the King's arms.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.030
Later, the Queen takes Imma out of the court,
revealing herself as Dora.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.810
Imma is frightened, confused at what happened.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.519
Dora explains that she woke up and sees that
she's changed her skin.

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:18.149
Imma lovingly touches her sister's youthful
look as Dora promises that she will take care

00:10:18.149 --> 00:10:19.430
of her sister.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.630
Dora has Imma promise that they will keep
it a secret before leaving.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:26.130
As the King and Queen begin the feast, Imma
tries to keep up but becomes distracted by

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.680
circus performers.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.900
She tastes the food and becomes obsessed,
having never tried such delicacy before.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.610
When the celebration is over, Imma is drunk
and refuses to leave the castle.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.720
Dora takes her away and urges her to leave.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.720
Imma insists on wanting to stay by her side,
but Dora refuses, knowing that it may jeopardize

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.050
her schemes.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:47.400
Afterward, Dora prepares for bed, but Imma
sneaks into her room, begging to stay.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.079
Angered, Dora shuts her down, reminding her
of her old appearance and so no one would

00:10:51.079 --> 00:10:52.550
believe that they are sisters.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.940
Imma now decides that she wants to be young
too, begging Dora to tell her how she did

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:56.940
it.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.889
Frustrated, Dora lies that she had herself
flayed to change her skin.

00:10:59.889 --> 00:11:02.759
As Dora is pulling Imma to leave, the King
arrives.

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:06.010
Dora hides Imma behind curtains as she spends
her honeymoon evening with the King.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.940
Imma watches the newly married couple, allowing
the King to spot her in the room.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.980
He assumes that Imma is the same woman he
had thrown over the window, alarming the guards.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.850
Dora tries to calm her husband down, hoping
that Imma, who she now claims to be a neighbor,

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:18.890
won't be harmed.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.560
But the King insists, frightened by the woman.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.640
Dora allows her sister to get dragged away,
not wanting to reveal who she really is.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.740
In the morning, Imma approaches a doctor,
begging him to flay her to change her skin.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.100
The doctor refuses, thinking that she's gone
mad.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.699
Imma moves on, searching for anyone else who
would skin her to turn her young.

00:11:35.699 --> 00:11:39.839
Imma offers a man all the jewelry that Dora
gave her for the wedding ceremony as payment.

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:41.639
The payment convinces him.

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:43.540
The man takes her to the woods and does the
deed.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.730
Imma whimpers in pain but holds on, believing
that it will turn her young and beautiful.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.329
She walks back to town, bloody and weak.

00:11:50.329 --> 00:11:54.339
In the ogre's cave, Violet desperately tends
to her clothes when she hears someone outside.

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:57.750
Desperately, she climbs out and finds a woman
whom she begs for help.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.310
But the woman refuses, scared of the ogre.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.920
Violet pleads in tears, making the woman think
twice.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.410
The woman promises to bring others for help
tomorrow, forcing Violet to spend another

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.779
night with the ogre.

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:12.370
The following morning, Violet helps the ogre
clean animal skins when she spots a young

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.020
acrobat who helps her across the cliff.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.480
The ogre notices her gone and chases after
them.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.899
The acrobats cut the rope as soon as Violet
is across, causing the ogre to fall off the

00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:22.170
cliff.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.510
Happy to be rescued, Violet rides with the
acrobats and celebrates.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.490
But the ogre, who survived the fall, reaches
their trailer and attacks them.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.420
Violet grabs a knife before running with the
survivors to escape.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.130
Hidden behind a pile of branches, the acrobat
shakily drinks some fuel then blows fire onto

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.490
the ogre's face.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:41.420
The ogre screams in pain but catches the acrobat,
choking him until his neck breaks.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.300
The woman tries to save him but suffers the
same fate.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.930
Now alone, Violet runs away from her husband,
tired and frantic.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.819
She climbs over rocks but finds herself on
a dead end.

00:12:50.819 --> 00:12:54.440
Hearing the ogre's grunt, she crouches down
in tears until he sees her.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.350
Frightened by his anger and with nowhere else
to go, Violet slowly walks back to him.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.180
The ogre grabs her and pushes her back.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:04.240
Then, in an attempt to calm him, Violet softly
lays her head on his chest.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.579
The ogre accepts her embrace and motions for
her to climb over his shoulder to take her

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:08.579
home.

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:12.440
Instead, Violet slits his throat and watches
him scramble until he bleeds out.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.819
In the castle of Highhills, the King has grown
ill but gains his strength back when he hears

00:13:15.819 --> 00:13:17.420
that Violet has returned.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.490
Violet approaches her father, covered in blood
while carrying the ogre's head to present

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:21.740
to her father.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:25.529
Filled with grief and fear, the King kneels
before her and begs for her forgiveness.

00:13:25.529 --> 00:13:28.610
The rest of the court kneels before their
princess, who pities her father but succumbs

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.360
to tears as well.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.810
Days later, Violet is crowned as the Queen
of Highhills, finally taking charge of her

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:34.810
life.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:38.220
The King of Strongcliff, Dora, and Elias attend
her coronation.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.820
Above them, an acrobat walks on a tightrope
on fire in honor of the family of acrobats

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.790
who died after rescuing Violet.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.360
While everyone's eyes are on the performance,
fate plays a cruel trick on Dora as she notices

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.630
her skin begin to wither and wrinkle.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:14:01.340
Horrified, she rushes out of the castle, unable
to face her husband in her true form.
