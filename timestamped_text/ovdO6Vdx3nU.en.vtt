00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.960
Story Recapped here. Today I'm going to&nbsp;
explain a Korean drama film called Oldboy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.000
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.320
In 1988, A middle-aged man named Oh Dae-su was&nbsp;
arrested for public intoxication and disorderly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.560
conduct on the night of his daughter's&nbsp;
birthday. After his friend, Joo-hwan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.880
bails him out, he calls his daughter on the&nbsp;
phone to tell her to wait for him. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.360
before he could go home, he suddenly disappears,&nbsp;
leaving behind the present for his daughter.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.040
Dae-su soon finds himself locked up in a hotel&nbsp;
room with no windows, not knowing who his captors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.400
were or why he was abducted. He is constantly fed&nbsp;
through a trapdoor, but he is also being gassed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.000
almost on a regular basis whenever his captors cut&nbsp;
his hair, change his clothes or clean up his room.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.520
The only way Dae-su can learn about&nbsp;
the outside world was through the TV.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.680
One day, he finds out that his wife, Kim Ja-hyun,&nbsp;
had been killed. His blood and fingerprints were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.800
found at the crime scene, so he has become&nbsp;
the prime suspect. By this time, Dae-su has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.840
started suffering from hallucinations. As months&nbsp;
and years pass, he continues to descend into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.160
madness and tries to take his own life several&nbsp;
times, but his captors revive him each time.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.440
Frustrated by his situation, Dae-su starts&nbsp;
keeping a journal and writes down the names&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.840
of people who might have a grudge against him.&nbsp;
He also starts training himself to fight in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.080
hopes that he could use it against his&nbsp;
captors someday. After about six years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.960
he had begun to dig a hole through the wall using&nbsp;
only a metal chopstick. He keeps removing a few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.040
bricks from the wall over the years until he&nbsp;
can hold out his hand and feel the rain outside.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.400
Dae-su starts planning his escape and covers the&nbsp;
hole with the bed, but before he could completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.080
hide it, he is knocked unconscious by the sleeping&nbsp;
gas. As he lay on the bed, a woman arrives in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.600
room and hypnotizes him. After fifteen years in&nbsp;
captivity, he emerges from a luggage and finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.000
himself outdoors wearing a brand new suit&nbsp;
and a watch. After adjusting to the light,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.960
he sees his journals inside the luggage. He looks&nbsp;
around and sees another man sitting on the ledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.920
Holding his pet dog, the man tells Dae-su not&nbsp;
to stop him from jumping off the building.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.800
Seeing another human being for the first&nbsp;
time, Dae-su takes the man's hand and holds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.680
it against his face. As Dae-su continues&nbsp;
to relish his freedom, the man asks him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.040
"even though I'm no better than a&nbsp;
beast, don't I have the right to live?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.240
Dae-su just smiles and repeats the question.&nbsp;
As the man was about to fall backward, Dae-su&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.120
grabs him by his necktie. He tells the man to&nbsp;
listen to his story first before killing himself.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.360
After telling his story, Dae-su&nbsp;
walks away and grabs his journals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.080
He completely ignores the man who was hoping&nbsp;
to reveal the reason why he wanted to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.680
As Dae-su leaves the building, the man&nbsp;
falls to his death on top of a car.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.600
Dae-su starts contemplating his next move while&nbsp;
walking around the city. He avoids contacting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.440
his relatives or friends, knowing that he is&nbsp;
still a suspect for the murder of his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.400
When he comes across a group of young men on the&nbsp;
streets, he tries out his fighting skills against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.000
them. Using only his fists, he successfully beats&nbsp;
them up and continues wandering through the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.120
While he was sitting in front of a&nbsp;
seafood restaurant, a homeless man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.360
hands him a cellphone and a wallet full&nbsp;
of money. The homeless man tells Dae-su&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.320
to avoid asking him any questions&nbsp;
because he doesn't know anything.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.440
After inspecting the wallet, Dae-su enters&nbsp;
a sushi bar and asks the server to bring him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.560
something alive to eat. Dae-su later recognizes&nbsp;
the server as one of the contestants in a cooking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.320
competition on TV. When his phone starts ringing,&nbsp;
he answers immediately and asks who's calling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.680
The man on the other end taunts Dae-su by asking&nbsp;
if he liked his new suit. Dae-su demanded to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.320
why he was incarcerated and starts guessing who&nbsp;
was behind the abduction. The man on the phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.440
says that his identity is not that important. He&nbsp;
tells Dae-su to reflect on his past to find out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.560
why he was locked up. The mysterious voice went&nbsp;
on to ask Dae-su to find him quickly and hangs up.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.040
As Dae-su puts down the phone, the&nbsp;
server brings him a live octopus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.480
as he requested. She asks Dae-su&nbsp;
if she should slice it up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.120
but he just grabs it and starts devouring it.&nbsp;
He collapses as soon as he finishes his meal.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.240
When he wakes up, he finds himself in the&nbsp;
server's apartment recovering from a fever.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.200
The server tells him that the medicine&nbsp;
she gave him was quite effective.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.440
While walking toward the bathroom,&nbsp;
the server tells Dae-su that the lock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.000
is broken but warns him against following her&nbsp;
because she has a knife. Despite the warning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.120
Dae-su still goes inside the toilet and forces&nbsp;
himself on her. The server thwarts his attempt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.520
by hitting him on the head with the butt of the&nbsp;
knife. Dae-su prepares to leave the apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.840
but the server stops him. She introduces&nbsp;
herself as Mi-do and tells him that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.680
is also interested in getting intimate with&nbsp;
him, but she won't do it until she's ready.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.400
Dae-su soon decides to look for his&nbsp;
estranged daughter with Mi-do's help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.800
They find out that a couple from Sweden had&nbsp;
adopted his daughter. Dae-su gives up on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.560
contacting his daughter and goes on a quest&nbsp;
to find the man who abducted him instead.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.280
One day, Mi-do receives an online&nbsp;
message from a man using the ID&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.400
"Evergreen," asking her about&nbsp;
"The Count of Monte Cristo."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.960
When Dae-su comes closer to investigate, Evergreen&nbsp;
asks him how he's doing in the "bigger prison."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.680
Mi-do tells him that she has been chatting with&nbsp;
Evergreen for some time to talk about sushi.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.000
Dae-su thinks that he can't trust Mi-do because&nbsp;
of her online relationship with Evergreen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.080
so he tries to find his captors on his&nbsp;
own. He soon discovers the restaurant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.560
that delivers the food that he had eaten while&nbsp;
he was in captivity. He follows a delivery man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.280
to the building where he was incarcerated and&nbsp;
attacks a guard with a hammer. He later discovers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.840
that the prison is run by a criminal organization&nbsp;
specializing in incarcerating people for a price.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.640
Dae-su tortures the man in charge of the&nbsp;
operation by pulling out his teeth with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.000
claws of a hammer. The man, named Mr. Park, says&nbsp;
he never met with the client who paid for Dae-su's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.960
incarceration, but he recorded the phone call.&nbsp;
Dae-su takes the recording and tries to leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.160
building, but a hoard of men waits for him outside&nbsp;
Park's office. Armed only with his hammer and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.720
fists, he fights them all off. He continues&nbsp;
to fight even as he is stabbed in the back.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.400
When Dae-su finally gets out of the building, he&nbsp;
pulls out the knife and collapses on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.120
A man on the street helps him up and puts him&nbsp;
inside a taxi. The stranger gives the driver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.160
an address and reveals himself to be responsible&nbsp;
for locking up Dae-su by calling him out by name.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.120
Unable to do anything because of his injuries,&nbsp;
he just looks at the man as the taxi drives off.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.320
Back at home, he listens to the recording&nbsp;
that he took from Mr. Park's office. He hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.880
the man and Mr. Park talking about the length of&nbsp;
incarceration and the types of drugs that they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.080
use to medicate him if he develops schizophrenia&nbsp;
during his captivity. When Mr. Park asks what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.040
Dae-su did to deserve a lengthy incarceration,&nbsp;
the client tells him that Dae-su talks too much.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.360
The next day, Dae-su pays a&nbsp;
visit to his friend, Joo-hwan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.800
to ask him if he recognizes the&nbsp;
client's voice in the recording.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.080
Joo-hwan cannot identify the client, but he&nbsp;
helps Dae-su find Evergreen online. Evergreen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.640
taunts Dae-su further by letting him know that the&nbsp;
statute of limitations on him has already expired.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.440
Dae-su goes back to Mi-do's home and starts&nbsp;
torturing her to find out what she knows about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.560
Evergreen. As he tries to force more information&nbsp;
out of Mi-do, Joo-hwan calls to tell him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.640
he had discovered Evergreen's identity.&nbsp;
Joo-hwan tells him that Evergreen's real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.280
name is Su Dee-ah, and he lives in a building&nbsp;
just across the street from Mi-do's apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.520
He immediately runs to the apartment and&nbsp;
meets Evergreen and his bodyguard, Mr. Han.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.240
Evergreen tells Dae-su that he will kill&nbsp;
Mi-do in five days unless he uncovers the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.800
motive behind his incarceration. He offers&nbsp;
to take his own life if Dae-su succeeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.080
Dae-su tries to attack Evergreen, but the&nbsp;
bodyguard fends him off. Evergreen went on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.400
to tell Dae-su that he will never find out the&nbsp;
motive if he kills him. He further reveals that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.040
is wearing a pacemaker that he can deactivate with&nbsp;
a push of a button if Dae-su tries to torture him.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.480
As Evergreen prepares to leave, he encourages&nbsp;
Dae-su to seek vengeance to deal with the pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.520
of losing his wife and child. He reminds Dae-su&nbsp;
that he had left Mi-do tied up in her apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.080
with the door wide open. Dae-su rushes back&nbsp;
to Mi-do's place after hearing her scream.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.240
When he arrives, he sees Mr. Park and his goons&nbsp;
abusing Mi-do. The goons overpower Dae-su and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.160
hold him down as Mr. Park attempts&nbsp;
to remove his teeth with a hammer.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.240
A phone call interrupts them, and Mr. Han&nbsp;
later arrives at the apartment and offers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.960
a briefcase full of money to Mr. Park. After&nbsp;
looking at the briefcase, he agrees to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.080
it and leave Dae-su unharmed. Dae-su threatens&nbsp;
to cut off Mr. Park's hand for abusing Mi-do.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.920
Dae-su and Mi-do immediately leave the apartment&nbsp;
after the goons left. On their way to a motel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.600
Mi-do sings a song to indicate that she&nbsp;
is ready to get intimate with Dae-su.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.440
After their lovemaking, sleeping gas seeps into&nbsp;
their room, and Evergreen goes in to leave them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.480
a package. When they opened it, they see&nbsp;
Mr. Park's severed hand. Dae-su realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.720
that Evergreen has bugged them, so he goes to&nbsp;
a shop to find the device and get rid of it.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.000
Sometime later, Dae-su and Mi-do stop by&nbsp;
Joo-hwan's internet cafe to learn out more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.560
about Evergreen. As Mi-do goes through the&nbsp;
search results on the internet, Dae-su and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.560
Joo-hwan soon realize that Evergreen was the&nbsp;
name of their batch in their old high school.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.280
Dae-su and Mi-do go to the school to look&nbsp;
at the yearbook for the class of '79.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.400
He learns that Evergreen was a fellow student&nbsp;
named Lee Woo-jin. Dae-su calls Joo-hwan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.880
to ask if he knows anything about Woo-jin.&nbsp;
Joo-hwan says he doesn't recognize the name.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.160
Dae-su starts asking Joo-hwan about a female&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.280
student named Soo-ah. Joo-hwan tells Dae-su that&nbsp;
she died after he transferred to another school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.280
When Dae-su asks for more details, Joo-hwan tells&nbsp;
him that Soo-ah was a very promiscuous girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.400
Unbeknownst to them, Woo-jin is at Joo-hwan's&nbsp;
cafe during the phone call. Enraged by how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.200
Joo-hwan described Soo-ah, Woo-jin kills him and&nbsp;
reveals to Dae-su that Soo-ah was his sister.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.800
Dae-su tracks down Mr. Park to ask for more&nbsp;
details about his incarceration. Due to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.360
loss of his hand, Mr. Park willingly tells Dae-su&nbsp;
that he had drugged the water to make him more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.640
susceptible to hypnosis. He also agrees to keep&nbsp;
Mi-do safe while Dae-su goes on to find Woo-jin.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.960
Another former classmate tells Dae-su&nbsp;
that Joo-hwan spread the rumors about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.840
Soo-ah's promiscuity. Dae-su later recalls that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.200
he had accidentally witnessed Woo-jin&nbsp;
and Soo-ah engaging in intimate acts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.160
He remembers that he had told Joo-hwan about it&nbsp;
just before he transferred to another school.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.800
Using the clues left behind by Woo-jin, Dae-su&nbsp;
was able to pinpoint where his former captor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.520
lives. He confronts Woo-jin and accuses him of&nbsp;
using hypnosis to erase the memory of what he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.880
witnessed in school. Woo-jin argues that it wasn't&nbsp;
hypnosis that made him forget about the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.320
Dae-su simply forgot about it because it&nbsp;
wasn't something that should concern him.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.040
Woo-jin reveals that the rumors about Soo-ah&nbsp;
getting pregnant have started to spread soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.760
after Dae-su left the school. The gossip has&nbsp;
gotten so bad that Soo-ah began to believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.840
that she was actually pregnant. Woo-jin&nbsp;
blamed Dae-su for spreading the rumors.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.800
Dae-su accuses Woo-jin of killing his own sister&nbsp;
because he feared people would find out about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.080
their illicit relationship. Woo-jin dismisses&nbsp;
the accusations and starts recounting how he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.720
arranged the meeting between Dae-su and Mi-do&nbsp;
with the help of a hypnotist. He shows Dae-su&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.920
a photo album of his wife and child. As Dae-su&nbsp;
flips through the album, he sees photos of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.800
child growing up. Dae-su is horrified as he finds&nbsp;
out that his daughter had grown up to be Mi-do.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.640
Enraged by what he discovered,&nbsp;
Dae-su attacks Woo-jin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:06.240
but Mr. Han stops him. Dae-su struggles to&nbsp;
fight off Mr. Han but manages to injure him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.840
Despite his serious injury, Mr. Han is still able&nbsp;
to subdue Dae-su. After watching the altercation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.840
for some time, Woo-jin gets frustrated&nbsp;
and decides to kill his own bodyguard.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.000
Woo-jin goes on to tell Dae-su that&nbsp;
Mr. Park is still working for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.440
Back in Mr. Park's building, Mi-do is presented&nbsp;
with a gift box and was told to open it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.040
Dae-su tells her over the phone not to&nbsp;
look inside and wait for him to get back.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.520
Dae-su starts begging Woo-jin&nbsp;
not to reveal the truth to Mi-do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.520
He kneels in front of Woo-jin and starts&nbsp;
barking like a dog as a sign of his submission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.000
Failing to make an impression on Woo-jin,&nbsp;
he decides to cut off his own tongue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.680
Woo-jin finally relents and tells&nbsp;
Mr. Park to keep the gift box closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.640
He walks away leaves Dae-su with the&nbsp;
remote control for his pacemaker. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.920
when Dae-su pushed the button, it only played&nbsp;
an audio recording of him and Mi-do making love.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.520
Woo-jin walks into the elevator and&nbsp;
starts recalling Soo-ah's death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.760
Woo-jin tries to save her from falling,&nbsp;
but Soo-ah tells him to let her go.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.040
As soon as the elevator opens,&nbsp;
Woo-jin shoots himself in the head.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.160
Now living in a secluded countryside, Dae-su&nbsp;
writes a letter to the hypnotist to tell his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.200
story and ask her for help. She tells Dae-su that&nbsp;
she initially had no intention of helping him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.200
but the last part of the letter convinced&nbsp;
her. In the last sentence of the letter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.200
Dae-su asks, "Even though I'm no more than&nbsp;
a beast, don't I have the right to live?"

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.080
The hypnotist warns Dae-su that something&nbsp;
might go wrong and mess up his memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.320
Dae-su agrees to go ahead with the session&nbsp;
anyway. She proceeds with the hypnosis and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:39.040
tells Dae-su that his mind will be split into&nbsp;
two personalities. The first personality will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.440
not know the truth about Mi-do, while the other&nbsp;
one is the monster who will keep the secret.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.320
The monster will start walking away and age one&nbsp;
year with each step until he reaches 70 and dies.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.320
Later on, Dae-su wakes up alone in the snow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.760
Mi-do comes over and tries to warm him up. She&nbsp;
embraces Dae-su and tells him that she loves him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.280
Dae-su breaks into a smile upon&nbsp;
hearing about Mi-do's feelings for him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.840
but the smile slowly turns into a look of&nbsp;
grief and pain as they continue to embrace.
