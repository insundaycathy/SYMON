Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:08.069
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of
the 2018 British horror film called 'Malevolent'.

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.650
The film is directed by Olaf de Fleur Johannesson
from a screenplay by Ben Ketai and Eva Konstantopoulos,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.470
based on the novel Hush by Konstantopoulos.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.330
The movie follows a group of scammers profiting
from phoney paranormal experiences.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.280
Their crew gets more than they expected when
they travel to a country estate, and one by

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.300
one, they start to lose touch with reality.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.940
Warning: there will be spoilers ahead, so
please proceed with caution.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.950
The story begins in Scotland, 1986.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.239
Angela and Jackson are American siblings who
operate a phoney medium scam on clients who

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.040
believe their houses are haunted, working
with a small crew of paranormal investigators.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.399
In order to help Angela advertise her special
talents as a medium, the team leverages the

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.489
reputation of her late mother.

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.429
While he owes money to loan sharks, Jackson
orchestrates the schemes because of the debt

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.030
he has accrued.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.960
Strange occurrences happen on their current
job, prompting Angela to wonder if these things

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.239
are manifestations of her mother's experiences.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.310
They've been hired to bring quiet to the school
by a new customer, Mrs. Greene.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.580
Since the assignments Angela just finished
were disturbing, she rejects down the request;

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.120
she does some research on the caller's residence
and learns that all of the previous foster

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.020
children, as well as the son of the property's
owner, were all discovered dead with their

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.800
mouths sewed shut, 15 years before.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.210
For money to pay off the loan sharks, Jackson
decides to take the job, despite his sister's

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.890
misgivings.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.420
Jackson devises a strategy to cheat Mrs. Greene
by enlisting the help of his team of technologists.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.650
When Elliot follows Angela into the restricted
East Wing, she finds the ghosts of the slain

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.270
girls on the floor and follows them into the
secret passageway leading to the North Wing.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.070
The girls' former captivity is discovered
by Angela, Elliot, and Jackson.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.040
Jackson learns that they've failed, and Mrs.
Greene thinks they're likely scammers.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.070
When Mrs. Greene threatens to reveal Jackson's
part in the girls' killings, he chooses to

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.580
leave the position.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.130
In the attic, Jackson discovers Beth, his
lover and technician, comatose, with her lips

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.380
sewed shut.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.550
During the escape attempt, Jackson causes
a vehicle accident that kills Beth.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.879
Herman, Greene's son, catches the siblings
one by one, with Jackson being the first.

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.659
Before sending her son, Herman, to murder
him, Mrs. Greene takes out Jackson's tongue,

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.499
drills out his teeth, and stitches his mouth
shut.

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:24.060
After Mrs. Greene got started on Angela, the
photographer Elliot was able to murder Herman

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.209
at the same time Angela begs and pleads with
the girls' spirits to aid her.

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.440
While Mrs. Greene is distracted, Angela frees
herself and kills her.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.799
As Angela makes her way to the road for aid,
she sees Jackson's spirit, who is desperately

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.129
seeking for Beth, fade away.

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.060
Angela and Elliot are rushed to the hospital
and are in critical condition.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.989
When Angela informs her grandfather that she's
not alone since a black shadow has passed

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.180
over her, we can assume it is her mother or
Jackson.
