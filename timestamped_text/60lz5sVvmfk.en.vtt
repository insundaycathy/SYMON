and it focuses on a bank security guard who

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.230
gets telekinetic superpowers after drinking
water from a meteor-affected mountain spring,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.650
and chooses to use them to save his estranged
daughter and her neighbourhood from an evil

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.180
construction firm.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.300

hospital.

he leave the premises.

legal interests.

by his abandoning of her as a kid.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.390

to beat off the attackers, leaving everyone

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.440
in awe.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.280
When Min attempts to report the incidents
to the police, the officer on duty does not

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.020
believe him, much to the amusement and joy
of the store owners.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.730
Seok-heon then employs his telekinesis to
construct a huge wall around the market area,

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.970
therefore safeguarding the local merchants.

in order to legally demolish the local businesses.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.900
She utilises her contacts to get police assistance
and creates a distraction by having Seok-heon

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.170
detained on bogus charges.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.950

to demolish the barrier and arrest the store

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.270

With the cops on their tail, Roo-mi and the
business owners run to a nearby building.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.890
Seok-heon escapes his detention cell after
watching the incident on the news and summons

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.500
the power to fly.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.080
He gets on the scene just as the store owners
reach the rooftop of another building and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.390

temporary structure.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.180
They kidnap Roo-mi and pull her into the hanging
structure.

Unfortunately, the crane fails and Roo-mi
is thrown out.

Seok-heon swoops in and saves her before handing
her over to the fugitive store owners.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.909
He approaches Min, who is present with the
riot police, and punches him unconscious before

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:26.890
surrendering to the cops.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.040
Seok-heon is freed from jail four years later
and is picked up by Jung-hyun, who announces

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.150
his engagement to Roo-mi.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.970

which is now an empty and vacant plot; Jung-hyun

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.540

skills to serve beverages to the clients.
