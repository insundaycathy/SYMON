00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.040
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today, I’m&nbsp;
going to explain an American science&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.840
fiction action film called “Surrogates.” 
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care!
 
&nbsp;

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.120
In a futuristic world, the field of robotic&nbsp;
science has been highly developed. Mankind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.720
manufactures an artificial life form called the&nbsp;
“surrogate”. The surrogates are realistic-looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.600
robots that are linked to people’s brains. They&nbsp;
are connected to the brains with a device that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.800
has more than a hundred sensors. When a human&nbsp;
is seated on a chair-like device, those sensors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.000
attach to different parts of the human brain.&nbsp;
By this process, whatever the human thinks of,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.680
the surrogate does. Officials describe it as&nbsp;
controlling your second body through your brain.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.200
The inventor of the surrogate, Lionel Canter, made&nbsp;
it to help disabled people live life as normal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.960
human beings. However, only three years later,&nbsp;
it starts to be used in wars to strengthen the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.080
military. As more devices are manufactured, they&nbsp;
become cheap enough to be bought by the general&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.520
public. This event changes the course of human&nbsp;
life. People begin using their surrogates to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.720
outside their homes and eventually, they become&nbsp;
fully dependent on it. Because of the surrogate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.680
you can go out without having to physically leave&nbsp;
the house which minimizes the risk of accidents,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.040
robberies, and diseases. Moreover, you can look&nbsp;
however you like without having to go through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.640
plastic surgery or exercise. The surrogate will be&nbsp;
the new you and will interact with the people of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.920
your life while you control it from your home. 
Only seven years after the invention, the largest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.640
surrogate company named VSI released a statement,&nbsp;
saying that currently, 98% of the world population&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.320
uses surrogates in different aspects of their&nbsp;
lives. Humans live in near-total isolation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.640
rarely leaving the comfort of their homes.&nbsp;
Their surrogates interact with other people’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.360
surrogates which has become the fashion of&nbsp;
life now. Because of the use of surrogates,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.320
violent crimes, communicable diseases, and&nbsp;
discrimination decrease to a record low.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.920
However, not everyone is fond of this technology.&nbsp;
There is a minority group that believes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.880
humans are not supposed to live through machines.&nbsp;
They have established surrogate-free zones in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.280
different parts of the US and are led by&nbsp;
a man widely known as the Prophet. 
&nbsp;

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.040
It is now fourteen years after the invention of&nbsp;
surrogates. A young man is on his way to a club.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.720
He lies to his dad on the phone, saying that he&nbsp;
is about to go see an opera. At the club, he jumps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.160
off from a balcony but lands safely suggesting&nbsp;
that the guy is a surrogate. He meets a girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.920
while dancing and brings her out. As the two make&nbsp;
out, a man on a motorbike uses a device on the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.480
to kill them. When the paramedics and police&nbsp;
arrive, they find out that the guy surrogate’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.840
memory chip is completely fried, so they cannot&nbsp;
find his registered owner. However, the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.000
surrogate is registered by the name of Cameron&nbsp;
McAllister. Two FBI agents named Tom Greer and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.800
Jennifer Peters find Cameron’s address and visit&nbsp;
her. However, when they reach the house, they find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.040
out that Cameron is actually a middle-aged&nbsp;
man who has been killed while sitting on his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.400
surrogate-linking device. This is the first murder&nbsp;
in years, so the detectives are shocked. 
&nbsp;

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.200
The scene cuts to a running subway. Tom is&nbsp;
returning home from work and we see everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.600
around him is a surrogate. When he reaches&nbsp;
home, he brings water for the real him who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.000
looks vastly different. The real Tom has&nbsp;
been using his handsome and young-looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.400
surrogate to live his life for him.
After putting the surrogate to his station,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.800
Tom walks out of his room to meet his wife,&nbsp;
Maggie but instead he is greeted by maggie’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.160
surrogate. Tom hasn’t met his wife in a long&nbsp;
time and only talks to her surrogate. Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.000
suggests they go for a vacation somewhere&nbsp;
but Maggie would rather send her surrogate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.360
for vacation and experience life through her. 
Somewhere else, some teenagers find their friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.360
Jarod Canter dead in his dorm room,&nbsp;
while still on his stim chair.
&nbsp;

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.160
At the FBI office, the detectives are discussing&nbsp;
the case. They figure that whatever device the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.040
surrogates were killed with, killed their owners&nbsp;
as well. Such a case was deemed impossible till&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.080
then, because the owners are not supposed to feel&nbsp;
what surrogates feel. They find out that Jarod&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.520
was the son of Dr. Lionel Canter, the inventor of&nbsp;
surrogates. Tom and Jennifer make an appointment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.400
with Dr. Canter and go to meet his surrogate.&nbsp;
They figure out that Canter has been using several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.120
surrogates at a time, which is considered&nbsp;
illegal. However, since he is the inventor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.240
the detectives dismiss it. Jarod was using&nbsp;
one of Canter’s surrogates when he got killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.240
This makes the detectives believe that the&nbsp;
killer was after Canter, not Jarod. 
&nbsp;

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.600
They then go to the largest surrogate&nbsp;
manufacturing company, VSI headquarters to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.600
investigate, but the CEO dismisses them, claiming&nbsp;
that the surrogates are 100% safe to their owners.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.720
By the camera footage embedded in&nbsp;
Jarod’s surrogate when he was killed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.680
they find the picture of the man who killed him.&nbsp;
They go to a colleague named Bobby Saunders who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.080
is an administrator of the FBI computer system. He&nbsp;
figures Jarod’s killer’s name is Miles Strickland.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.520
Bobby also has access to every single surrogate&nbsp;
in the US and can turn them off at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.560
After finding Miles’s location, Tom and a&nbsp;
colleague pursue him on a helicopter. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.200
as they are about to get him, Miles flashes all&nbsp;
the detectives with the weapon, killing both the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.280
surrogates and the operator. He also harms the&nbsp;
real Tom and kills his friend. Their helicopter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.320
crashes in a restricted area filled with anti&nbsp;
surrogates. Before Tom can get the killer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.600
his surrogate is killed by the anti surrogates.&nbsp;
The real Tom is injured because of the weapon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.789
He walks out of his room and falls unconscious.&nbsp;
Then, we see Miles meet the leader of the anti&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:36.720
surrogates, the Prophet who asks him what he&nbsp;
told Tom. Miles insists that he didn’t reveal any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.840
information but the Prophet kills him anyway.
Tom wakes up in the hospital where he finds out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.280
he has been suspended for a week for landing onto&nbsp;
the restricted area. However, he is determined to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.560
solve the case, so he goes outdoors without the&nbsp;
surrogate for the first time in years. He then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.160
goes to the restricted area to meet Miles again&nbsp;
but comes across his body being cremated. Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.880
asks the Prophet about the weapon Miles used&nbsp;
earlier, but he claims he has never seen one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.240
The Prophet’s men realize he is a cop and beat&nbsp;
him. Tom gets out of the restricted area when a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.360
young man offers him a ride home. Turns out&nbsp;
the man is Canter’s surrogate. He asks Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.960
about Jarod’s murder case. Canter advises Tom to&nbsp;
focus on the weapon and where it came from. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.240
an injured Tom reaches home, he sees Maggie with&nbsp;
her young friends hanging out in the living room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.120
Maggie gets nervous when she sees him, but&nbsp;
he doesn’t confront her. Later, Tom sees her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.600
talking to a man and beats him but the man&nbsp;
is a surrogate so it doesn’t bother him. 
&nbsp;

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.640
In the following scene, we see a man break into&nbsp;
Jennifer’s house and kill her. Right after,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.960
he takes control of her surrogate. 
The following day, Tom visits the military&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.240
general and asks him about the weapon. The general&nbsp;
informs him that the weapon is called an “overload&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.960
device”. It was made as a war weapon to&nbsp;
bug the surrogates with a software virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.600
However, the officials didn’t know that the&nbsp;
virus would kill the operators as well. 
&nbsp;

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.360
After they figured it out, the manufacture of&nbsp;
the weapon was ceased. VSI was the manufacturer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:09.200
of the weapon and they destroyed every unit of&nbsp;
it. However, this one weapon was left out. In&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.120
exchange for the information, Tom tells them&nbsp;
that the restricted area has the weapon. 
&nbsp;

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.720
Then we see the Prophet hand his men the weapon&nbsp;
to deliver it to Jennifer’s surrogate. 
&nbsp;

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.840
Tom then goes to Maggie’s work and asks her if&nbsp;
she misses their son. It turns out that the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.880
had lost their son in a car accident and Maggie&nbsp;
has not been able to recover since. We get a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.960
glimpse of her real self who is old and wrinkly,&nbsp;
a total opposite of her surrogate. She and Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.080
are still grieving the loss of their child. 
Somewhere else, the military attacks the Prophet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.400
and his men to get the weapon back from&nbsp;
them. However, when they shoot the Prophet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.880
who is the leader of the anti surrogates,&nbsp;
they find out that he is also a surrogate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:54.480
The scene cuts to Dr. Canter on his computer&nbsp;
monitoring the person in front of the Prophet. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.840
get to know that Canter was the one posing as the&nbsp;
Prophet to stop the use of his own invention. 
&nbsp;

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.320
Tom meets Jennifer’s surrogate, who is now&nbsp;
being controlled by Canter. She tells Tom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.680
that Canter’s son was killed by VSI and their&nbsp;
boss Andy Stone. They had figured out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:15.600
Canter was trying to stop the use of surrogates&nbsp;
which would cause VSI a huge loss. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:21.360
they, along with Stone, planned to kill Canter&nbsp;
with the weapon. However, they killed his son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.760
mistakenly. Carter couldn’t bear the thought&nbsp;
of his son dying and made it his mission&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.200
to kill all the people using surrogates. 
However, he needs the weapon and a code to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.800
it function. Jennifer already has the weapon. She&nbsp;
tells Tom that Stone was involved to kill Jarod&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.160
and asks him to bring Stone’s computer file to&nbsp;
her as evidence. Tom goes to meet Stone and knocks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:47.600
him out. He then downloads everything from Stone’s&nbsp;
computer and rushes out. Now that Jennifer finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.480
has the weapon and the code, she has to go to&nbsp;
Bobby to induce the virus through the weapon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.520
to every surrogate in the world. Tom realizes&nbsp;
that Jennifer’s surrogate has been taken over,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.400
but just then they get into an accident.&nbsp;
Jennifer runs to Bobby, while Tom rushes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.960
to the root of the problem, Canter.
Jennifer holds Bobby at gunpoint and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.840
induces the virus into the system. In a few&nbsp;
minutes, everyone with a surrogate will die.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.200
Just then, Tom reaches Canter’s mansion&nbsp;
and asks him why he is doing all this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.680
Canter replies that he had made the surrogates&nbsp;
to help handicapped people, not for everyone to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.880
be dependent on it. Now that his son is dead,&nbsp;
he doesn’t want to let his death go in vain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:32.400
and wants to end the surrogate “addiction”.
After laying out his reasons, Canter takes a pill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.600
and kills himself. Tom takes over Jennifer’s&nbsp;
surrogate and asks Bobby how he can stop the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.320
virus from spreading. Bobby quickly tells&nbsp;
him the codes and the two successfully save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.360
the surrogate’s operator. Now Tom has to&nbsp;
click a ‘yes’ to save all the surrogates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.960
He hesitates as Bobby tells him they have only&nbsp;
a few seconds left. He finally presses ‘No’,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:58.720
disabling all the surrogates in the world. We see&nbsp;
hundreds of surrogates stop working in the street.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.560
Soon, their owners come out of their&nbsp;
homes for the first time in years.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.840
Tom rushes back to his home to see the real maggie&nbsp;
is not in her room. He finds her in their son’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:13.360
bedroom and the movie ends as the two hug.
