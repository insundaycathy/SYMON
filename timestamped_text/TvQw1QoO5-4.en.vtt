00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.640
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.299
Today, I’m going to show a drama and sci-fi
film called, “Arrival.”

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.749
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:09.389
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.410
Louise Banks gives birth to a daughter and
watches her grow into a young woman, only

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.750
to see her succumb to a rare and incurable
disease.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.820
She is heartbroken and her life is changed
forever.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.949
It starts on the day they arrived.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.890
Louise is a linguist professor at a local
university.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.619
She’s walking to her first class in the
morning when she notices the ruckus around

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.360
the television in the common areas.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.110
There’s a strange hum in the air this morning
but she ignores it.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.850
She greets her class but finds the students
too distracted with their phones to pay attention.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.399
One student asks her to turn on the television.

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.750
On the screen, breaking news is being broadcasted.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.899
An unidentified flying object has landed in
Montana and eight more have landed in locations

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.469
around the world.

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.520
Just then, the university alarm rings and
Louise dismisses her class.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.989
As she goes home, she finds the world changed
and in turmoil.

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.350
People are evacuating, jets flying overhead,
and the military taking over.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.980
At home, Louise watches the news and learns
that twelve of the unidentified objects have

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.110
landed.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.130
Unsure of what to do, she goes to work the
next day only to find classes indefinitely

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.300
suspended.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.550
She stays in her office and tunes in to live
updates.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.570
Just then, two men visit her in her office.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.000
It’s Colonel G.T. Webber from Army Intelligence.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.220
She remembers him from that time she helped
in the translations with some insurgents.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.530
Webber tells her that she’s the top choice
for translations and that’s why he’s in

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.610
her office and not at Berkley’s.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.800
He plays her a recording of a human speaking
to an entity giving out low growls.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.640
Louise knows that it’s an entity from the
objects.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.150
She tells Webber that it’s impossible to
translate it unless she was in the same room

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.540
with the speaker, observing because this is
a language that doesn’t exist on Earth.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.690
Webber takes this as a ploy for her to be
part of the scene but he refuses.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.360
He doesn’t want the research center to become
a tourist site for anyone who has top security

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.420
clearance.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.770
He tells Louise that if he leaves now, her
chance is gone.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.300
He walks away but Louise calls out to him.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.150
She asks if they’re going to ask Danvers
next, another linguist, and tells him that

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.190
before they commit to him, ask him the Sanskrit
word for war and its translation.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.230
Later that night, Louise falls asleep in front
of the news when she wakes up to a helicopter

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.040
landing in her backyard.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.350
Webber has returned and asks her for the meaning
of “Gavisti,” the Sanskrit word for “war,”

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.410
and Louise replies, “A desire for more cows.”

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.320
Webber knows that Louise is more capable to
take on the job and orders her to be ready

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.610
in ten minutes.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.630
Louise joins the team on the helicopter and
meets Dr. Ian Donnelly, a theoretical physicist

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.920
whom she will be closely working with.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.400
Webber tells her that the first priority is
to know what they want and where they’re

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400
from.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.060
They arrive at the Montana site and are briefed
with the protocol and whisked away to Dr.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.700
Kettler who gives them some immunization shots.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.470
Louise arrives at the main control room and
learns that the site is communicating with

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.850
the other sites.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.240
She meets Agent Halpern from the C.I.A. who
tells her that they haven’t gotten much

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.970
information from the object since it landed.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.110
Louise and Ian are taken to another room where
they’re equipped with hazmat suits.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.350
They join a small team and make their way
to the object, now known as the “pod.”

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.700
Every 18 hours, a door opens up at the bottom
of the pod and the team goes in via a platform.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.870
Louise watches in awe as they get inside the
pod and feels the deep absurdity of the whole

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.240
situation.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.160
Once the platform reaches its limits, the
team jumps into the tunnel, floating their

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.620
way to the rectangular light ahead of them.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.490
Louise hesitates, having second thoughts,
but Webber grabs her and they make their way

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.209
through the antechamber.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.819
They arrive at the main room and see a glass
wall separating them from the entities inside.

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.530
The team places a caged bird on the floor,
indicating that while the bird is still alive,

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.069
the oxygen levels in the room are safe.

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.310
Soon enough, two giant cephalopod-like creatures
appear behind the glass.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.720
They call the aliens “heptapods,” due
to their seven limbs.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.310
The session is quickly over and they’re
brought to the disinfection room.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.060
Webber tells Louise and Ian that they have
two hours to figure something out.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.590
They continue to listen to the news and watch
as the world burns down in lockdown, riots,

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.010
and cult rituals.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.770
Agent Halpern communicates with the other
sites but they too are unsuccessful.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.970
The next day, they are set to enter the pod
again when Louise has an idea.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.630
She brings a whiteboard and a pen, saying
that they might be unable to understand their

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.190
spoken language, but they might have a written
basis of the language they’re speaking.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.840
Inside the pod, Louise writes the word, “human,”
and steps forward to show them.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.000
After a few seconds, one of the heptapods
responds, drawing out its limb and creating

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.180
a circular symbol with strokes.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.050
It continues giving out different circular
symbols, giving the team its first breakthrough.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.380
Back at the site, Webber questions her if
this is the right approach and how he would

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.930
be able to explain it to the upper office.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.190
Louise defends her approach and says that
if they don’t teach the heptapods their

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.600
own language, it would lead to a lot of miscommunication
and things will take ten times as long.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.300
Webber agrees for now but requires her to
submit a list of words before the next session.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.970
Louise learns that not all countries are open
to this friendly approach.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.040
The government is afraid that the other countries
would follow General Shang and China’s decision

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.520
for a hostile move.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.860
Meanwhile, Louise explains to Webber that
in order to communicate with the heptapods,

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.240
they first have to teach them the basics of
the English language before they can move

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.650
on to the big question, which is the purpose
of their arrival.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.260
They go back into the pod and Louise introduces
herself.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.100
Sensing the heptapods’s confusion, Louise
walks forward and takes off her hazmat suit.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.520
The team panics but she reassures them it’s
fine and continues with the operation.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.430
She walks to the screen and puts her palm
on the glass.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.630
One of the heptapods follows her action and
they properly introduce themselves again.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.490
Ian unzips his hazmat suit and introduces
himself as well.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.639
She asks them who they are and each of the
heptapods writes their names on the glass.

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.690
Ian decides to nickname them Abbott and Costello.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.640
As they get back from the pod, Louise dreams
about her daughter for the first time.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.639
Due to the session’s success, Webber allows
the operation to continue despite the contamination

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:54.639
risks.

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.660
Meanwhile, tensions from the soldiers arise
from the camp, not knowing what kind of threat

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.040
they’re up against.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.020
Later that night, Louise dreams of her daughter
again.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.790
They are in a field, exploring the flowers
and picking rocks at a nearby creek.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.710
Over the next several weeks, Louise and Ian
continue their research.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.720
Aside from seeing and hearing them, the heptapods
leave no other footprint.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.850
The chemical composition of their spaceship
is unknown.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.070
Assuming that the pods communicate with each
other, they do so without detection.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.980
They also still have no idea why the pods
chose to land on these specific locations.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.630
One of Louise’s first breakthroughs is learning
that there is no correlation between what

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.320
a heptapod says and what a heptapod writes.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.520
She also learns that the heptapod’s writing
is semasiographic, which means that it represents

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.800
meaning and doesn’t convey sound.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.460
Through the Pakistan site, they learn that
a heptapod’s logogram is free of time.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.570
Their writing has no forward or backward direction.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.160
Linguists like Louise call this non-linear
orthography, which makes them think if this

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.590
is also how they process ideas.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.100
Louise and Ian study their language enough
to create their first reply.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.870
Now, they’re working on expanding their
vocabulary which would take another month.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.160
One night after a session, Louise and Ian
hang out at the back of a pickup truck overlooking

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.259
the pod.

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:12.570
Ian expresses his admiration for her intelligence
and willingness to keep going and they talk

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.889
a little bit about their personal lives.

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:19.330
Louise thinks it’s all up to them now and
Ian is glad that it’s become that way.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.050
Outside the site, the world hasn’t coped
well with the presence of the pods.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.100
The looting and riots continue especially
after a leaked photograph of the aliens goes

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.110
viral.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.169
The tensions around the site grew worse as
well, with some soldiers thinking it’s better

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:35.139
off to draw the first fire before the aliens’
attack.

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:38.570
On another night of working, Louise dreams
of her daughter again.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.210
She’s showing her a book about planets and
her daughter shows her a picture she drew

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.300
for her project in class.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.010
She begins explaining to her why she and her
father aren’t together anymore, but her

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.590
daughter says it’s fine.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.180
She’s cut from her daydream by Ian and goes
out to get some air.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.820
She thinks of her again.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.830
This time she sees her as a child and then
later on as a teenager, lying sickly on a

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.480
hospital bed.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.030
Later on, Louise finds herself in her room
with Ian who’s discussing with her the Sapir-Whorf

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.250
hypothesis, wherein if you immerse yourself
in another language, you can actually rewire

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.470
your brain.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:14.160
He asks if she’s dreaming in her language
and when she looks up, a heptapod is in her

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.280
room.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.169
Louise wakes up in her bed, feeling relieved
that it was all a dream.

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:23.590
She meets up with Webber who leads her to
the control room to do a Mandarin translation.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.660
It turns out that their satellite picked up
on a phone conversation with the Chinese military

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.600
chief, General Shang.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.759
Louise translates the first sentence, saying
that each of the twelve is offering advanced

00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:37.699
technology and that their science team is
attempting to decode the sets.

00:08:37.699 --> 00:08:43.199
She tells Webber that she doesn’t understand
the following phrases, suits, honor, and flowers.

00:08:43.199 --> 00:08:48.470
He tells her that an hour ago, China mobilized
forces and now Russia is following their lead.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.740
Louise realizes that the phrases belong to
sets in Mahjong tiles and learns that they’re

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.370
using a game to converse with their heptapods.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.689
She raises her concerns about how problematic
this is, with every conversation becoming

00:08:59.689 --> 00:09:04.200
like a game and every idea expressed through
opposition, victory, and defeat.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.040
Webber then gives her the ultimatum and orders
her to ask the big question, whether they’re

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.040
ready or not.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.230
Louise, Ian, and the team enter the pod again.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.559
Louise begins to form her logograms, asking
the heptapods their purpose.

00:09:16.559 --> 00:09:19.949
Costello responds with a message saying, “offer
weapon.”

00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:24.709
Back at the site, an argument ensues between
Louise, Webber, and Agent Halpern.

00:09:24.709 --> 00:09:28.610
Louise insists that the heptapods may not
know the difference between a weapon and a

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:32.300
tool, and with the complex human language,
sometimes one can be both.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.490
Ian adds that they don’t know if the heptapods
are offering a weapon or asking them to offer

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.529
one, as the beginning of a trade.

00:09:38.529 --> 00:09:41.839
The only way to know the difference between
the two is to go back in.

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:45.369
A call interrupts their meeting and Agent
Halpern offers his theory that this is the

00:09:45.369 --> 00:09:49.220
way for the aliens to divide them and make
them fight amongst each other.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.660
The council disbands and Louise and Ian feel
defeated.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.869
Back at the control room, chaos is unraveling.

00:09:55.869 --> 00:10:00.249
China and Russia have received the same message,
misinterpreting it as a threat, and have cut

00:10:00.249 --> 00:10:04.509
their communication with the other pod sites,
going off the grid and offline.

00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:08.139
Louise insists that this will only worsen
the situation and they need to communicate

00:10:08.139 --> 00:10:09.459
with each other.

00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:12.179
She runs off with Ian to reenter the pod.

00:10:12.179 --> 00:10:16.350
Afraid of the impending threat, several soldiers
at the pod have formed a mutiny, carrying

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:21.509
several boxes of explosives and placing them
in the room, set to detonate in ten minutes.

00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:25.809
Louise and Ian arrive and one of the soldiers
tries to stop them, but they eventually let

00:10:25.809 --> 00:10:29.050
them go, despite knowing that the bomb will
kill them.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:33.580
Louise and Ian enter the room to talk to Abbott
and Costello, completely unaware of the bomb

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.709
sitting several feet away from them.

00:10:35.709 --> 00:10:38.910
Louise asks them if they are offering the
humans something.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:43.449
The heptapods reply with words like technology,
visitors, and friends.

00:10:43.449 --> 00:10:45.929
She then asks them to give the technology
now.

00:10:45.929 --> 00:10:49.050
Suddenly, Abbott starts tapping on the glass.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:53.339
Unbeknownst to them, Webber has sent security
to arrest the rogue soldiers.

00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:56.369
Back in the room, Abbott keeps tapping on
the glass.

00:10:56.369 --> 00:11:00.100
Louise walks forward and thinks Abbott wants
her to write on the screen.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.989
She places both palms on the glass and begins
writing together with Abbott.

00:11:03.989 --> 00:11:07.860
While in the middle of it, she dreams of her
daughter again, setting her off to sleep and

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.470
holding her hand.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:13.559
After they finish writing, Castello jets off,
leaving hundreds of symbols on the screen

00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:14.910
all at once.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.749
They look back outside, hearing gunshots.

00:11:17.749 --> 00:11:22.079
As the time ticks down to zero, Abbott forces
them outside of the room just as the bombs

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:24.209
explode and the room closes.

00:11:24.209 --> 00:11:28.819
Louise and Ian are thrown into the antechamber,
unconscious but alive.

00:11:28.819 --> 00:11:32.920
Louise wakes up and finds herself in Dr. Kettler’s
office with a concussion.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.779
They have survived the blast and Kettler informs
them of the rogue soldiers.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:40.499
She looks for Ian and finds him in the main
room with Webber and the rest of the team.

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:44.559
She tells them that they have to go back and
explain to the heptapods what happened.

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:48.029
He says that it’s impossible because his
orders have now changed.

00:11:48.029 --> 00:11:51.290
They need to evacuate and prepare for retaliation.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:54.149
Just then, a rumbling interrupts their conversation.

00:11:54.149 --> 00:11:59.170
The team runs outside and sees the pod lifting
itself several miles higher from the ground.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:03.350
Later that night, China officially declares
war against the aliens, urging several other

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.239
countries to do the same.

00:12:05.239 --> 00:12:09.089
Louise and Ian continue to decode the heptapods’
last message.

00:12:09.089 --> 00:12:12.139
As they discuss, Louise’s daughter enters
her mind again.

00:12:12.139 --> 00:12:16.249
She’s a young teenager now and she’s asking
Louise about a certain term that means two

00:12:16.249 --> 00:12:19.179
parties make a deal and both get something
out of it.

00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:23.639
Back at the site, Louise wakes up from her
dream and learns that Ian has made a breakthrough.

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:26.299
He says that the symbol for time is everywhere.

00:12:26.299 --> 00:12:29.959
He then calculates the amount of negative
space in the message and concludes that it

00:12:29.959 --> 00:12:31.470
means “one of twelve.”

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:35.680
Louise presents this discovery to the council,
saying that the message that the heptapods

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.309
gave them is one of twelve and that they need
to communicate with the other sites to piece

00:12:39.309 --> 00:12:41.230
the twelve messages together.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.610
Agent Halpern interrupts her and tells her
that it’s no use because they’re blacked

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.379
out and everyone is preparing for conflict.

00:12:47.379 --> 00:12:49.910
He then plays a recording taken from Russia.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:53.309
The aliens gave their final message, “There
is no time.

00:12:53.309 --> 00:12:54.709
Many become one.”

00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:57.399
The recording is then cut off by gunshots.

00:12:57.399 --> 00:13:01.670
Louise insists on her theory but Halpern remains
hostile, asking how they are going to convince

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.779
the other sites to share their data.

00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:09.260
Ian pipes in, saying they offer their data
in return, making it a non-zero-sum game.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.170
Louise picks this up and remembers this from
the conversation with her daughter.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.879
As Louise listens to the men argue in the
room, she zones out and leaves.

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:21.449
There’s not enough time anymore and she
must take the matters into her own hands.

00:13:21.449 --> 00:13:25.499
She walks to the pod and surprisingly, the
pod sends a vessel down.

00:13:25.499 --> 00:13:28.600
She enters the vessel and is engulfed in a
fog-like state.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.120
She struggles for a minute to breathe before
her lungs stabilize.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.829
As the vessel opens, she finds herself in
the room behind the glass wall filled with

00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:37.350
a similar fog.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.579
Costello approaches her and Louise learns
that Abbott has died from the explosion.

00:13:41.579 --> 00:13:44.879
She breaks down and apologizes on behalf of
humanity.

00:13:44.879 --> 00:13:48.389
She then asks the heptapod to send a message
to the other sites.

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:52.249
Costello says that Louise already has the
weapon and that she should use it.

00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:54.709
She doesn’t understand and asks their purpose.

00:13:54.709 --> 00:14:00.180
Costello says their purpose is to help humanity
because, in 3,000 years, they will need humanity’s

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.180
help.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.209
She asks them how they can know the future.

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:05.410
Just then, her daughter enters her mind again.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.680
They’re at the same field, playing at the
same creek.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.129
Louise looks confused and finally asks Costello
who the child is.

00:14:12.129 --> 00:14:15.730
It turns out that Louise’s dreams of her
daughter weren’t dreams, but premonitions

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.069
of the future.

00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:20.649
With that last message, Costello disappears
into the fog.

00:14:20.649 --> 00:14:23.529
Louise is ejected as the pod turns sideways.

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:27.100
A convoy approaches her and Ian wraps a blanket
around her.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.230
Just as she’s being put in the car, she
has another premonition.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.879
She’s standing at the lake with her daughter.

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:36.600
She asks Louise why her father doesn’t look
at her the same way anymore.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.109
Louise feels conflicted but tells her it’s
because she told her father something that

00:14:40.109 --> 00:14:44.220
he wasn’t prepared for, something about
a rare and incurable disease.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.199
In the present, Louise just realizes why her
future husband left her.

00:14:48.199 --> 00:14:52.290
Meanwhile, all the pods around the world have
also turned sideways and the entire planet

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.100
is preparing for global war.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.459
As Louise wanders through the site, she has
another premonition.

00:14:57.459 --> 00:15:00.309
Her future daughter asks her why her name
is Hannah.

00:15:00.309 --> 00:15:03.899
Louise tells her that her name is special
because it’s a palindrome, which means if

00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:06.699
it’s spelled backward, it will still say
“Hannah.”

00:15:06.699 --> 00:15:11.259
In her vision, she also sees herself publishing
a book about the heptapods’ universal language

00:15:11.259 --> 00:15:13.759
and teaching the language to other humans.

00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:16.850
She finally realizes the heptapods’ true
purpose.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.619
Their weapon is their language and they shared
all of their language with humanity.

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:24.120
Their language opens up time and once you
learn it, you begin to perceive time the way

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.029
they do, in a non-linear state, so that you
can see what’s to come.

00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:31.930
She shares her discovery with Ian and Webber,
but Webber tells her that the mission’s

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:32.930
over.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.309
Outside, Louise has another premonition.

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:38.670
This time she’s attending a gala at the
United Nations.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.889
General Shang approaches her and says that
he only attended because he wanted to meet

00:15:41.889 --> 00:15:42.889
her.

00:15:42.889 --> 00:15:47.480
He tells her that 18 months ago, she did something
even his superiors were unable to do and changed

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.699
his mind.

00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:51.930
He continues to say that she called him on
his private number.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:56.009
Louise is confused and says that she doesn’t
know his private number, but the general whips

00:15:56.009 --> 00:15:58.620
out his phone and shows the number to her.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.899
General Shang tells her that now she knows.

00:16:00.899 --> 00:16:04.579
He feels that it was important that he shows
her that number despite not knowing the reason

00:16:04.579 --> 00:16:05.579
why.

00:16:05.579 --> 00:16:08.810
He then tells her that she told him something
that he will never forget.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.389
She told the general his wife’s dying words.

00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:15.489
At the present time, it dawns on Louise the
thing that she has to do to stop this global

00:16:15.489 --> 00:16:16.489
war.

00:16:16.489 --> 00:16:20.660
She ventures back to the site and gets ahold
of Agent Halpern’s satellite phone.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.209
She calls General Shang’s private number.

00:16:23.209 --> 00:16:26.790
This alerts security and they send several
soldiers to confront her.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:30.359
Louise evades capture and hides in the disinfection
room.

00:16:30.359 --> 00:16:33.419
General Shang answers the call and she tells
him her purpose.

00:16:33.419 --> 00:16:36.709
Ian joins her in the room and shields her
from the soldiers.

00:16:36.709 --> 00:16:39.939
She finally tells General Shang her message
and he receives it.

00:16:39.939 --> 00:16:44.939
The call is a success and she puts her hands
up in the air, surrendering to security.

00:16:44.939 --> 00:16:49.089
Suddenly, China pulls out from the attack
and the other countries follow.

00:16:49.089 --> 00:16:53.879
The 12 sites then agree to share their data
and complete the pieces of the puzzles together.

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:58.709
With humanity working as one, the pods begin
to elevate and disappear into outer space,

00:16:58.709 --> 00:17:00.779
just as quickly as they have arrived.

00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:04.610
Louise and Ian stand outside as they watch
the site evacuate.

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:07.930
She asks him if he would change things if
he could see his whole life from start to

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:08.930
finish.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.230
He tells her that the most surprising thing
that has ever happened in his life was not

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.580
meeting the heptapods, but rather, it was
meeting her.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.220
He then declares his love for her.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.260
Louise looks at him, knowing that this is
the face of her future husband, and reciprocates

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.329
his love with an embrace.

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:26.650
Even though Louise knows what’s going to
happen in the future, them getting married,

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:31.300
giving birth to Hannah, and Hannah passing
away, she embraces it fully and whole-heartedly,

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:39.620
despite knowing that Ian will eventually leave
them.
