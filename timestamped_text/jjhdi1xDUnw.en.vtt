00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:07.889
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.017 --> 00:00:11.729
today I'll show you a science fiction action film: "Cosmic Sin"

00:00:12.113 --> 00:00:14.481
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:19.025
in the year 2524, the technology is so advanced 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.865
that humans are able to set up colonies on planets like Mars and Ellora

00:00:23.057 --> 00:00:26.513
for years, humans have been collecting resources on those plants 

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:29.265
but there hasn't been any alien encounters

00:00:29.457 --> 00:00:34.449
on the desolate alien planet, two scientists are gonna play a hormone game during a break

00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:37.585
suddenly, the female scientist hears some movement outside

00:00:37.713 --> 00:00:40.785
and sees there is a spaceship landing nearby on the monitor

00:00:40.977 --> 00:00:43.025
her boyfriend thinks it doesn't make sense

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.737
because except for the two, there are no other living things on this planet

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:48.913
that could ever interrupt their hormone game

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:53.393
to ease the female scientist's concern, her boyfriend grabs a machine gun

00:00:53.457 --> 00:00:56.145
goes outside and starts shooting into the darkness

00:00:56.401 --> 00:01:00.049
he assures her that they are 100% absolutely alone

00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:03.121
her boyfriend goes out again but never comes back

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.385
no matter how much she calls him, there is no response

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:11.249
the female scientist gets nervous and reports an alien encounter to the spaceship

00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:15.375
very soon, word spreads of an alien encounter back to Earth

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:20.600
a General is astonished to hear the news as it is the first contact with aliens

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:23.089
soon he gives orders and gathers the team up

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:27.249
including an old soldier called Ford, who is at a bar brawling right at that time

00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:31.409
during the fight, everyone pulls guns out and points them at each other

00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:33.201
right then, the police arrive

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:36.785
they all put their guns back and leave as soon as they hear the sirens

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:40.305
however, the police are not coming here to stop the fight

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.417
they are here to offer Ford a job

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:46.833
Ford was dismissed from his duty for causing 70 million casualties 

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:49.713
using the Q-bomb under the order of the Alliance

00:01:50.097 --> 00:01:52.785
if he accepts the offer, he can get a reinstatement

00:01:52.977 --> 00:01:55.409
it appears the Alliance is having some issues

00:01:55.857 --> 00:01:59.313
at the headquarters, Ford meets his old acquaintance Dr.Goss

00:01:59.697 --> 00:02:03.281
the meeting is a bit awkward as Dr.Goss doesn't like Ford

00:02:03.537 --> 00:02:08.209
Dr.Goss is very excited, for she thinks the first contact has a significant meaning

00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:11.153
at least it shows humans are not alone in the universe

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.505
but Ford thinks differently and hopes the Alliance can prepare some Q-bombs 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.617
in case the aliens are not friendly

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:20.945
as expected, a female engineer gets an emergent mission

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:23.185
to help the Alliance activate a Q-bomb

00:02:23.441 --> 00:02:28.305
in the meantime, the human survivors on planet Ellora have returned to Earth in a spaceship

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:31.569
Dr.Goss has them sterilized as soon as they get off the ship

00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:35.217
however, before they are quarantined, they start to change

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.969
they are all infected by parasitic aliens

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:42.321
these infected survivors attack the security guards and infect them too

00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:46.609
the aliens are hostile, but Dr.Goss urges the security guards not to shoot

00:02:46.737 --> 00:02:50.001
and then leaves there quickly under the protection of the security guards

00:02:50.193 --> 00:02:55.057
one of the security guards can't help himself and shoots at one infected survivor's body

00:02:55.313 --> 00:02:58.833
to their surprise, the bullet doesn't hurt the survivor at all

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:00.881
the security guards shoot again

00:03:00.945 --> 00:03:03.633
this time the survivor is shot in the head and dies

00:03:03.825 --> 00:03:07.857
they realize that the infected survivors need their brains intact to function

00:03:08.305 --> 00:03:12.849
all the people evacuate immediately and seal off the area with the infected people inside

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.561
the alarm in the base alerts Ford and other people at the headquarters

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:20.401
the infected survivors kill a security guard in front of Dr.Goss

00:03:20.657 --> 00:03:24.049
but she still wishes to negotiate peacefully with the aliens

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.761
she is fascinated by them and wanna admire the masterpiece of God

00:03:27.953 --> 00:03:32.625
a security guard shoots the infected survivor, seeing she has a gun in her hand

00:03:33.073 --> 00:03:36.785
it turns out the infected survivors controlled by the alien parasites

00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:41.393
have a strong learning capability, so they learn quickly how to shoot and fire back

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:46.065
there comes a fierce exchange of fire between the infected survivors and the security guards

00:03:46.321 --> 00:03:49.457
not long after, the General comes and joins the fight

00:03:49.713 --> 00:03:53.041
however, the situation goes worse and runs out of control 

00:03:53.297 --> 00:03:55.409
more and more people get infected

00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:59.505
the General helps the wounded and encourages them to continue to fight

00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:02.769
a girl is killed in front of the General, which enrages him

00:04:02.961 --> 00:04:05.649
before the infected survivors rush out of the gate

00:04:05.841 --> 00:04:09.617
Ford backs up with a rocket launcher and helps the group win the fight

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:13.521
after the fight, they have a meeting about how to deal with the hostile aliens

00:04:13.777 --> 00:04:17.937
Dr. Goss insists it is possible to coexist peacefully with the aliens

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:19.729
others don't agree with her

00:04:19.857 --> 00:04:21.969
they think the aliens might attack Earth

00:04:22.097 --> 00:04:26.385
the General believes that what happened to the base was an attack against humanity

00:04:26.513 --> 00:04:30.161
therefore, he dismisses the doctor and decides to strike first

00:04:30.545 --> 00:04:35.473
soon word comes from the front line that there are more alien spaceships gathering on Ellora

00:04:35.665 --> 00:04:38.673
and that an alien spaceship was shot down in a battle

00:04:38.865 --> 00:04:42.001
the group hold an emergent meeting to discuss their next move

00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:43.857
if they can find the wreckage

00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:47.249
they might be able to track the radiation back to the aliens' homeworld

00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:50.065
then they can wipe them out with a Q-bomb

00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:52.945
however, an engineer spots out a problem

00:04:53.073 --> 00:04:54.865
when the aliens arrived on Earth

00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:57.809
they must have sent Earth's coordinates back to their home planet 

00:04:57.937 --> 00:05:00.369
meaning that the location of Earth has been exposed

00:05:00.497 --> 00:05:03.057
the aliens could launch an attack at any time

00:05:03.377 --> 00:05:06.705
also, a Q-bomb is powerful but very unstable

00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:12.017
if used in the wrong way, it could have devastating consequences and open a black hole

00:05:12.465 --> 00:05:15.665
later, the General decides to bring a team to the front line

00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:20.017
when everyone is suited up, they travel to the front line via a Quantum Jump Gate

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:23.153
which can transfer them to the destination in a flash

00:05:23.345 --> 00:05:28.081
after arriving, a space battle between the humans and the aliens is being waged

00:05:28.401 --> 00:05:32.689
the human forces appear to be losing, and the aliens gain the upper hand

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.657
fortunately, the group manage to pass safely through heavy gunfires

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:41.073
but Ford gets separated from the others because there is too much wreckage in his way

00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:44.657
and the General gets hit by a piece of wreckage and drifts away

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:47.985
soldier Mustache is with the engineer and soldier Handsome

00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:49.969
while Ford and the general are offline

00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:52.145
they don't know if they are alive or not

00:05:52.465 --> 00:05:56.369
soldier Mustache asks the engineer to check if Q-bomb is alright

00:05:56.625 --> 00:05:58.545
luckily, the Q-bomb is fine

00:05:58.801 --> 00:06:02.577
not long after they arrive at the planet, they are ambushed by the aliens

00:06:02.705 --> 00:06:05.393
which are all the infected humans being controlled

00:06:05.777 --> 00:06:08.977
soldier Mustache gets shot and is seriously injured

00:06:09.233 --> 00:06:12.945
there are too many aliens, and they can't hold out any longer

00:06:13.137 --> 00:06:16.657
at the critical moment, another human squad comes for their rescue

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:18.961
they are survivors on planet Ellora

00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:22.481
once humans are infected by the alien, they can't talk

00:06:22.673 --> 00:06:25.809
so it's easy to verify if they are allies or not

00:06:26.193 --> 00:06:30.161
with the help of the army led by Yellow Hair, they defeat the aliens

00:06:30.609 --> 00:06:33.041
soldier Handsome tells Yellow Hair their plan

00:06:33.233 --> 00:06:35.729
hearing they are looking for the wreckage of the alien ship

00:06:35.857 --> 00:06:38.545
Yellow Hair expresses a willingness to help them

00:06:38.801 --> 00:06:42.513
later, soldier Mustache is transferred to the orbital cannon to get medical treatment

00:06:42.641 --> 00:06:45.905
while soldier Handsome goes to find the wreckage with Yellow Hair

00:06:46.097 --> 00:06:50.961
they search around, and very soon, Yellow Hair and soldier handsome find the crashed ship

00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:53.777
some aliens are in the middle of repairing it

00:06:54.033 --> 00:06:57.937
through testing, they confirm that the wreckage leaves a radioactive signature

00:06:58.257 --> 00:07:00.689
when soldier Handsome is about to send the coordinates

00:07:00.817 --> 00:07:03.441
his equipment is interfered with by an alien signal

00:07:03.633 --> 00:07:06.321
Yellow Hair suggests they don't do anything rash

00:07:06.577 --> 00:07:09.137
it's better they go back to the orbital cannon first

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.528
it would be easier to get signal out there

00:07:12.104 --> 00:07:15.176
on the other side, Ford also lands on the planet safely 

00:07:15.304 --> 00:07:17.736
but because he has changed his tracks many times

00:07:17.864 --> 00:07:22.280
he doesn't land in the same position as his teammates, who presume he is dead

00:07:22.472 --> 00:07:27.720
not long after his landing, he is captured by the aliens and is held captive in a cave

00:07:27.976 --> 00:07:31.368
an alien is controlling his mind and wants him to join them

00:07:31.688 --> 00:07:36.552
before the alien succeeds, Ford is found and saved by soldier Handsome and Yellow Hair 

00:07:36.808 --> 00:07:39.368
then they head to the Alliance outpost together

00:07:39.688 --> 00:07:42.824
there they learn how the aliens infect and control people

00:07:43.144 --> 00:07:46.344
the aliens transfer parasites to humans through blood

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.888
once the infection spreads, people will become the alien's puppet and their army

00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:54.664
even at the orbital cannon, they can't send out the coordinates 

00:07:54.856 --> 00:07:56.904
because there is too much tachyon interference

00:07:57.416 --> 00:07:59.336
they can't fire the Q-bomb, either

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.328
in the meantime, soldier Mustache is weakening, and his condition is getting worse

00:08:04.712 --> 00:08:09.320
Ford can't bear to see him suffering, so he euthanizes soldier Mustache

00:08:09.576 --> 00:08:13.160
the engineer suggests going into orbit to fire the Q-bomb

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.000
but they are not able to get into orbit with the tachyon interference

00:08:17.064 --> 00:08:18.728
while they are discussing what to do

00:08:18.792 --> 00:08:21.800
they see the aliens have built a stable space gate in orbit

00:08:22.248 --> 00:08:24.232
the alien's intention is obvious

00:08:24.488 --> 00:08:28.712
they want to send an army to Earth, which is the easiest way to wipe out humankind

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.232
Ford comes up with an idea that they could fire the Q-bomb 

00:08:32.424 --> 00:08:34.920
to blast the space gate and the alien enemy

00:08:35.304 --> 00:08:39.016
but in that way, the explosion from the Q-bomb will create a black hole

00:08:39.272 --> 00:08:42.472
everything on the planet Ellora will be sucked into the black hole

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.760
to save Earth, Ford decides to get the orbital cannon back online 

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.024
so they can fire the Q-bomb and collapse the space gate

00:08:50.344 --> 00:08:54.504
just before they take action, the engineer receives a signal sent by the General

00:08:54.632 --> 00:08:57.320
whose suit was damaged and remains in space

00:08:57.768 --> 00:09:02.376
having known Ford's plan, the General volunteers to help detonate the space gate 

00:09:02.696 --> 00:09:05.704
he asks the engineer to fire the Q-bomb through the space gate 

00:09:05.832 --> 00:09:07.560
to destroy the enemy on the other side

00:09:07.752 --> 00:09:10.760
he will detonate the explosives on him and destroy the space gate

00:09:10.888 --> 00:09:13.576
so that a black hole will not be created in this way

00:09:13.896 --> 00:09:16.264
he also requests the engineer not to tell the others

00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:19.528
in the meantime, Ford and his team are preparing themselves 

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:22.408
as the aliens could attack the outpost at any time

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.952
when the aliens arrive at the outpost, they see that Dr.Goss has been infected

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.192
and has become the leader of the alien army

00:09:29.576 --> 00:09:35.016
from Dr.Goss, they learn that the aliens are a warlike species; they are born to be invasive

00:09:35.144 --> 00:09:38.600
Dr.Goss persuades Ford to surrender, but Ford refuses

00:09:38.984 --> 00:09:41.928
Dr.Goss leads the infected human attack on the outpost

00:09:42.184 --> 00:09:44.616
then, both sides fall into a fierce fight

00:09:45.064 --> 00:09:48.328
Yellow Hair shoots the aliens from an elevated position

00:09:48.648 --> 00:09:52.360
the human soldiers are holed up inside the outpost and losing the fight

00:09:52.616 --> 00:09:57.480
after a while, when Dr.Goss flies back to the space gate to organize the main forces

00:09:57.864 --> 00:09:59.976
Ford clings to her ship and follows her

00:10:00.424 --> 00:10:04.136
later, the alien's main forces begin to pass through the gate

00:10:04.264 --> 00:10:07.144
but the General still hasn't detonated the bomb to destroy it

00:10:07.656 --> 00:10:11.496
the engineer can't wait any longer, so she launches the Q-bomb

00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:16.104
to everyone's surprise, Dr.Goss intercepts the Q-bomb with an energy shield

00:10:16.488 --> 00:10:19.496
seeing that, Ford comes forward and hits Dr.Goss

00:10:19.816 --> 00:10:23.080
because of that, the balance of the energy shield collapses

00:10:23.208 --> 00:10:26.280
which finally allows the Q-bomb to pass through the gate

00:10:26.472 --> 00:10:31.656
right then, with a deadly blow, Ford sends the Q-bomb and Dr. Goss into the transfer tunnel

00:10:31.848 --> 00:10:35.112
while he himself is bounced back to planet Ellora by its blast wave

00:10:35.624 --> 00:10:39.144
in the meantime, there's something wrong with the General's self-destruct device 

00:10:39.528 --> 00:10:43.880
so he gives his coordinates to the engineer and asks her to fire another bomb at him

00:10:44.072 --> 00:10:47.976
together with the explosives he is carrying, he can destroy the space gate

00:10:48.296 --> 00:10:50.472
the General is soldier Handsome's father

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.096
he doesn't want to see his father sacrifice himself

00:10:53.224 --> 00:10:56.360
but for the humans' future, he presses the launch button

00:10:56.552 --> 00:11:01.928
with the massive explosion, the space gate collapses, sealing the entire alien army in

00:11:02.312 --> 00:11:06.536
the war between humans and the aliens ends, and Earth is saved once again

00:11:07.304 --> 00:11:10.120
this's Daniel CC movie channel, peace out
