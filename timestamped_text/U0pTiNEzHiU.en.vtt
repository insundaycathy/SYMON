Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.450
Today, I'm going to explain a horror, mystery,
and thriller film called “The Midnight Meat

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.450
Train."

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.700
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.700
Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.480
&nbsp;
On a late-night train ride, a man wakes up

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.880
alone, realizing that he might have missed
his stop.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.250
He walks to the other section of the train,
but he slips into a pool of blood, leaving

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.850
him drenched and afraid.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.490
From the other section, he hears thumping
noises, as if someone is being butchered,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.450
so he takes a look and sees exactly what he
thinks.&nbsp;

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.890
&nbsp;
In the busy streets of New York, Leon Kaufman,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.320
photographs the city and practices it as his
profession.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.690
He lives with his girlfriend, Maya Jones,
in an apartment they rent together.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.260
While they spend time together, Maya realizes
that Leon’s work is causing too much strain

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.280
and stress on him.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.170
She figures out that it would make him happy
to call his boss behind his back, and let

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.280
him introduce him to a famous gallery owner
named Susan Hoff.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.579
The next day, Leon goes to her office with
his boss, Jurgis, and officially meets her.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.170
Leon explains to Susan that his style captures
the unique and gritty shots of the city, but

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.280
it does not leave a big impression on her.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.250
Instead, she criticizes his shots, saying
that he is not taking enough risks, and that

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.460
his shots lack life.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.420
Emboldened by her remarks, Leon has a hard
time sleeping that night, so he heads outside

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.310
to seek inspiration for his work.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.790
He heads into the city subway system during
that night, where he sees the uncrowded place.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.190
Just as he is about to go downstairs, he witnesses
an impending assault, where three men are

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.710
harassing a woman, and photographs the scene.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.530
He calls their attention, making one of the
men start to approach him, and again, he starts

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.799
taking pictures of the man’s menacing face.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.820
He points at the security camera to avoid
a fight, and the group lets go of the girl

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.100
before leaving.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.509
In a sigh of relief, the woman thanks Leon,
even kissing him before she boards the train.

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.759
By the door, a built and well-dressed man
holds the door for her.

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.250
After overcoming a stressful night, she happily
plays music when the man approaches her from

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.850
behind and hits her head with a meat hammer,
causing her to die instantly.&nbsp;

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.960
&nbsp;
The following day, Leon visits the local restaurant

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.610
where he is a regular customer.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.869
As a vegan, he always asks the cook to fry
some tofu that he brings with him whenever

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.159
he visits, and the cook hesitantly agrees
after making fun of him.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.240
Leon reads the newspaper that day and discovers
that the woman he saved, Erika Sakaki, is

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.940
reported missing shortly after she rode the
train.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.250
Concerned by her whereabouts, he feels a sense
of responsibility for handing the photograph

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.219
of her harassers to the police immediately.

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:14.269
However, the one in charge, Detective Lynn
Hadley, does not seem convinced about his

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.739
theory and even thinks that Leon was stalking
her and is the one behind her disappearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.430
&nbsp;
Later that day, Leon meets with Susan again

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.129
to submit his photo entries.

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.499
Her expression is nothing short of amazed;
the images have gained her respect for Leon

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:29.150
as a photographer, and she asks him to submit
two more powerful pictures to be part of her

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.890
group show in the following week.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.769
For the first time in his career, he feels
seen and noticed by the higher-ups; that night,

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.510
along with Maya and Jurgis, they grab drinks
to celebrate.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.359
However, the celebration ends abruptly as
Leon decides to head to the subway again to

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:42.819
take more pictures.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.040
Three passengers wait for their next stop
inside the train, but the train takes another

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.280
route, making them miss their stop.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.590
From the convex mirror, one of them sees the
same man who killed the missing woman stand

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.980
up and come toward them.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.849
The woman alarms them about the man, but they
pay her no mind and continue to converse.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.389
Suddenly, the man smashes his head with a
meat hammer, causing his eyeballs to fall

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.730
out and result in his instantaneous death.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.190
The killer’s identity is now revealed, who
comes by the name Mahogany.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.099
He targets the next victim by using a hook
to stab him, even lifting him into the air.

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.450
The woman tries to run away, but slips in
the puddle of blood on the floor as Mahogany

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.409
walks toward her in a sinister way.

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.140
The man from behind tries to stop him by grabbing
his leg, but Mahogany mercilessly hits him

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.400
with the meat hammer.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.629
The last remaining passenger suffers the same
fate as her friends and gets beaten with the

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.169
hammer, resulting in decapitation.&nbsp;

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.540
&nbsp;
Waiting to take the perfect shot, Leon waits

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.510
outside the station for passers-by who look
interesting.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.129
Mahogany comes up the escalator looking extremely
intimidating, so Leon takes a photo of him

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.669
and follows him around.

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.579
As Mahogany takes a turn, he senses that he
is being followed, so he stops just as Leon

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.120
takes the turn as well.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.830
He gets a little frightened seeing Mahogany
standstill, waiting for him to pass by.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.950
As he gets closer, Mahogany grabs him, and
he sees a ring adorned with eight stars.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.629
He nervously explains that he simply wants
a picture of him, and Mahogany, fortunately,

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:54.999
lets him go.

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:58.790
While printing and examining his photos, Leon
notices the same ring he saw on Mahogany holding

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.849
the door for Erika the night she disappeared.

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.680
This gives him the suspicion that Mahogany
is behind the killings of late-night passengers,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.760
a myth circulating the city.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.290
&nbsp;
From then on, Leon devotes himself to investigating

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.290
Mahogany.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.859
He follows him around the city and finds out
that he is a butcher.

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.790
The intrigued Leon waits for him to get off
work and follows him to the subway station

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.879
that night.

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:20.340
Oddly, Mahogany is observant and vigilant
of his surroundings; he waits for the station

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.260
to be unpacked, spending hours sitting down,
waiting for a possible prey while Leon is

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.370
busy taking pictures of his new subject.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.430
Finally, the train that Mahogany has patiently
waited for arrives, but before Leon could

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.080
enter the same train, a police officer stops
him to check his camera.&nbsp;

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.789
&nbsp;
A built man enters the train and tries to

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.539
make fun of Mahogany before realizing that
the train is en route to another railway,

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:40.930
missing his stop.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.319
Mahogany attacks him, knocking the man at
once, but he stops and drops the meat hammer

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.850
after coughing blood.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.220
Little does he know, the man has a knife and
gets up to attempt to stab Mahogany, but the

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.379
killer manages to dodge every attack.

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.620
The two of them start punching each other,
making the train driver, Mahogany’s accomplice,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.099
alarmed by the situation.

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.979
He comes to the rescue and shoots the man
directly in the head before saying that he

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.090
is disappointed at Mahogany.&nbsp;

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.100
&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Leon surprises Maya in the restaurant

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.190
where she works with a pre-engagement ring.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.419
He is still saving enough money for her to
receive a proper engagement ring, and the

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.210
two happily share the precious moment.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.590
That night, Leon dreams of being on the midnight
train, butchering numerous victims.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.710
He wakes up from his horrible nightmare and
sees himself trapped in the obsession of knowing

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.189
more about the butcher.&nbsp;

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:22.659
&nbsp;
Mahogany, who suffers from a skin disease,

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.840
stands in front of a mirror and uses a scalpel
to remove the excess skin that is getting

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.070
worse over time.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.679
Weirdly, he preserves the extracted skin and
stores it in his medicine cabinet.

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:33.110
&nbsp;
At home, Maya notices the man consistently

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.660
in the pictures that Leon takes.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.639
He explains that he feels the need to follow
the butcher because he may be the suspect

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.070
in a gruesome crime, but Maya reminds him
of the photos that he has to submit to Susan

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.219
for the show.

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:46.099
With his interest completely shifted, Leon
goes into further research about the butcher.

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:50.009
The following day, he comes to Mahogany’s
workplace and pretends to be a butcher himself,

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:52.389
just to get a glimpse of him and hopefully
more evidence.

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.889
As a vegan, he finds the place very uncomfortable,
but he continues to take pictures anyway.

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.509
Unfortunately, Mahogany spots him secretly
taking pictures, so he runs away to avoid

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:02.590
confrontation from the menacing man.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.069
In the room where animal carcasses are hung,
Leon sees him holding a meat hook in hopes

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:07.499
of getting ahold of him.

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:10.889
He holds himself up with the animal carcass
so Mahogany would not see him, but as he goes

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:13.809
down, the scary butcher chases him, but he
safely escapes.&nbsp;

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:16.229
&nbsp;
The disoriented Leon meets up with Jurgis

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.229
at the restaurant, who is having a big plate
of steak at the moment.

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:22.889
Leon seems to crave meat that day, so he grabs
a piece of the steak and eats it, leaving

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:25.159
the cook and Jurgis shocked by his behavior.

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:28.999
Later that day, he gathers newspaper articles
related to midnight train murders, filling

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:30.830
the whole apartment with documents.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.120
Maya arrives home to Leon acting frantically
and bombarding her with information about

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.060
the disappearances of people, a scheme fueled
by the butcher.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.849
Annoyed by his obsession, Maya begs him to
stop shooting at night and calls his investigation

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:42.499
a whole conspiracy theory.

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:46.250
To clear his mind, Maya hands him his camera
to take portraits of her, but he only sees

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.990
visions of the midnight train and the butcher,
unable to click the capture button.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.719
Leon makes it up to her and apologizes to
Maya for being paranoid about the butcher.

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:58.460
Still, out of nowhere, Leon sees Mahogany’s
reflection, which is just outside the restaurant,

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.639
seemingly taunting him.

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.300
Instantly, it wakes up Leon’s obsession
once more, so he makes his way to the subway

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.110
station, boards the train, and is ready to
take more photos of the butcher.&nbsp;

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.220
&nbsp;
During the ride, Leon sets his eyes on Mahogany,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.219
who is in another section of the train.

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:14.770
Some passengers board the last stop, who end
up being killed with a meat hammer.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.150
Leon witnesses the blood bath and instantly
confirms his theories of Mahogany being a

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.449
serial killer.

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:22.509
He takes up all his courage to stand up and
take the pictures while the butcher is busy

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:23.840
cleaning up the scene.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.840
Horrifyingly, he sees Mahogany extract the
victims’ teeth, nails, and hair before hanging

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.500
them upside down.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.539
Mahogany notices Leon and smirks at him, causing
the photographer to run along the aisle.

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:37.099
As he reaches the end of the train, Mahogany
smashes his head against the window, knocking

00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:38.319
him down.

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:42.599
Once he regains consciousness, he finds himself
inside the slaughterhouse, still alive.

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:46.059
He comes home and ignores Maya, who is deeply
concerned about him.

00:07:46.059 --> 00:07:49.559
Inside the bathroom, he discovers strange
markings on his chest, which Maya sees shortly

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:50.559
after.

00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:53.789
Leon reveals Mahogany’s scheme to her, but
with the lack of evidence since his camera

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:57.289
is taken away from him, he is sure that the
police will not buy his story.

00:07:57.289 --> 00:08:00.379
Maya gets alarmed by his behavior, but she
believes him enough to seek the photos he

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:01.379
took.&nbsp;

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:03.370
&nbsp;
Along with Jurgis, she plans on retrieving

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.120
Leon’s camera, so they head to Mahogany’s
apartment.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.550
After breaking in, Maya and Jurgis examine
the apartment separately.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.000
He scours through his tools while Maya enters
the bathroom, where Mahogany preserves his

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.449
extracted skin.

00:08:14.449 --> 00:08:17.870
Unknown to them, the butcher returns to his
apartment and captures Jurgis after finding

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.740
Leon’s camera hidden in the closet.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.199
As Maya makes her way out of the bathroom,
she sees Mahogany’s bag and timetables that

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:25.900
record more than 100 years of murders on the
train.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.490
She runs to safety after seeing Mahogany’s
shoulder from the closet, knowing that Jurgis

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.370
has suffered an untimely tragedy.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.839
She reports the disappearance of Jurgis, but
Detective Hadley is still skeptical of her

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:35.839
claims.

00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:39.490
According to her, she sent an investigation
team to the apartment, but they didn’t find

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.490
anything.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.579
When Detective Hadley presses Maya to give
back the timetables, she demands answers,

00:08:43.579 --> 00:08:44.839
but the officer remains unhelpful.&nbsp;

00:08:44.839 --> 00:08:47.760
&nbsp;
In the gallery, Leon attends the event, where

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.340
he is introduced to clients who find his work
exceptional.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.350
However, Leon is too stressed to maintain
a conversation with anyone, so he walks around

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.800
the gallery until he stops by one of his photographs
with Mahogany in it.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.850
He observes it intently until Susan asks what
is wrong; before walking away, he tells her,

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:02.850
“I have a train to catch.”

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:07.209
Meanwhile, Maya takes a gun hidden in the
restaurant and finds Detective Hadley outside,

00:09:07.209 --> 00:09:09.900
who finally gives her the whereabouts of Jurgis
on the train.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.240
While she boards the train, Leon gathers several
weapons from the slaughterhouse, now ready

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.880
to combat Mahogany in full butcher gear.&nbsp;

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.070
&nbsp;
On the train, Maya realizes that the train

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.970
took another direction, so she stands up bravely
and makes her way along the aisle, where Leon

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:21.970
sees her.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:25.610
Afraid for her life, he chases the train and
manages to climb from it.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.300
Mahogany has just completed his nightly massacre,
and Maya sees Jurgis hanging from a meat hook,

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.519
her screams alerting the sinister Mahogany.

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:34.750
She tries to shoot him but misses every shot,
so she resorts to running back to the other

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.940
end of the train.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.899
However, Mahogany throws his meat hammer and
hits her leg, causing her to fall.

00:09:39.899 --> 00:09:43.350
Now that she is cornered, the killer comes
forward and almost strikes the hammer at her,

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.760
but Leon calls his attention just in time.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.360
Both of them come face to face and fight between
the swinging bodies that are ripped, thrown,

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.829
and used for defense.

00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:53.940
Their brawl continues climatically as the
two recklessly throw themselves against each

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.940
other.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.079
Jurgis, hanging from a meat hook, dies after
being gutted in Mahogany’s attempt to hold

00:09:59.079 --> 00:10:00.079
on.

00:10:00.079 --> 00:10:03.970
Finally, Leon throws Mahogany out of the train,
but not long before it hits its final stop.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.310
Maya approaches Leon, slightly relieved that
they both survived.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.880
The train lights go out at the final destination,
and the driver calmly informs them to "step

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.089
away from the meat.”

00:10:12.089 --> 00:10:15.149
They find out the purpose of the abandoned
station, as reptilian creatures enter the

00:10:15.149 --> 00:10:18.150
train and start consuming the bodies of the
murdered passengers.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.810
Both of them step down and enter an underground
cavern, covered with skulls and decomposing

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:22.810
bodies.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.850
The battered Mahogany returns from beneath
the train with his eyes transformed and fights

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.620
in a death brawl with Leon, who finishes him
at last by impaling the butcher's skull on

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.670
a blade.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.120
Mahogany demonically grins in his dying breath,
pronouncing the single word “Welcome!"&nbsp;

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.040
&nbsp;
The train driver picks up Leon after attempting

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.870
to attack him, rips out his tongue, and eats
it.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.070
He continues to tell Leon that the carnivorous
creatures had lived underground long before

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.310
the subway existed, and Mahogany's job is
to feed them every night to keep them from

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.060
civilization and attacking train riders during
the day.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.639
He then approaches the unconscious Maya, who
lies on a pile of bones.

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:55.330
Brutally, he lets Leon watch as he cuts her
chest open to extract her heart before handing

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.629
it to Leon, now that he must take the dead
butcher’s place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.629 --> 00:11:00.450
&nbsp;
The following day, a new butcher is up for

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.010
the job and wears the same ring with the group
symbol.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.570
He meets Detective Hadley, who hands the train
timetables, revealing that she is part of

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:07.870
the secret society.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.500
The new killer makes his way onto the midnight
train, looking for a new victim, and reveals

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:21.639
himself as none other than Leon.
