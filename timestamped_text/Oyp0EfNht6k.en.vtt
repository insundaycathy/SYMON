00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.730
Welcome to the Man of Recaps, this is Better
Call Saul, season 3.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.240
In the Future, Saul Goodman is hiding out
as the manager of Cinnabon, one day he sees

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.240
a shoplifter get caught and he yells "Kid
get a lawyer!", which is a weird thing for

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.530
a Cinnabon manager to yell, and then later
he passes out, woah...

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.650
Now back in the present-past, Jimmy had just
admitted to his brother that he doctored the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.999
documents so that the Mesa Verde bank would
go back to his friend Kim.

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:26.800
But he didn't know his brother Chuck was tape
recording him, despite his allergy to electricity.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.220
Chuck tells his partner Howard, but Howard's
like "Hey we can't use this as evidence,"

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.740
Chuck's like "Don't worry I've got a plan."

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.730
Mike Ehrmantraut last season was going to
assassinate old Hector Salamanca because he

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.920
sent the murder twins to threaten his granddaughter.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.870
But back at his car someone left him a note
that said "DON'T"!

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.140
Who tracked him out here!?

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.790
So Mike takes his car apart looking for the
tracker bug, eventually he finds it inside

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.790
the gas cap.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.510
So Mike gets a tracker of his own and puts
that one in his car, then he takes the original

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.430
tracker and runs down the battery, so that
night when someone comes to swap it out for

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.110
a fresh one, they take Mike's tracker back
with them.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.579
He tracks them too... fast food joint Los
Pollos Hermanos!!!

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.089
If you've seen Breaking Bad you know that's
the cover for Gus Fring, the mild-mannered

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.089
drug kingpin.

00:01:06.089 --> 00:01:09.990
So Mike gets Jimmy to scope things out, but
the guy never meets with anyone, because Jimmy

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.399
wasn't paying any attention to the fast food
manager sweeping the floor, and Gus Fring

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:15.399
is on to him.

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.119
Now Chuck has his assistant replace the batteries
in the tape recorder, but it starts playing

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.920
and he hears Jimmy's confession!

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.229
Chuck's like "Yo don't tell anyone," but immediately
he tells Kim, who then tells Jimmy.

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.710
Kim's like "Don't worry he can't use that
as evidence," but Jimmy's so mad his brother

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.899
deceived him, he kicks down the doors, grabs
the tape and breaks it in front of him.

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.700
But Howard and this guy come out, IT WAS A
SET-UP!!!

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.509
Chuck knew Jimmy would break in there to destroy
the tape, and now he's been witnessed breaking

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.509
and entering.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.049
Later Mike sees the tracker's on the move,
but it was a set-up they were on to him, and

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.600
Gus Fring wants to meet in person.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.840
He's like "Why didn't you want me to kill
Hector Salamanca?" and Gus explains that if

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.389
he was assassinated they might come after
him.

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:54.719
Mike still wants revenge so Gus is like "Look
maybe we can hurt him a different way."

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.520
So Mike goes to Mexico and throws some shoes
over the wire.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.189
When Hector's drug truck comes by Mike snipes
the SNEAKERS - which he put a bag of cocaine

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.560
in - and so it sprinkles down over the truck.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.330
When these guys try to cross the border they're
taken in, and the ice cream shop Hector uses

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.000
as a front is shut down.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.170
Now Hector and Gus both work for the big Salamanca
cartel boss in Mexico, and Hector has always

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.340
hated the "chicken man."

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.770
So he busts into the restaurant and he's like
"Hey, now that my supply line is out, you're

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.570
going to make room for my product on your
trucks."

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.700
Little does he know, that's exactly what Gus
wanted.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.030
Gus is like "Yo Mike, you've got real skills,
you want to work for me full time?"

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.140
And of course in Breaking Bad that's how we
first meet Mike, he's head of security for

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.230
Gus, but for now he's like "Eh, maybe later."

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.100
Mike does have a butt-load of cash that he
stole from Hector Salamanca last season, and

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.320
Gus is like "Hey the least I can do is help
you launder it through my friend company Madrigal,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.230
with this girl who is also from Breaking Bad."

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.600
So Jimmy spends a night in jail, but they
come to an agreement where if he admits to

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.070
everything he just gets a year probation.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.820
But for sabotaging legal documents, he would
definitely be disbarred.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.260
And that's all his brother Chuck ever wanted,
for Jimmy to NOT be a lawyer.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.450
But Jimmy's not going down without a fight!

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.280
Chuck had a backup tape obviously and they
play it, which makes Jimmy sound very guilty

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.560
(and of course he is).

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.080
But he argues that his confession was a lie!

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.680
He was just concerned that his brother had
finally gone off the deep end, and only said

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.050
that to make him feel better.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.040
Chuck explains that he is just fine mentally,
his condition with electricity

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.040
is a real physical thing.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.610
But Jimmy had it proven to him back in season
1 that that's not the case.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.330
So he's like "Chuck do me a favor, check your
pocket," what OH it's a battery!!!

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.330
What?!?!

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.950
Yeah Jimmy had some guy sneak it in there
and he's like "That's been in your pocket

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.860
this whole time, you didn't feel it."

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.640
So Chuck screams "I'M NOT CRAZY!!!"

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.040
And goes on a huge rant about how much he
hates Jimmy for being a sleazy con-man, and

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.020
unfortunately his makes him sound very crazy,
and he realizes that his professional career

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.280
is probably over.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.630
And Jimmy gets off with just a one-year suspension!

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.130
Now Hector Salamanca hates relying on Gus
for his supply line, he goes to Nacho's Dad's

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.880
upholstery store, wants to use that to import
drugs.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.030
But Nacho's Dad is a straight-shooter, he's
like "Get out of here I'm not gonna do it,"

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.380
and Hector's like "Yo, your dad might have
to have an accident."

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.819
Nacho's a good kid, for a criminal, he's not
gonna let that happen."

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.430
Hector Salamanca's got a heart condition,
and he takes these pills all the time, so

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.290
he steals one and goes back to his pharmacist
friend he used to deal with in season 1.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.940
He's like "Hey I need a bunch of these pills,
but they need to be fake."

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.240
So there's a very intense scene where he has
to swap them out, and, boom, makes the switch

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.400
undetected.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.310
So Jimmy can't practice law for a year, but
he's made this great commercial and pre-paid

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.690
for a bunch of airtime.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.810
So he makes a new commercial about making
commercials and selling his airtime, and he

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.850
goes by the name of Saul Goodman Productions.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.850
"Saul Goodman?"

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.720
"Yeah, it's like, s'all good, man!"

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.530
So he's out there making local commercials,
but no one wants to pay full price so he's

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.800
actually losing money.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.860
So he pays a visit to the old woman from the
Sandpiper case.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.360
That was the big case he started where the
assisted living facility was overcharging

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.380
it's residents, and when they finally settle
Jimmy's gonna get a big chunk of cash.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.750
Turns out they've had their first settlement
offer, and it is plenty big for Jimmy's taste.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.770
As the class representative this one old lady
has the power to accept it, but the lawyers

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.520
are telling her to wait for something bigger.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.130
So Jimmy decides she needs some peer pressure,
he basically sews distrust among her friends

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.660
until before long she's a social outcast.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.690
He goes so far as to rig a bingo game, which
turns out to be the final straw.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.120
She breaks down, "Why do my friends hate me?"
and it's absolutely heartbreaking.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.490
He's like "Yo, maybe they just want you to
accept the settlement?"

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.470
So Jimmy's gonna be a millionaire!

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.410
Kim's like "Hey congrats, but I gotta run,"
she's had her hands full with the Mesa Verde,

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.240
and she's doing so good they recommend another
client - this big oil guy.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.611
So she's driving out to the meeting but she's
been getting way too little sleep, and, OH

00:05:28.611 --> 00:05:31.880
NO falls asleep at the wheel and crashes!

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.690
Seriously don't drive drowsy, folks.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.640
She's OK, just a broken arm, but she decides
to take a break from lawyering for awhile

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.860
and just take it easy.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.850
Almost losing a loved one makes Jimmy want
to reach out to Chuck, but what's this?

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.620
Chuck's got his electricity on!?!?

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.720
Having had it proven to him that his condition
is mental,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.560
he starts really trying to overcome it.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.160
He's working with a doctor and everything,
pretty soon he can go to the grocery store

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.710
with only mild discomfort.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.280
But after his breakdown on the stand no one
trusts him professionally anymore.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.760
Howard's like "Hey Chuck, ya know, maybe it's
time to retire."

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.560
But Chuck's not having any of that.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.340
In fact he would rather cash out his half
of the firm, which would bankrupt it.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.419
He's like "Look no one wants that, just keep
me on here it will be fine."

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.550
But Howard's like "Look I can't trust you
anymore if that's your thing, I'd rather pay

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.159
you off out of my own pocket!"

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:17.770
And he's gathered the whole company to give
him a big farewell, and send him on his way.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.880
But anyway Jimmy's like "Hey Chuck I'm sorry,
you're my brother and I love you."

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.400
And Chuck's like "Yo, don't worry about it
Jimmy, to be honest, I never liked you at all."

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.160
Ouch.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.311
Now Hector Salamanca has a meeting with Gus
and the representative for their boss, turns

00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:33.790
out the chicken trucks are so effective, he
only wants the drugs coming in that way.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.110
And Hector freaks out, he's super mad, and
oh his heart's giving out, and his pills aren't

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.440
working, so BOOM Hector down!

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.340
He survives though and this is probably what
leads to him being hospitalized for

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.320
all of Breaking Bad.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.280
Nacho manages to switch the pills back before
anyone notices, and now Gus and Nacho, what

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.680
are they gonna do next season?

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.680
We'll see...

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.561
So Jimmy goes to congratulate Old Lady on
her settlement, but she's still so sad, her

00:06:55.561 --> 00:06:56.930
friends never forgave her!

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.360
IT'S HEARTBREAKING!!!

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.060
Jimmy tries to fix it, but he did too good
of a job making them hate her in the first place.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.800
So Jimmy knows there's only one thing he can
do to fix it.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.870
He hosts a session of Chair Yoga, but then
he gets a lawyer from Davis &amp; Main to come

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.220
and shout at him for manipulating these old
people for his own gain.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.300
And he says awful things, "Oh I hate old people,
they're so annoying," but he intentionally

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.360
left his microphone on so they all hear it,
and the friends are back together, but all

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.760
old people now hate him.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.340
Which unfortunately destroys the pretty nice
career he built in Elder Law.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.180
Meanwhile Chuck turns off the power before
bed one night, but the next morning he checks

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.680
his meter and it's still running.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.990
So he starts checking the walls to see what's
draining the power, and he ends up going full-on

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.020
crazy with it.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.210
He ends up in a worse state than he's ever
been.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:43.320
Unable to trust his own mind anymore, he's
kicking his lamp, until... knocks it over...

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.600
AND A FIRE ERUPTS, NOOO!!!

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.060
That's how season 3 comes to an end.
