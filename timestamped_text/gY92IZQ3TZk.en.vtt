00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.049
If you woke up chained to a pipe in a grungy
bathroom with another man, and were told that

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.270
if you killed him you would be set free, but
if you didn’t, you and your family would

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.260
die, what would you do?

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.500
In this highly requested How to Beat video,
we’ll follow Jigsaw’s victims, see if

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.010
we can make better decisions, and ultimately
attempt to beat the traps in, Saw.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.370
If you think you could do better, or if you
have a movie request, let me know in the comments.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.410
If you want to stay prepared for all the other
worst case scenarios movies can come up with,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:01:06.830
hit the like, notification bell, and subscribe
buttons so you don’t miss a beat.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:39.540
Alright, let’s see 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:57.450
if 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.020
we can outsmart Jigsaw and his traps.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.630
We start out following John Kramer, more infamously
known as Jigsaw.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.529
He and his lovely assistant, Amanda, are setting
up Lawrence and Adam’s game.

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:13.480
Their game is pretty simple, make sure the
other person dies, with the asymmetric twist

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.980
that Adam was a private investigator hired
to snoop on Lawrence, but Lawrence doesn’t

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.209
know who Adam is.

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.430
It’s honestly not spicy of a relationship.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.209
Does Jigsaw really think Adam’s legitimate
profession is going to incite Lawrence to

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.209
murder him?

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.439
Come on man, you can do better.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.150
Amanda shackles both Lawrence and Adam, places
each of their instructional cassette tapes

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.250
in their pockets, puts Adam in the tub along
with the keys to their shackles, and then

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.519
turns the faucet on.

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.090
Jigsaw puts the finishing touches on his mask
and pours the fake blood on the floor where

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.419
he is going to act as a suicide victim holding
the two primary game elements.

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.549
The revolver and cassette recorder.

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.310
Jigsaw looks at the mirror and says, “It’s
time to start our game“, then injects himself

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.900
with a sedative to slow his heart rate and
breathing, before lying down in the blood.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.650
We don’t see it here, but Jigsaw also palmed
a remote for tasers hooked up to Adam and

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.389
Lawrence’s shackles as a defense if they
get keen.

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.650
Amanda completes the setup by turning off
the lights and locking the door, sealing them

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.650
all in.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.950
Before the game officially begins, we need
to back up for a second.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.829
See, Lawrence and Adam aren’t the only victims
here.

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.939
When Jigsaw was looking into the mirror saying,
“It’s time to start our game,” he wasn’t

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:23.939
talking to himself.

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.989
It was a two-way mirror with a camera behind
it operated by Zep.

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.980
Unlike Amanda, Zep isn’t an assistant or
apprentice.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.309
He was given a cassette tape outlining how
Jigsaw had injected him with a slow-acting

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:37.949
poison which only Jigsaw had the antidote
for.

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:42.150
If Zep wanted to live, he needed to play his
part in Lawrence and Adam’s game, which

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.879
meant abducting Lawrence’s family and killing
them if Lawrence didn’t kill Adam by 6pm.

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.219
At the moment Jigsaw looked into the mirror
and told Zep to begin, Zep was watching from

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.650
offsite at Lawrence’s house with his family
tied up.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.269
Zep is a certified sick fuck who gets off
on hearing the increased heart rate of his

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.379
victims when he waves a gun in their face,
and Zep might have been promised a position

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.699
at Team Jigsaw if he pulled this off.

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:10.650
Like Amanda, who was one of the rare escapees
of Jigsaw’s traps.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.180
However, the amount of people who would take
that offer after being poisoned and forced

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.709
to abduct and kill an innocent family is slim
at best.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.610
I think he has far stronger reasons to put
Jigsaw down and claim the trophy for it.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.490
Zep is in a position of extreme power here.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.620
He knows who Jigsaw and his apprentice are,
Jigsaw is currently incapacitated, and as

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.000
we later see, Zep has the location and access
to the bathroom where all this is going down.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.330
Zep can just message the details to Detective
Tapp and it’s game over for Jigsaw and Amanda.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.520
The slow-acting poison in his system isn’t
a problem.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.810
John Kramer isn’t a toxicologist.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.520
It’s not like he developed some revolutionary,
unheard of poison.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.860
Zep should be able to go to a hospital or
poison control center and get treated for

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.020
it if there is an antidote.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.250
The game is like 8 hours long, so he might
as well go see if they can treat him before

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.250
being forced to end an innocent family’s
lives.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.770
Of course he’d have to sedate the wife and
daughter while he checked so they didn’t

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.009
run off, because in the event the hospital
staff can’t treat you, well, the family

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.090
is gonna have to go bye bye so you can get
that sweet antidote.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.960
Now, even if the hospital couldn’t treat
the poison in your blood, the antidote or

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.310
atleast how to make the antidote might be
found in Jigsaw’s home and computer hard

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.310
drives.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.800
Risky, maybe, but I’d say it's less risky
than trusting the asshole who poisoned you

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.080
in the first place.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.979
At the very least, Zep should be using his
position behind the camera to stockpile evidence

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:40.220
against John Kramer and Amanda that could
be used to blackmail Jigsaw if his game goes

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.220
sideways.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.240
Man, this makes Jigsaw look pretty stupid.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.150
He shouldn’t have chosen to victimize someone
who knew him so well, and shouldn’t have

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.729
given him the location of the game.

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:56.909
Zep doesn’t consider these options, so the
game begins.

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:01.629
In Adam’s panicky awakening, he unwittingly
kicks the drain plug open and the key to his

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:03.680
shackle gets sucked down the drain.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.389
Natural, probable, and very unlucky.

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.189
Amanda and Jigsaw had to know that the key
would likely go down the drain without Adam

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:12.530
even realizing it was there in the first place.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.490
That’s just poor game design.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.690
It’s immediately clear this is a bad situation.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.610
This isn’t some state of the art containment
cell to house hot pick-pocketer women for

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.879
some handsome billionaire’s pet AI project
where you get to play mobile puzzle games

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:28.010
all day and make friends with cheeky robots.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.460
You’re a whiny dork chained up in a rusty
basement with a bonesaw next to you.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.770
The really thin silver lining is that you’re
still breathing.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.610
If your abductor wanted you dead, you’d
already be dead.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:44.000
Lawrence turns on the lights which reveals
the bloody corpse in the middle of the room.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.349
To them, it looks like this corpse was another
victim who committed suicide with the revolver

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.580
and left his dear loved ones note on his recorder.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.530
If they took a minute to analyze the situation,
they’d realize the corpse is actually very

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.530
strange.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.190
Why was a man initially left in here unshackled
with a loaded gun?

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.080
What compelled him to supposedly kill himself?

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.969
Why was his dead body and the loaded gun left
here with Adam and Lawrence?

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:17.210
Perhaps the strangest aspect of it from their
POV is the crafted appearance of a supposed

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.229
suicide.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:21.400
Any blood splatter analyst would tell you
that this was no suicide.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.150
What this corpse is amateurly dolled up to
look like is a standing person shooting themselves

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.469
in the head, falling to the ground with the
pistol and recorder in hand, and blood pooling

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:32.069
out from the hole in their head.

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:33.289
This didn’t happen.

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:37.160
If it did, blood and brains would have splattered
onto the adjacent walls.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.870
Then, when his lifeless corpse fell, the gun
and recorder would have fallen or gotten knocked

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.150
out of his hands.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.909
From what I've read about suicides, yes, I
went there, a victim would rarely be found

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:52.169
holding the pistol they used on themselves
because their bodies immediately go flaccid

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:53.169
upon death.

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:55.819
Rigor mortis only kicks in after being dead
for a while.

00:07:55.819 --> 00:08:00.059
It would be extremely weird and improbable
that he would’ve laid flat out face down

00:08:00.059 --> 00:08:02.779
on the ground before shooting himself in the
head.

00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:08.729
Even if he did, the blast from that .357 Magnum
Smith and Wesson Model 686 would have directionally

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:11.669
propelled blood and brain a good distance
outwards.

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:15.949
There is some directionality to the blood,
but it’s jutting out on the same side he’s

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:16.949
holding the gun.

00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:19.319
The blood should be spraying the opposite
direction.

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:23.169
You could say that I watch too much Dexter
and that it’s unrealistic for them to know

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.999
this, but Lawrence is a surgical oncologist.

00:08:25.999 --> 00:08:28.530
He should have some general knowledge on this.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:33.320
All this begs the question, why dress up a
corpse as a suicide victim and put it in the

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.320
room with them.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.740
Hell, is this corpse even a corpse.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.650
They don’t know the actual cause of death,
so this man could be alive.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.399
It shouldn’t be too hard to check.

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:45.730
All they’d need to do is crawl as close
to him as possible and check for torso expansion.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.300
If this man’s alive, he’ll be breathing.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.110
Even shallow breaths should be visible.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.430
They could also throw a toilet seat at him
to cause a little pain as a jump starter or

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:59.050
to get a reaction, but considering they don’t
know who this is, and that he has a gun, I’d

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.750
play my cards closer to chest and go with
the former strategy.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.350
Lawrence notices that there’s a brand new
clock on the wall, and remarks that it must

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.279
have been intentionally placed there for them
to tell time.

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:14.420
Right now it’s unclear why, but what is
clear is that this isn’t a normal abduction.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:24.040
At least to Lawrence.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.630
Your foot is chained to a pipe in a derelict
bathroom with a corpse in the middle of the

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.850
room, I have a feel you’re going to be wishing
you woke up on ice with a kidney missing.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.200
And I highly doubt Kidney thieves use eBay.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.530
Lawrence’s next move is to try the door.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.170
It’s low effort so you might as well check
before doing something crazy.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.530
Unsurprisingly, it doesn’t budge.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.760
Even if it did, there’s still the whole
shackle thing to contend with.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.820
Adam finds a cassette tape in his pocket labeled
play me.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.730
Lawrence checks his pockets and finds one
too, with the addition of a small key and

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.190
a single .357 magnum bullet.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.260
The key doesn’t work on his shackle so he
tosses it to Adam.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.580
Which doesn’t work on his shackle either.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.990
Clearly they’re missing important information
which will be found on their tapes.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:08.180
They’re going to need to confiscate the
corpse’s cassette recorder to hear how screwed

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.320
they really are.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.690
Adam cleverly uses his shirt and the drain
plug to retrieve the recorder and play his

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.890
tape.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:27.009
It’s apparent now that his captor knows
him intimately, chose him based on his flaws,

00:10:27.009 --> 00:10:30.350
and is presenting a situation that will require
him to overcome them.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:35.540
The captor is alluding to how Adam has pathetically
been a silent bystander, capturing other people’s

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.860
follys from the sideline with no skin in the
game.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.899
I mean, a private investigator is a legitimate
career that has constructive utility.

00:10:42.899 --> 00:10:47.310
It’s not like Adam was one of those assholes
who video’s people drowning in floodwaters

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.120
to get 15 minutes of e-fame instead of trying
to help.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.630
I guess you can’t expect someone who designs
torture dungeons to have a strong moral code.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.950
Adam’s game is weird, because you’d think
based on his targeted character flaw he would

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:03.860
be instructed to sacrifice himself in some
way in order to help Lawrence survive.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.860
But nope.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.529
All he gets is, ‘watch yourself die, or
do something about it.’

00:11:08.529 --> 00:11:12.510
Not wanting to risk breaking the recorder
by throwing it to Lawrence, he tells Lawrence

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.050
to just throw him the tape.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:18.240
What would happen if they accidentally broke
the recorder or Lawrence beefed his toss and

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.029
it went down the bath drain too?

00:11:20.029 --> 00:11:24.550
Would Jigsaw get up, sigh in disappointment,
and just headshot both of them for being morons?

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.139
I’d like to think so.

00:11:26.139 --> 00:11:37.670
Adam pops Lawrence’s tape in and hits play.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:58.529
Well, there’s your reason for the brand
new clock.

00:11:58.529 --> 00:12:03.069
You have 8 hours to kill Adam, or your family
is murdered and you're left here to decompose.

00:12:03.069 --> 00:12:05.310
It’s a good thing Adam’s key went down
the drain.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:09.440
If he had initially helped unshackle Lawrence,
Lawrence would easily be able to grab the

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.279
gun, shoot Adam, and win the game.

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:15.380
Both Adam and Lawrence’s strategies for
winning the game and surviving are antagonistic

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.380
to one another.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:21.250
Jigsaw was pretty explicit: Adam needs to
prevent Lawrence from killing him before 6pm,

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.250
and Lawrence needs to kill Adam by 6pm.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:28.080
I don’t see any out of the box way of beating
this, so following the instructions on the

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.889
tape is the only real option.

00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:33.800
Adam should feign helping Lawrence find a
way out of here, but refrain from actually

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.160
helping him in any manner because ultimately
it will come down to Lawrence using whatever

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.610
he has to kill Adam and save his family.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.440
Likewise, Lawrence needs to feign that he
is empathetic and has no interest in killing

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.380
Adam in order to recruit his help in solving
the clues, like the ‘follow your heart’

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:56.319
Jigsaw softly muttered on the tape.

00:12:56.319 --> 00:13:01.220
This one wasn’t too hard, as there’s a
toilet with a big heart on it written in feces.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.300
Adam digs his hand around the shit-filled
bowl and comes up empty and brown-handed before

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.910
realizing that he should have checked the
top compartment first.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:12.180
In it, there’s a bag with two hand-saws
and the incriminating photographs Adam took

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.740
of Lawrence’s affair.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.950
Adam neglects to share those with Lawrence.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:20.310
No need to stir conflict or give Lawrence
any more information that he could use against

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.310
you.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.639
Adam pulls the saws out and tosses Lawrence
the spare.

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:25.070
Shouldn’t have done that.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.990
You know that saw isn’t cutting through
those shackles or padlocks, you know the corpse

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:32.860
in the middle has a gun which Lawrence has
a bullet for, and you know Lawrence’s sole

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.269
mission is to kill you.

00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:38.920
When that clock starts ticking down to 6pm,
he will use that saw on his foot, grab the

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.680
gun, and kill you to save his own ass and
family.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.050
Maybe you don’t want to overtly be antagonistic
to Lawrence, in which case you could just

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:50.569
try the saw on your shackle and demonstrate
how it won’t help them and he doesn’t

00:13:50.569 --> 00:13:51.569
need one.

00:13:51.569 --> 00:13:55.279
You could try to saw through the rusty pipe
the shackles tied around, but with how old

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:58.050
and shitty those saws are, I don’t think
that would work at all.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:02.019
They both give up on sawing through the shackles,
and Lawrence tells Adam he thinks he knows

00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:03.019
who their captor is.

00:14:03.019 --> 00:14:08.020
He says that months ago he was a suspect in
the Jigsaw case, which we’re going to flashback

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.020
to.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:13.320
In the flashback, the police are investigating
the shredded remains of Jigsaw’s latest

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.320
victim.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:30.180
He also had a cassette tape on him outlining
the rules for the game.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:34.930
This big fella panic dove belly first into
the razor wire and started flailing around

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.009
when he got stuck.

00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:39.509
The flailing caused the razors to rip deep
into his flesh.

00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:42.449
So deep, that his stomach acid was found on
the ground.

00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:49.680
Within minutes he was dead from blood loss.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.850
The best way to beat this trap is to do the
opposite of what he did, and go low and slow.

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:59.040
It’s hard to tell how big the cage maze
is, but it doesn’t seem that big and with

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.190
two hours he should have enough time to slowly
navigate them.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.990
By getting low he removes an entire attack
surface he could get cut from.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.570
I’m not sure whether you’d want to crawl
face up or face down.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:14.630
Even though crawling face down mitigates exposure
to your most vulnerable areas like your neck

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.500
arteries, stomach, and groin..

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.209
You’re going to get caught up with razors
sinking into your back, and it will be very

00:15:20.209 --> 00:15:22.190
difficult to pull them out with your hands.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:27.040
With how slow you can go, I’d be inclined
to go face up, shoulder crawling and using

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:32.009
my hands to relocate the razor wires out and
around my body as best as possible.

00:15:32.009 --> 00:15:33.680
Doing nothing isn’t an option.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.800
I’m sure his family will report him missing,
but it’s highly unlikely the police will

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.290
find him within the 7-10 days it will take
for him to die of dehydration.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.769
I don’t think the police will have many
leads to go off of in this case.

00:15:44.769 --> 00:15:48.560
Jigsaw probably just read this guys suicide
attempt in the news and threw him into an

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.450
unmarked van before placing him in this trap.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:55.640
Lawrence interrupts the flashback with a stupid
monologue, saying that Jigsaw wasn’t really

00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.370
a murderer, that technically he never killed
anyone, that he found ways for people to kill

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.370
themselves.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.629
I’m pretty sure you’d still be tried as
a murderer.

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:08.449
Judge, I only stripped them down naked, imprisoned
them in an underground maze of razor wire

00:16:08.449 --> 00:16:13.050
under a time constraint, which they need to
reach the exit by or it will be sealed off

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:14.480
and they will be left to starve to death.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.339
They basically killed themselves by choice.

00:16:17.339 --> 00:16:21.709
The next crime scene the police show up to
is that of a charred corpse in a room of glass

00:16:21.709 --> 00:16:24.819
with a vault in the middle and red numbers
painted all over the walls.

00:16:24.819 --> 00:16:31.880
He too has a cassette tape.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:39.540
So this guy was murdered for playing Hookie?

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:45.889
Oh, sorry, I mean, so because this guy played
hookie, he was lawfully relocated into a situation

00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:50.459
which happened to be potentially dangerous,
in which he somehow found a way to kill himself?

00:16:50.459 --> 00:16:54.079
That’s one of the lamest reasons for killing
someone I've heard.

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:57.060
Literally everyone has done this at least
once in their lives.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.670
Maybe this poor guy needed a mental health
day and his employer was a raging dick.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.040
How did Jigsaw even find this guy?

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.880
Did he explicitly go out looking for someone
who called in sick too much.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.200
What is too much, because like we said, everyone
does this from time to time.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.350
Did Jigsaw just follow a guy who was out walking
in the park during the workday and see if

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:16.720
he was calling in sick.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.670
Or did he get a job somewhere just to find
someone who called in sick too much.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.450
What the fuck is Jigsaw doing.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:27.680
There is absolutely zero shortage of criminals
and downright horrible people walking free.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.960
Why not choose them.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.290
Like the man in the razorwire, this guy panicked,
started frantically running around with the

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:40.100
candle, and caught the tip of the flame.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.090
The best way to beat this trap is again, taking
your time, methodically trying each combination

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.840
in order so you don’t repeat or miss a combination.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.280
Most slow acting poisons will give you hours
if not days before you succumb to them.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.760
You should have plenty of time.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.160
The room seems well lit enough to where you
don’t need to wave the candle in front of

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.410
your face in order to see the numbers.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.840
Using the candle just unnecessarily risks
combustion of the flammable ectoplasmic goo

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.840
you're covered in.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.510
The glass on the floor shouldn’t be a problem
either considering you have shoes on.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.770
The most difficult aspect of this trap is
the vault itself.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:16.680
We have no idea if it’s a 3 or 4 combination
lock, so the possible combinations we need

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.090
to try just doubled.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:21.890
Not only that, but if you aren’t familiar
with these combination locks you won’t know

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:25.860
how to clear the combination, which direction
you need to turn the dial for each combination

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.720
number, and how many times to pass each combination
number before stopping on it.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.730
I mean shit, I didn’t realize they were
this complicated until I looked into it.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:37.390
Since the vault is only carrying an antidote
and shouldn’t be too heavy, I might opt

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:41.060
to cradle it and use it as a battering ram
against the brick wall.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:45.630
Most brick walls, especially old ones like
in this room will start to crumble under repeated

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:46.630
assault.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:50.850
It’d take some time, but not more than trying
a thousand combinations which may or may not

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:51.850
work.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:52.850
It’s more of a sure bet in my opinion.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:57.110
Jigsaw might have had a loose connection with
the razor wire guy, but Mr. Hookie is a different

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.110
story.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.410
In order to know that this guy was calling
in sick all the time, Jigsaw would have either

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:05.470
had to be working with him or had access to
his cell phone records where he could find

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.710
out that this guy was calling in sick and
not just taking PTO.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:12.720
The police should be cross-checking everyone
at his work, in his recent personal life,

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.900
and who had records or phone taps on him.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:20.660
The biggest breakthrough, almost suspiciously
so, is the penlight Jigsaw supposedly left

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.660
behind.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.000
They run the prints and find the penlights
owner, which is none other than Dr. Lawrence

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Gordon.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.590
Lawrence was working on John Kramer’s brain
tumour situation when the police arrived and

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.710
questioned him about how his penlight ended
up at a murder scene.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:36.800
He gives them his alibi of going to a seedy
motel to have an affair with a med student

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.670
that night, which checks out.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:44.220
An alibi could be faked pretty easily, especially
for a mastermind such as Jigsaw, but if Lawrence

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:49.340
wasn’t Jigsaw, then whoever Jigsaw is or
worked with visited this hospital in order

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.630
to grab the penlight.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:55.070
The police should be investigating anyone
who might have come into contact with Lawrence.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.170
Janitors, doctors, patients, orderlies, everyone.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:02.430
As well as the camera footage looking for
any suspicious behavior or anyone swiping

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.780
Lawrences gear.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.970
Since we know that Jigsaw always has a relatively
deep connection with his targets, it would

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.800
likely be an employee or frequent patient.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.890
The detectives should run the audio of the
previous victim’s tapes past Lawrence to

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.280
see if he recognized the voice and could make
a connection.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.720
While a voice masker was applied, it’s not
done sufficiently enough to separate the man

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.940
from the voice.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:31.100
I’m pretty confident Lawrence could identify
this as John Kramer, and the ensuing investigations

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.110
would have uncovered his side hustle.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:38.150
After much deliberation, I can’t think of
any rational reason for Jigsaw framing Lawrence,

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:42.280
bringing a ton of police attention to him,
and then using him as a victim in his next

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.280
trap.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.280
This was a high risk low reward move that
provided the police with leads they could

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.330
follow back to him.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.800
I get that Jigsaw’s not overly concerned
with discretion, as he leaves his victims

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.540
mangled corpses in the traps for the police
to find, and uses his Jigsaw calling card

00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:01.510
to gain notoriety and spread his twisted social
justice message as far as possible, but this

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.310
poor frame job easily could have ended his
career.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:09.100
Calling card or not, the most successful serial
killers target completely random people they

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.840
haven’t established any connection with.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.480
The police ask Lawrence to listen to the testimony
of a woman named Amanda that had escaped a

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.910
trap Jigsaw put her in to see if it jogs his
memory about the penlight, and to gauge his

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.510
reaction to seeing the victim.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:25.150
Amanda starts telling her story of waking
up with a metal contraption on her head and

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.960
Jigsaw breaking the bad news.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.740
He tells her that the device is hooked into
her upper and lower jaws, and when the timer

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:34.220
at the back goes off, her mouth will be permanently
ripped open.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:35.520
Like a reverse bear trap.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.920
He’s nice enough to give a demonstration:

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:45.080
He then goes on to say that there is one key
to unlock the device, but it’s in the stomach

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.460
of her dead cellmate.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:51.650
Amanda, as all do and justifiably so, panics,
tries to rip her restraints off and take the

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.550
reverse bear trap off her head.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:57.090
Getting up pulled a pin on the jawbreaker
and initiated the countdown.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:00.360
There really was no way to know that would
happen or prevent it.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.830
Even if she did try to turn around and assess
her situation calmly, the wire was short enough

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.460
that it would have pulled regardless.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:11.890
Jigsaw never told her how much time she had,
but the ticking sound every second...

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:17.260
...would strongly suggest to her that she
has less than 60 seconds to grab the knife

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.740
and start digging through the corpse for the
key.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.530
Only the dead man isn't dead.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.230
Amanda doesn’t have a choice here.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.520
She’s seconds away from getting her head
cracked wide open.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.000
It’s do or die.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.020
You or him.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:35.980
The aggressive fist stabs aren’t the way
to go with a scalpel, she’s just causing

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.160
excessive hemorrhaging and mashing up the
guts into an unrecognizable mess.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.570
She needs to create a large circular incision
to remove the layer of skin over the top right

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:48.680
of his upper abdomen so she can actually identify
and locate the stomach.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.950
And that is important.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:55.110
The stomach is in the upper right area of
your abdomen right around your lower ribs,

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.400
not your belly, that’s where your intestines
are.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.400
If you fucked that up you just died.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.630
Once the stomach is located, she just needs
to create another incision to open it up and

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:11.200
snag the key to unlock the headpiece and throw
it off.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.880
The police tell Lawrence that even though
Jigsaw said that the man with the key in his

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:20.190
stomach was dead, and even though Jigsaw said
he wasn’t lying, the man was alive, just

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:23.400
doped up on enough opiates to where he couldn’t
move or feel anything.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.810
It’s fucked up, but.. it could have been
a lot worse for both of them.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:29.240
He could have been strapped to a chair completely
sober.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.850
He got to go out feeling calm, relaxed, and
in a state of euphoria.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:35.160
We never hear why this guy was murdered by
Jigsaw.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:40.010
He never had a chance at survival, which seems
really unfair and unsportsmanlike.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:44.250
The police also mention that Amanda was a
drug addict before all this, and maybe that’s

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.250
why she was chosen.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:49.200
Yah, it’s kind of a mystery because this
trap didn’t exhibit the previous theme of

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.860
overcoming personal flaws.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:55.010
It was almost like he came up with this cool
head contraption and wanted to find any excuse

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:57.260
to put it on someone for his twisted amusement.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.810
Okay, maybe it was more of a ‘choose life’
thing and the drugged man was a representation

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:04.560
of her on drugs, but it’s still ridiculous.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:09.280
The lifelong PTSD caused by this is not going
to improve her drug addiction whatsoever.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.330
Why am I even still on this, Jigsaw is clearly
not in the business of rehabilitation.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:17.120
Sure, Amanda said Jigsaw helped her, but we
all know that’s not true.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.920
I mean, the sheer fact that she said killing
someone and almost getting her jaw removed

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.070
from her head helped her, is evidence that
it didn’t help her.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.070
Quite the opposite.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.330
In fact, if I was the detective I’d be trailing
this broad.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:32.690
From Tapps perspective, her Stockholm syndrome
coupled with a psycho like Jigsaw’s infatuation

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:37.300
with his victims, especially the rare ones
that escape, means there’s a chance she

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.550
will lead them to him.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:43.250
We know from the beginning that Amanda was
helping Jigsaw set the game up, so realistically,

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.620
trailing her could very well have led them
to Jigsaw.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.660
The important piece of information that Lawrence
can use from this trip down memory lane is

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.800
that it is possible to be free if you win
the game, even though Jigsaw lied about some

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.270
aspects of the game.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:59.790
Adam then picks up a piece of glass and realizes
it’s actually a two way mirror, so he chucks

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:03.760
a bunch of scrap at the bathroom mirror and
breaks it which uncovers the hidden camera

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.760
recording them.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.540
Why even hide the camera in the first place,
if by design the victims know it’s a game

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.090
and they’re being watched to see if they
achieve their goals.

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.490
And if you were going to hide a camera for
whatever reason, why would you leave extra

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.910
fragments of two way mirror glass on the ground?

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.850
With the clock ticking down, Lawrence realizes
he needs to start playing the game or bad

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:22.470
shits going to happen to him and his family.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:26.021
He remembers that Jigsaw mentioned in the
tape that there are numerous ways for him

00:25:26.021 --> 00:25:28.560
to win, and that X marks the spot for the
treasure.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.540
He asks Adam to help him find the X under
the context of it being beneficial to them

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.310
both finding a way out of here.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:38.960
Remember, this is a last man standing game
with no successful cooperative strategy.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:54.020
Adam should know that he would literally be
helping Lawrence obtain a way to kill him.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:58.290
Adam comes across as impulsive and naive,
so I don’t think this was a calculated move.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:02.940
It was a great move though, because it distracted
Lawrence into spending precious time reminiscing

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:07.630
about his family instead of making progress
without seeming too obvious that Adam is trying

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:08.630
to stall him.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:12.250
In his flashback to the night of his abduction,
he was working late when his daughter came

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.340
to him scared of a bad man in her closet.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.840
I know kids have overactive imaginations and
it’s probably nothing, but I’d be grabbing

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.850
the 9mm from the nightstand.

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:25.020
Lawrence doesn’t check the closet, he just
tells her a bedtime story before getting paged

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.240
for an ‘emergency’.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:30.670
He neglects to check his wallet for clues,
even though every possession was included

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:34.840
for a reason, and passes it to Adam to show
him pictures of his wife and daughter.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:39.220
Only the picture of his wife was replaced
with a picture of them captive with a note

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:43.550
on the back reading, “X marks the spot,
sometimes you see more with your eyes shut.”

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:47.510
Instead of telling Lawrence, he just says
it’s not here and throws the wallet back

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:48.510
to him.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.770
Maybe Adam is more devious than he appears.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:54.920
This was another solid move that took a clue
out of Lawrences hands without being obvious

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.920
about it.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.730
We get some more backstory on the night Lawrence
was abducted.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.440
After he left to bang his hot med student,
his family was subdued and tied up by the

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:07.130
man in the closet that Lawrence didn’t check.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:12.170
If only Lawrence was paranoid and armed, actually
checked the closet, and gunned down Zep.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.850
Now his family is tied up with Zep getting
off to their increased heart rate when he

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:17.610
waves a pistol in their face.

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:21.590
Zep then parts the curtains and shoves his
face up to the window to I guess check if

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:22.960
anyone called the cops?

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.040
He does have a reason to be paranoid.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.070
Lawrence was under investigation after Jigsaw
framed him with the penlight he stole.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:33.440
But for that same reason, bare facing the
window the police are possibly watching is

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.940
a bad idea.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.810
Detective Tapp was staking out Lawrence, and
was able to snap a picture of Zep peeping

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:39.810
his head out.

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:43.740
It was a bad photo and maybe he couldn’t
identify the person with it alone, but Tapp

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.901
can use this opportunity to tail him when
he leaves, or confront Lawrence with this

00:27:47.901 --> 00:27:51.910
evidence as well as cross-check it with anyone
Lawrence had frequent contact with at the

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:52.910
hospital.

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:58.050
The frame job was 5 months ago, so why is
Tapp so unrelenting in staking out Lawrence’s

00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:59.050
house.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:02.690
Did he literally get nothing from looking
at the connection between Jigsaw and the hospital?

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:06.530
Or did he just not check and tunnel vision
on the target of the obvious frame job?

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:08.150
Yah, probably the latter.

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:11.900
Looks like we are going to find out in this
flashback inside a flashback to just after

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.570
Tapp questioned Lawrence and dropped him off
at home.

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:18.940
Later that night when Tapp was reviewing the
tapes he recognized a gang sign on the wall,

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.270
and he heard a fire alarm in the background
of the tape.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:25.580
By cross-checking the gang sign location with
what fire department responded to an emergency

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:29.850
that night, they were able to locate an old
mannequin factory which they believed is where

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:31.210
Jigsaw’s operation was.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:36.150
Anxious to bag Jigsaw, these wannabe action
heroes load up and bust down the front door

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:38.910
without any information, planning or backup.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:43.640
Hastily rolling on a guy that’s known for
making traps isn’t the smartest idea.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.900
Instead of breaking in right off the bat,
maybe stake it out first.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:51.211
Tail whoever comes and goes, get their license
plate, visual profile, home address, and get

00:28:51.211 --> 00:28:52.570
a proper warrant.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:56.910
Then once Jigsaw enters the building, you
can send in SWAT teams who are vastly better

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:59.540
trained and equipped to bag someone like this.

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:04.030
Inside the factory there are dioramas of traps
and a man locked up in between two drill bits.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.320
This is Jigsaw’s operation, all right.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.320
Someone starts coming up the elevator so they
hide to try and ambush him.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.970
Tapp and Sing get the drop on Jigsaw, but
all the sudden become good cops that want

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:14.320
to do things the right way.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.720
They broke in without a warrant at night,
Tapps hungry for vengeance, this dude is clearly

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.720
the bad guy.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.680
It’s not unreasonable for them in their
position to shoot first and ask questions

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.680
later.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.900
Especially since Jigsaw is the slippery mastermind
and you're on his turf.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.820
At least kneecap him.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:38.360
Great, now Jigsaw triggered the trap and this
poor guy is going to get frankensteined in

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.780
under 30 seconds.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:44.060
Tapp has every possible right to blast this
guy right here right now.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:47.860
As for the victim, Sing doesn’t need to
find the keys, he just needs to find the power

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.100
cable and shoot it.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.020
Or just shoot the padlock off.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.980
Tapp really needs to get some distance between
him and Jigsaw so this doesn’t end in a

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.790
tug of war for the gun.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:05.220
Damnit Tapp, all you had to do was keep him
at arms length or put a hole in his pelvis.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.350
Now Jigsaw’s getting away and you’re on
the ground with your throat slit.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.360
Sing runs after Jigsaw and fires some buckshot
into his back.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:15.410
It looks like a killshot, but at this point,
I’d pump a few more shots off into his corpse

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:16.470
to confirm the kill.

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:19.420
Don’t want him scurrying away or flipping
around with a gun.

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:23.780
Again, there is every reason to suspect that
a mastermind who designs human traps for a

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:27.080
living will have booby trapped in his own
operation in case he was compromised like

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.080
this.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:36.160
Sing tunnel visions on the hooded man and
accidentally trips one of them.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.150
Tapp tries to help, but only gets there in
time to see Sing’s headless body and Jigsaw

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:41.240
getting away.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:45.580
This would explain his unrelenting desire
to track down Jigsaw, and why he was taken

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.490
off the force, but it doesn’t explain why
he’s tracking Lawrence so aggressively.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:52.940
The hooded man's voice and figure simply don’t
match up.

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:57.460
I also have a hard time believing that the
ensuing police raid didn’t yield any usable

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.460
evidence.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.120
All these flashbacks cost Lawrence a lot of
time.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.160
He now has just over 2 hours remaining to
kill Adam.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.940
Better start looking for that X unless you
wanna lose a leg.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:11.151
Adam, remembering what the picture said, comes
up with the idea to turn the lights off, which

00:31:11.151 --> 00:31:15.450
reveals a glow in the dark painted X that
was charged by the lights being on.

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:17.210
Behind the X there’s a box.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:21.030
It’s padlocked so Adam tosses the key back
to Lawrence so he can open it.

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.030
Adam.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:23.450
Why are you helping Lawrence?

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:27.220
He has to kill you or him and his family die,
remember?

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:31.430
The box contains a note, cell phone, lighter
and cigarette.

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:36.050
Lawrence secretly reads the note which says,
“The cigarettes are harmless, I promise.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:38.700
Smoking is only poisonous when it ends in
bloodshed.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.480
Think about this, you don’t need a gun to
kill Adam.”

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.520
Adam foolishly wants to smoke the cigarette
regardless of the fact that it’s a blatantly

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.750
horrible decision.

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:51.010
This method of Lawrence winning the game was
obviously devised to play on Adam’s cigarette

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:52.010
addiction.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.460
The phone wasn’t mentioned in the note,
though.

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:57.630
Lawrence tries calling 911 with it, but the
phone was altered to only be able to receive

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:59.010
calls, not make them.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:03.070
The tampered phone somehow rings a bell for
Lawrence and sparks another flashback to the

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:04.300
night he was abducted.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.510
He was finishing up at the ‘hospital’
and walking back to his car when he got the

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:09.540
feeling someone was watching him.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:14.070
That feeling was triggered by Adam moronically
leaving the flash on in a dark parking light

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:16.550
while snapping ninja pictures of Lawrence.

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:19.110
Lawrence hops into his Beamer and tries to
make a phone call.

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:21.950
His cell doesn’t work so he stops to try
the pay phone.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:23.230
Which doesn’t work either.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:31.670
While he’s distracted someone in a pig mask
sneaks out of his car and runs up on him.

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:35.330
Why didn't the pigman piano wire his neck
while he was in the car?

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.470
Abducting someone out in the open without
a quick getaway is much riskier..

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:39.470
Just sayin.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:41.400
I still don’t like the backseat abduction
technique though.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:45.570
If your target has half a brain or decent
peripherals they are going to check the backseat

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:48.000
before getting in and they will see you.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.700
Especially if you’re a dumbass wearing a
pig mask and red suit.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:55.110
I can just see Jigsaw tucked into the backseat
trying to scrunch in low, hearing a knock

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:59.100
on the window and wondering if Lawrence saw
him or just accidentally hit the window.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:03.010
He slowly turns around and looks up to see
Lawrence with a pistol waving for him to step

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:04.030
out of his vehicle.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:09.020
After wasting more time storytelling, Lawrence
asks Adam how he knew to turn the lights off.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:13.230
Adam hesitates to answer at first, but eventually
gives in and hands over the picture of his

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:15.560
captive wife and daughter with the note on
the back.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:19.740
Good going Adam, you just provided massive
motivation for Lawrence to kill you.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:23.380
Yes, Lawrence already heard on the cassette
tape that his family was in jeopardy, but

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.310
it wasn’t as real until now.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:29.460
Lawrence remembers the tape which said that
the man in the middle had poison in his blood,

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:34.590
and the note from the box that said that cigarettes
are only deadly when they ‘end in bloodshed’.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:39.230
Putting 2 and 2 together, he secretly dabs
the cigarette that Adam was desperate to smoke

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:41.460
in the corpse's poison filled blood.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:42.460
Great!

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:45.110
Lawrence doesn’t need to chop his foot off
to get the gun to kill Adam with.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:49.620
He can just toss the cig and lighter over
to Adam, watch him slowly die, win the game,

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.210
and save him and his family.

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:54.850
From the flashbacks, he knows that this will
end badly for him if he doesn’t win, and

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:56.730
that winning is an option.

00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:00.740
Instead of playing his hand, he sacrifices
it by flipping the lights off and secretly

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.520
telling Adam all about the death sticks and
the charade he’s planning.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:09.079
Lawrence’s plan is to have Adam fake smoke
the poison cigarette and fake die so Lawrence

00:34:09.079 --> 00:34:13.629
can fake win, and when their captor comes
in to free Lawrence, they can kill him and

00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:16.759
then ride off into the sunset on their ivory
stallions.

00:34:16.759 --> 00:34:18.819
This is a massively flawed plan.

00:34:18.819 --> 00:34:23.240
If your captor has a decent microphone or
a camera with night mode, he will hear and

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.619
see every detail.

00:34:24.619 --> 00:34:28.940
Even if he’s using a shitty camera and mic,
which he stupidly is, you still don’t know

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.579
what type of poison was put in the blood,
nor what it’s effects are and how long these

00:34:32.579 --> 00:34:34.029
effects take to kick in.

00:34:34.029 --> 00:34:38.710
Without knowing what type of poison was used,
Adam couldn’t possibly sell the fake death.

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:43.060
And you can be sure Adam is going to do a
horrible job acting this whole thing out anyways.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.550
Lawrence flips the lights back on and starts
the show.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.899
If I was Adam, I still wouldn’t trust Lawrence.

00:34:47.899 --> 00:34:51.829
He didn’t have to tell you about the poison,
so he’s probably being honest, but you could

00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:56.899
fake smoke it instead of taking a full drag
on it.

00:34:56.899 --> 00:35:02.820
Adam’s faking is ridiculous.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.089
Nobody’s buying that shit.

00:35:04.089 --> 00:35:08.670
Jigsaw uses his taser remote to shock Adam
so Zep could see that Lawrence didn’t actually

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.740
win the game yet.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:14.839
Should have given him the actual poison.

00:35:14.839 --> 00:35:18.650
The shock jolted Adams' memory about his abduction,
or so he says.

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:22.559
I think he’s just reverting to stalling
Lawrence because his plan failed and now he’s

00:35:22.559 --> 00:35:24.040
going to have to try to kill Adam.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.029
Adam starts telling the story of how he woke
up in his dark room with the power out, then

00:35:28.029 --> 00:35:37.940
heard some strange noises in his living room
which he went to check out.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:38.940
Really Jigsaw?

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.730
You put your doll on his couch with a halloween
noisemaker?

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:42.730
Why?

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:46.289
You didn’t even use that as a distraction
to nab him from behind.

00:35:46.289 --> 00:35:49.599
Adam hears someone making noise in the closet
and grabs a bat to check it out.

00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:53.080
If I was Adam I’d be leaving my apartment
right now and calling the cops.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:57.731
Why would you, a weak, unarmed, untrained
person willingly engage in a hand to hand

00:35:57.731 --> 00:35:58.731
fight with an intruder.

00:35:58.731 --> 00:36:02.490
It’s not going to end well for you.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:05.160
Adam’s not the only idiot here.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:09.000
Hiding in someone's closet and making a bunch
of noise to bait them to open said closet

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.849
is a terrible way to abduct someone.

00:36:10.849 --> 00:36:15.250
You have no escape route if things go south,
like if the other person brought friends over,

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:18.920
they had a knife or a gun, or they called
the cops and waited outside the apartment.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:23.400
By the time Adam wraps his story up, Lawrence
has 23 minutes left on the clock.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.339
He doesn’t seem motivated to start hacking
away at his foot yet.

00:36:26.339 --> 00:36:30.359
No matter, part of Zep’s instructions was
to call Lawrence and have his wife and daughter

00:36:30.359 --> 00:36:31.869
give him some motivation.

00:36:31.869 --> 00:36:35.580
His daughter tells him a man has them tied
up with a gun, and his wife tells him not

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.079
to believe Adam’s lies.

00:36:37.079 --> 00:36:38.480
That Adam knows him.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.140
Lawrence wastes more time confronting Adam
about his lies.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.349
Does it even matter what Adam has to say?

00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:44.720
You know what you need to do.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:48.279
Adam should just be honest about being hired
to tail Lawrence as a private investigator.

00:36:48.279 --> 00:36:52.390
Sure, it’ll piss Lawrence off, but it doesn’t
give him any more reason to kill you than

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:53.390
he already has.

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:56.319
It actually helps Adam by wasting more of
Lawrence’s time.

00:36:56.319 --> 00:37:00.150
Adam flicks the pictures he took of Lawrence’s
affair at him and says he was stalking Lawrence

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:04.091
the night he was abducted, but had left when
Lawrence got in his car, so he didn’t see

00:37:04.091 --> 00:37:05.260
who abducted him.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.490
Lawrence questions Adam about who hired him,
thinking that that must be the person who

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:09.579
put them in here.

00:37:09.579 --> 00:37:13.269
Adam says that he was hired by a tall black
man with a scar on his neck.

00:37:13.269 --> 00:37:15.819
Lawrence immediately figures this was Agent
Tapp.

00:37:15.819 --> 00:37:19.529
Tapp must have hired Adam because Lawrence
had a restraining order on him and couldn’t

00:37:19.529 --> 00:37:20.529
get close.

00:37:20.529 --> 00:37:24.059
After their fight, Adam double-takes one of
his pictures, realizing there's a face in

00:37:24.059 --> 00:37:25.059
it.

00:37:25.059 --> 00:37:28.589
You just now remember that you took a picture
of some random guy at Lawrence’s house the

00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:29.839
night before you both were abducted?

00:37:29.839 --> 00:37:34.369
He throws it to Lawrence who identifies the
man as Zep, the orderly from the hospital.

00:37:34.369 --> 00:37:38.250
Why was this picture of Zep at Lawrence’s
house placed in the bathroom?

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:40.799
Now Lawrence and Adam both know who Zep is.

00:37:40.799 --> 00:37:45.200
If either of them win and get free, they will
report Zep to the police, who will report

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.859
John Kramer to the police.

00:37:46.859 --> 00:37:48.500
Zep is in a game he can’t win.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.599
He either dies from poisoning, or gets thrown
in the slammer.

00:37:51.599 --> 00:37:55.500
Zep could choose to complete the game, get
the antidote, and flee to a non-extradition

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.500
country.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.930
Or, he could immediately report Jigsaw to
the police and check himself into a hospital.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:04.100
When Zep isn’t looking, Lawrence’s wife
slips her restraints and patiently waits for

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.630
her moment to strike.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.589
Lawrence fails to kill Adam and is now officially
out of time.

00:38:08.589 --> 00:38:12.599
He knows from the previous Jigsaw cases that
Jigsaw doesn’t fuck around.

00:38:12.599 --> 00:38:16.119
His family will be executed and he will be
left in here to rot.

00:38:16.119 --> 00:38:21.410
Zep draws his 1911, and then gives Lawrence
one last call so he can hear his wife telling

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:24.720
him he failed before she catches a bullet
in her teeth.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.760
Jigsaw, you sadistic son of a bitch.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:31.079
The call is a nice touch, but telegraphing
your blatant intention to kill the wife and

00:38:31.079 --> 00:38:36.299
daughter in front of their faces like this
is just going to incite a ferocious last stand.

00:38:36.299 --> 00:38:38.630
It’s better for you if they don’t see
it coming.

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:43.880
His other mistake was leaving them in a room
by themselves with poorly tied rope restraints.

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:47.319
If you’re going to do that, at least check
the restraints every time you re-enter the

00:38:47.319 --> 00:38:49.640
room to make sure they didn’t slip them.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:50.640
Lawrence gets the call.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:55.230
Alison tells him that he failed, but right
before Zep domes her she snatches his gun

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.230
from him.

00:38:56.230 --> 00:39:00.069
Unfortunately she lacks the nerve to kill,
and makes the all too common mistake of getting

00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:11.390
within arms reach which gives Zep the opportunity
to grab for the gun back.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:14.910
Good thing Tapp heard the shots, because Alison’s
losing control over the gun.

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:18.520
In a last ditch move she shanks his leg with
a pair of hair clippers.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.849
Why the hell does everyone always go for the
leg.

00:39:20.849 --> 00:39:24.609
The same thing happened in my last video on
The Hills Have Eyes, and look how well that

00:39:24.609 --> 00:39:27.420
worked for Lynn.

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:31.579
People, you need to go for the throat.

00:39:31.579 --> 00:39:35.120
Instead of capitalizing on Zep being stunned,
she runs for her daughter.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.400
Alison, you need to stomp out Zep when he’s
down.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.400
Priorities.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.630
Your daughter being freed won't help if Zep
gets up and guns you both down.

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:46.619
Lucky for her, Tapp comes in guns hot before
Zep can finish the job.

00:39:46.619 --> 00:39:48.849
Tapp runs out of ammo and tackles Zep to the
ground.

00:39:48.849 --> 00:39:53.160
Zep stuns Tapp with a flower vase to the head
and runs after Alison and her daughter.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.400
Why is nobody seizing the kill when they have
the chance.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.470
It would take 2 seconds to put one in Tapps
chest before running after the family.

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:03.839
Zep can’t find Alison and her daughter,
so he runs back to the warehouse to kill Lawrence.

00:40:03.839 --> 00:40:05.769
His plan is really falling apart here.

00:40:05.769 --> 00:40:08.470
I don’t think he’s going to be getting
that antidote anymore.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:14.529
Tapp tracks Zep to the warehouse in the most
legit car chase I’ve ever seen.

00:40:14.529 --> 00:40:24.789
They get into a scuffle, which ends with Zep
shooting Tapp in the chest.

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:28.440
Alison and her daughter safely emerge from
their hiding spot, but the problem is that

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.410
all Lawrence heard on the phone was gunshots
and screaming.

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:33.349
For all he knows, they got mowed down.

00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:37.109
He breaks down crying and gets electrocuted
until he foams at the mouth.

00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:38.220
Why was he electrocuted?

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:42.119
I get shocking Adam for fake dying, but this
seemed unnecessary.

00:40:42.119 --> 00:40:46.060
Alison calls back on the phone to tell him
they were safe, but it’s just out of reach

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.599
because when Lawrence was electrocuted the
phone got knocked out of his hand.

00:40:49.599 --> 00:40:54.230
He could flip the box around to give him more
reach so he could snag the phone, but just

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:55.940
gives up trying to retrieve it.

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:59.930
Lawrence giving up on getting the phone leads
to him freaking out and irrationally deciding

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:04.050
to cut his leg off so he could shoot Adam
in an attempt to salvage his game.

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:05.310
A little late on that, chief.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:09.049
If Lawrence had gotten the phone, hearing
how his family was safe would have prevented

00:41:09.049 --> 00:41:10.359
this freakout.

00:41:10.359 --> 00:41:14.230
Before sawing his leg off at the ankle, he
tries to apply a makeshift tourniquet with

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:15.230
his shirt.

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:18.470
If you’ve seen my other videos, you’d
know his execution is terrible.

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:23.950
He basically under overs his blouse and pulls
it slightly tight like its a fucking shoelace,

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:25.670
and this guy’s supposed to be a surgeon.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:28.820
There’s no way this adequately cut off blood
circulation.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:33.130
He finishes sawing his foot off, grabs the
revolver, puts the round in the chamber, and

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.339
takes a shot at Adam from across the room.

00:41:35.339 --> 00:41:39.309
If you were Lawrence, you’d want to get
as close as possible before firing.

00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:43.160
Most people will have trouble hitting a human
size target from 7 yards away.

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:47.499
Zep arrives and tries to kill Lawrence, but
Adam sweeps his leg and bashes his brains

00:41:47.499 --> 00:41:51.260
in with the toilet cover.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:55.819
I’m surprised Adam had it in him.

00:41:55.819 --> 00:41:56.819
Nice job.

00:41:56.819 --> 00:42:00.059
With the door wide open and Lawrence free
from his shackle, he tells Adam he’s going

00:42:00.059 --> 00:42:01.430
to leave and get help.

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:05.589
Adam checks Zeps clothing to see if he had
a key to his shackle, and finds another cassette

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:10.430
player which reveals how Zep was not only
their captor, but another victim in the same

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:18.069
game.

00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:23.610
The big twist moment hits when the corpse
dressed as a suicide victim in the middle

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:27.049
of the room gets up and reveals himself to
be Jigsaw.

00:42:27.049 --> 00:42:31.020
Realizing your captor was right in front of
you this whole time has to be a bitch of a

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.020
revelation.

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.950
In the beginning I laid out how this corpse
might not have been dead, and that they should

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:36.559
check it if they get the chance.

00:42:36.559 --> 00:42:38.809
However, I don’t think this would have helped.

00:42:38.809 --> 00:42:42.940
They had no way of knowing if this was Jigsaw,
and no way of attacking him.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:46.940
Even if they had gotten free, threatening
and attacking Jigsaw would have just resulted

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.950
in them getting electrocuted to death.

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:53.140
When Jigsaw fully wakes up, he tells Adam
that the key to his shackle was in the bathtub.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.720
Yah, it actually went down the drain.

00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:59.029
If you wanted the key to serve a purpose you
should have hidden it somewhere else with

00:42:59.029 --> 00:43:00.029
clues to it.

00:43:00.029 --> 00:43:04.349
It seems like he was trying to tell Adam how
to free himself because, technically, he won

00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:05.349
the game.

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:09.589
Adam’s understandably pretty pissed off
right now and tries to kill Jigsaw with Zep’s

00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:12.740
pistol, but Jigsaw tasers him before he can
get a shot off.

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:17.742
The movie ends with Jigsaw shutting the door
leaving Adam to die.

00:43:17.742 --> 00:43:22.499
Adam trying to kill Jigsaw may have changed
his mind on letting Adam live, but what was

00:43:22.499 --> 00:43:26.109
Jigsaw expecting, that Adam was going to be
grateful and cordial?

00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:30.019
Later in the sequels we find out that Amanda
was having nightmares about Adam, and had

00:43:30.019 --> 00:43:34.019
gone back to the bathroom to put him out of
his misery by suffocating him with a plastic

00:43:34.019 --> 00:43:35.019
bag.

00:43:35.019 --> 00:43:37.920
Not much mercy for a man who technically won
the game.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.170
What makes Adam’s death even more fucked
up is that after Jigsaw left Adam to die,

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.940
he found Lawrence passed out in the hallway
from his attempt to cauterize his leg on a

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:47.339
steam pipe.

00:43:47.339 --> 00:43:51.249
Instead of finishing Lawrence off for losing
the game, he allows Lawrence to live, fits

00:43:51.249 --> 00:43:55.790
him with a prosthetic foot, and later brings
him on as an apprentice at Team Jigsaw.

00:43:55.790 --> 00:44:00.359
Then again, you can’t really expect a serial
killer to be honest and fair with you.

00:44:00.359 --> 00:44:03.900
Let’s recap the pivotal moments where a
different decision could have altered who

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.100
lived or died.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:09.390
In my opinion, Zep had the motive and the
means to single-handedly take down Jigsaw

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:10.390
and Amanda.

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:14.069
This would have saved Adam’s life, and ensured
that Lawrence didn’t end up working for

00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:15.170
Jigsaw in the future.

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:19.599
Jigsaw left a ton of leads which the detectives
should have been able to use to track him

00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:20.599
down.

00:44:20.599 --> 00:44:23.920
His voice on the cassettes, Amanda’s testimony,
the penlight, etc.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.180
Ultimately they did, but hesitated to pull
the trigger once they caught him.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:33.279
Sings death, as well as the pain and suffering
of all Jigsaw’s future victims enabled by

00:44:33.279 --> 00:44:36.160
Tapp’s pathetic failure is mindblowing.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:40.569
Razor wire guy and Hookie guy both might have
been able to escape their traps had they calmed

00:44:40.569 --> 00:44:43.839
down and thought things through a bit before
bum-rushing the traps.

00:44:43.839 --> 00:44:48.690
All said and done, I think we could have beaten
the Traps from Saw with less life and limb

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:49.690
lost.

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:53.089
Thanks for watching, and remember.. actually,
I don’t really have anything for this.

00:44:53.089 --> 00:44:56.930
If you find yourself in one of these situations
you’re probably fucked.

00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:57.960
Peace!
