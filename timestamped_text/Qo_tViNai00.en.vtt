00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.400
Detective Recapped here. Today, I'm going&nbsp;
to explain a Drama-Romance film called:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.840
"The Virgin Suicides,” which is a&nbsp;
masterclass in dehumanizing young girls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.160
After all, the two ways to dehumanize someone&nbsp;
are by dismissing them and by idolizing them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.040
This movie shows the extreme ends of&nbsp;
the spectrum through a group of teenage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.840
sisters who killed themselves one by one.&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.440
A man once asked, should I kill myself or&nbsp;
have a cup of coffee? Some believe that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.040
the question of whether or not life is worth&nbsp;
living is the most fundamental query there is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.720
But even after millennia of human existence,&nbsp;
we still don’t have a universal answer to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.880
question. And just like us, a certain ragtag&nbsp;
of boys-turned-men will never reach the truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.320
In the 1970s, a group of young boys&nbsp;
from the suburbs of Grosse Pointe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.840
Michigan, obsesses over the five beautiful Lisbon&nbsp;
sisters. After 25 years, the now-grown men recall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.680
the story of how the teenage sisters ended their&nbsp;
lives, still trying to figure out why they did it.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.080
Thirteen-year-old Cecilia first tries killing&nbsp;
herself by slitting her wrists in a bathtub.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.320
Fortunately, she is quickly found and rushed&nbsp;
to the hospital, so she manages to survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.720
Upon her recovery, the doctor says that she’s&nbsp;
not even old enough to know how bad life gets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.160
In turn, Cecilia tells him that he’s&nbsp;
obviously never been a thirteen-year-old girl.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.800
Cecilia and her other sisters, fourteen-year-old&nbsp;
Lux, fifteen-year-old Bonnie, sixteen-year-old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.960
Mary, and seventeen-year-old Therese, continue&nbsp;
to obey their strict Catholic parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.920
Their mother, Sara, is a devout housewife while&nbsp;
their father, Ronald, is a Math teacher. Everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.400
has an opinion about why Cecilia attempted to end&nbsp;
her life, but the child's motive remains unclear.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.000
People blame her parents, the new kid on the&nbsp;
block, and even the interior design of their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.080
home. During her counseling, Cecilia's doctor&nbsp;
concludes that the little girl didn't actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.840
want to take her life, but her act was a call&nbsp;
for help. Knowing the girl's parents are strict,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.240
the doctor suggests letting Cecilia interact with&nbsp;
boys her age. Everyone’s looking everywhere for an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.040
answer to Cecilia’s problem, but nobody ever tries&nbsp;
to look at Cecilia herself. When you’re a child,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.680
nobody takes you seriously. People, adults,&nbsp;
especially, prefer projecting their own views&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.600
and insecurities onto children without taking a&nbsp;
step back to understand them. And when it comes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.840
young girls, everyone is all the more dismissive&nbsp;
of them. Cecilia’s already hinted at her personal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.920
plights, yet her doctor just runs some ink blots&nbsp;
by her and assumes that what she needs is a boy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.680
It’s almost as if Cecilia can’t be a girl&nbsp;
with her own thoughts and her own humanity.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.120
One day, Mr. Lisbon invites one of&nbsp;
his students, Peter, to his house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.720
as a token of gratitude for helping him&nbsp;
set up a solar system model in class.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.720
While eating, Lux discreetly flirts with the&nbsp;
boy by playfully touching his leg with her feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.880
Once dinner is over, Mrs. Lisbon lets&nbsp;
Peter use the bathroom in Cecilia’s room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.400
There, Peter goes through the girls' stuff,&nbsp;
imagining Lux as he smells a lipstick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.440
Suddenly, Lux knocks on the door, so Peter lets&nbsp;
her in and watches her as she looks for something.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.520
Noticing Peter standing and staring, she&nbsp;
teasingly asks him to leave the bathroom. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.440
that incident, Lux has grown more brazen with&nbsp;
alluring the boys and men in the neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.760
These boys are likely more than just boys to Lux.&nbsp;
They’re new experiences, a wholly different world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.360
outside of the small one her parents keep her&nbsp;
in. And to see them so acutely enthralled by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.120
her feminine existence, which her parents try&nbsp;
hard to diminish, must be thrilling for her.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.720
Two weeks after Cecilia returns home,&nbsp;
Mr. Lisbon persuades his wife to throw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.760
a party for their girls. Tim and his&nbsp;
friends are all invited to the party,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.040
and the girls seem amused by the boys’&nbsp;
awkward and juvenile charm and humor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.200
But Cecilia doesn't seem to be having fun&nbsp;
and excuses herself from the party. It isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.960
long before everyone hears Mr. Lisbon scream,&nbsp;
and when they all check to see what happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.800
they realize that Cecilia has jumped off the&nbsp;
window and impaled herself on the iron fence.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.480
Meanwhile, the neighbors continue to gossip&nbsp;
about the Lisbons as the family gets their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.320
iron fence removed. Tim and his friends come&nbsp;
into possession of Cecilia’s diary after the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.920
plumber's assistant found it in the bathroom.&nbsp;
The boys try to analyze every page of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.760
notebook in search of anything that will help&nbsp;
them understand why Cecilia did what she did.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.120
Based on her handwriting, one of them concludes&nbsp;
that she’s a dreamer who must’ve thought that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.800
she would fly when she jumped. In one of the&nbsp;
entries, the boys read that Lux once wrote the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.040
garbage man's name all over her underwear. When&nbsp;
Mrs. Lisbon found out about it, she bleached out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.360
her daughter's undergarments and left Lux crying&nbsp;
in bed all day. After reading Cecilia's diary, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.600
boys get a glimpse into the lives of the Lisbon&nbsp;
sisters and realize the imprisonment of girlhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.200
They adopt a dreamy view of girls, and they&nbsp;
believe that girls are just women in disguise.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.360
They even conclude that these girls understood&nbsp;
life, death, and even them, but they, as boys,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.720
would never fathom these little women. It’s&nbsp;
clearer now that these boys have stripped the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.560
sisters of their humanity. To them, girls like&nbsp;
the Lisbon sisters are otherworldly creatures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.160
that they will never understand, so they don’t&nbsp;
even try. But in the end, most of what they’ve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.080
read from Cecilia’s diary entries are painfully&nbsp;
mundane. There’s no mention of her sadness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.680
of feeling distant from her parents. It’s&nbsp;
almost as if Cecilia is closer to being a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.160
faceted human being than she is the mysterious,&nbsp;
ephemeral angel the boys picture her as.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.160
After some time, a reporter named Lydia Perl&nbsp;
goes to the Lisbon residence and asks Mary and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.320
Bonnie about Cecilia, hoping to write a piece&nbsp;
about the girl. As she interviews the girls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.480
Mrs. Lisbon shows up and quickly tells her&nbsp;
to leave. However, Lydia proceeds to give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.560
a sensationalized report about Cecilia. Lydia&nbsp;
talks about what some psychologists think of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.400
kids' behaviors, saying their frustration&nbsp;
can sometimes lead to acts of violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.920
This leaves the neighbors wondering why they&nbsp;
couldn't just let the poor girl rest in peace.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.840
That night, Mr. Lisbon hallucinates and sees&nbsp;
Cecilia in her bedroom, looking towards her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.000
open window. As he closes it, Mr. Lisbon is&nbsp;
startled when Bonnie calls him. She tells him not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.320
to worry since the iron fence has already been&nbsp;
taken out. Meanwhile, Tim dreams about Cecilia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.040
sitting on his bed and watching him sleep, while&nbsp;
his other friend, Chase, sees Cecilia on a tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.440
The Lisbon girls go back to school as if nothing&nbsp;
happened, and Mr. Lisbon does the same. Due to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.120
the recent event in the neighborhood, the local&nbsp;
school has decided to hand out green pamphlets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.360
to the students, discussing the sensitive issue&nbsp;
of taking one's life. At this point, Cecilia’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.440
nothing more than a ghost and an idea for everyone&nbsp;
to mourn and yearn for. But most of all, she’s an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.080
object for everyone around her to commodify. From&nbsp;
that pushy reporter, to her school, to the boys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.280
who invade her privacy by picking at her diary,&nbsp;
Cecilia’s just a PSA, a hot topic, and an enigma.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.720
As the siblings move on with their lives,&nbsp;
more boys are starting to flock around Lux&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.720
and claim to know her and have slept with her.&nbsp;
However, the only reliable boy who has really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.520
gotten to know Lux is Trip Fontaine, the school&nbsp;
heartthrob. Trip's infatuation with Lux began when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.440
he accidentally entered her class after hiding&nbsp;
from one of his teachers. Since every girl in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.120
school has a crush on Trip, he is intrigued&nbsp;
as to why Lux doesn't find him interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.680
Twenty-five years later, Trip Fontaine talks about&nbsp;
the day he first saw Lux, saying he never got over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.920
her. It doesn’t take long for Lux to follow in&nbsp;
the footsteps of her younger sister at all. Lux,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.560
the fourteen-year-old girl, ceases to exist. She’s&nbsp;
just a beautiful idea to the boys who surround her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.480
and a prize for them to covet. After all, the only&nbsp;
reason that anyone’s paying more attention to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.640
than the rest of her sisters is because she’s&nbsp;
the one who displays the most sensual maturity.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.000
When Trip finally musters the courage to&nbsp;
ask Lux out, he decides that it's better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.080
to visit her at their house first. Mrs. Lisbon&nbsp;
sits in between Lux and Trip the whole night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.280
leaving the teens no room for&nbsp;
conversation. Lux, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.600
still manages to send a subtle sign of flirting&nbsp;
to Trip, but Mrs. Lisbon still notices it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.840
When it's finally time for Trip to go home, Lux&nbsp;
walks him to the door and bids him goodbye. Trip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.680
leaves in disappointment then sits in his car.&nbsp;
But to his surprise, Lux suddenly gets in with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.840
him. The two make out in the car passionately, and&nbsp;
when it’s time for Lux to get back into the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.680
she leaves her chewing gum inside Trip's&nbsp;
mouth. If you tighten the noose on someone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.760
they’ll only struggle more. With how strict&nbsp;
and imposing her parents are, it almost feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.520
natural for the girl to feel and act deprived&nbsp;
of a boy’s attention. But the ironic thing is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.360
Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon may as well be the ones&nbsp;
who planted the seed of longing in Lux’s heart.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.800
The next day, Trip talks to Mr. Lisbon&nbsp;
to tell him that his intentions for Lux&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.160
are entirely honorable. Confused,&nbsp;
Mr. Lisbon asks Trip what he meant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.240
and the young man says he wants to take Lux&nbsp;
to the Homecoming Dance. Surprised, Mr. Lisbon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.920
asks Trip to sit down then tells him that he and&nbsp;
his wife have certain rules for their children.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.280
And the rules that apply to the older girls&nbsp;
can't be changed for the younger ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.640
Mr. Lisbon adds that his wife won't let&nbsp;
him change the rules even if he wanted to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.120
then invites Trip to come over to their house and&nbsp;
watch TV instead. To clarify things, Mr. Lisbon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.440
tells Trip that he can't take Lux to the dance,&nbsp;
especially in a car. When Trip offers to take out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.600
all of Mr. Lisbon's daughters along with his other&nbsp;
friends and have them back home before curfew, Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.000
Lisbon tells him that he'll talk to his wife about&nbsp;
it first. Upon getting home from work, Mr. Lisbon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.840
immediately tells his wife about Trip's desire&nbsp;
to take Lux and the other girls to the dance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.920
The Lisbon girls get excited about it, but their&nbsp;
mother is clearly reluctant to let them go. Trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.760
to convince his wife, Mr. Lisbon assures her it's&nbsp;
going to be fine since he's a chaperone for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.600
dance, but Mrs. Lisbon wishes to discuss it more&nbsp;
later. The girls seem to have everything they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.360
could need in their house except for autonomy.&nbsp;
They don’t get any input about the dance, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.520
while it’s expected that they’re thrilled to go,&nbsp;
nobody even asks them what they think. As always,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.280
young girls are rarely given control over their&nbsp;
lives, and Mr. Lisbon was keener to talk things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.200
over with Trip than he was with the girls. But&nbsp;
here, it’s clear that Mr. Lisbon is more open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.960
to letting his daughters explore the world. It’s&nbsp;
Mrs. Lisbon who has her hand tight on their leash.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.520
At school the next day, Mr. Lisbon informs Trip&nbsp;
that he and his wife have decided to let him take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.360
Lux to the Homecoming Dance. During football&nbsp;
practice, Trip tells his friends he's taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.280
Lux to the dance, adding that he needs three more&nbsp;
guys to come with him to be Lux's sisters' dates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.640
The girls are ecstatic to learn that their parents&nbsp;
are letting them attend the dance, and when they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.120
finally choose their dresses, Mrs. Lisbon&nbsp;
makes sure that they look proper. Lux, Mary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.120
Bonnie, and Therese wear modified dresses that&nbsp;
almost look like sacks to conceal their figure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.880
but that doesn't stop them from being excited&nbsp;
to attend the dance with Trip and his friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.240
Mrs. Lisbon greets Trip, Parkie, Kevin, and Joe&nbsp;
when they finally arrive to pick the girls up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.200
When the girls come down from their rooms, Trip is&nbsp;
completely blown away by Lux's beauty. He and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.280
boys then put the corsage they've brought to their&nbsp;
dates' dress, and once they leave, Mrs. Lisbon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.600
immediately feels the emptiness in the house. All&nbsp;
parents are worried about their children, but Mrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.600
Lisbon is especially anxious and neurotic. This&nbsp;
is what happens when you view your daughters as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.000
little more than symbols of purity who must never&nbsp;
be tainted. Ironically, Mrs. Lisbon dehumanizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
her daughters just like the very boys she’s trying&nbsp;
to protect them against. She barely sees them as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
their own individual persons; Mrs. Lisbon just&nbsp;
sees them for the ways they can be corrupted.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.120
On their way to the dance, the girls are&nbsp;
having the time of their lives. They show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.160
that they have keen minds and sharp wits,&nbsp;
as evidenced by their different quips for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.160
their different neighbors. Lux smokes a cigarette&nbsp;
from Trip, making her sisters feel uncomfortable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.920
Bonnie warns her their father will smell it on&nbsp;
her clothes, but Lux is stubborn, saying she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.920
will just tell him that some kids were smoking in&nbsp;
the bathroom. At school, all the girls look at Lux&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.640
and Trip as they arrive together. Later, the two&nbsp;
are hailed as Homecoming King and Queen, and after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.120
they claim their crowns onstage, they join the&nbsp;
students in dancing. The Lisbon sisters are happy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.360
and they feel a semblance of freedom. Even Mr.&nbsp;
Lisbon can see this, and he’s happy for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.280
While everyone is busy, Trip persuades Lux to&nbsp;
go with him for a walk, but Lux is worried that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.360
her father will notice her absence. Determined&nbsp;
to be alone with Lux, Trip tells her to make up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.200
an excuse of going to her locker, and the&nbsp;
girl agrees. Meanwhile, Lux's sisters and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.600
Trip's friends wait for them in the car, wondering&nbsp;
where the two have gone. The boys then take Mary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.240
Bonnie, and Therese home, while Trip and Lux make&nbsp;
love in the field. When Lux wakes up the next day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.000
she is confused to learn that Trip has left&nbsp;
her there alone. It’s hardly a mystery as to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.240
why Trip just left Lux. He got what he wanted&nbsp;
from her, and the spell is now broken. Lux is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.560
no longer that unconquerable enigma to him; she’s&nbsp;
now just another one of the girls he slept with.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.360
With no other choice, Lux takes a cab home. While&nbsp;
her father asks her how she is, her mother roughly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.280
demands to know where she’s been. As a grown-up,&nbsp;
Trip recalls how he left Lux sleeping on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.800
field after they make love. He remembers&nbsp;
how he didn't care if Lux got home safely,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.560
which he finds weird since he really liked her.&nbsp;
Trip feels lucky that he was able to experience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.040
a special kind of love with Lux. Again, this only&nbsp;
reinforces how Lux is just more attractive as an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.040
idea and as a symbol of desire. Trip really&nbsp;
isn’t interested in her as a person. All he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.640
cares about is the thought of being with her&nbsp;
and romanticizing whatever they had. After all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.080
how can he fall in love with a girl he&nbsp;
hardly spoke to and left after banging?

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.760
Because of Lux's mistake, Mrs. Lisbon takes all&nbsp;
her daughters out of school and puts them in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.320
complete isolation. As if that isn't enough,&nbsp;
Mrs. Lisbon orders Lux to destroy her rock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.880
record collection. No matter how much Lux begs her&nbsp;
mother to let her keep them, Mrs. Lisbon is set on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.720
teaching her daughter a lesson. Sobbing, Lux is&nbsp;
forced to burn her vinyl records as her mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.320
watches. When she couldn't take the burning&nbsp;
smell anymore, Mrs. Lisbon throws them in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.560
trash instead. Aside from Mrs. Lisbon’s extreme&nbsp;
measure of isolating her daughters from the world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.760
she went on her little crusade to strip&nbsp;
Lux of her identity, of her hobby that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.360
has nothing to do with her femininity by&nbsp;
forcing her to burn her prized rock records.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.600
Her sisters don’t even have anything to do with&nbsp;
Lux’s mistake, yet she punished them all the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.600
No matter Mrs. Lisbon’s intentions, it’s safe to&nbsp;
assume that she has no respect for her daughters’&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.920
personal lives. Out of rebellion, Lux starts&nbsp;
the habit of hooking up with different boys and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.160
men on their roof. Unknown to her, she is being&nbsp;
watched by most of the boys in their neighborhood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.920
who love to gossip about her and pick her apart&nbsp;
once she's done with her little escapades.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.320
Mr. Lisbon, who’s been absentminded the entire&nbsp;
time, is eventually replaced as a Math teacher,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.640
giving their neighbors more things to talk about.&nbsp;
One day, when a tree-cutting company shows up at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.160
the Lisbons' lawn to cut down their elm tree,&nbsp;
the four sisters decide that they won't allow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.440
it since Cecilia loved that tree. As one of the&nbsp;
workers insists that the tree is dead, Lux, Mary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.960
Bonnie, and Therese hold hands and surround the&nbsp;
tree, saying that they should just leave it up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.120
to nature. Frustrated, the worker talks to Mr.&nbsp;
and Mrs. Lisbon and explains to them that if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.720
they don't cut down their sick elm tree, then the&nbsp;
other trees in the neighborhood will start dying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.560
too. He even threatens to call the cops if the&nbsp;
girls don't move, but the couple insists that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.320
the girls are simply standing on their own&nbsp;
front lawn. As they argue, the local media&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.800
shows up to report on what's happening. Lydia's&nbsp;
back to exploit the situation for TV again, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.120
she rushes her crew to get footage of the girls in&nbsp;
their nighties. She sensationalizes the situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.880
painting the girls as the tragic salvagers of&nbsp;
their late sisters' loving memory. In the end,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.760
the elm tree is finally cut down. This just goes&nbsp;
to show that the objectification, commodification,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.960
romanticization, and all that fun&nbsp;
-ations never end for these girls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.880
The boys spend so much of their free time making&nbsp;
a feist out of Lux’s promiscuity. The neighbors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.640
treat the family as nothing more than lunchtime&nbsp;
gossip. The media doesn’t hesitate to make a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.080
story out of the sisters without even talking&nbsp;
to them. Everyone has a voice in the sisters’&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.160
lives but the sisters themselves. The sad thing&nbsp;
is, the girls have it in them to stand up to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.520
cutting company to protect a dying tree,&nbsp;
but no one ever stepped in to help them.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.080
As time passes by, the Lisbon sisters remain in&nbsp;
isolation. The neighborhood boys barely see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.600
sisters, and the girls never talked to their&nbsp;
homecoming dates again. The girls then start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.880
ordering brochures for exotic vacations so&nbsp;
that they could travel even if just in their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.960
imaginations. To feel closer to them, Tim&nbsp;
and his friends order the same brochures,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.480
too, visualizing that they're with the Lisbon&nbsp;
sisters as they go to different places.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.160
To cope with their sadness, the girls begin&nbsp;
to send out notes to the boys, asking them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.840
for help. When Tim and his friends finally&nbsp;
decide to contact the girls through the phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.600
he gives them his number before quickly ending&nbsp;
the call. The Lisbon sisters are quick to call the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.440
boys back, but instead of talking to each other,&nbsp;
they would just play some music for all of them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.760
listen to. The brochure reading, the music playing&nbsp;
over the telephone—these are the only things the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.440
girls could do to stay sane in their maddening&nbsp;
and heartbreaking situation. But to the boys,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.800
these little activities are just a small part&nbsp;
of their day; they’re just trivial things to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.240
do so they can pretend that they’re closer to&nbsp;
the girls. And at the end of the day, they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.600
go around doing whatever they please because&nbsp;
they’re free to live life the way they want.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.480
One night, the sisters talk to their&nbsp;
mother and tell her how they feel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.880
saying that they're suffocating. Unmoved, Mrs.&nbsp;
Lisbon insists they're safe there. The next day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.720
the sisters send out another letter to Tim, asking&nbsp;
him to meet them once he and his friends see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.800
sisters' signal. As Tim and the other boys wait&nbsp;
from a house across the street, the Lisbon sisters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.040
finally signal them to come over to their place.&nbsp;
Clearly, the girls are planning to do something in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.800
retaliation for their mother's refusal to hear&nbsp;
them out. If only Mrs. Lisbon listened to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.040
daughters, they'd be able to resolve their problem&nbsp;
in a better way. Unfortunately, Mrs. Lisbon has no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.560
idea that her stubbornness is about to lead to a&nbsp;
tragedy that she and her husband will have to live&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.040
with forever. Excited, the boys sneak out to the&nbsp;
Lisbon residence, where they find Lux smoking in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.200
the living room. Lux opens the door for them, and&nbsp;
Tim informs her that they have a car and they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.680
go wherever they want to. Worried that they might&nbsp;
get caught, Tim asks Lux where her parents are,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.120
and Lux assures him they're asleep. Chase then&nbsp;
tells her that they need to go since it's getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.720
late, but Lux wants to wait for a few more minutes&nbsp;
until they're sure her parents won't be coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.960
down. Lux suggests they use their family car since&nbsp;
it's bigger, and when Lux finally lets them in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.400
she tells the boys to wait for her sisters in the&nbsp;
living room while she waits for them in the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.720
Inside the house, the boys hear a sound from the&nbsp;
basement, so they decide to check it out. There,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.320
they are horrified to see one of the sisters&nbsp;
hanging from the ceiling, so they immediately run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.400
back upstairs and stumble upon another sister's&nbsp;
body on the floor. The boys leave the house in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.560
a haste, never looking back again. The sisters'&nbsp;
bodies are taken away the next day, and the boys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.320
believe that Bonnie hanged herself while they were&nbsp;
waiting in the living room. Meanwhile, Mary put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.720
her head in the oven while Therese overdosed on&nbsp;
sleeping pills. The last of the sisters, Lux, has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.120
taken her life by carbon monoxide poisoning. The&nbsp;
methods the girls used to kill themselves largely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.640
had to do with asphyxiation. This may have been&nbsp;
their way of showing their parents and the boys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.640
how they were suffocating, how the confined world&nbsp;
that gave them no autonomy was stifling to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.960
But in the end, this is just speculation. No one&nbsp;
will ever know the why. All that the world can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.640
be sure of is that the girls were tragic, and the&nbsp;
Lisbon couple failed to protect their daughters.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.440
Different media outlets cover the sad story of the&nbsp;
Lisbon sisters. As Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon skip town&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.200
to avoid all the gossip about them, Mrs. Lisbon&nbsp;
insists that none of her daughters lacked any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.040
love. While the Lisbons have someone to sell their&nbsp;
house and furniture, Tim and his friends take some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.800
of the Lisbon family photos that were thrown out,&nbsp;
along with the other belongings of the girls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.080
They want to figure out where things started&nbsp;
going wrong for the family, but no matter how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.800
hard they try, gaps remained, and more questions&nbsp;
are formed. As the adults go back to their lives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.240
pretending as if nothing horrible has happened in&nbsp;
their neighborhood, Tim and his friends attempt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:49.120
to forget the Lisbon sisters. However, they&nbsp;
remain haunted by their memories. After 25 years,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.600
Tim and his friends, who are now middle-aged men,&nbsp;
ruminate about how they never found an answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.280
But to them, it never really mattered how old the&nbsp;
sisters had been or that they were girls. What&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.560
mattered was that they loved the Lisbons and that&nbsp;
they hadn't heard the boys calling out to them.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.400
Though the Virgin Suicides is supposed to tell&nbsp;
the story of these five girls, the story is told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.480
by boys who never understood them, boys who never&nbsp;
truly tried to understand them, and boys who kept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.400
trying to make the story about themselves. Even&nbsp;
the very title of the film reduces these sisters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.080
to their own novelties as if their chastity and&nbsp;
their self-appointed deaths are what define them.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.280
The boys keep trying to piece their puzzle&nbsp;
together, but they never once stopped to look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.440
at these girls as human beings. They never even&nbsp;
questioned why Mrs. Lisbon was the way she was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.840
and why Mr. Lisbon was powerless to stop his wife&nbsp;
from confining his daughters. It’s as if the boys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.840
accepted the situation with a sense of normalcy.&nbsp;
Or maybe they never truly cared about the girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.680
themselves like they deluded themselves into&nbsp;
thinking. After all, there’s a reason why they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.000
had the most to say about Lux; she was the most&nbsp;
promiscuous of the sisters. She was the easiest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.360
to objectify, to fixate over, and to thirst&nbsp;
over. The boys—now men—even said it themselves:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.000
who the Lisbons were never mattered. What mattered&nbsp;
was that they were the object of their desires.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.240
From the beginning up until the very&nbsp;
end, Cecilia, Lux, Bonnie, Mary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.080
and Therese were all dehumanized for no reason&nbsp;
beyond their girlhood. Their mother dismissed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.600
their autonomy and their individual selves and&nbsp;
instead saw them as vessels of innocence who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.280
must never be corrupted, and the boys saw&nbsp;
them as something divine and otherworldly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.280
From Cecilia’s diary, the boys concluded that&nbsp;
girls were profound and mystical creatures even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.040
though her diary entries were mundane. They filled&nbsp;
in the gaps themselves to keep their romanticized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.960
views of the girls’ beings. Going back to Lux,&nbsp;
why did Trip leave her vulnerable and alone on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.040
the football field? Likely, it was because he&nbsp;
cracked at the angelic mystique of Lux Lisbon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.880
and when she slept with him, he caught a&nbsp;
glimpse of what she was: a human. Just human.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.000
And because the boys kept ignoring just&nbsp;
what the girls were, they became deaf to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.680
their cries. It wasn’t the girls who didn’t hear&nbsp;
the boys calling out to them. It was the boys,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.280
the parents, the neighbors—it was everyone who&nbsp;
failed to hear the girls calling out to them.
