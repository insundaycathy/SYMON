00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.460
A year after&nbsp;Otto Octavius' demise, Peter
Parker&nbsp;plans to propose to&nbsp;Mary Jane Watson,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.610
who has just made her&nbsp;Broadway musical&nbsp;debut.
While the two stargaze in&nbsp;Central Park, a

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.669
meteorite lands nearby, and an extraterrestrial&nbsp;symbiote&nbsp;follows
Peter to his apartment by attaching to his&nbsp;moped.&nbsp;Harry

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:35.360
Osborn, knowing Peter's true identity, seeks
to avenge his father&nbsp;Norman's death. Using

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.290
his father's performance-enhancing gas and&nbsp;Green
Goblin&nbsp;technology, he battles Peter to a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:02:31.459
stalemate, developing partial&nbsp;amnesia. Meanwhile,
police pursue escaped convict&nbsp;Flint Marko,

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:38.540
who visits his wife and sick daughter before
fleeing again. Falling into an experimental&nbsp;particle

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.840
accelerator&nbsp;that fuses his body with the
surrounding sand, he gains the ability to

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:52.560
control sand and reform his body with it.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.340
During a festival, honoring Spider-Man for
saving Gwen Stacy's life, Peter kisses her

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:05.620
to please the crowd, angering Mary Jane. Simultaneously,
Marko robs an armored truck and escapes after

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:46.700
easily defeating Spider-Man.&nbsp;NYPD&nbsp;Captain&nbsp;George
Stacy, Gwen's father, informs Peter and his&nbsp;aunt

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.400
May&nbsp;that Marko is&nbsp;uncle Ben's true killer;
the initial suspect, the deceased&nbsp;Dennis

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:59.409
Carradine, was Marko's accomplice. At his
apartment, as Peter sleeps in his Spider-Man

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.510
suit while waiting for Marko to come out of
hiding, the symbiote assimilates the suit.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.230
Peter later awakens atop of a building, discovering
that the symbiote has colored his suit black

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.459
and enhanced his powers; however, it also
brings out the dark side of his personality.

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:42.040
Spider-Man locates and battles Marko in a
subway tunnel. Discovering that water is Marko's

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:56.780
weakness, he opens a pipe, releasing water
that reduces Marko to mud and washes him away.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.080
Peter's changed comportment alienates Mary
Jane, who is struggling in her career because

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.139
of her show receiving negative reviews from
critics. She shares a tender moment with Harry

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:13.160
but leaves in regret. Urged by a hallucination
of his father, Harry&nbsp;recovers from his amnesia&nbsp;and

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.850
forces Mary Jane to break up with Peter. After
Mary Jane tells Peter she loves "somebody

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:28.740
else", Harry meets with Peter and claims to
be that person. Under the influence of the

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.771
symbiote, Peter later confronts Harry over
this and spitefully tells him that his father

00:05:32.771 --> 00:06:46.610
never loved him. Another battle ensues, with
Harry throwing a pumpkin bomb at Peter, who

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:52.940
deflects it back, disfiguring Harry's face.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:59.120
At the&nbsp;Daily Bugle, Peter exposes rival photographer&nbsp;Eddie
Brock, whose fake photos depict Spider-Man

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:13.620
as a criminal. Publisher&nbsp;J. Jonah Jameson&nbsp;fires
Brock and promotes Peter to staff photographer.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:28.030
Later, Peter brings Gwen to a jazz club, where
Mary Jane now works. Peter interrupts Mary

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.280
Jane's performance and he passionately dances
with Gwen in front of her, in order to make

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:42.050
her jealous. Gwen, realizing this, apologizes
to Mary Jane and leaves. After assaulting

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.870
the bouncers and accidentally hitting Mary
Jane, Peter finally realizes that the symbiote

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:53.240
is corrupting him. Retreating to a church's
bell tower, and realizing the high-pitched

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.680
sounds of clanging metal weaken the creature,
Peter removes the symbiote. However, Brock

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.370
follows him and becomes the symbiote's new
host.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:09.280
As&nbsp;Venom, Brock, having deduced that Peter
is in fact Spider-Man, locates a still-living

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:16.530
Marko and convinces him to join forces to
kill Spider-Man. Brock abducts Mary Jane and

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:23.350
holds her captive from a web high at a construction
site. After Harry refuses to help Peter, he

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:27.569
finally learns the truth about Norman's death
from his butler, who engourages him to go

00:08:27.569 --> 00:08:34.490
and help them. While Brock and Marko pin Peter
down, Harry arrives with his Green Goblin

00:08:34.490 --> 00:09:51.810
technology to help Peter and save Mary Jane.
Thereafter, Brock attempts to perforate Peter

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:59.579
with Harry's&nbsp;glider, but Harry jumps in and
is impaled himself. Peter, remembering the

00:09:59.579 --> 00:10:04.140
symbiote's weakness, assembles a perimeter
of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:13.230
it and allowing Peter to separate Brock from
the symbiote.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:18.320
Peter activates a pumpkin bomb from Harry's
glider and throws it at the symbiote. Brock,

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.940
having become addicted to its influence, attempts
to save the symbiote, and ends up vaporized

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:29.610
along with it. Afterward, Marko explains that
Ben's death was an accident that has haunted

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:34.140
him ever since, justifying that all his robberies
were intended to collect enough money to pay

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:41.329
for his daughter's surgery; Peter forgives
Marko, allowing him to escape. Harry and Peter

00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:46.410
reconcile before the former dies from his
injuries. Sometime after Harry's funeral,

00:10:46.410 --> 00:11:00.540
Peter visits Mary Jane at the jazz club where
she works. They embrace and share a dance.
