00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.450
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today, I’m going
to explain an American science fiction called

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.268
“knowing”. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take
care.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.539
In 1959, a small girl, a recluse called Lucinda
is in school. It’s play time... but she

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.989
is away from the other kids...with voices
whispering around her. Their teacher, Miss

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:29.460
Taylor comes to call off the play break. She
had to call Lucinda separately because she

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.390
wouldn’t budge.
Next, the teacher is in front of the class,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.590
she reminds them that tomorrow is the school’s
official opening day. She tells them that

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.990
the school celebrates its opening with a competition...in
which students draw a picture of what they

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.220
believe will happen in the future. The children
are excited and begin different things; except

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.490
for Lucinda Embry, who is guided by whispering
voices to fill her paper with a series of

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.511
numbers. Before she can write the final numbers,
the allotted time for the task expires, and

00:00:56.511 --> 00:01:00.920
Miss Taylor collects the students' drawings.
The works are stored in a time capsule to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.070
be opened 50 years later.
The next day, on the opening of William Dawes

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.240
Elementary School, the principal welcomes
everyone and announces the burial of the time

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.420
capsule. Fifty years from now their descendants
will dig this time capsule up… After the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.400
time capsule was buried, Miss Taylor notices
that Lucinda has gone from where she was.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.110
The staffs begin calling her name; looking
for her within the school. Miss Taylor goes

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.090
down a staircase and hears some noise behind
a door. On opening the door, she finds frightened

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.130
Lucinda with blood on her hands. She had written
some things on the door WITH HER FINGERS.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.229
This is the remaining numbers that she hasn’t
finished writing the day before. She looks

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.317
very scared, and asks the teacher to make
the whispers stop.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.640
Fast forward to fifty years later, the movie's
present day.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.600
An astrophysicist, John, finds it difficult
to control his depression after losing his

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.830
wife. He has trouble believing that there's
meaning in life after his wife has died in

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.818
a fire accident. He also has a son, Caleb,
who also struggles to move on.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.170
The next morning, at Caleb’s school, the
current principal announces the unveiling

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.560
of the 50-year-old legacy, the time capsule,
that was buried 50 years ago. She calls on

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.420
old Miss Taylor, the same teacher from 50
years ago, to do the honours. The capsule

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.480
is opened and the children each receive an
envelope. Caleb receives the letter from Lucinda,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.900
and opens to find numbers on the paper instead
of drawing like everyone else. While staring

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.349
at the paper, he begins hearing whispers from
everywhere, and notices a figure standing

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.840
far away from the school; but it’s gone
when he checks again.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.170
At home, Caleb tries to ask permission to
go to a friend’s place for a sleepover.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.630
While talking, his dad notices the paper from
the school and queries him about it, he wasn’t

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.760
supposed to bring it home.
Once John puts Caleb to bed, he starts to

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.200
get curious about the list of numbers himself. He accidentally

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.460
puts a whiskey glass on top of it, and it
makes a circle around specific numbers. He

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.430
puts a set of numbers on a whiteboard and
he quickly realizes that this means September 11 2001...of

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.959
course being the attack on the Twin Towers
in New York City which killed 2996 people,

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.629
lining up perfectly with these numbers. Certain
that this is just a coincidence, he puts all

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.140
the numbers on the whiteboard and investigates
further. He figures out that the list is full

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.800
of similar things. Dates, years, and lives
lost at specific tragic events such as explosions,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.770
crashes, earthquakes, hurricanes, etc. These
are all listed in the order that they would

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.239
have happened since 1959. He uses red circle
for the date of the tragedy and blue for the

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.160
death count. But there are some uncircled
numbers that he can't quite figure out what

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.010
they mean.
So the next day, John talks to a colleague,

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.130
Phil, about the numbers on the paper. He explains
that every set of numbers matches a major

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.459
disaster in date and lives lost; and the predictions
of the numbers have been consistent, even

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.640
the date his wife died was also there. John
tells him there are three sets of numbers

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.810
that hasn’t happened yet, and one of them
showing...81 people would die somewhere tomorrow.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.680
Phil refuses to believe because it’s too
crazy to be true and thinks that the numbers

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.269
are just coincidences, as there are also uncircled
numbers on the paper that apparently has no

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.390
meaning. He suspects that someone may be playing
a joke on John.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.819
John begins to search for more details. He
goes to Miss Taylor, who was Lucinda’s school

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.620
teacher back in 1959...when the time capsule
was buried. He wants to verify the authenticity

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.360
of the letter. Miss Taylor confirms that this
is the original, and tells John about Lucinda

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.540
scratching on the door after the burial of
the capsule, and the weird circumstances surrounding

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.669
it. John expresses his desire to meet Lucinda,
but it turns out that Lucinda had passed away

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.020
due to a drug overdose several years ago.
At home while trying to get some contacts

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.810
over the phone, he sees a couple of strange
men pull up to the yard in a car. Caleb goes

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.330
up to the car ,and the strange men give caleb
a rock without actually saying anything to

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.510
him...which of course freaks John out. He
reminds him to stay away from strangers and

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.320
sends him inside the house.
While searching through the net about Lucinda's

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.210
death, his sister, Grace, startles him. Grace
wants John to visit his family because he

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.610
hasn't talked to his father for a very long
time. But he refuses. John has a difficult

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.720
relationship with his parents due to them
being extremely religious and John is an atheist.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.491
The next day, on his way to pick Caleb up
from school, John is stuck in traffic. He

00:05:17.491 --> 00:05:22.600
tries to reroute but no alternative route.
Looking at the coordinates on his GPS, he

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.470
realises that the uncircled numbers he couldn’t
figure out on the list earlier.... are in

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.680
fact coordinates of all the locations where
the tragedies will happen, and he is exactly

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.460
at that location. He leaves his car to find
out why the road is blocked. While talking

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.130
to the police, the prediction happened; an
aeroplane falls to the ground, several people

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.400
burn and die while he tries to help.
He goes back home while still having trouble

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.800
believing what just happened. John goes online
to search about the accident only to find

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.229
the report stating that 81 people have died
At night, a strange man walks into Caleb's

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:59.240
room. Caleb wakes up and the stranger shows
him a revelation of everything being destroyed,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.100
while the animals are running for their lives.
Caleb screams. His father runs into the room

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.930
and carries him from the floor. John sees
a strange man through the window while holding

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.440
him up ,and runs out looking for him; but
he’s gone.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.120
The next morning, John and his son trail a
woman and her daughter to the museum. At the

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.880
museum, he meets the woman and they introduce
themselves. She’s Diana, Lucinda's daughter.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.870
John later explained to her that he followed
her to ask about her mother. Diana becomes

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.419
upset at the mentioning of Lucinda. John explained
that Lucinda’s prediction had come true

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:35.020
and only two remaining...and the last one
will happen 3 days later, on October 19th

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:41.280
and 33 people will die. He needs her help.
However, Diana leaves with her daughter, Abby,

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.770
saying she can not help him.
At home, there is news of a possible terrorist

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.200
attacks. John searches the location of the
next disaster using the GPS coordinates. He

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.880
finds the location, a subway station, and
tries to warn the police.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.840
John goes all the way to the subway station
and chases a guy he thinks is a terrorist

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.870
into the train. The police follows them. They
discover that the guy is just a petty CD thief.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.759
The train sets to move but they see a derailed
train heading towards them and there’s chaos

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:14.550
as everyone tries to escape. The train kills
a lot of people fitting the prediction once

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.800
again.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.750
The next scene shows the survivors including

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.570
John coming out of the debris, and the police
and fire department trying to help.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.199
Returning home, he is surprised to see Diana
and her daughter waiting for him. She proceeds

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:31.520
to tell John that the last disaster left on
the list is on October 19th, the same day

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.729
Lucinda said she's supposed to die. Diana
didn't want to talk with him about it in the

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:39.900
first place because she hated the idea of
knowing when one would die

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.090
Diana decides to bring John to Lucinda’s
former home, an old abandoned building where

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.610
her mother used to hide from everyone around
her. As they pull up, they realize that the

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:53.849
last numbers on the list which followed the
date October 19th weren't the numbers 33,

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:57.580
but the backwards letters of E E which they
think are the initials of a name.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:02.319
At the house, John searches Lucinda's bedroom,
where they found out that “EE” in the

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:06.840
last prediction means everyone will die. He
also finds many of those black stones in the

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:12.130
house, like the one Caleb received.
Outside, Caleb and Abby are in the car waiting

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.930
for them to return, they both start to hear
whispers and see those strange figures. The

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:22.069
whispers call on them to come. Poor Abby almost
got taken but Caleb uses the car horn to call

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:27.330
attention. John and Diana run to them but
the strangers were gone. John sites one of

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:32.209
them and runs after them. Finally catching
up to the man, he asks what he wants but the

00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:36.829
man opens his mouth and huge bright light
comes from it and he disappears.

00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:40.300
They return to John's house and can’t
believe her mother predicted the death of

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.969
everyone tomorrow and this could be their
last night together.

00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:46.480
The next morning, John wakes up seeing Abby's
drawing

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.360
Suddenly, he realizes that the final disaster
may have something to do with the sun

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.170
John finds that the last prediction,
which is tomorrow, was in tandem with a research

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:00.540
he had done about super flares from the sun
hitting the rest of the solar system and destroying

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.739
everything.
He quickly goes to the observatory and checks

00:09:03.739 --> 00:09:08.540
on the recent readings of the sun... which
shows abnormal levels of solar radiation.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:13.040
He thinks that a large solar flare may occur
very soon, and that may be the cause of humanity's

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.689
destruction

00:09:14.689 --> 00:09:16.769
Back at John's house, they prepare to go hide

00:09:16.769 --> 00:09:21.920
in an underground cave where Diana used to
play as a child. It’s time to go. He goes

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.759
to call Caleb, but finds him at his desk writing
a similar list that Lucinda did. From what

00:09:26.759 --> 00:09:30.689
Caleb was writing, he gets the sense that
Lucinda's writing on the door fifty years

00:09:30.689 --> 00:09:35.319
ago was fundamental to the last prediction,
so they go back to the school. He removes

00:09:35.319 --> 00:09:40.459
the particular door, takes it home and begins
to unveil the writing. Diana is impatient

00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:44.459
and wants to get to the caves before doom
comes, so she steals the kids and drives to

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:49.249
the caves. Jon finally gets the numbers from
the door, and he assumes this is the coordinate

00:09:49.249 --> 00:09:53.489
where they can survive this disaster...but
when he comes out, everyone has gone which

00:09:53.489 --> 00:09:58.930
prompts him to chase them from behind. Diana
stops at a gas station. At the station, she

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:03.119
watches the government announce that there’s
trouble coming and everyone should take shelter,

00:10:03.119 --> 00:10:07.379
preferably underground. Diana goes to call
John to tell him where they are

00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:10.030
Jon tells her that the "safe haven" might
be at Lucinda’s old

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:14.239
home according to the coordinates, but she’s
scared and refuses to go there.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:18.949
While still on the phone, the strangers steal
her car with the kids inside. She also steals

00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:23.850
a car ,and tries to follow them...but runs
into a half truck. She breaks her neck, and

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:29.540
later dies in front of Jon...at exactly twelve
midnight according to her mother’s prediction.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.170
Jon drives to Lucinda's abandoned home,and
follows a car-ridden path into the bush. He

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:39.129
finds many of those black stones there. Finally,
he sees one of the strange men and threatens

00:10:39.129 --> 00:10:42.259
to shoot.
Caleb stops him and tells his father that

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:45.749
the strangers have been protecting them this
whole time, and that they must go with them

00:10:45.749 --> 00:10:49.980
in order to be saved. It turns out that they
were the ones who sent the messages about

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.480
the major disasters trying to save humanity
from being completely destroyed. They then

00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:00.369
reveal an ark up in the sky. Jon is astonished.
It’s time to go... but the strangers will

00:11:00.369 --> 00:11:06.059
only allow the children go with them. Only
the chosen must go. Caleb cries. Caleb and

00:11:06.059 --> 00:11:12.769
his father say their last goodbyes. And the
men turn to shining bodies, and the ark leaves.

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:17.299
Up in the sky, many of such ark had come to
several other places on earth, they are also

00:11:17.299 --> 00:11:22.610
leaving. Jon wakes up in the morning on that
ground. He navigates the now rowdy city to

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:28.319
his family house. His sister meets him with
a hug and he tells her...Caleb is safe. He

00:11:28.319 --> 00:11:32.360
enters the house and hugs his father, then
his mother, and his sister joins for a group

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:38.119
hug. The sun flare starts to destroy everything,
and takes them too in their group hug. As

00:11:38.119 --> 00:11:42.829
the movie ends, the ark drops the children
at different places and goes away. Caleb and

00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:46.060
Abby run through the field towards a huge
tree.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.790
Now, for the explanation.
At the end of the movie, the beings who have

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:55.089
been whispering into Lucinda’s and Caleb's
ears finally reveal themselves as a more evolved

00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:59.750
alien race, who have been selecting few humans
and animals to save from the imminent destruction

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.519
of the planet.
Since there were other spaceships leaving

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:06.550
the earth, it’s possible that these humanoids
whispered the same messages to other people

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:10.759
around the world.
So, why were only the children taken? Aren't

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:14.920
children too young to take care of themselves?
We can assume that the other children were

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.410
children with various types of knowledge and
skills. Maybe the whisper people chose some

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:23.600
specific children who would be great at working
together. They took children because they

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.999
wanted a fresh start. Adults would just go
to the new planet and try to recreate what

00:12:27.999 --> 00:12:32.939
they had on earth and end up destroying the
planet. Children are more of a blank canvas,

00:12:32.939 --> 00:12:36.819
and will have a more open-mind as they grow
older...and learn to understand why the aliens

00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:41.860
do this. It's also entirely possible the aliens
don't simply leave the children there to fend

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.179
for themselves, it's possible they stay in
the skies and observe, and then come down

00:12:46.179 --> 00:12:49.139
to the planet to teach the kids how to build
and how to survive.

00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:54.029
That’s my explanation for the movie.
