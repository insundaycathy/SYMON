00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.080
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain a drama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.960
horror, mystery film called "The Rental."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.240
In their office, Charlie and his business&nbsp;
partner, Mina, browse images of a seaside house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.360
planning a weekend retreat to celebrate closing&nbsp;
a deal. Charlie's brother and Mina's boyfriend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.400
Josh, walk in to pick up Mina. They share their&nbsp;
plans for the weekend with Josh, who agrees.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.640
At their house, Charlie discusses&nbsp;
the trip with his wife, Michelle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.960
Michelle comments on Mina's good effect on Josh,&nbsp;
who seemed to have given up on life before meeting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.320
her. Charlie doesn't trust Josh, however, listing&nbsp;
down his brother's misbehaviors in the past.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.240
That weekend, Charlie picks up Mina and Josh,&nbsp;
arguing that they shouldn't bring their dog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.200
Reggie, to the trip, but they insist. During&nbsp;
the drive, they discuss why the renter denied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.240
Mina's rental request but accepts Charlie's. Josh&nbsp;
believes that the renter is a bigot, given that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.880
Mina is of Middle-Eastern descent, but Charlie&nbsp;
insists on giving the benefit of the doubt.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.440
The group arrives at the&nbsp;
house and meets the caretaker,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.720
Taylor. Mina asks if he's the owner, but&nbsp;
her tone offends Taylor. He corrects her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.480
that it's his brother's house then asks Mina&nbsp;
how she got involved in Charlie's family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.280
Mina is offended by the question and starts to&nbsp;
think twice about giving her money to Taylor.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.440
Taylor gives the group a tour of&nbsp;
the house. The group is amazed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.600
both the house and the ocean view. When&nbsp;
Taylor talks about the stars at night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.840
Michelle laments that she didn't bring her&nbsp;
telescope. Taylor jokes that a telescope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.280
in the city is meant for peeping, then&nbsp;
offers to let them borrow his instead.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.320
Before Taylor leaves, Mina confronts him about&nbsp;
being denied when she tried to rent the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.840
Taylor becomes defensive and&nbsp;
refuses to answer her questions.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.520
As Charlie and Michelle unpack&nbsp;
the groceries in the kitchen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.080
Taylor peeks into the kitchen&nbsp;
window before driving away.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.800
While setting up her clothes in the bedroom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.680
Michelle notices dirt on the&nbsp;
sheets that she sweeps off.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.400
Josh plays with Reggie outside but tosses&nbsp;
the ball too far. He goes under the house's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.760
deck to retrieve a ball and notices a&nbsp;
basement entrance with a keypad lock.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.000
While walking by the beach, Michelle&nbsp;
and Josh talk about their partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.320
Josh admits that he's afraid of losing&nbsp;
Mina since he can't keep up with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.360
Michelle assures him that all&nbsp;
he needs is to support Mina.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.960
At dusk, the group returns home&nbsp;
to find Taylor's telescope.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.560
Mina worries that Taylor can come into the&nbsp;
house as he pleases while they're staying there.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.800
During dinner, Josh, Charlie, and Mina take molly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.760
but Michelle doesn't join, wanting to sleep&nbsp;
early. After getting into a fight with Charlie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.920
Josh leaves. When Mina checks on him,&nbsp;
he's already asleep on the couch.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.280
Mina goes back outside, seeing Charlie open the&nbsp;
hot tub. She and Charlie get in the hot tub,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.120
toasting their outstanding&nbsp;
partnership and careers. Intoxicated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.520
they kiss but are interrupted by Reggie's&nbsp;
barking and whining. Feeling awkward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.160
Mina decides to go to bed. Unbeknownst&nbsp;
to them, someone watches them from afar.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.480
Mina takes a shower, thinking about the kiss. The&nbsp;
bathroom door opens, and she sees Charlie walk in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.160
The two continue their&nbsp;
passionate night in the shower.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.760
On the following day, Josh and&nbsp;
Michelle are excited about their hike,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.600
but Mina and Charlie are too hungover&nbsp;
to go with them. Once they're alone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.880
Mina and Charlie decide they can't&nbsp;
repeat what happened the last night.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.840
While on the hike, Michelle reveals to Josh that&nbsp;
Charlie already had a girlfriend when she met him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.160
Josh isn't surprised, knowing that Charlie&nbsp;
had cheated on previous girlfriends before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.920
This bothers Michelle.
Meanwhile, in the woods,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.360
a person is following the two.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.480
Back at the house, Mina takes a shower&nbsp;
and notices something on the showerhead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.200
Charlie confirms that it's a camera, and there's&nbsp;
also one in the shower where they spent the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.800
Charlie thinks twice about reporting it,&nbsp;
knowing that the camera caught them cheating.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.680
They discuss their options, but Michelle&nbsp;
and Josh arrive before they can make a plan.&nbsp;

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.360
They decide to pretend that nothing&nbsp;
happened. Charlie greets his wife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.680
but Michelle ignores him. He follows her&nbsp;
to their bedroom, where Michelle asks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.320
about his past girlfriends, accusing him of&nbsp;
having a cheating pattern. Charlie realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.640
that Josh told her and defends that he doesn't&nbsp;
remember the details of his past relationships.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.480
Back in the living room, Charlie&nbsp;
smacks Josh before taking a seat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.360
Michelle invites them to take molly again, but&nbsp;
the others are tired from the previous night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.320
Michelle gets pissed and takes&nbsp;
recreational pills by herself.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.840
Later that day, Josh prepares food for his&nbsp;
dog, but Mina forgot to take Reggie inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.440
They head out and find Reggie is missing. Mina,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.800
Charlie, and Josh try to find Reggie&nbsp;
but give up when nighttime comes.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.680
They arrive back at the house, where Michelle&nbsp;
tells them she called Taylor to fix the broken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.960
hot tub. Charlie and Mina are bothered by&nbsp;
this. Josh wonders if Taylor took his dog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.320
planning to confront him about it.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.880
A drunk Taylor finally arrives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.760
and Josh immediately starts asking him questions&nbsp;
about his dog, but Taylor denies taking Reggie.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.200
Out on the deck, Taylor successfully fixes&nbsp;
the hot tub. He goes out of the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.920
seeing Mina searching for Reggie. Taylor assures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.280
her that he won't report to his brother&nbsp;
that they brought a dog in the house.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.560
Pissed, Mina takes him to the&nbsp;
shower and shows him the camera,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.120
threatening to call the cops. Taylor claims he&nbsp;
doesn't know about it, but Mina doesn't believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.080
him. Thinking it's a scam, Taylor starts calling&nbsp;
the police, and Mina tries to take his phone away.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.760
Hearing the commotion from&nbsp;
outside, Josh rushes in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.960
Seeing Mina in trouble, he tackles Taylor into the&nbsp;
tub and beats him. Charlie and Michelle hear the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.600
fight and run back inside. Charlie pulls his&nbsp;
brother off of Taylor, who's now unconscious.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.680
Outside, Mina finally confesses&nbsp;
about the camera in the shower&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.920
but doesn't mention her night with Charlie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.400
She tells them how she confronted Taylor and&nbsp;
panicked, which led to Josh beating the caretaker.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.680
Somewhere in the dark, an unknown person&nbsp;
watches their conversation through a cell phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.360
With the group outside, the person goes&nbsp;
into the house and suffocates Taylor.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.240
The group argues on what to do. Josh&nbsp;
and Michelle want to call the police,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.960
despite Charlie's warnings that Josh might get&nbsp;
in trouble. Michelle goes in to make the call,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.320
but Charlie stops her, reporting&nbsp;
that Taylor is no longer breathing.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.360
Josh is terrified, thinking that he caused&nbsp;
it. Michelle still feels that they should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.840
go to the police, but Charlie and Mina want&nbsp;
to protect Josh. Charlie plots to stage an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.880
accident and destroy the footage from the hidden&nbsp;
camera. Michelle is horrified and storms off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.160
not wanting to go with their plan.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.360
Charlie, Mina, and Josh clean up the&nbsp;
evidence and take Taylor's body away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.760
Before leaving, Charlie checks on Michelle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.200
who tells him that they'll be compromised&nbsp;
as well by not reporting what happened.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.560
The three throw Taylor's body down a cliff,&nbsp;
but it lands on a rock instead of the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.840
Not wanting to risk getting caught, Josh&nbsp;
climbs down to push it into the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.160
He slips and falls on top of the body,&nbsp;
allowing him to push it into the water.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.840
Back at the house, Michelle is packing up but&nbsp;
hears a shower turn on. She checks the bathrooms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.080
but all of the showers are turned off. She&nbsp;
follows the sound and finds a television&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.520
that shows Mina and Charlie's activity&nbsp;
in the shower from the previous night.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.280
Mina, Charlie, and Josh walk back to the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.520
not noticing a masked man walking behind&nbsp;
them. They see Michelle driving off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.280
and Charlie chases her. She stops to tell him&nbsp;
that she saw the footage. Charlie is exasperated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.320
apologizing to her. When he asks where he found&nbsp;
the footage, Michelle gets pissed and drives away.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.640
Josh is nervous, thinking that Michelle&nbsp;
will go to the police. But Charlie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.600
tells him that they should continue&nbsp;
with the plan and find the footage.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.080
While Michelle is driving, her tires burst,&nbsp;
causing her to hit a tree. She checks the road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.440
and sees the spike strip that flattened her tires.&nbsp;
Afraid, she goes back in the car and begins typing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.160
on her phone to ask Charlie for help. She doesn't&nbsp;
notice the masked man running to the car window.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.240
Charlie receives a message from Michelle,&nbsp;
learning that she crashed the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.360
He runs out of the house, telling the others that&nbsp;
he'll help her. He finds their car on the road,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.480
but it's abandoned, with a window smashed. Charlie&nbsp;
calls Michelle's phone and hears it down the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.800
He sees the phone's screen from&nbsp;
afar and walks to it. But he stops,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.360
stepping over Michelle's body. Distracted,&nbsp;
the masked man rushes to him and hits him.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.480
Josh and Mina try to open the door from under&nbsp;
the house, thinking that the cameras' receiver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:06.240
is there. Josh kicks the lock open and enters.&nbsp;
There, they search through the cluttered boxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.680
Josh finds some disturbing photos&nbsp;
but refuses to show them to Mina.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.040
Josh cries, regretting all&nbsp;
the trouble he caused them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.800
Mina comforts him, assuring&nbsp;
him that it wasn't his fault.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.880
He asks to be left alone for a while, so&nbsp;
Mina goes to continue searching elsewhere.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.720
Josh sifts through the boxes again&nbsp;
but stops when he hears the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.200
He goes to check but stops when he receives&nbsp;
an audio recording of Mina and Charlie.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.680
Josh goes inside, letting Mina hear&nbsp;
the recording that he received.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.200
It's the conversation Mina and Charlie&nbsp;
had about what happened the night before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.560
Josh presses Mina to explain but receives the&nbsp;
video recording of Mina and Charlie in the shower.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.200
They hear the front door open, and Josh&nbsp;
rushes down, thinking that it's Charlie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.480
Multiple cameras around the house record an angry&nbsp;
Josh looking for Charlie, but he isn't anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.200
Josh opens a closet and gets hit on the head.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.360
Mina peeks downstairs and sees Josh on the&nbsp;
floor. From the closet, the masked man emerges.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.080
The terrified Mina hurries up the stairs to&nbsp;
escape. The masked man goes to chase her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.120
but Josh weakly grabs his leg. The masked man&nbsp;
finishes off Josh before heading up the stairs.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:17.040
Upstairs, the masked man sees Mina's shoe on the&nbsp;
ground from the balcony. Thinking she jumped,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.640
he climbs down the stairs, not knowing&nbsp;
that Mina was still hiding in the room.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.560
When he's gone, Mina comes&nbsp;
out and heads down the stairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.520
She tries to flee as quietly as&nbsp;
she can but can't stop her cries.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.920
She grabs a screwdriver from a bag before&nbsp;
getting ambushed by the man outside.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.120
Mina stabs him in the face with the screwdriver,&nbsp;
causing her to fall down the stairs and injuring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.760
her foot. The masked man removes the screwdriver&nbsp;
from his face and heads down in pursuit.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.440
Mina limps into the foggy woods, desperate&nbsp;
to escape. But her injury slows her down;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:53.040
the masked man closes in on her. Mina trips&nbsp;
and quickly hides behind a tree. Behind her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.160
the masked man looks around, searching for her.&nbsp;
Mina covers her mouth to silence her gasps.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.560
Thinking that the man went in another&nbsp;
direction, she sprints forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.480
The man hears her running and gives&nbsp;
chase. With the darkness and fog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.680
Mina can't see what's in front of her. With&nbsp;
a gasp, she accidentally falls into a cliff.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.480
The masked man catches up,&nbsp;
looking down the cliff, but&nbsp;

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.760
Mina is nowhere in sight. With his deed done, the&nbsp;
masked man goes back to the house and cleans up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.400
He loads the spike strip into Taylor's truck&nbsp;
and returns the hammer to Taylor's toolbox.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.920
He removes the hidden cameras throughout&nbsp;
the house and the receiver from the attic.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.040
The following morning, he takes off&nbsp;
his mask and sees Reggie return safely.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.160
Without his owners around,&nbsp;
Reggie heads out on his own.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.280
Soon after the events, the man&nbsp;
rents a new property in the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.120
There, he makes a copy of the key&nbsp;
and installs hidden cameras inside.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.520
Days go by, and new renters of the&nbsp;
property are recorded in his camera,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.800
oblivious to the danger. One night, the masked man&nbsp;
walks in on a sleeping couple in the new property.
