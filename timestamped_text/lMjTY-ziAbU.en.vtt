Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:06.620
Today I'm going to show you a Drama Thriller
film called The Girl With All The Gifts.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.770
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.929
Watch out and take care.In a dystopian world
taken over by a fungal disease, humankind’s

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.289
only hope is a group of hybrid children.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.189
They do not look like the stereotypical superheroes;
they are in wheelchairs and are heavily guarded

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.400
by soldiers because they crave living flesh.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.170
In a rather strange school setting, Helen
Justineau is responsible for educating them.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.370
Among the children is Melanie, whose intelligence
is exceptional and is the one closest to Ms.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.629
Justineau.

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.010
The children at the army base are treated
lowly by the guards.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.399
Guns are constantly being pointed at them,
and the food given is very unpleasant.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.720
To say the least, they are treated like outcasts
and animals.The children are being experimented

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.359
on by Dr. Caroline Caldwell, who is in charge
of the research for these kinds of cases.

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.859
Dr. Caldwell is fond of Melanie because she
is a brilliant, bright, and insightful child.

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.660
From time to time, she asks Melanie to solve
riddles to test her.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.430
Dr Caldwell randomly made her pick a number
between one to twenty; she chose thirteen,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.530
and on the following day, on her way to the
classroom, Melanie noticed that one of her

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.050
classmates, Kenny, is absent.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.430
What made her suspicious is that Kenny is
numbered as “13”.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.750
She brought this to Ms. Justineau’s attention,
but the teacher brushes the subject off; little

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.470
did they know, Kenny is being experimented.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.860
On that same day, Ms. Justineau assigned the
class to write their own story.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.220
Melanie volunteered to read her story out
loud to the class.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.720
Her story is about a mother and a child; her
story deeply touches Ms. Justineau that she

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.670
touches Melanie on the head in a caring way.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.690
Lacking motherly care, Melanie feels comforted
by Ms. Justineau’s simple act of affection.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.440
The guards see the teacher caress the student,
and they come into the room furiously.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.480
Sergeant Eddie Parks, the leader of the soldiers,
shouts at Ms. Justineau and reminds her that

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.540
physical touch can trigger these children’s
craving for human flesh.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.980
Sergeant Parks proceeds to show Ms. Justineau
what will happen if she ever does it again.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.560
He comes toward one of the children, spits
on his hand, and lets him sniff it.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.009
In just a matter of seconds, the boy turns
frantic as he reaches out for the sergeant.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.930
The boy's action also caused other students
to act the same way, almost like they want

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.780
to attack Sergeant Parks.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.840
Ms. Justineau is left devastated as the class
ended because she feels like it is her fault.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.150
After the class, Melanie is escorted to her
cell by the guards, and Sergeant Parks walks

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.160
by.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.280
Melanie tells the sergeant that Ms. Justineau
likes her best, and the teacher would rather

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.030
touch her than him.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.810
Sergeant Parks became angry and left her tied
to her wheelchair for the whole night.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.490
Ms. Justineau walks by Melanie’s cell and
found her still tied to her wheelchair.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.150
Out of kindness, she unties her from the chair,
but Melanie starts acting frantic and even

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.910
tells her
teacher that she smells nice.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.430
Fighting the urge to attack her, Melanie shouts
at Ms. Justineau to get out of her cell.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.720
She came out safely but little did she know
that Dr. Caldwell found out about her visit.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.770
Dr. Caldwell initiated a conversation with
Melanie and, once again, made her pick a number.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.390
Melanie sensed the pattern and chose “4,"
which is the number assigned to her.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.720
Dr. Caldwell fell silent and walked away.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.480
One day, instead of being escorted to her
classroom, Melanie is brought outside.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.300
The camp is now attacked by the “hungries”
or the ones infected by the highly contagious

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.860
fungal disease.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.820
Melanie is brought to Dr. Caldwell’s lab
for medical procedures, but it goes wrong

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.620
as the hungries overrun the camp.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.870
One of the nurses is attacked; Dr. Caldwell
runs for her life, leaving Melanie alone in

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.080
the lab.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.740
She manages to escape by using a scalpel to
set herself free.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.790
Outside is complete chaos.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.360
To get to Ms. Justineau, Melanie attacks two
soldiers, infecting them.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.310
Melanie fell unconscious, and Ms. Justineau
carried her to board an escaping truck with

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.280
Sergeant Parks, Dr. Caldwell, and two other
soldiers, Gallagher and Dillon.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.120
Melanie is tied, and they use a restraint
mask to prevent her from biting others while

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.120
traveling.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.830
When they stop for water, a group of hungries
proceed to attack, and Dillon is infected,

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.090
leaving Sergeant Parks no choice but to shoot
him.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.480
They all reach London by foot, and they pass
through a swarm of dormant hungries by using

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.349
a gel that conceals their smell.

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.630
They end up in an abandoned hospital to find
shelter for the night.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.430
Dr. Caldwell explains that second-generation
hungries, like Melanie, were discovered after

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.630
newborns killed their infected mothers from
the inside by burrowing the womb.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.850
The following day, their shelter is surrounded
by hungries, and Melanie volunteers to go

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.180
outside and look for a way to get them out
of the building.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.440
As a second-generation hungry, she is completely
ignored by the hungries.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.680
On her walk, Melanie finds a stray cat, eats
it.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.060
This instantly satisfies her hunger and craving
for blood.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.960
She then continues to explore abandoned houses.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.810
In one of the houses, she found a stray dog
and uses it to catch the hungries’ attention,

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.520
making it safe enough for the group to escape
from the building.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.580
Melanie is given a walkie-talkie to monitor
the area while communicating with the group.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.490
As they advance and walk through the city,
they encounter a piled tower with infected

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.990
bodies, which encircles the building.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.460
The amount of infection has taken over the
building with seed pods that could release

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.699
airborne contamination.

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.170
The group takes shelter in an abandoned mobile
lab.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.740
After some time, Melanie feels hungry and
is once again set free outside by the group.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.889
Gallagher, who is also in search of food,
ventures around the city.

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.730
Melanie comes across a group of uninfected
but feral children, and she observes them

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.460
from a distance.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.630
Back in the lab, Dr. Caldwell is in great
pain as she fights her inflammatory sepsis

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.410
— a blood poisoning she got from cuts on
her hand.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.440
Dr. Caldwell persuades Ms. Justineau to sacrifice
Melanie to synthesize a vaccine that would

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.180
end the fungal disease.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.850
The group of children has caught Gallagher’s
scent, and in an attempt to save him from

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.490
danger, Melanie helps the group track him
by searching for him around the city.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.610
It’s too late since the group of children
found him first, and he ends up being eaten

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.740
by them.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.580
The group arrived at the place where Gallagher
is killed.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.440
They discovered his helpless body, all devoured.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.820
The rest of them are also surrounded by the
feral children, but Melanie fights their leader

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.699
and brutally kills him with a bat, shooing
the rest of them away.

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:12.960
Her bravery makes way for the group to escape
and find their way back to the lab.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.190
Upon arriving, Dr. Caldwell uses a gas tank
to make Melanie, Ms. Justineau, and Sergeant

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.830
Parks unconscious.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.000
In this way, she can freely dissect Melanie’s
body.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.080
As she struggles to do the procedure because
of her sepsis, Melanie gains consciousness

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.660
before the process starts.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.730
Dr. Caldwell explains to Melanie that she
can make a cure out of her and that it is

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.250
a way to save Ms. Justineau, who is very close
to Melanie’s heart.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.910
Dr. Caldwell guilts Melanie into sacrificing
her own life; she assures the little girl

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.610
that it will not hurt, and she is doing Ms.
Justineau a great favor.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.480
Melanie refused; she managed to escape, and
Dr. Caldwell followed her, but she ended up

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.150
being eaten by a group of feral children.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.850
Melanie sets fire to the seed pods surrounding
the tall tower.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.770
Because of the heat, spores and seeds are
released into the air.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.300
These spores could cause humans to turn into
hungries.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.650
Melanie runs into Sergeant Parks, who left
the lab in search of Ms. Justineau.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.160
Melanie admitted that she has opened the pods
and apologized for it.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.720
Sergeant Parks has been infected by the spores
released into the air and begs Melanie to

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.479
take his gun and shoot him because he does
not want to turn into a hungry.

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:19.490
Melanie obeys him and shoots.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.729
Back in the lab, secured by the airtight windows,
Ms. Justineau watched as the spores fall.

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:28.530
She watches Melanie from the sealed door,
and they look at each other longingly.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.919
Ms. Justineau settles and is confined in the
mobile lab as the outside environment is highly

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:35.960
lethal except for the second-generation hungries.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.120
She continues to educate Melanie and the rest
of the feral children with a sealed door dividing

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.770
her from the rest of them.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:46.500
Melanie then continues to lead the group of
feral children, even teaching them to speak.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.289
All of them have accepted this new reality
and this compromised world that they are forced

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:51.000
to live in.
