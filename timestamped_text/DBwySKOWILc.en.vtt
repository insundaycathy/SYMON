00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.170
This is Movie Shortens.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.109
Follow us today to the movie titled: Little
Nicky.

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.640
Be aware, there are spoilers!

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.259
There is a man sitting on a tree with the
setup like he’s having dinner.

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.999
He takes a sip of wine and slowly spies a
very hot lady from her bedroom’s window.

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.460
As he is very satisfied with the scene, her
son enters.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.740
He makes a phone call to their house and requires
the son to get out of the room.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.460
Just then, the lady spots him from the window.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.960
The man gets a slingshot in the eye, dropping
from the tree.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.840
Within minutes after that, he finds himself
floating in a cloudpool.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.570
He ends up going through the wall of soul
in Hell.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.030
Nicky, the Satan’s sweet son, enjoys the
rock music before the Demon assistant - Jimmy

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.160
walks in.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.650
He tells Nicky to come to the throne room
under his father’s order.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.820
Nicky has two brothers: Adrian, the most intelligent,
and Cassius, the silly but strongest.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.110
They have hated Nicky and mind controlled
him for fun since he was born.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.720
Nicky has a speech disorder caused by Cassius.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.140
He hit Nicky in the face with a shovel, making
his jaw deformed.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.509
Seeing Cassius hurt Nicky again by mind control
ability, Satan walks in and punishes him.

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.590
The father and sons join a meeting to decide
who would be the next successor for ruling

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.590
Hell.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.770
Satan says it is difficult for him to decide
who keeps the throne among the three sons.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.709
He thinks the sons need more time to learn
about the balance between the good and the

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:20.709
evil.

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:23.359
Therefore, he’ll keep the throne for himself.

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:27.650
Displeased with Satan’s decision, Adrian
and Cassius decide not to serve in Hell for

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.479
the next 10000 years.

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.670
The two then come up with their own evil plan:
coming up back to the Earth and creating their

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.700
new Hell.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.350
The two then run backward to the wall of soul.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.689
As they jump over it, the wall becomes frozen,
blocking the only entrance to Hell.

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.990
When getting the bad news, Satan lets Nicky
know that his brothers’ action would make

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.990
him die.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.539
If the wall of soul is blocked, there are
no more evil souls coming.

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.090
This causes Satan’s body to begin decomposition.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.909
To stop them, Nick is sent to Earth.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.009
He will have to find his brothers and trap
them in a silver flask.

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.959
Nicky has less than a week to save Satan.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.139
Returning to Earth, Nicky has difficulties
staying alive.

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:08.820
He is killed and sent back to Hell several
times.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.270
Upon getting back, Nicky meets a talking bulldog
called Mr. Beefy, who is his father’s best

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.270
friend.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.590
Nicky seems very scared of the real world
and rushes to find his brothers.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.930
Beefy tells him that it is not easy to find
them because they can possess people and become

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.760
different from their original appearances.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.379
At first, Beefy teaches Nicky to put on warm
clothes and eat food.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.500
He then takes Nicky to share an apartment
with a struggling actor named Todd.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.709
Knowing that Satan is running out of time,
Nicky holds the flask and forces anyone he

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.459
sees in the street to take a sip, aiming to
expose his brothers.

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.780
Nicky gets hit at every single attempt.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.800
Meanwhile, Adrian and Cassius possess religious
and political leaders to join their scheme.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.110
Poor Nicky has been very enthusiastic to find
his brothers but he’s been failed and become

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.110
exhausted.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.640
While sleeping, his flask is stolen by an
old man.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.530
Nicky wakes up and panics knowing that his
flask is gone.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.970
Luckily, he runs into the flask at the man’s
open fair.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.239
When he asks the man to give it back, the
man threatens him.

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.319
Nicky gets to see Valerie, a design student.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.330
She kindly helps Nicky to get his flask back.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.330
He falls in love with Valerie ever since.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.950
While the couple are walking together, Adrian
spots Nicky across the street.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.170
Nicky once again is mentally controlled, scaring
Valerie away.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.849
Adrian makes Nicky go to Hell one more time
by setting him up with a car accident.

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.689
At home, Nicky encounters his brothers possessing
other political and religious VIPs in the

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:28.049
city on TV.

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.709
Beefy decides to teach Nicky how to release
the Wickedness inside him, eventually empower

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:32.709
Nicky using his evil power and fight with
his brothers.

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.849
While learning, Todd enters the living room.

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.730
He asks to use the TV for the basketball game.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.659
Just then, Nicky sees Cassius on television,
possessing the referee of the game.

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.770
Nicky immediately runs to the court to capture
Cassius.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.701
Taking this opportunity, Nicky starts to use
his evil power, trying to defeat Cassius with

00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:52.879
his great performance on the court.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.069
Nicky then tricks Cassius to take a sip from
the flask, eventually trapping one of his

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.249
brothers inside.

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:04.060
Impressed by Nicky's talents, metalheads John
and Peter decide to become his forever fans.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.090
After the game, Nicky brings his fans to the
apartment.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.650
They soon bond with Todd and Beefy.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.159
The group have a fun time together as good
friends.

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.209
They also encourage Nicky to find Valerie
and apologize to her.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.280
Nicky then gets the courage to see Valerie
that night.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.770
Nicky fails to take Valerie back at the beginning.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.680
He gets pepper sprayed and falls off the building.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.780
However, he can use his power to lift himself
back to Valerie.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.360
At the end, Nicky explains to her about his
identity and why he is on Earth, Valerie accepts

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.360
him.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.133
The two fly in the sky to enjoy the city at
night.

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:43.380
The following day, Adrian possesses the Chief
of Police Department and accuses Nicky of

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.310
being a serial murderer in the city.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.250
Elsewhere on the street, Nicky hasn’t known
about this and still enjoys his new day.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.950
People around start to hunt him for the reward
from the Police Department.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.300
Confused and scared, Nicky turns himself into
a thousand spiders and fights people away.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.480
Coming back home, Nicky learns about Adrian’s
evil trap.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.940
He asks the friends to kill him so he can
return to Hell and talk with his father.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.640
In Hell, Nicky realizes that Satan is now
badly fallen apart.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.080
He has hearing trouble as the ears are gone.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.530
The Demon assistant panics because the midnight
deadline to capture Adrian and Cassius is

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.260
only hours away.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.130
Nicky assures Satan that he’ll try his best
to save his father.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.470
Returning to Earth, Nicky and the friends
think of an idea to capture Adrian.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.890
John and Peter pretend to meet the Chief of
the police department.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.370
They let him know about Nicky’s location.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.640
The two take the Chief to the subway station.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.070
The team arranged to have Todd and Beefy arrested
instead.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.070
While waiting for Nicky, the chief reveals
himself to be Adrian.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.750
Just then, Valerie disguises as a drunk woman
with a flask covered in a bag.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.010
She gives it to John and Peter, attempting
to trap Adrian.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.860
Seeing Peter is strangely worried while John
keeps cool.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.290
Adrian realizes the trick.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.500
Later, John reveals to be possessed by Nicky.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.020
Adrian decides not to release Cassius out,
telling him that Hell only needs one next

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.020
Satan.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.630
Meanwhile, Beefy manages to escape from the
police and comes back to help Nicky.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.910
Back to the subway, Adrian captures Valerie
and threatens Nicky to take a sip from the

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:13.910
flask.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.730
As Nicky is about to drink, Beefy arrives
on time and attacks Adrian with an arrow.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.030
Adrian grabs Valerie down the track as the
train is coming.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.420
Nicky storms in to save Valerie by throwing
her out of the track.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.980
Adrian and Nicky are eventually killed by
the train.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.380
A moment later, Adrian shows up in front of
his father and questions Nicky.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.320
Adrian then dethrones his father and becomes
the next Satan.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.900
He arrives on Earth and lets all the humans
know that he’ll kill them in 15 minutes.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.440
Adrian plans to turn Earth into Hell.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.590
Meanwhile, Nicky finds himself in heaven this
time.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.700
He meets his mother Holly again.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.660
She tells him that he can only fight Adrian
by his “inner light”, an ability that

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.730
he was actually inherited from her.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.770
She then gives him a mysterious orb and encourages
him to be brave and fight for the right.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.580
Back to the Earth, the demons discover Nicky
and try to attack him.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.750
Nicky creates gifts for them which makes them
respect him enough to join Nicky and stop

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.030
Adrian.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.600
Coming to see Adrian with good will, Adrian
kills one of the demons, making them all run

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.100
away from Nicky.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.630
Now Nicky has to deal with his brother alone.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.520
Both of them decide to fight inside the flask.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.570
Here happens to be a three-way fight among
the brothers.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.320
They fight fiercely inside the flask with
the cheers from his friends outside.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.920
Nicky finally gets out of the flask alone,
signaling the win.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.260
However, when Valerie kisses him for the victory,
she realizes something is wrong.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.540
Nicky reveals to be Adrian and he’s turning
himself into a bat.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.610
With the help from Valerie, Nick can escape
from the flask.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.430
Nicky decides to follow his mother’s advice
to destroy Adrian.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:50.840
When he breaks the orb, Ozzy Osbourne appears,
bites Adrian's head off and sends him back

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.100
to the flask.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.600
Mission completed, Valerie has to kill Nicky
so he can return to Hell and bring the flask

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.730
to his father before midnight.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.140
Nicky saves Satan just in time.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.200
Later, he regains his body and the throne.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.670
Satan allows Nicky to stay with Valerie on
Earth as he deserves that.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:13.020
The film closes a year afterward, when Nicky
and Valerie live in New York with their newborn

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.690
child, Zachariah.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:21.490
John and Peter die in a plane crash and now
live happily in the hell of Nicky's old bedroom.
