wanted to take revenge then defense lawyer claims&nbsp;
that when sunway saw yang unconscious and he stole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.640
her 3 million yen watch which was found from his&nbsp;
house and killed yang by poking her head to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.800
nail on the wall which his tongue slips and he&nbsp;
says yes only to say no again that everyone is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.600
shocked and lin tai breaks down in court but&nbsp;
also gives a creepy smile to public prosecutor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.000
in flashback it is shown that tong tao&nbsp;
tried to prosecute lin tai three times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.760
by now first time for a fraud but the witness&nbsp;
withdrew the statement in the last moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.960
in the second time it was for a property&nbsp;
fraud but again witness withdrew the statement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.880
on the third time it was for a financial fraud&nbsp;
and this time after the witness testimonies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.000
suddenly a scapegoat took claim for fraud in the&nbsp;
court and lin tai was set free his assistant asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.600
him that this time it's a criminal case and no one&nbsp;
will be a scapegoat for lin tai which he replies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.640
that everyone can be bought some with money some&nbsp;
with emotions that he is sure that lin tai knows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.120
how to buy people then we see lin tai walking out&nbsp;
of courtroom and claiming he knew his daughter was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.520
innocent after the court session tong tao asks&nbsp;
his assistants what they think about the case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.800
which they replies that they didn't expect sunway&nbsp;
to be the killer he says who said sunway is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:21.200
killer he claims he can read that lin tai had a&nbsp;
very creepy smile on his face and his eyes were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.840
hiding something he then says lin tai is playing&nbsp;
smart with him so they must play real with him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.080
then they go to the crime scene and find out&nbsp;
that the assistant of joe lee was already there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.080
it means they might have erased evidence by&nbsp;
now then he asks his assistants to search&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.840
for all the bank transactions of lin thai and&nbsp;
sunway for any deposits since he thinks sunway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.800
was bought to take all the blame the next day&nbsp;
they find out that sunway was diagnosed with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.600
brain cancer one month before the murder so&nbsp;
he might be bought since he's dying already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.760
secondly they find the transfer of 2 million yen&nbsp;
to sunway's account one week before the murder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.840
the next day he brings both son&nbsp;
way and his wife for interrogation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.560
his wife says lin tyfel filled all her wishes&nbsp;
with money which her husband would have never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.840
done and she enjoyed changing hormones with lintai&nbsp;
then they interrogate sunway but he stays silent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.560
the next day tong tao visits lin tai tong tao&nbsp;
aggressively says that he cannot let this happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.920
and just because lin tai is rich does not mean&nbsp;
he can buy people's life and he will find the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:45.600
real murderer the next day few hours before the&nbsp;
next court session tong tao and his assistants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.000
get an anonymous email that claims that the&nbsp;
center had video evidence of the murder of yang&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.440
they try to locate the sender but&nbsp;
they cannot locate who is the sender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.760
then the video is sent over just as tong&nbsp;
tau and his team arrives into court for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:09.280
cross-examination of lin tai they decide to watch&nbsp;
the video first as they try to open the video it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.600
does not work on windows media player so they&nbsp;
download another program and play it only to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.720
that lin tai came out of the car which is strange&nbsp;
however the video lags a lot and they were already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.120
late for the court session and the whole court&nbsp;
was waiting for them so they decide to go inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.880
upon going inside they try to watch the video and&nbsp;
on testimony we see lin tai claiming how much he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.640
loves his daughter and he always knew his driver&nbsp;
was not normal and is blaming the driver for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.880
murder of his fiancee when tong tao is about to&nbsp;
present it to the court strangely the video is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:54.720
self-deleted stopping it from being presented in&nbsp;
court upon having no choice tong tao immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.760
asks for a recess on the claim that he has a new&nbsp;
evidence to reorganize and present to the court&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:07.200
but he needs some time later tong town tells his&nbsp;
assistant that lin tai is very rich and cunning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:14.400
but his only weakness is his pride which is often&nbsp;
harmful when the court session resumed tong tao&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.440
compliments him of being a very successful&nbsp;
businessman who has 2 000 employees and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.840
is the only owner to handle he then asks him if&nbsp;
he loved his fiance after hearing confident yes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.680
he asks him what did he think about the affair&nbsp;
his fiancee was having which was leaked on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:38.480
internet lintai refuses to answer how he felt&nbsp;
then he asks after his wife died he might have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.160
tried to look for another woman he says proudly&nbsp;
that woman chases me not me going after them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.560
then tong tao asks him he gave diamond&nbsp;
ring to four women in last six years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:58.720
which he laughs off at oh he forgot that tong&nbsp;
tao is not rich so he won't understand upon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.880
hearing that tong tao took an aggressive stance&nbsp;
to cross-examine lin tai and used the infertility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:11.520
of yang dan against lin tai claiming that lin tai&nbsp;
used yang dan and when he found out she was having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.400
an affair with others and she is not fertile&nbsp;
woman as well he decided to take her life away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:24.560
surprisingly this strategy worked and in&nbsp;
his agitated state lin tai shouts that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.680
was actually with his daughter in the suv at the&nbsp;
day of the murder while his daughter had knocked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:36.640
down yang dan it was lin tai that got off the car&nbsp;
and pushed yang dan against the wall and her head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:43.120
went on to a nail which killed her the whole&nbsp;
court is in an uproar and everyone is shocked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:51.680
lin ty is hence detained his daughter ming was&nbsp;
also released after the confession of his father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:58.480
having been acquitted of her crime few&nbsp;
days later nearing the trial of lin thai&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.480
jolie revealed to the audience that her team&nbsp;
was the one that had gotten hold of the video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:12.240
and had sent it to tongtao's team this video was&nbsp;
in turn given to her team via an anonymous source&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:19.040
as she was comparing this video which was shot at&nbsp;
an angle different from the security camera feed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.400
that was overlooking the scene she noticed that&nbsp;
the movement of sunway's leg was inconsistent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.360
this led her to believe that the video&nbsp;
was shot after the murder happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:36.720
upon finding this shocking detail she immediately&nbsp;
asks her assistants to investigate whether lin tai&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.360
had carried out a massive renovation job within&nbsp;
the last few months and whether he had purchased&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:48.400
a lot of second-hand vehicles later her line of&nbsp;
doubt turned out to be fruitful and led her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:55.680
a deserted factory in the sioux province of china&nbsp;
she goes there and searches into the factory and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.960
discovers the interior had been modeled after the&nbsp;
car park where the murder of yang dan had happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.280
this confirmed her hunch that lin tai shot the&nbsp;
video in the aftermath of the murder to stage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:14.960
the idea that he was the one that committed the&nbsp;
murder instead of his daughter tong tao also has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.120
his suspicion when he revealed the court footage&nbsp;
of lin tai confessing the murder of yang dan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:26.640
lin tai asking to his daughter to forgive what&nbsp;
happened and start her new life before the end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:32.800
of the video at that time he made a reference&nbsp;
that he would not allow himself to be convicted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:40.000
by tong tao in front of the dragon back wall&nbsp;
ting tao cannot stop thinking what that meant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.840
even his assistants were not able to find out&nbsp;
what it meant unable to fathom what this meant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:54.800
tong tao visited lin tai's hometown and he decides&nbsp;
to speak to an old villager later the old person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.840
explained the significance of the dragon back&nbsp;
wall telling the story of how in ancient china&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.600
the local dragon king took the place of his&nbsp;
dragon son that had committed grave atrocities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.160
and gave himself up to the heavenly warriors&nbsp;
that were there to punish the younger dragon son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.600
the local mountain where this allegedly happened&nbsp;
was hence referred to as the dragonback mountain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:22.560
when tong tao was returning to town he received&nbsp;
a call from meng who was set free from the crimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:30.560
who supposedly called to confess her father's plot&nbsp;
to save her then the movie ends leaving everyone a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:37.280
strong sense of grief as well as experiencing the&nbsp;
power of fatherly love let me know in the comments&nbsp;&nbsp;
