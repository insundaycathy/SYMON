Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.270
Today, I'm going to explain a sci-fi thriller
film called “Limitless.”

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.560
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.340
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.080
Eddie Morra is an aspiring writer living in
New York.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.509
For the past several months, he’s been living
off of a book contract advance and financial

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.110
support from his girlfriend.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.060
The only problem is that he hasn’t written
a single word of his book.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.040
He struggles writing his story, going through
a continuous cycle of writing, deleting, and

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.040
starting over.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.019
He spends his afternoons drinking at a bar
or wasting away on his couch in a messy apartment.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.809
Eddie’s fiance, Lindy, decides to end their
relationship as she sees Eddie incapable of

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.409
straightening out his life.

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:38.729
Lindy says she hasn’t seen any progress
on Eddie’s part, and with her career taking

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:42.409
a big step forward, she can’t afford to
be taking care of Eddie all the time.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.729
Eddie says he loves her, and he wants to spend
the rest of his life with her, but Lindy leaves.

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:50.690
While walking home, a man, Vernon, calls out
to him.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.809
Vernon is Eddie’s ex-wife’s brother.

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.949
Eddie had a short-lived marriage with his
college sweetheart, Melissa.

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.239
Eddie remembers Vernon as Melissa’s drug-dealing
little brother, but Vernon says those days

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.839
are behind him.

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.799
Vernon invites Eddie for a drink at a bar
and quizzes him, asking for updates about

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.020
his life.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.310
Vernon says Melissa has remarried and has
two kids of her own now, and Eddie tells him

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.580
he's trying to write a book and admits he's
having a hard time starting it.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.310
Vernon sees Eddie having creative problems
and offers help.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.670
He takes out a small pill and offers it to
Eddie.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.520
Eddie refuses, saying Vernon is still dealing.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.159
Vernon says the drug is legal, already finished
with lab tests, approval from the food and

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.990
drug administration, and will be sold the
following year.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.049
He has early access to it as he works for
the pharmaceutical company that makes it,

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.049
calling it N.Z.T.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.390
Eddie is unconvinced, saying he knows a designer
drug when he sees one.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.140
Regardless, Eddie is interested, and Vernon
says the pill helps unlock formant receptors

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.079
in the brain, allowing them to use 100% of
their brainpower.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.240
Vernon gets an urgent phone call and tells
Eddie he'd love to meet up some other time,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.659
handing Eddie his card.

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.299
Eddie refuses the pill, but Vernon insists,
saying a single tablet costs $800.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.929
On his way home, Eddie contemplates his life.

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.270
Thinking he's already at his low point, he
takes the N.Z.T., reasoning out that his life

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.950
couldn't get any worse.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.079
He runs into his landlord's wife on his way
up, and she cusses him out for being late

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.240
on his rent.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.030
She shouts at Eddie, saying he'll never amount
to anything and that he'd soon be homeless.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.630
Eddie has lost focus on what the lady is saying
as the N.Z.T. is taking effect.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.970
He feels dizzy, and the drug's effect finally
hits.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.840
He sees the lady’s bag and in it, a book
about law.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.349
Eddie deducts that the lady dislikes him,
but something else must be bothering her.

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.819
He asks about law school, and the lady is
surprised how Eddie knows about her studying

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:23.819
law.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.440
Eddie recalls seeing the book once several
years ago in a dorm room when he was still

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.440
in college.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.540
Somehow, he now remembers everything he’s
ever read, seen, and heard in his entire life.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.239
Eddie then recommends a different book on
the law that would be more appropriate for

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.030
her assignment and continues advising her
about how she could proceed with her assignment.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.209
The lady is impressed, even attracted, by
Eddie's sudden mastery of law and court.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.270
She invites her in, he helps with her assignment,
and they eventually have intercourse.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.069
Eddie is perplexed as to how he suddenly has
all of this knowledge.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.720
He realizes that he always had this knowledge,
just in a random mess in his head.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.280
The N.Z.T. must have helped his brain rearrange
and analyze the pieces of information he has

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.470
in his head and turned them into a congruent
and organized thought that he now has complete

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.769
access to.

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.849
Every documentary, every magazine article,
every movie, every commercial, anything he's

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.629
ever read and seen has now been turned into
an accessible stream of information.

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.210
He heads back to his dirty apartment and starts
cleaning.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.580
He starts writing and ends up with a 90-page
preliminary manuscript.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.879
The N.Z.T. not only gave him superior knowledge
but also gave him a boost in motivation.

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.100
The following day, he feels the N.Z.T.'s effects
had worn off.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.160
He takes his manuscript to his editor.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.430
The editor is doubtful but reads it anyway.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.140
When Eddie reaches home, he receives voice
messages from his editor praising him.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.560
Eddie then decides he'd need more N.Z.T. and
heads to Vernon's apartment.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.129
Eddie shows up at Vernon's apartment, and
Vernon immediately knows what Eddie wants.

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.360
Eddie sees Vernon has bruises and scratches
on his face and asks him what happened, but

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.069
Vernon avoids answering.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.530
Vernon then reveals that he lied about the
N.Z.T. being legal and approved by the F.D.A.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.670
Regardless, Eddie still wants more.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.950
Vernon asks Eddie to head out to do some chores,
and Eddie complies, thinking he'd do what's

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.750
necessary to get more N.Z.T.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.349
He arrives back at the apartment and sees
the door busted open.

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.290
He sees Vernon's apartment had been ransacked
and Vernon on the couch with a bullet hole

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.489
on his head.

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.469
Eddie calls the police but realizes he needs
to find Vernon's N.Z.T. stash before the cops

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:05.469
arrive.

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.819
He finds a pack of N.Z.T. along with Vernon's
list of clients and cash.

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.290
At the police station, Eddie is interviewed
and gets a phone call from Melissa.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.010
The police then tell Eddie they’ll stay
in contact.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.490
At home, Eddie takes another pill and his
creative juices start flowing.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.980
With Vernon’s cash, Eddie gets a haircut
and new clothes.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.950
He starts getting in shape and even finishes
his book in four days.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.290
He learns to play the piano in three days
and notices he can learn any language by listening

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.460
to it.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.720
Eddie becomes outgoing, meeting new people
and impressing everyone with his mastery of

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.130
almost any field.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.670
He becomes daring, his shyness gone, and he
feels like he could achieve anything he ever

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.670
wanted.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.990
Eddie gets a realization and suddenly knows
what he needs to do.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.130
He’d delve into the world of stock trading.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.060
He meets Kevin, a broker working in Wallstreet,
and he becomes Eddie's entry point into the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.440
world of stocks.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.850
Eddie starts reading books on stock trading
and monitors the stock market for movement.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.580
With N.Z.T., he grew Vernon's remaining $800
to $2,000 in a day.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.890
The next day, it reaches $7,500.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:05.290
Eddie needs more capital for more growth and
decides to seek help from a loan shark, Gennady.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.610
Gennady decides to give Eddie the loan but
warns that he must be paid on time, or else

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.510
something terrible would happen to Eddie.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.200
Eddie accepts the risk, confident that he
would pay Gennady back in no time.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.760
The following day, Eddie heads to Kevin's
brokerage firm and starts buying and selling

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.760
stocks.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.390
Within two weeks, Eddie increased his brokerage
account to over two million dollars.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.000
Word starts getting around, and soon, Kevin
calls him to say that a Wallstreet tycoon

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.250
wants to meet with him.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.850
That evening, Eddie has dinner with Lindy,
and he tells her all about the good things

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.550
he’s been doing with his life.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.920
Seeing Eddie clean up his act, Lindy is proud,
and Eddie tells her he just got a sudden wake-up

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.170
call and decided to get his life together.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.940
After dinner, they head back to Lindy’s
place and make love.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.940
Over the next couple of days, the couple rediscovers
their love, and soon, Lindy tells Eddie that

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.980
she wants to be together with him again.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.440
As they talk about restarting their relationship,
Eddie spots a man eyeing him from a distance.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.500
Later that night, Eddie stares out the window,
looking to see if he’d spot the man but

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.710
sees nothing.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.980
Lindy is in bed asking him to join her, but
Eddie stumbles, and he’s transported to

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.610
the hallway in an instant.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.740
Eddie has no recollection of how he got out
of his apartment, but Lindy sees him and asks

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.730
him to go inside for a meal.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.400
The following day, Kevin joins Eddie for their
meeting with the Wallstreet giant.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.480
Kevin is nervous, but Eddie assures him that
the meeting would be fine.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.020
Carl Van Loon, a Wallstreet icon, arrives,
and they start talking.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.250
Carl’s companion is suspicious of Eddie
and how he climbed up the ladder so fast,

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.740
thinking it’s a con, but Eddie talks his
way through his questioning and impresses

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:24.740
Carl.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.140
On a car ride home, Carl hands Eddie a stack
of papers about the companies he owns and

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.060
asks Eddie to take a look and to analyze a
pattern and asks him what a good move would

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.060
be.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.750
Eddie takes a thorough look and realizes that
Carl must be planning a massive merger with

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.330
a competing company.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.490
Carl is impressed even further, noticing how
nobody could have figured that out in such

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.160
short of a time.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.200
Carl gives Eddie a chance to restructure the
deals between the companies and asks Eddie

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.950
to meet him the following day.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.720
Eddie takes the challenge and exits Carl’s
limousine but decides he doesn’t want to

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.770
go home.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.130
He instead starts walking, wanting to take
as much information as he can.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.090
Still, he finds himself having episodes of
unconsciousness, finding himself in different

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.410
parts of the city, and having no recollection
of how he got there.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.170
He stumbles into several parties, into different
clubs, meeting different women, and eventually

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.170
ending up in a hotel room with a model where
they have intercourse.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.110
Unbeknownst to Eddie, the strange man he had
seen earlier is following him.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.470
After leaving the hotel, Eddie heads to the
subway, where he runs into a group of thugs

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.900
and gets into a fight.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.210
The N.Z.T. helps him remember every self-defense
video, action movie, fight scene, and survival

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.430
documentary he's ever seen, and he manages
to fight off the group of thugs singlehandedly.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.120
He starts running afterward and finds himself
atop the Brooklyn bridge by dawn with no recollection

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.690
of what happened to him in the past 18 hours.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.010
He heads home and gets to bed but is awakened
by his alarm, reminding him about the meeting

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.010
with Carl.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.010
Afraid that he might run into another episode
of amnesia, Eddie decides not to take an N.Z.T.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.010
pill.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.920
He looks through the files that Carl sent
him but finds that he can't understand the

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.920
data.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.640
Kevin calls, and Eddie tells him he needs
to postpone the meeting, but Kevin says he'll

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.830
never get another chance if he cancels now.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.270
Eddie arrives at the meeting without taking
N.Z.T., and he's noticeably less focused,

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.560
dizzy, and even has trouble speaking.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.150
Carl notices Eddie is out of focus and asks
him about Hank Atwood, the competing businessman

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.880
he intended to merge with.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.800
Carl says Atwood was a nobody and had a meteoric
rise in the world of stock trading.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.200
Carl is perplexed about how Atwood had such
a steep rise, now ready to go toe-to-toe with

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.330
him.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.360
Eddie doesn’t focus on Carl and instead
fixes his gaze on the television where he

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.690
sees a new report of a woman who had been
found dead at the hotel, the same woman he

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.280
was with the night before.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.150
Eddie loses all focus and excuses himself
from Carl.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.390
He heads out and starts vomiting, his stomach
churning at the thought that he may have killed

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.490
someone.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.370
He heads home and gets a call from Melissa,
who is asking questions about Vernon's death.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.870
Eddie asks her if they could meet up somewhere,
and Melissa reluctantly agrees.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.880
Eddie goes through Vernon's notebook at a
park, looking up Vernon's clients and calling

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.689
them to find out more about the effects of
N.Z.T.

00:08:36.689 --> 00:08:39.860
Each number he calls, he gets an answer saying
the person had died.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.779
Each of them had experienced severe headaches,
vomiting, and some even fell into a coma.

00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:46.279
Still, they all ended up dead.

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:49.529
He dials another number, and a man behind
Eddie had his phone ringing.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.459
He answers, and Eddie hears his voice from
the other line.

00:08:52.459 --> 00:08:54.690
Eddie recognizes him as the man who was spying
on him.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.050
It’s the same man who had followed Eddie
and the model to the hotel.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.310
Eddie starts running, and the man follows
him.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.649
Eddie runs through the streets swerving through
traffic.

00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:06.310
He finally makes his way into a taxi cab to
the meeting place with Melissa.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.529
Melissa tells Eddie that Vernon's death didn't
surprise her and says she knows about the

00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:10.529
N.Z.T.

00:09:10.529 --> 00:09:12.420
She took it too but soon decided to get off
of it.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.550
Having the brain function at a prolonged high
level of mental activity would result in mental

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:16.970
fatigue and burnout.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.730
She got scared and stopped taking N.Z.T.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.839
Suddenly, she felt lazy, unfocused, and had
problems maintaining her job.

00:09:22.839 --> 00:09:25.910
Two years have passed, and the after-effects
still haven't worn off.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.850
She recommends that Eddie stop taking the
pill too but tells him to lower the dosage

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.060
as a sudden stop would be lethal.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.200
Eddie heads home but runs into Gennady.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.300
Gennady beats up Eddie and demands his payment.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.800
They stumble their way up Eddie's apartment,
and Eddie drops an N.Z.T. pill.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.519
Gennady picks up the pill, believing it to
be some kind of drug, and takes it himself.

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:45.200
They then head to the bank, and Eddie gives
him the money.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.880
Gennady notes that the pill made him feel
excellent, and he'd be asking for more soon.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.370
Eddie makes his way to Lindy’s office and
collapses.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.740
Eddie is left with no choice but to tell Lindy
everything.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.970
Lindy finally understands the source of Eddie’s
newfound motivation and agrees to retrieve

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.300
the pills for him.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.450
She heads home, takes the rest of the drugs,
and heads back.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.890
On her way back, she sees the man following
him.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:07.339
She runs into the city park and asks two men
to help her, but the pursuer stabs both men

00:10:07.339 --> 00:10:09.370
and continues chasing after Lindy.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.779
Lindy hides behind some boulders and calls
Eddie.

00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:14.540
Eddie advises her to take one of the pills
as it would give her the power to overcome

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.730
the situation, and she does.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.829
After the pill takes effect, she knows what
she has to do to escape from the man chasing

00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:20.829
her.

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:24.000
She runs into the ice skating rink and carries
a child, spinning her around and allowing

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.389
the child’s ice skates to slice the man’s
face.

00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:28.699
The man falls, and Lindy gets away.

00:10:28.699 --> 00:10:32.439
The following day, Lindy expresses her concerns
about the pill, saying it turned her into

00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:34.170
a completely different person.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.480
Eddie promises he’ll stop taking the pill
as soon as he gets enough money.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.980
On the street, Eddie sees Gennady spying on
him.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.810
Eddie approaches, and Gennady says he needs
more of the pill.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.470
Eddie gives him a few but realizes Gennady
won't stop.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.350
Eddie hires two bodyguards, thinking he'd
need security with him at all times.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.910
He meets with Carl again and apologizes for
how he behaved earlier, saying he was just

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:53.910
sick.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.660
Carl is unimpressed with Eddie’s apology
but says he has seen the projections Eddie

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.620
had sent and is once again impressed.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.889
Soon, Eddie would broker what he calls the
biggest merger in corporate history between

00:11:01.889 --> 00:11:03.970
Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:08.170
Eddie discovers that if he slept properly,
stayed hydrated and fed, abstained from alcohol,

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.279
and maintained a steady dose, the blackout
episodes stopped.

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:15.350
He has suits custom-made for him, all with
a hidden pocket for all the N.Z.T. he has.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.529
He finds a chemist and asks him to reverse
engineer the pill, hoping to make more of

00:11:18.529 --> 00:11:19.829
his own.

00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:23.470
While having lunch, he spots the detective
that interviewed him about Vernon’s death.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.509
The detective informs him that Eddie is now
a suspect in the model’s death as one eye

00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:28.819
witness placed him at the crime scene.

00:11:28.819 --> 00:11:33.649
Eddie hires Morris Brandt, one of the best
and most ruthless lawyers in New York.

00:11:33.649 --> 00:11:36.730
Brandt gets him walking free temporarily,
saying the evidence the police had is too

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:37.730
weak.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.920
Carl and Eddie meet with Atwood again, and
they observe Atwood’s deteriorating health,

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.930
and Eddie notes that Atwood isn’t even over
the age of 60.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:47.759
Eddie heads back to his hotel room and finds
someone had broken in and, he assumes, is

00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:49.070
looking for the N.Z.T.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.680
Security is now a primary concern, so he decides
to buy a luxurious penthouse apartment with

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.649
a top-of-the-notch security system.

00:11:54.649 --> 00:11:58.720
Later, Eddie runs into Gennady, who now has
his own set of thugs guarding him.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.120
Eddie recognizes that Gennady, too, must be
taking the pill.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.949
Gennady demands twenty more pills and blackmails
Eddie with the model’s death.

00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:08.420
The following day, the contract signing with
Atwood is scheduled, but Carl is worried as

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.540
Atwood is late.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.829
Atwood’s wife arrives later and tells them
her husband had suffered pain and dizziness

00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:14.509
and is currently hospitalized.

00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:18.180
She makes clear that they still want to proceed
with the contract as soon as Atwood is able.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:22.220
They walk her down, and Eddie sees her driver
is the man who had been stalking him.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.480
Eddie joins Brandt at the police station that
afternoon, where Eddie has to enter a police

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.480
lineup.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.779
Eddie takes his jacket off and hands it to
Brandt.

00:12:28.779 --> 00:12:31.899
After the lineup, he meets up with Brandt
again, and he tells him that Eddie is cleared

00:12:31.899 --> 00:12:33.199
of suspicion.

00:12:33.199 --> 00:12:35.350
Brandt then compliments Eddie's suit jacket.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.910
He makes his way back to Carl’s office and
discovers Atwood is now in a coma.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:42.579
He heads to the bathroom to take another pill
and discovers his secret pocket is empty.

00:12:42.579 --> 00:12:43.889
His stash is gone.

00:12:43.889 --> 00:12:46.689
He goes back to Carl, and a package is brought
to him.

00:12:46.689 --> 00:12:49.759
He opens it and sees his disembodied bodyguards’
hands inside.

00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:52.680
In shock, he runs out of Carl’s office and
hurries home.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.980
He watches a news report regarding updates
on Atwood’s situation and sees that Brandt

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.610
is also Atwood’s attorney.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.499
He finally understands and couldn’t help
himself from laughing.

00:13:00.499 --> 00:13:03.519
Eddie then hears banging at his door and notices
from the surveillance cameras that Gennady

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:07.339
had arrived with his goons, using metal grinders
and steel cutters to break in.

00:13:07.339 --> 00:13:12.050
Stuck in an inescapable situation, Eddie steps
up to the balcony, readying himself to jump.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.860
As his foot slips, he stops himself, trying
to remember if he had left even just a single

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.189
tablet somewhere.

00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:20.809
He digs through his mind and recalls one being
left in his old tin container.

00:13:20.809 --> 00:13:24.050
He searches through the boxes and finds it,
but Gennady breaks in, and Eddies trips on

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.389
a box, losing the pill.

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:30.209
Gennady's goons pin Eddie down, and Gennady
shows Eddie an even better way of using N.Z.T.

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:32.949
He dissolves it and injects it directly into
his bloodstream.

00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:35.910
He says it's more potent this way and even
lasts longer.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.170
Eddie looks around at his assailants and notices
one of them has a blind eye.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.210
Gennady takes out several medical instruments,
including knives, blades, and pliers, intending

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.639
to torture Eddie into giving him more N.Z.T.

00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:48.480
The henchmen start grinding into the safe
in the next room while Gennady approaches

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.100
Eddie, but Eddie stabs him with a knife he
had earlier concealed.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.480
The two struggle and Eddie drives the blade
into Gennady, killing him.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.839
Eddie lays on the floor next to a bleeding
Gennady.

00:13:56.839 --> 00:14:00.209
He eyes the needle Gennady had used to inject
the N.Z.T. and decides to drink Gennady's

00:14:00.209 --> 00:14:02.360
blood, hoping to get some of the N.Z.T. into
him.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.879
It works, and his brain starts working at
total capacity.

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:08.970
He lays on the floor and waits for the half-blind
henchman to come back.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.300
As the henchman flips Eddie over, he spits
out the syringe needle directly into the man's

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.199
seeing eye, blinding him completely.

00:14:14.199 --> 00:14:18.279
The other henchman runs in, but Eddie outsmarts
them, hiding in a room and using a T.V. to

00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:19.660
bash his pursuant's head.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.529
Eddie runs, but a henchman catches up to him,
choking him.

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:26.059
Eddie kicks him off, and the blind henchman
shoots the other henchman by accident.

00:14:26.059 --> 00:14:29.459
The blind henchman then starts firing his
gun, hoping to hit Eddie, but Eddie manages

00:14:29.459 --> 00:14:32.999
to disable him by pushing the man into a window
using a piano.

00:14:32.999 --> 00:14:35.050
At the hospital, Hank Atwood dies.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.660
Eddie appears at the hospital and sits next
to the driver.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.430
He wonders how Atwood died even though they
successfully got the N.Z.T. pills for him.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.920
The driver then helps Eddie find Brandt, finding
out that Brandt had kept the pills for himself

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.550
rather than give them to Atwood.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.930
They find the drugs in Brandt's closet.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.630
Several years pass, and Eddie is now running
for governor.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.639
He gets a call that a man representing a large
pharmaceutical firm is waiting for him in

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:55.819
his office.

00:14:55.819 --> 00:14:58.160
Eddie is surprised to see that the man is
Carl.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.059
Carl tells Eddie he left Wallstreet a while
back and is now in the pharmaceutical industry.

00:15:02.059 --> 00:15:05.800
Carl reveals that he now knows about N.Z.T.,
telling Eddie that the company he owns manufactures

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.010
the drug.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.480
Carl offers Eddie a steady supply of N.Z.T.
in exchange for a few favors he would later

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.480
ask.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.950
Eddie refuses Carl's offer, but Carl warns
that the illegal N.Z.T. labs have all been

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:18.580
shut down, telling Eddie that they alone manufacture
the N.Z.T. now.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.290
Eddie then reveals that he doesn't take N.Z.T.
anymore.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.790
He had the drug tweaked and edited a while
back, removing the side effects.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.270
He slowly took less and less N.Z.T. until
he no longer depended on it, but the effects

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.259
of the drug remained permanent on him.

00:15:30.259 --> 00:15:33.970
The modified N.Z.T. had permanently altered
his brain patterns, and now, Eddie's brain

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.379
is fully unlocked even off the drug,

00:15:36.379 --> 00:15:40.240
Eddie shows this by predicting a van would
hit a car because the driver is distracted.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.050
Carl looks over, and it happens.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:46.029
Eddie then places his hand on Carl’s chest,
saying he detects several problems with Carl’s

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:47.029
heart.

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:49.699
Carl warns Eddie that he would be a brutal
enemy, but Eddie is not threatened, saying

00:15:49.699 --> 00:16:01.149
he’d always be fifty steps ahead of him.
