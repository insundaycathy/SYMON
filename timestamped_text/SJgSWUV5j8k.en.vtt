00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.280
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.760
Today I will show you a Drama, Mystery,&nbsp;
Sci-fi film from 2015, titled Project Almanac.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.360
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.280
Watch out and take care.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.960
High school senior genius - David is testing&nbsp;
an experiment with his friends Adam and Quinn.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.480
The video is for a scholarship to MIT University.&nbsp;
David shows off an aircraft he made that he can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.520
control with a material placed on his fingers.&nbsp;
The gang sets the craft loose outside when someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.640
calls David's phone, jamming the signal on Quinn's&nbsp;
laptop to connect with the craft. The craft&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.760
plummets to the ground and crashes. Still the&nbsp;
experiment was a complete success in David’s eyes.&nbsp;

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.880
A few weeks later David’s sister (Christina) is&nbsp;
the camera operator and is filming as David gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.400
an envelope from MIT. He gathers with Christina&nbsp;
and their mom Kathy, along with Adam and Quinn,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.440
to open it. David gets into MIT, but&nbsp;
to his disappointment, he only receives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.440
$5,000 instead of the proposed $45,000.
At school, we learn that David has a crush&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.560
on a girl named Jessie Pierce. Back home,&nbsp;
David and Christina discover that Kathy is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.520
trying to sell the house to help her son with MIT&nbsp;
tuition. David is rummaging through the attic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.080
trying to find one of his father’s ideas to&nbsp;
submit for reappraisal for the scholarship to MIT.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.920
Christina comes upstairs and they find a videotape&nbsp;
of David's 7th birthday party. It was the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.720
day the two saw their dad Ben before he died&nbsp;
in a car crash. The two look at the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.400
David notices something strange - he, in his&nbsp;
current age, is physically visible in the video.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.680
He shows the tape to Adam and Quinn, both of them&nbsp;
are surprised. Christina still tries to find some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.320
logic in this, but then David shows his shirt.&nbsp;
He is wearing the same shirt as in the video.&nbsp;

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.120
David obsesses over the video and notices&nbsp;
details like a blue stain on his shirt and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.920
holding keys with a ballerina figure keychain.&nbsp;
He looks in his bag and notices he's actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.280
holding Jessie's bag. David goes over to return&nbsp;
it to her and awkwardly tries to talk to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.720
He returns the bag, and she&nbsp;
congratulates him on getting into MIT.&nbsp;

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.760
The gang retraces the steps from the old video&nbsp;
footage to see what David was doing in it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.400
they find a light switch to the basement. They&nbsp;
go downstairs and uncover a secret hatch in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.480
floor containing blueprints for a temporal&nbsp;
relocation prototype or a time machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.520
At first David himself thinks that this is&nbsp;
crazy, they can’t build a time machine, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.560
then Quinn says they already built it considering&nbsp;
the old videotape. The boys get excited and begin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.440
to gather the materials they need from home depot&nbsp;
to build it. Initially the machine appears to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.960
working, creating electromagnetic energy, then&nbsp;
it all goes haywire. They learn how to control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.000
the time machine navigation with the help of a&nbsp;
graphics processor from Quinn’s XBOX. They are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.800
having fun while building the time machine. David&nbsp;
points out that with the charge they have now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.280
the furthest they can go back in time is three&nbsp;
weeks. They manage to activate something that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.080
causes objects in the basement to levitate, water&nbsp;
in a glass to whirlpool, and as Quinn puts his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.520
hand on the time machine primary device, his hand&nbsp;
is traveling between space-time. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.120
the batteries keep short-circuiting. David’s shirt&nbsp;
gets stained the same way as in the old videotape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.200
They deduce that they are close to finishing&nbsp;
the machine, motivating the gang even after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.400
a failed attempt. After a few failed tests, they&nbsp;
conclude that they need hydrogen for power fusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.440
Since you can’t legally obtain it as teenagers,&nbsp;
they decide to steal hydrogen canisters from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.080
school to charge their batteries properly.
The group doesn’t have a power source big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.680
enough to supply the device. A party is happening&nbsp;
next door. Jessie brings her car and parks it in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.720
David's driveway. They decide to hook up their&nbsp;
cables to Jessie’s car battery to test their next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.440
experiment: they are trying to send Christina's&nbsp;
red toy Corvette one minute back in time. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.160
manage to activate the machine. Just as Jessie&nbsp;
comes in, she sees what they're doing to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.120
car. The room begins to shake, and objects start&nbsp;
floating, and then all the power on the street&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.080
goes out. When the lights go back on, the gang&nbsp;
sees that the toy car did go through the time and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.960
is somehow fused to the wall, and it went back two&nbsp;
hours. They look at the GoPro that they attached&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.800
to the car and see that it was already sitting&nbsp;
there recording them as they set up the machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.280
At school David makes a sketch of the time&nbsp;
machine in a backpack to carry it with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.680
In the meantime, Quinn flops his chemistry test.
After seeing Jessie’s keychain, she joins the gang&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.320
as they show her David's birthday video and prove&nbsp;
what they can do. They get together that night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.640
in the neighborhood, and after tinkering with&nbsp;
the machine, they attempt to go back 24 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.920
After setting up go-pro to film everything,&nbsp;
they activate the machine and jump through time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.560
The gang is left deafened and disoriented for a&nbsp;
brief moment trying to come back to their senses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.120
They then run to Quinn's home, where&nbsp;
Quinn was sleeping the previous night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.480
Quinn draws a smiley face on his sleeping self’s&nbsp;
neck. Past Quinn then rolls over and wakes up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.440
sees his future self. This causes a glitch in&nbsp;
time, and the two of them start to disappear.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.920
The gang runs out of there and then excitedly&nbsp;
jumps for the fact that they have successfully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.320
time-leaped. When they get back to the area&nbsp;
where they made the jump, they find a dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.560
As they drive through the streets, they&nbsp;
notice many "missing dog" flyers that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.680
weren't there earlier. They return the dog to&nbsp;
its rightful owner. Jessie drives everyone home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.720
David tries to kiss her in the car, but he&nbsp;
interrupts it, and the exchange becomes awkward.&nbsp;

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.080
They start to imagine the possibilities of their&nbsp;
newfound ability and decide to utilize it for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.040
personal matters as long as they all time-jump&nbsp;
together. Quinn uses it to do his chemistry test&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.120
until he finally aces it. The third time was&nbsp;
the charm. Christina uses it to catch Sarah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.760
moments after she caused Christina to spill her&nbsp;
drink, only for Future Christina to show up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.880
purposely spill drinks on Sarah, humiliating&nbsp;
her and declaring, "I'm everywhere, b*tch!"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.840
Adam has the gang time jump so they can win the&nbsp;
lottery. However, he only got five out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.200
six numbers right, and after taxes, they only&nbsp;
make 1.8 million. They are saddened because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.880
main prize was 53 million dollars. The gang goes&nbsp;
on a spending spree, Quinn uses the money to buy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.480
himself a cool car. David gives Kathy money so&nbsp;
she doesn’t have to sell the house. Christina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.760
goes shopping. Also David orders better parts&nbsp;
for the time machine to extend their time leap to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.560
ten years. Quinn brings a food truck line to the&nbsp;
school and feels proud when his name is chanted.&nbsp;

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.000
During class, David pulls the gang out of class&nbsp;
to meet under the bleachers. They jump to three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.800
months ago for Lollapalooza. They are having&nbsp;
the time of their life, everything is possible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.240
and there are no consequences. They watch their&nbsp;
favorite bands play and even score VIP passes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.160
(after getting them cheaply on eBay in the&nbsp;
present) to go backstage and hang with the band.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.080
They hang on water slides and party all day.&nbsp;
Before the day is over, David goes over to Jessie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.720
as she checks out the wall that says, "Before the&nbsp;
world ends..." with some things people would do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.800
Jessie drops HUGE hints to David, like&nbsp;
going to the statement that reads,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.520
"Before the world ends, I want to fall in&nbsp;
love." David misses the chance to make his move,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:51.360
making him regret that. Christina and Adam hook&nbsp;
up. David depressingly calls off the whole thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.560
and they jump back to the present, where only 41&nbsp;
seconds have passed. David and Jessie keep their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.680
distance. The present started to change.&nbsp;
Kathy was jobless, but suddenly David and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.960
Christine discovered she has a job. Christine’s&nbsp;
arch-nemesis Sarah is her best buddy, and Quinn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.520
has over 18 thousand Instagram followers.
After rewatching the video from the music&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.240
festival, David, frustrated with this&nbsp;
outcome, jumps back alone to Lollapalooza,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.480
even though they made ground rules to always&nbsp;
jump together no matter what. He makes his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:26.000
move on Jessie. He kisses her and then returns to&nbsp;
the present. He's in his room and tries calling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.680
Jessie, only to see her phone is on his desk. She&nbsp;
emerges from the bathroom wearing only a towel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:38.080
David asks her if they had sex. She says yes.
The two become an item, David notices odd things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.760
Kathy never was hired for her job position.&nbsp;
At the school basketball captain, Justin has a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:50.080
broken leg. The chemistry teacher is fired. Sarah&nbsp;
walks by David crying. There's a banner hung up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.200
that reads "Titans Basketball - Better Luck Next&nbsp;
Year.” After school, David learns from Adam and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.800
Quinn that there was a plane crash that killed 77&nbsp;
people, including Sarah's dad, who was the pilot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:06.000
The boys start to deduce that it’s their fault, a&nbsp;
ripple effect because Justin broke his leg, Titans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.480
didn’t make it to playoffs, player parents didn’t&nbsp;
attend the game, and it kept escalating beyond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.120
their imagination. Everyone tries to convince&nbsp;
David that they have to go back and make it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.560
so they never went to Lollapalooza,&nbsp;
meaning he and Jessie never happened.&nbsp;

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.320
The gang meets up at night when David&nbsp;
tells Adam that he jumped alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.760
Despite Adam telling him not to do it again,&nbsp;
David jumps back alone to the night of the party.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.320
After he and the others killed the power when they&nbsp;
time leaped Christina's toy car, David runs into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.320
the street and pushes Justin out of the path&nbsp;
of a car to prevent him from breaking his leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:42.000
The other partygoers hail him as a hero. David&nbsp;
jumps back to the present and sees that not only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.520
did the team win the championship, but the plane&nbsp;
landed safely. However, Adam lands in the hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:53.040
following an incident after the basketball game.
David becomes increasingly anxious by the burden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.680
of trying to solve everything independently. He&nbsp;
runs home and tries to figure out how to stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.680
Adam from being hurt. He gets the machine&nbsp;
ready when Jessie comes into the basement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.640
They both jump through time, and David is&nbsp;
forced to explain that he jumped alone to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.200
go back and make his move on her. Jessie is&nbsp;
hurt and admits that she liked David since she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.920
first met him and would use the machine to go&nbsp;
back and meet him sooner. Then, Jessie's past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.800
self comes by, and once they see each other,&nbsp;
she completely vanishes into thin air, leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:26.480
behind only her car keys, which David grabs.
Seeing no other way out, David decides he must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.240
jump all the way back to his 7th birthday&nbsp;
to prevent the machine from ever existing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:36.160
Unfortunately he doesn’t have any hydrogen left.&nbsp;
Quinn goes to his home after Jessie goes missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.320
David explains the whole situation to&nbsp;
him and apologizes for his mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.960
The police then show up at David's home,&nbsp;
suspecting him in Jessie's disappearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.760
David escapes his home and runs to the school,&nbsp;
where he takes one more hydrogen canister.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.000
He fuels the machine just as the cops&nbsp;
barge in, moments before he makes the jump.&nbsp;

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.000
David goes back ten years and makes it home. He&nbsp;
sees himself in the mirror, right where the video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.080
first got him. He follows his dad to the basement,&nbsp;
and they come face-to-face. Ben recognizes his son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.880
and realizes he got the machine to work. David&nbsp;
tells him that there are no second chances and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.920
that they need to stop this. The two of them&nbsp;
hug, and Ben leaves. David gathers all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.960
components of the time machine and burns them.&nbsp;
His body repeatedly flickers until he vanishes.&nbsp;

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.560
David is back in the present, looking in the attic&nbsp;
where Christina finds him. They find both of their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.720
dad's video cameras, which have footage of what&nbsp;
they were doing and saying mere seconds ago.&nbsp;

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.960
The gang is at school during the moment&nbsp;
when David sees he has Jessie's bag.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.520
He goes over to give it to her with more&nbsp;
confidence, and he repeats a statement that Jessie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.400
made to him the first time they spoke. When she&nbsp;
asks how he knew what she was going to say, David&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.800
leans in and says, "This is gonna sound crazy,&nbsp;
but I think we're about to change the world."

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.200
The End.
