00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.080
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm&nbsp;
going to explain a comedy, crime,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.560
and drama film called "Robot and Frank."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.080
A faint light shines on a keyhole&nbsp;
as someone tries to pick it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.840
A burglar enters the home and rummages through&nbsp;
the belongings of the unsuspecting owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.360
He grabs all the jewelry and money, but&nbsp;
a picture frame grabs his attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.600
It is the owner's family, and the burglar,&nbsp;
Frank, realizes what he's doing and leaves.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.120
In Cold Spring New York, Frank cleans up some&nbsp;
broken glass and deposits a frame into his safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.960
He tries to eat his cereal but finds&nbsp;
that the milk has spoiled. After a while,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.280
he receives a call from his daughter,&nbsp;
Madison, who is currently in Turkmenistan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.320
She assures him that she's well and&nbsp;
checks up on his Father’s condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.040
The connection suddenly gets cut&nbsp;
off, leaving Frank disappointed.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.480
Frank walks down the road, and a remarkably thin&nbsp;
vehicle passes him. He arrives at the library,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.400
and there, Jennifer, the librarian, meets him. He&nbsp;
dusts off his ancient flirting skills and asks for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.960
her phone number. Jennifer laughs but denies&nbsp;
his proposition. As they try to find a book,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.840
a robot named Mr. Darcy disrupts them. Jennifer&nbsp;
informs Frank about the library’s renovation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.040
saying that she won’t be working there anymore.&nbsp;
Frank then gets a call from his son, Hunter. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.040
talk about a restaurant down the street that Frank&nbsp;
intends to eat at, only to realize they've closed.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.960
Meanwhile, Frank enters a shop. The kleptomaniac&nbsp;
within him cannot help but swipe items on display.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.560
The clerk notices this and threatens to call&nbsp;
the cops on him, so he acts innocent and leaves.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.840
While walking, his son catches up to him.&nbsp;
Hunter scolds his old man for not waiting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.600
Frank enters the car, and they drive home.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.200
At home, Frank criticizes Hunter's parenting,&nbsp;
saying he shouldn't buy his kids toys and gadgets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.040
Hunter agrees to disagree and changes the&nbsp;
conversation to Frank's messy home. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.760
confronts his father about his memory problem, but&nbsp;
Frank is too proud to accept any help. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.640
Hunter's excitement doesn't dissolve as he leads&nbsp;
Frank to his car. In the trunk is a robot. Frank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.760
instantly expresses his dissatisfaction,&nbsp;
but Hunter says to give it a chance.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.960
The robot turns on and greets Frank; Frank&nbsp;
interrogates him by asking why it knows who he is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.160
The robot enters the home to clean up the&nbsp;
mess and whips something up for them to eat.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.560
At the dinner table, Frank asks about&nbsp;
his ex-wife. Hunter says that she also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.480
has a robot that she appreciates, unlike&nbsp;
Frank. The robot then enters the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.920
with a freshly baked cake and offers&nbsp;
his assistance and company to Frank.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.360
He harshly denies it, causing Hunter to&nbsp;
show his frustration. Hunter stands his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.280
ground and says that the robot will stay or&nbsp;
else he'll send Frank to a retirement home.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.760
Hunter drives away, leaving the two standing on&nbsp;
the porch. Frank tries to turn the robot off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.000
but it requests for him to let&nbsp;
go so it can do the dishes.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.160
The robot does all the errands, from&nbsp;
taking out the trash to buying groceries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.440
seamlessly integrating itself into&nbsp;
Frank's life. It wakes up Frank,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.000
and he waves his hands in front of&nbsp;
it, again forgetting where the robot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.800
came from. For breakfast, the robot hands him a&nbsp;
piece of grapefruit, but Frank asks for cereal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.600
The robot says cereal is for children, and Frank&nbsp;
calls it stupid. While the robot talks about plans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.000
for them to start a garden, Frank leaves to get&nbsp;
some cookies. He ignores the robot, so it starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.600
to call Hunter. Frank pleads it not to because&nbsp;
he doesn't want to go to the retirement home.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.160
Leaves fall on a patch of soil the&nbsp;
robot's preparing. Frank sits from afar,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.800
staring at it judgingly. For lunch, Frank is&nbsp;
served a portion of healthy greens and rice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.120
He looks unhappy as he&nbsp;
desperately wants his cereal back.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.920
In the forest, they take a walk while Frank&nbsp;
expresses his hatred of hikes. He says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.240
he'd rather die than do what the robot wants him&nbsp;
to do. The robot guilt trips Frank by saying that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.240
it'll be sent back to the warehouse if he dies.&nbsp;
Frank changes his attitude and leads the way.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.440
The two arrive at the library, and Frank asks&nbsp;
the robot to wait outside. Mr. Darcy meets him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.840
at the desk, and he asks for Jennifer. Jennifer&nbsp;
is talking to the library’s new owner, Jake,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.360
and Frank introduces himself. He doesn't remember&nbsp;
the talk they had yesterday about the renovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.760
When Jake leaves, Frank&nbsp;
instantly forgets who he is.&nbsp;

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.760
……………………………….
An upset Frank observes as every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.640
book in the library gets taken. To try and cheer&nbsp;
him up, Jennifer shows him her most valuable book.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.800
Frank exits the library to see a group of kids&nbsp;
playing with the robot. He advises the robot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.960
to say self-destruct sequence initialized so&nbsp;
the kids won't bother it anymore. The robot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.160
doesn't understand, and they make their way to&nbsp;
the restaurant that Frank forgot was closed.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.120
At the store, Frank pockets another figurine. A&nbsp;
new clerk meets them who offers their lavender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.880
soaps. She compliments the robot, but the&nbsp;
woman from before shows aggression towards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.280
Frank. Frank sneakily returns the item while&nbsp;
the woman threatens to make a citizen's arrest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.680
He reveals his empty pockets&nbsp;
and proceeds to leave the store.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.760
On their way home, Frank complains to&nbsp;
his daughter about his new companion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.600
As they converse, Frank realizes that&nbsp;
the item he tried to steal is in the bag.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.480
The robot confesses that it got the&nbsp;
item as it thought that Frank forgot it.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.240
Back at home, Frank asks the robot&nbsp;
if it knows what stealing is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.400
He further asks if the robot is programmed to&nbsp;
obey the law, to which the robot replies no.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.480
With this newfound information, he feels as&nbsp;
though having the robot around isn't that bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.280
But the robot's sudden reminder of his&nbsp;
enema makes him retract that thought.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.160
The next day, Frank teaches the robot how to&nbsp;
pick a lock. They chat about Frank's past and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.640
his life as a criminal. The robot knows his past&nbsp;
allegations but not the James Bondesque stories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.920
he has. Frank was a jewelry thief living a life&nbsp;
of crime and excitement. After a while, the robot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.320
successfully picks the lock. The two form a bond&nbsp;
as Frank realizes what he and the robot can do.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.640
At the library, the two inspect the&nbsp;
scene of their first potential robbery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.280
Jennifer finally meets the robot and introduces&nbsp;
it to Mr. Darcy. The two talk about how technology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.600
has caught up to them. Books are now available&nbsp;
anywhere on the web; hence, the less of a need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.000
for actual libraries. She invites him for the&nbsp;
upcoming fundraiser, and Frank happily accepts.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.120
Later that night, Hunter calls Frank while they're&nbsp;
preparing. He complains about Madison scolding him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.680
for bringing Frank a robot. Hunter says that the&nbsp;
robot will stay whether Frank likes it or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.200
Strangely enough, he agrees, saying that&nbsp;
he wants to keep the robot for good.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.280
In the middle of the night, Frank and&nbsp;
the robot prepare to enter the library.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.840
Frank spraypaints the camera, and&nbsp;
then the robot picks the lock.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.960
Inside, the robot opens the bookcase while Frank&nbsp;
checks the building’s blueprints. He babbles on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.440
about his life, and the robot reminds him to be&nbsp;
quiet. Frank asks why it's wearing a space helmet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.480
and they exit the building, with Frank&nbsp;
unknowingly leaving his glasses behind.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.080
Morning arrives, and yet another&nbsp;
plate of healthy breakfast is served.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.760
Frank doesn't mind the food anymore as&nbsp;
he's too busy planning their next robbery.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.160
At the fundraiser, Frank stands out amongst the&nbsp;
crowd, looking timeless in his suit. Jennifer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.800
stands beside him, feeling uneasy. She tells Frank&nbsp;
about someone who broke into the library the night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.280
before. In the distance, the robot brings the&nbsp;
stolen book all wrapped up, but Frank signals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.360
him to abort. The two interact with the robots,&nbsp;
encouraging them to mingle with one another.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.320
Jake and his wife approach them, he compliments&nbsp;
Frank, but Frank mistook it as an insult.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.840
Jake laughs it off and steals Jennifer&nbsp;
for a while. The night continues,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.800
and Frank looks more and more&nbsp;
anxious at every passing second.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.120
Jake approaches him and asks him if he ever went&nbsp;
to prison. Frank neither confirms nor denies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.280
so Jake asks if he wears reading glasses.&nbsp;
Frank lies, and Jake asks him to leave.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.160
Jennifer returns to Frank after mingling with&nbsp;
the crowd. Frank expresses his concern as he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.600
finds it odd how everyone at the party looks&nbsp;
wealthy, but Jennifer thinks he just had too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.760
much to drink. Frank then zones out and focuses&nbsp;
on the piece of jewelry a woman is wearing.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.560
At home, Frank reviews images taken&nbsp;
from the party. He plans to rob again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.320
but this time, the robot doesn't want to help&nbsp;
him. The only way it will agree is if Frank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.320
guarantees there's no risk. He agrees with&nbsp;
that condition, and his gears start turning.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.880
Frank looks at a man from afar using his&nbsp;
binoculars. They talk about how the robot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.040
didn't speak to Mr. Darcy last night, seeming as&nbsp;
if Frank provokes the robot to show its sentience.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.600
Later that day, Jennifer visits Frank for&nbsp;
their dinner, disrupting his scheming session.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.800
He asks her to come back later, and she&nbsp;
leans her head on the door in frustration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.920
Frank finally opens the door,&nbsp;
only to see her driving away.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.160
Frank is back at his study table,&nbsp;
meticulously finalizing their plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.080
The robot is happy with Frank's regained&nbsp;
enthusiasm. He even challenges the robot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.560
to arm wrestle. He struggles embarrassingly,&nbsp;
but a sudden knock on the door interrupts them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.400
It's Madison, finally finding the time&nbsp;
to visit her father. They reconnect,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.720
and she says that she's there to save him. Madison&nbsp;
then whispers into the robot, turning it off.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.880
Later that day, Madison shares&nbsp;
her experiences in Turkmenistan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.560
Frank doesn't listen as he&nbsp;
worries about his friend.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.680
A new day comes, and Frank's morning is incomplete&nbsp;
as his companion is not there to greet him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.080
He approaches the robot and tries to wake it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.200
Madison returns home with some&nbsp;
groceries and a box of cereal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.720
Frank says he prefers the robot's cooking&nbsp;
and asks her to wake it up, but she refuses.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.080
In the woods, Frank is all alone as he observes&nbsp;
their target. He feels frustrated as his companion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.600
is not there to assist him. Frank returns&nbsp;
home and makes a mess of the kitchen as he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.680
looks for something. He asks Madison to make&nbsp;
some lasagna, and she accepts the challenge.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.880
Madison serves a sad bowl of pasta&nbsp;
with red sauce to her father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.680
He insults the dish and says he wants&nbsp;
to eat at the restaurant in the town.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.760
She reminds him that it's closed and asks&nbsp;
for him to appreciate the food she cooked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.280
With no choice, he eats the food, blurting&nbsp;
out that he doesn't need her to be with him.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.000
Morning arrives, and Frank makes his way&nbsp;
downstairs to see the living room spotless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.080
He confronts a busy Madison who says she just&nbsp;
finished cleaning up. Frank doubts his daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.320
and asks if she turned on the robot. She denies&nbsp;
his accusations and still refuses to turn the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.120
robot on. Frank snaps and throws a bag of pasta at&nbsp;
her, saying that the robot is not some slave that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.600
she can just turn on and off. Madison admits that&nbsp;
she used the robot, and he comforts his frustrated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.760
daughter. Frank again asks for her to turn&nbsp;
the robot on, saying he needs his friend back.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.560
The robot awakens, and Frank whispers that&nbsp;
they'll execute the robbery later at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.400
Night arrives, and Frank starts to explain&nbsp;
the plan. The target is the couple,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.480
Jake and his wife. They plan to steal jewelry&nbsp;
in their home while they're out for an event.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.520
Now that it knows all the details,&nbsp;
the robot asks how they’ll accomplish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.400
such a feat as their house will most&nbsp;
likely have top-notch security systems.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.640
Frank says that security systems are designed&nbsp;
by security companies and not thieves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.080
Someone like him can easily find a spot&nbsp;
that the system doesn't account for.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.360
The two sneak around the house, trying to find&nbsp;
a way in. Luckily, a door without an alarm is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.920
conveniently left open. Frank effortlessly finds&nbsp;
the safe, and the robot is tasked to try every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.480
lock combination until it gets it right. As&nbsp;
they try to leave, Jake and his wife arrive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.240
The two eavesdrop on the fighting couple, but the&nbsp;
fight quickly turns into passionate love-making.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.200
Back at home, Frank examines their spoils and is&nbsp;
shocked to find extremely high-quality jewelry.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.920
He hides it in his safe, but he&nbsp;
doesn't seem happy with the outcome.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.800
The next day, Frank and Madison lounge in&nbsp;
the backyard. Their relaxation time gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.640
interrupted by Jake and the sheriff. Jake&nbsp;
accuses Frank of stealing his belongings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.360
but Frank plays dumb. Meanwhile, the sheriff is&nbsp;
starstruck at the sight of the infamous thief.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.120
Despite being a prime suspect, the sheriff&nbsp;
believes that someone Frank’s age can't pull off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.720
such a complex robbery. He even invites Frank to&nbsp;
be his consultant. However, he rejects the offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.360
Before leaving, Jake shouts, saying he knows&nbsp;
Frank did it. The sheriff pulls him away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.120
knocking the drink off the table, which&nbsp;
the robot then catches instantaneously.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.440
The sheriff notices this and&nbsp;
leaves without saying anything.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.400
Later that day, Madison says her goodbyes.&nbsp;
Frank gives her some jewelry as a gift and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.320
assures her that it isn't from Jake. She&nbsp;
drives off, passing a van parked outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.320
Frank's home. Frank and the robot enter the&nbsp;
house and speculate what the van's doing there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.800
Smoke spews out the chimney as Frank burns up all&nbsp;
the evidence of the robbery. The robot warns Frank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.400
that the sheriff can use its memory against&nbsp;
him, advising Frank to reformat its memory.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.560
Frank frantically stores the jewelry&nbsp;
in a plastic bag. He tries to cut the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.000
piece in half, but he injures his&nbsp;
finger. The robot bandages him up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.840
and Frank grows unstable. Frank tells the&nbsp;
robot to call Hunter and tell him he's dying.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.960
Hunter drives to Frank's home looking anxious.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Frank lays in his bed to try and act&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:56.000
sick. Hunter enters the room and wakes his father&nbsp;
up. Frank puts on a show, acting all dramatic and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.240
emotional. He apologizes for not being a good&nbsp;
father, thanking Hunter for always taking care&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.480
of him. His son reminisces about their humble&nbsp;
past, but Frank transitions the conversation to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.720
his genuine objective, asking his son to take the&nbsp;
case filled with the stolen goods somewhere safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.240
Hunter is reluctant, but an intense cough&nbsp;
from his father makes him accept immediately.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.560
As Hunter drives off, the van blocks&nbsp;
him, and police start surrounding him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.720
The sheriff interrogates him and opens up the&nbsp;
trunk. Inside the bag are the figurines Frank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.800
stole from the store. Jake is still suspicious&nbsp;
and demands the sheriff to search the house.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.280
The police begin their search, and Hunter&nbsp;
worries about his supposedly sick father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.440
Frank gives him a cheeky look and says he's just&nbsp;
cooperating with the cops. Hunter is frustrated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.200
with his father's games and berates him about&nbsp;
pretending to be dying. He insults him and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.600
the robot, who stays silent throughout the mess.&nbsp;
Jake realizes something and suggests downloading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.480
the robot's memory. Jake starts hitting the robot,&nbsp;
but it suddenly initiates a self-destruct sequence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.120
and starts counting down. Frank runs out, but&nbsp;
Hunter assures them that the robot is lying.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.160
But as the countdown nears zero, they can't help&nbsp;
but run away, only to realize that it's lying.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.520
Frank drives away in Hunter's car,&nbsp;
picking the robot up in the backyard.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.720
Hunter sarcastically commends the&nbsp;
police, and Jake stands dumbfounded.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.120
In the car, the robot revisits the&nbsp;
idea of reformatting its memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.200
Frank doesn't want to do it and says they'll&nbsp;
just run off together. They stop at the library,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.600
lockpicking their way into Jennifer's office. He&nbsp;
shares his problem, and Jennifer realizes that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.320
took the book. Frank confesses, but the picture&nbsp;
frames grab his attention. He takes the photo of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.400
Jennifer and her husband and sees himself.&nbsp;
Frank realizes that Jennifer is his wife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.640
and with that realization, he kisses her. He&nbsp;
and the robot leave the library to walk home.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.400
In his room, Frank's condition deteriorates. The&nbsp;
robot urges him again to reformat its memory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.480
saying that they can continue to plan their next&nbsp;
heist afterward. It finally convinces Frank,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.320
and he agrees. Frank presses the button&nbsp;
at the back of the robot, turning it off.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.160
Days pass and Hunter approaches his father,&nbsp;
who has been entirely consumed by his memory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.560
loss. Frank has suffered the same fate as&nbsp;
his friend. He reunites with his family,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.480
eating at the same table, sharing laughs&nbsp;
and stories. As they say their goodbyes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.640
Frank hands Hunter a note. In it states to check&nbsp;
under the robot’s garden for the jewelry he stole.
