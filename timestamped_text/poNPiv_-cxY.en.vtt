00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.760
in an ancient japanese language the&nbsp;
1980s were the time of vinyl records&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.320

tells a teaching of his religious teacher torini&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.600

deceased person walks 40 steps away from one's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.040
tomb the dead rises again for a few minutes when&nbsp;
they see they are in a shroud then they die really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.880
rini dismissed his superstition&nbsp;
as their family was an atheist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.360
and they never prayed now tony combs her mom's&nbsp;
hair suddenly a window opens all by itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

now his mom gives him a scary look later rini&nbsp;
secretly observes her dad talking to her mom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.680
at midnight in rini's dream she sees a white&nbsp;
lady in her mom's room she was watching the&nbsp;&nbsp;

rini and tony to manage the house in the meantime&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.960
naturally these two were worried as in the 80s&nbsp;
cell phones were not available for emergencies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.840
now bondi was awake due to his fear he sees a&nbsp;
man in the graveyard a guy was searching for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.840
something with a torch now tony hears his mom's&nbsp;
bell ring when he checked the room the bell was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.400
still ringing but in the dare as soon as he sees&nbsp;

she was in a wheelchair as she&nbsp;
can't walk she had asthma too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.240
ian finds her in a game which makes her happy&nbsp;
next night tony heard his mom's voice on the radio&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.760
she was calling him he shuts down the radio&nbsp;
and horror but still hears his mom's voice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.680
tony do my hair he sees a shadow of one&nbsp;
white lady who makes him fall from his cot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.760
but suddenly out of the blue his mom's comb comes&nbsp;
into his hand when he checked it in the lights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.240
there was nobody at midnight ian was standing in&nbsp;
front of the room looking scared when bondi asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.240
what happened ian points at their mom's portrait&nbsp;
now bondi throws a white curtain to cover that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.960
portrait but the curtain stops in midair for&nbsp;
some time in front of that portrait then it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.600
advances at them with speed naturally bondi and&nbsp;
ian both scream like hell when rini arrives there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.880
bondi says mom's ghost had attacked them he points&nbsp;
at the portrait which was now covered in a curtain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.880
rini now calms both of them down in the next&nbsp;
scene we see grandma writing a letter in fear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.200
tony keeps his mom's bell and comb&nbsp;
near her grave and wishes for peace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.040
next day hendra tells rini that he saw a lady&nbsp;
during the funeral she was not from their village&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.800
i even checked the graveyard the night your mom&nbsp;
died but couldn't find anything fishy but what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.960
was shocking here was that i saw the same white&nbsp;
lady again in your house meaning reni's house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.680
hendra says some evil spirit has taken&nbsp;
her mother's form and the house is haunted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.400
meaning here it is clear that bondi saw hendra&nbsp;
that night in the graveyard when he was awake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.960
rini says it's natural for you to be superstitious&nbsp;
as you are a son of ustadji hendra convinces her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.040
that he is open-minded unlike his father rini&nbsp;
refuses hendra's offer of staying at his house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.440
now in the next scene we see grandmother walking&nbsp;
all by herself she was going somewhere pain was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.080
all over her face later rini finds her&nbsp;
grandmother's body in a well being dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.200
they conduct her funeral it seems somebody forced&nbsp;
her to commit suicide bondi was in terrible shock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.720
as he was the one who first saw his grandmother's&nbsp;
body rini finds her grandma's letter addressed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.560
a guy named buddyman rini and hendra meet that&nbsp;
guy he says he and her grandmother were close&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.080
but she had to marry his friend he says her&nbsp;
grandma was not ready for her dad's marriage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.720
to her mom their relationship was bitter due to&nbsp;
her mom's inability to conceive also at that time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.480
singing was considered a despised profession when&nbsp;
eventually mari had kids her grandma's suspicion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.080
grew too she believed milwaurty prayed to satan&nbsp;
for children not god rini didn't believe this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.360
story to convince her bodyman gave her a magazine&nbsp;
in which his article on the occult was published&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.440
he says they meaning the cult can't take them&nbsp;
if they stay together he advises rini to read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.640
the article to fully understand it now suddenly&nbsp;
a blind guy interrupts their meeting and reminds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.920
him of his massage timings now bondi in sleep&nbsp;
whispers that he will not kill ian i love him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.000
it seems he is possessed when rini arrived&nbsp;
back home he was in total possession isolated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.000
reni and tony think that he is still in shock&nbsp;
due to grandma's death now while sleeping bondi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.640
signals to ian in sign language that he will kill&nbsp;
him now ian was scared like hell at midnight ian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.080
hears a voice he follows that voice and as soon as&nbsp;
he opens the door from which it was coming he sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.640
a black hand with long fingernails he screams but&nbsp;
since he is mute there was no sound this one scene&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.560
is magnificent horror and truly iconic it really&nbsp;
scares you now ian tries to run but his shirt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.320
sticks to a nail he screams more with no sound&nbsp;
next day rini finds her mom's old vinyl record&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.720
when she plays it backward we hear chanting in an&nbsp;
ancient language later rini found ian outside in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.400
small box outside the house as he slept there the&nbsp;
whole night out of fear rini takes him inside and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.360
assures him that they all are with him now tony&nbsp;
after reading that article tells ladies who can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.560
conceive can join the demonic cult the cult will&nbsp;
grace them with children with one condition when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.080
their last child turns seven they must give it&nbsp;
to the cult tony explains a strange calculation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.320
rini is 22 years old he is 16 years old bondi&nbsp;
is 10 years old and ian will be seven in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.440
next three days he says their mom had children&nbsp;
at an interval of seven years to trick the devil&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.840
he says there were always a few strange&nbsp;
people around their mom during her parties&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:13.200
by showing a photo album he says he even asked&nbsp;
one guy once who he was that guy didn't answer the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.320
article says these were the members of the cult&nbsp;
when a kid turns seven the living dead arrives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.520
at their house to take that kid away they can take&nbsp;
the kid only if the family voluntarily allows it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.040
to all the story rini again dismissed it as&nbsp;
superstition now when rini was giving breakfast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:35.040
to ian grandma's chair moved all by itself rini&nbsp;
glimpses her grandma's crying image on the front&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.800
glass which makes her scared she asks susta g to&nbsp;
check the house as he is an expert on religion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.720
he checks the house and says there is&nbsp;
an evil spirit which is haunting them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.640
he advised them to pray to allah when rini was&nbsp;
getting ready to pray she again saw that white&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.560
lady in another room ian and bondi were sleeping&nbsp;
suddenly their room's door opened all by itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:03.040
ian again saw a ghost in black color which was&nbsp;
staring at bondi as rini prays a white looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:09.120
lady hovered around her as rini completes her&nbsp;
prayer a white lady attacks her after seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:16.080
her white face in hand rini runs to ustad ji's&nbsp;
house next day hendra says she is zombie since in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:22.880
ancient times such beings have been there they use&nbsp;
humans to propagate their kind tony says according&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.960
to this article one can't defeat them but they&nbsp;
can decline their demand by staying united&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.000
tony also says their biological dad must be&nbsp;
different members of the cult as all four look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.960
so divisively different it was strange their&nbsp;
dad never thought why they looked so different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.000
now hendra gets a call from buddymen&nbsp;
he asks rini and hendra to meet him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:49.040
but only hendra visits bootyman hands in his new&nbsp;
article while playing his tape loud he whispers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:54.320
something in hendra's ear he did that to block any&nbsp;
evil spirits from listening to their conversation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.200
but now while coming back hendra faces an&nbsp;
accident and dies instantly on the road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.360
at the buddyman's house a blind guy comes without&nbsp;
notice buddyman tries to shoe him off with a stick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.640
as he thought he may be a member of the cult in&nbsp;
the house bondi was ready to kill ian with a knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.400
in time rini takes away his knife the&nbsp;
villagers bring hendra's body to the village&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.880
astaji conducts his funerals in disbelief rini&nbsp;
finds bodyman's letter from hendra's belongings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.040
at night rini heard a noise when&nbsp;
she checked it was hendra's zombie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:32.000
he tried to drag greenie from his house&nbsp;
as the rini screams tony and ian jumps to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.280
help their sister meanwhile stad g offers&nbsp;
no help as he was too devastated in grief&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:43.280
now the kid's dad arrived there apparently he&nbsp;
was back from the city he takes all of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.880
back to their house rini explains everything&nbsp;
to him he was shocked at his mother's death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:55.440
he says tomorrow itself they will walk away from&nbsp;
their house after some time tony shouts help help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.280
ian was locked in the bathroom as they open&nbsp;
door we see someone guarding ian into the well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.880
ian's dad too jumps into the well and&nbsp;
saves him somehow we see a zombie-like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:12.000
black creature in a well now cult members who&nbsp;
were actually satan slaves surround their house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.960
as the family locks all their doors a lot&nbsp;
of paranormal activities start to happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.440
some force throws a wheelchair at them as panic&nbsp;
rips rini tony and dad get stuck in the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:30.080
while only ian and bondi were outside now some&nbsp;
supernatural power has attacked ian meanwhile&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:36.400
bondi comes out of possession now their dad preys&nbsp;
on the spirits of malwarty and grandma he thinks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.840
all of this is his fault in the background we hear&nbsp;
grandma's voice as an asthmatic patient breathing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:49.360
now bondi with courage tries to rescue ian as&nbsp;
soon as he touches ian evil power vanishes now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.000
his dad with a steel rod shouts at cult members&nbsp;
says he will not give any of his children away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.640
now cult members while moving away from their&nbsp;
house they throw something around the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.800
next day the family starts to leave the village&nbsp;
they also plan ian's surprise birthday party at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:11.920
midnight their taxi was supposed to arrive at 4pm&nbsp;

says sorry he stays at their house while walking&nbsp;
around the house rini finds a lot of red seeds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:25.760
even at 10 30 pm there was no sign of a taxi&nbsp;
just suddenly the electricity goes off later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.200
rini remembers hendra's letter after reading it&nbsp;
she says to tony that this is an updated article&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.120
according to this cult members arrives to give a&nbsp;
clue to the living dead she says all the red seeds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.480
are for awakening the living dead when the devil&nbsp;

to take good care of them so that they can't run&nbsp;
away now satanic music plays they dance we see a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.680
jar full of red seeds proving they were the head&nbsp;
of the cult in the film the cinematography sound&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.840
black and white color combination costume&nbsp;
design gives you a proper horror feeling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:40.240
in the film zombie is white and grandma's ghost&nbsp;
is black during rini's praying scene two different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:45.280
evils haunt the two characters the audience&nbsp;
will definitely overlook this menu at difference&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.200
ian never mentions that black hand to his&nbsp;
sister in the end he stops grandma's ghost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.440
with a single hand even when the ghost&nbsp;
was ripping all the furniture around him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:01.600
he was able to stop it as he was the devil's son&nbsp;
he was doing a drama of being a nice cute brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:07.760
grandma was telling bondi to kill ian i think he&nbsp;
might be a member of the cult as he was not that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.320
scared when he went to city he had no money&nbsp;
but when he returned he had all the wealth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.040
he might have left the cult long ago&nbsp;
he might not know this child thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.560
in trouble he prays to ghosts of morty and&nbsp;
ma at the end when the couple says we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:27.120
to keep them happy this time they might be&nbsp;
talking about dead malwarty's living dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.720
haunted and pressurized them so that they&nbsp;
could voluntarily give away their child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:37.760
at the end they did the same with no option so&nbsp;
