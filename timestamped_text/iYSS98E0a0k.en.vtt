they both check around the abandoned house&nbsp;
and observe the basement filled with water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.920
obviously they think there must have been a&nbsp;
flood lliya organized roma with a stag party&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.800
because he is nearly to get married to marina&nbsp;

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.920
he sits at the edge of the same lake as he calls&nbsp;
marina but she is engaged in some work roman jumps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.720
into that lake for swimming while swimming&nbsp;
roma realizes the presence of someone there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.040

found by marina in roma's cloth at laundry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.680
roma does not feel good and shows low&nbsp;
performance at swimming after this incident&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.560
his coach advises him to have more practice&nbsp;

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.000
he thinks it's marina and shouts as he rises to&nbsp;
check but sees no one because he suffers fever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.680
now marina thinks he is unwell because of work out&nbsp;
marina puts him to sleep and makes a video call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.080
with roma's sister olga informing her about the&nbsp;
roma's condition marina says he is acting strange&nbsp;&nbsp;

regains consciousness at the edge of swimming pool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.560
roma found himself admitted in hospital&nbsp;
because of dehydration diagnosed by the doctor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.800
in there with him marina olga and lliya he tells&nbsp;

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.640
the story she gets angry and leaves roma follows&nbsp;
her but he cannot walk well because of feebleness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.880
suddenly marina hears a strange voice and takes&nbsp;
its directions roma follows her and reaches in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.840
a room where he again encounters the mermaid in&nbsp;
marina form and the door gets locked before marina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.920
reaches there the mermaid is about to attack roma&nbsp;
until lliya breaks in olga understands everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.520
noticing all what's happening she goes to her&nbsp;
father first of all their father forbids to meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.840
them and asks to go upon hearing roma's encounters&nbsp;
with the girl at the lake he becomes devastated he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.720
weeps and tell them all what's happened 20 years&nbsp;
ago how their mother sacrificed herself to save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.840
him and from that day everything lost its meaning&nbsp;
except from the mermaid as he keeps remembering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.480
her every day of his life they moved to that&nbsp;
house in search of solution along with lliya&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.320
roma and marina stay at the house and olga goes&nbsp;
at that edge of lake with leah hoping they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.360
find something jumping into the lake he swims&nbsp;
to a grave which has an engraved name on it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.320
he reads it and also finds some dead bodies around&nbsp;
it one of the dead bodies come to life seeing it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.840
lliya tries to escape but the dead tries pulling&nbsp;
him down somehow he manages to come outside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.720
water with the help of olga he arrives at the&nbsp;
edge of the lake and tells the name of mermaid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.640
lisa grigorieva on the other side as marina&nbsp;
fetches water outside the house she observes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.520
a woman at the door of the cottage house going&nbsp;
there she observes it's a room where roma's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.960
mother perform rituals she then faces roma's&nbsp;
mother ghost chatting some words out of fear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.400
she runs back to the house she comes near roma and&nbsp;
suddenly a force pulls him towards the basement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.480
marina helps him the mermaid comes on site and&nbsp;
begins to pull roma marina kicks the mermaid and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.640
save him august suggests maybe it's all about the&nbsp;
comb and also stated the mermaid committed suicide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.680
in previous years suicide victims were&nbsp;
buried on the shores that's why the mermaid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.840
grave was found in the river after the lake&nbsp;
spilled over the shore when a dam was built&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.400
marina decides to perform the ritual just like&nbsp;
roma's mother used to maybe it would help she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.080
requests lliya to wait for her outside the cottage&nbsp;
and starts a ritual going inside meanwhile the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.000
mermaid appears before lliya and asks him the same&nbsp;
question do you love me he replies yes and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.640
bewitches him she also blitches roma and compels&nbsp;
him to come to the basement olga tries to stop him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.960
but gets attacked instead on the other side marina&nbsp;
starts the ritual she soaks the comb into water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.120
looking in the mirror she speaks the same&nbsp;
words she heard from roma mother's ghost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.640
the cone disappears immediately and the mermaid&nbsp;
appears drowning marina's face into water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.240
for unknown reason the mermaid reveals her past&nbsp;
after a proposal a young man deceived her by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.960
marrying another lady knowing this on the wedding&nbsp;
day she rages and murders them before committing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.640
suicide by jumping into the lake afterwards she&nbsp;
turned into mermaid and allures men into her end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:08.000
roma comes to his senses after being bewitched and&nbsp;
runs to the cottage he breaks in when the mermaid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.360
impersonates into marina in several numbers and&nbsp;
each of them asking do you love me he is able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.120
recognize the real marina and expresses his love&nbsp;
doing this all the witchcraft seems to be over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.520
everything seems normal the next morning lliya is&nbsp;
still bewitched by the mermaid accepting her love&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.000
he moves to the basement roma find him floating&nbsp;
on the water and then the mermaid takes lliya with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.360
her roma tries to save him but he is already&nbsp;
gone and also gets attacked by mermaid again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.840
at the same time marina and olga also&nbsp;
reach there and help roma to escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.320
and they all immediately leave that place covering&nbsp;
a distance their car break down suddenly rain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.760
starts roma comes outside to check the car the&nbsp;
mermaid appears to them again and waters start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.840
to fill in the car obviously caused by the mermaid&nbsp;
roma breaks the window glass saving olga an arena&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.560
roma wonders why the mermaid still follows&nbsp;
them after returning her comb and performing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:07.280
the rituals he gets to understand that she&nbsp;
will not stop pursuing him until she get him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.880
roma quickly moves back to the lake and marina&nbsp;
runs after him she falls and someone hits her on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.480
her head and goes unconscious the mermaid comes&nbsp;
near him as he reaches at the edge of lake she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.400
asked him again do you love me roma replies on it&nbsp;
yes but mermaid knows he's lying to stop all her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:30.400
torment and then suffocates him at the basement&nbsp;
we see olga trying to use marina as sacrifice in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.760
exchange for her brother as he ties her to a chair&nbsp;
it's clear she was the one that hit her marina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:42.000
pleads all good to stop it but she ignores at the&nbsp;
same time roma's father arrives there he reveals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.800
to olga sacrificing her in exchange will not work&nbsp;
only if she volunteers her life it can't be forced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.120
the mermaid appears before them and roma's&nbsp;
father requests the mermaid to spare life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.000
of everyone and taken with her she turns into&nbsp;
her mermaid form and takes him down the water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.720
seeing her father olga tries to stop her&nbsp;
but only gets the mermaid hair and pulls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.960
marina untie her hands and get a scissors she cuts&nbsp;
her hair the hair burns and the mermaid begins to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.640
feel unrest as her power is in her hair moment&nbsp;
later she takes olga with her in retaliation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.960
marina is unable to save olga and her father&nbsp;
but to save roma's life she quickly goes at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.600
the edge of the lake and finds him lying&nbsp;
or suffocating she reveals to roma that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.640
the power of the mermaid is in her hair not&nbsp;
the comb roma seems not to hear what marina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.720
is saying she jumps into the water intending&nbsp;
to cut the mermaid's hair with the scissors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.960
the mermaid faces marina after a while struggling&nbsp;
with her marina manages to cut some of her hair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.720
causing roma to be free from her power then marina&nbsp;
comes from the lake and both embrace each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:52.640
she then asks roma do you love me suspecting&nbsp;
her roma begins to cut her hair the mermaid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:58.000
came impersonating marina as he cuts her hair&nbsp;
she loses all her power and return into the lake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.400
