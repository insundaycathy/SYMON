00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.639
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.220
Today, I’m going to explain a horror, mystery,
and thriller film called “The Cabin in the

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.220
Woods.”

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.790
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.120
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:17.600
At a laboratory facility, engineers Steve
Hadley and Gary Sitterson discuss their plans

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.070
for an annual event to be held that evening.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.160
They’re approached by Wendy Lin, head of
the chemistry department, who tells them that

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.119
Stockholm, who’s also holding the same event,
has failed.

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.160
It’s now up to them and another competing
country, Japan.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.780
The men reassure Lin that they won’t mess
it up.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.840
Meanwhile, at a nearby university campus,
Dana Polk prepares her bag for her upcoming

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.760
weekend trip with her friends.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.070
Her best friend, Jules Louden, helps her pack
and shows off her new blonde hair.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.879
Jules’s boyfriend, Curt Vaughan, helps them
carry their bags.

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.300
All three hop into the camper van and are
joined by their stoner friend, Marty Mikalski,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.970
and a transferee student, Holden McCrea.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.960
Curt takes the steering wheel as they make
their way to his cousin’s cabin in the woods.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.360
Unbeknownst to the group, a man watches them
leave, contacts someone on his earpiece and

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.960
tells them that the camper has already left.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.520
At the lab, Hadley and Sitterson arrive at
the control room and meet Alex Truman, who

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.330
supervises the event.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.100
On the way to the cabin, the group stops by
a rundown gas station for a refill.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.350
They meet the owner, Mordecai, who is hostile
yet tells them the directions.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.780
They pass through a mountain tunnel, unaware
that they’re now entering an invisible dome.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.250
The group finally arrives at the cabin and
picks their rooms.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.120
Holden goes into his room and spots an eerie
painting.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.290
Feeling disturbed, he takes it down and discovers
a one-way mirror behind it.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.850
He shows the group the mirror, and Marty suspects
that it must be from the pioneer days.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.830
Holden offers to switch rooms with Dana, and
she thanks him for being decent.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.670
At the lab, Hadley and Sitterson are watching
every room through the cameras they’ve hidden

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.240
throughout the cabin.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.700
Lin arrives and reports that Jules’s blood
levels are normal, and they’re planning

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.380
to increase her libido.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.000
The employees at the lab make their final
betting choices for the night.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.040
Truman asks them how they can make a betting
contest out of this if they control the outcome.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.230
Handley and Sitterson tell him that they only
get the lambs into the arena; everything that

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.620
happens from there on is by choice of their
own free will.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.590
The group gets the party started by bringing
out the booze and turning on the music.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.719
They play truth or dare, and Jules decides
that it’s Dana’s turn.

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.260
Just as Dana chooses to dare, the cellar door
behind blasts open and interrupts their game.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.510
Jules dares Dana to check it out.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.469
Not one to chicken out, Dana brings a flashlight
and explores the cellar.

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.379
It’s full of knick-knacks from the previous
owners.

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.919
The group joins her in the basement and explores
the mysterious room.

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:49.650
Dana picks up a journal, Jules spies on a
locket, Holden opens a music box, Curt takes

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.409
a mysterious puzzle, and Marty spots a couple
of film reels.

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.799
Dana turns their attention to the journal
she found, and the group huddles around her.

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.829
The diary belonged to Anna Patience Buckner,
who lived in 1903 with her abusive and sadistic

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:03.949
family.

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.189
She starts to say something in Latin.

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.319
As she says the last word, the corpses of
the Buckner family rise from a nearby grave

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.349
and drag their way to the cabin.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.189
At the lab, the maintenance department cheers
as they win the betting pool.

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.169
It turns out that they betted that the Buckners
would be the one to eliminate the group.

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:23.839
Lin tells Truman that everything they have
in the dungeons is remnants of the old world

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:27.809
when the gods roamed the Earth and monsters
and magic had the upper hand.

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:31.290
As the night goes on, Marty tells Dana that
something weird is happening.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.349
He doesn’t understand why Jules is acting
like a dumb blonde when she’s in pre-med

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.719
and why Curt has suddenly turned into a high
school jock when in fact, he’s a sociology

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.079
major on a full academic scholarship at the
university.

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.559
He shares his theory that there might be puppeteers
controlling them, but Dana dismisses his points

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.459
to the joint that he’s smoking.

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.439
Meanwhile, the couple starts making out in
the woods, unaware that a room full of men

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:54.799
is watching them.

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.669
The engineers turn on the pheromone mists
to increase their sexual appetites and light

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.620
the way to a clearing where the couple can
have their little outing.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.859
Truman, together with Hadley and Sitterson,
watch as Jules and Curt make love on the ground.

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.109
Right on cue, the Buckners arrive and stab
a dagger into Jules’s hands.

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.319
Jules screams as Curt pins down one of the
undead.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.759
He gets impaled on the back but manages to
punch down the corpse.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:22.419
Jules runs towards her boyfriend, but she’s
chained down and dragged by another zombie.

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.500
The corpses surround her and hold her down,
while Curt can only watch in horror as they

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.270
cut off her head with a saw.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.960
The engineers say a little prayer at the lab
as they turn on the underground mechanism

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.129
and drain Jules’s blood into a pipeline
below to fill a stone tomb.

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:40.500
Back at the cabin, Marty smokes another joint
to keep his mind off the voices that he’s

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.500
hearing.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.360
He starts to freak out and decides to take
a leak outside.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.610
Curt appears, all bloodied and beaten up,
and drags him outside just before one of the

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.129
corpses can take another one of them down.

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:54.389
He tells the group that Jules is gone and
they should start barricading all the doors

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:55.819
and windows in the cabin.

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:00.500
Dana refuses to leave and opens the door,
only to face another zombie who tosses Jules’s

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.650
severed head.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.520
Dana screams as the boys push against the
door.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.580
She comes to her senses and helps them lock
down the door.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.199
Curt tells them that no matter what happens,
they have to stay together.

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.669
Hadley sighs in frustration as he listens
to the conversation.

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.580
This isn’t ideal for them, so Sitterson
presses a button that releases gas through

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.110
the cabin vents that lowers cognition.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.210
Curt inhales the gas and suddenly changes
his mind.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.919
He tells the group that they should split
up so that they cover more ground.

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.270
One of the zombies breaks down the door, and
the group separates and hides in their rooms.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.660
The engineers press another button and lock
the bedroom doors.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.980
Marty is in full panic mode and knocks off
a lamp as he closes a window shut.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.460
As he looks at the broken lamp, he sees a
tiny hidden camera.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.370
The color is drained from his face as he pulls
a long cable hidden within the walls.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.870
Marty’s suspicions are correct.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.199
Someone is watching them.

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.310
The window behind bursts open as John Buckner’s
corpse drags him outside.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.509
Marty narrowly escapes his knife.

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.840
He hits him with his thermos and runs away.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.169
The corpse throws his knife at Marty’s back
and pins him down.

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.889
Marty screams as the corpse drags him back
to his grave, and his blood is spilled and

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.349
drained into the underground stone tomb.

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.599
The ground rumbles as the gods accept the
second sacrifice.

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.770
Meanwhile, Dana is trapped in her bedroom.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.539
Another undead makes its way to her window,
and Holden rescues her by breaking the one-way

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:20.620
mirror.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.469
They find another door on the floor and escape
through it.

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:27.840
Dana realizes that it’s the torture room
from the journal, and there’s no way out.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.980
One of the corpses catches Holden and drags
him outside, but she manages to stop it by

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.569
driving a crowbar right into its neck.

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:37.240
She grabs a knife and starts stabbing the
undead.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.719
Suddenly, a door opens in the room and reveals
Curt.

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:44.259
He leads them through another door, and they
finally escape the cabin.

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:47.910
They pile into the camper, and Curt steps
on the gas so that they could escape this

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:48.910
hellhole.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.430
Meanwhile, Japan has failed in its sacrifice
to the gods.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.509
Now it’s up to Hadley and Sitterson.

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:58.560
The duo panic as they see the camper heading
towards the mountain tunnel and realize that

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.939
there’s no cave-in.

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:04.319
The demolition team was supposed to initiate
an explosion a few minutes earlier.

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:08.439
Sitterson runs to the pyrotechnics department
and fixes the wires himself.

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:12.509
He finally gets the operation going, and an
explosion erupts in the tunnel just before

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:14.380
the group can make their way out.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.410
They quickly back away and manage to exit
safely.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.520
Curt curses out of frustration as they realize
that they’re only one jump away from their

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.520
escape.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.180
They come up with a plan, and Curt decides
to jump with his motorcycle and then run to

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.249
town for help.

00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:30.360
Dana begs Curt to be careful as he steps on
the gas.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.990
He backs away and fully revs towards the gap
between the two roads.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.090
Curt makes the jump and almost makes it until
he smashes straight into the invisible force

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.090
field.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.450
He is instantly killed and is thrown into
the deep trench together with his wrecked

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.669
motorcycle.

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:47.370
Dana screams for her friend as Holden takes
her away into the camper.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.469
The gods have now received their third sacrifice.

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:54.669
In the camper, Dana realizes that Marty was
right all along.

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:57.349
Someone is watching them and controlling their
every move.

00:07:57.349 --> 00:08:01.220
They will never escape here unless they find
a way to reveal who’s behind this.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.560
Suddenly, one of the corpses appears behind
Holden and stabs him through the throat.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.490
The gods have now received their fourth sacrifice.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:12.659
Dana screams as the camper goes out of control
and they’re thrown into the lake.

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:15.520
She swims up for air and manages to escape.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.840
Meanwhile, everyone is celebrating in the
control room.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.599
Hadley tells Truman that the ritual is now
complete.

00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:25.639
The virgin’s death, in this case, Dana being
the virgin, is optional.

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:29.900
It doesn’t matter whether she lives or dies;
the main thing is that she suffers.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.809
It’s now up to fate.

00:08:31.809 --> 00:08:35.750
Dana swims up to the surface and takes deep
breaths as she realizes all of her friends

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.849
are dead.

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:40.120
The corpse has now emerged and starts strangling
her.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.530
Everything that’s happening is being viewed
in the control room as the employees start

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.050
having a party to celebrate their win.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:50.220
Sitterson approaches the demolition team and
jokes with them for almost failing them.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.750
The team insists that they didn’t get their
order because there was a power glitch from

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:54.940
upstairs.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.930
One of the college students must have messed
up with the wires they have hidden in the

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.279
killing field.

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:02.660
But who can it be when all of them, except
Dana, is dead.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.500
Suddenly, a call interrupts their party.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.250
Hadley stops the celebrations as he answers
the call.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.959
It’s the Director.

00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:14.139
It turns out one of the students is still
alive, and the ritual isn’t complete.

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:18.350
Meanwhile, as Dana crawls her way to one of
the loose boards, the corpse collapses behind

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.350
her.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.269
She turns around and sees Marty, who’s still
alive.

00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:25.459
She grabs the board and slams the undead back
into the lake.

00:09:25.459 --> 00:09:29.310
The two make a run for it, and Marty drags
her inside one of the graves.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.220
He closes the steel door before any more of
the corpses can kill them.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.139
Dana can only look in horror as she sees a
tunnel and the dismembered remains of one

00:09:37.139 --> 00:09:38.529
of the corpses.

00:09:38.529 --> 00:09:42.170
She tells Marty that she’s the only one
who survived as he tinkers with the control

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:43.180
box.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.810
It turns out he was the one who created the
power glitch that the demolition team was

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.150
talking about.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.000
Dana tells Marty that he was right all along.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.550
He shows her the elevator that he discovered
and tells her that someone sent those zombies

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.780
after them.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.180
If they want to escape, this is the only way
out.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.190
They hop into the elevator with the severed
zombie arm.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:05.100
The elevator takes them deep into the dungeons
as they come face to face with more monsters

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.639
in glass cages.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:10.450
Dana realizes that whoever is watching them,
these people made them choose how they die

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:13.220
based on the things they were playing within
the cellar.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.180
She screams and pounds her fists on the glass
as she realizes that she’s the reason why

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.870
all of her friends are dead.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.779
Meanwhile, in the control room, all hell has
broken loose.

00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:26.940
Sitterson sends security to shoot Marty so
that the ritual can be completed.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.830
Dana must die last so she will not be touched.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.660
Lin then informs Hadley that whatever Marty’s
been smoking, it’s been making him immune

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.009
to all their chemical adjustments.

00:10:36.009 --> 00:10:40.950
The elevator doors soon open, and Dana and
Marty come face to face with an armed guard.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:44.320
The zombie’s arm distracts the guard, and
he starts shooting at it.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.270
They take him out and grab his gun and the
zombie’s knife.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:51.380
They find themselves in a hallway of elevators,
and a man starts speaking through the speaker

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.380
system.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.019
The man tells them to give up and allow themselves
to be sacrificed.

00:10:56.019 --> 00:11:00.230
The two hide in one of the operator rooms
as a whole squad starts firing at them.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.260
Dana spots the controls and hits the warning
button.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:08.220
All the elevators open and release an army
of monsters who instantly takes down the squad.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:12.850
In a matter of minutes, the demons take over
entire floors, eliminating and torturing every

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.220
employee they see.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:18.920
Hadley, Sitterson, and the rest have locked
themselves in the control room.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.170
Their defenses have been overridden, and there
is no way out.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:26.540
Dana and Marty quickly get out of the room
and escape through a hole in the hallway.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.380
Back at the control room, the monsters have
managed to break down the steel door and take

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.310
Truman down immediately.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:36.339
Hadley fires his gun as Sitterson puts in
the code for the escape hatch leading downstairs.

00:11:36.339 --> 00:11:41.500
An explosion erupts, and Hadley is blasted
into the air and is eaten by a merman.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.040
Sitterson opens the hatch and escapes as Lin
is taken away by a giant octopus.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.170
He runs through the dark hall and is stabbed
in the chest by a terrified Dana.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:54.529
As he sits down dying, he tells Dana to do
the right thing and kill Marty.

00:11:54.529 --> 00:11:58.459
Marty hands her the gun, and they go further
into the tunnel until they find themselves

00:11:58.459 --> 00:12:02.930
inside a chamber surrounded by five stone
tombs with etchings filled with their friends’

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:03.930
blood.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.850
The Director reveals herself and finally tells
them the truth.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.870
Dana, Marty, and the rest of their friends
are part of an annual ritual sacrifice.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:17.230
The whore, who is corrupted, dies first, then
the athlete, the scholar, the fool, and the

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.230
virgin.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.800
If they don’t make the sacrifice, the gods
who rule the Earth will rise again and create

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.779
havoc, pain, and suffering.

00:12:23.779 --> 00:12:27.620
She tells them that the sun is coming up in
eight minutes, and if Dana wants to survive

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.870
and save the rest of humanity, she must kill
Marty.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:34.070
With a trembling hand, Dana raises the gun
at her friend.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:38.250
Marty can only stare in disbelief as he realizes
what she’s about to do.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.259
As Dana contemplates shooting her friend,
a werewolf appears behind her and bites her

00:12:42.259 --> 00:12:43.470
on the neck.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:47.149
She throws away the gun as Marty fends off
the Director and picks it up.

00:12:47.149 --> 00:12:50.000
He shoots the werewolf and sends it out, whimpering.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.069
The Director punches Marty, and a struggle
ensues.

00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:56.690
This time, the corpse of Patience Buckner
appears with her ax.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:01.160
The Director grabs the gun and sees her chance,
but Marty manages to pull her on top and shield

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.139
himself as the corpse hacks the ax into her
head.

00:13:04.139 --> 00:13:07.480
He gets away and pushes the two into the raging
depths below.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.639
Marty backs away and joins Dana on the steps
as the room crumbles around them.

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:16.070
She apologizes to him for even considering
shooting him, but Marty reassures her that

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.070
he understands.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.740
They don’t think humanity is worth saving,
and they share one last joint as the end of

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.569
the world starts around them.

00:13:22.569 --> 00:13:35.920
The chamber crashes as a giant hand erupts
from the depths and obliterates the lab.
