00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.360
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going&nbsp;
to explain a Post Apocalyptic Horror film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:15.920
called “28 Days Later,” Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.680
The movie begins with a group of radical animal&nbsp;
rights activists storming into a laboratory. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.440
lab has held different species of chimpanzees&nbsp;
in captivity for medical research. The radical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.040
activists proceed to free the animals but a lab&nbsp;
staffer warns the group against it, alleging the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.600
animals are infected with a highly infectious Rage&nbsp;
virus. However, the animal rights activists do not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.280
heed his advice and start releasing the chimps.&nbsp;
Lo and behold, as soon as the chimps are released,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.160
they violently start attacking everyone&nbsp;
in the lab, infecting them in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.600
The lab staffer tries killing the infected but&nbsp;
it's too late and he easily gets overpowered.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.640
The infection spreads rapidly through the&nbsp;
activists and turns them into uncontrollable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.240
monsters in a matter of 20 seconds.
The movie then fast forwards to 28 days in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.720
the future. A man named Jim wakes up in a hospital&nbsp;
bed. As he gets up from his bed and looks around,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.640
he realises that the hospital is deserted and&nbsp;
trashed. All phone lines are dead. He grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.320
some beverage and heads out only to realise that&nbsp;
the entire city of London is deserted and seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.920
like it underwent some sort of catastrophe much&nbsp;
like the hospital. He wanders through the city,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.560
hoping to find other people. He comes across&nbsp;
a church, where a large group of people have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.600
gathered. He calls out for them but only to get&nbsp;
chased by people who seem to have turned into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.560
raging monsters. They follow Jim into the streets&nbsp;
until he runs into two survivors, Selena and Mark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.320
The duo throw DIY petrol bombs at the raging&nbsp;
monsters, setting them on fire. They then finish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.440
the monsters off by using explosives and lead&nbsp;
Jim into their hideout: a shop in the London&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.480
underground. It is revealed that Jim is a bicycle&nbsp;
courier who met with an accident and went into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.080
a coma. While he was in coma, the Rage virus&nbsp;
uncontrollably spread throughout the country,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.240
turning people into violent monsters and resulting&nbsp;
in a societal collapse. There’s no radio,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.960
electricity, TV, government, army, police and&nbsp;
all that’s left for consumption is candies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.840
and canned soft drinks. Selena speculates&nbsp;
that the catastrophe has gone global.
 
&nbsp;

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.440
The revelation alarms Jim and he insists on&nbsp;
finding his parents. Selena and Mark try to advise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.480
him against it but eventually relent and accompany&nbsp;
him to his parent’s home the next morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.000
Much like the entire city, Jim’s home seems&nbsp;
haunted. He finds his parents’ dead bodies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.760
in their room. They seem to have commited suicide&nbsp;
together and have left a final note for him. Jim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.880
breaks into tears after reading the note.
Due to safety reasons, the trio decide to spend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.840
the night in Jim’s home and sleep in the same&nbsp;
room. The thoughts of his parents don't let Jim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.560
sleep. As Selena and Mark peacefully sleep,&nbsp;
Jim looks at his mother’s handwriting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.560
and old home videos. Suddenly, two monsters break&nbsp;
into his home from the window and attack him like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.240
raging maniacs. Selena and Mark quickly wake&nbsp;
up and come to Jim’s rescue and the monsters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.760
are quickly neutralised. Jim survives without&nbsp;
injury but Mark is bleeding from the fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.440
Fearing a possible infection,&nbsp;
Selena quickly knocks Mark down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.520
and hacks him to death with a machete&nbsp;
as Jim watches in horror. 
 
&nbsp;

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.440
Selena decides to immediately leave for the store,&nbsp;
fearing more possible attacks. Jim is shaken by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.080
Mark’s murder but Selena explains to him that&nbsp;
the virus spreads through contaminated blood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.280
overtaking the victims in matter of seconds&nbsp;
and making them raging violent monsters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.320
She believes that just being alive is enough&nbsp;
and the end justifies the means. She warns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.400
him that if he ever gets infected,&nbsp;
she would kill him “in a heartbeat”.
&nbsp;

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.880
As they head to the store, they come across&nbsp;
Christmas lights blinking in an apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.760
in a high-rise building in an otherwise dark and&nbsp;
desolate city. They get hopeful of finding other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.480
survivors and go to investigate. They take the&nbsp;
stairs to the apartment but half way through their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.320
journey, Jim suffers from fatigue and extreme&nbsp;
headache, possibly due to hunger. She proceeds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.280
to pass him painkillers and a drink but suddenly&nbsp;
they hear sounds of infected people climbing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.680
stairs. Panicking, the duo run upstairs and run&nbsp;
into a man in police riot gear. The man directs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.480
the pair to his apartment while he blocks the&nbsp;
infected. The infected try to get past him but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.520
the man manages to neutralise them. The man then&nbsp;
welcomes the two to their apartment and introduces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.640
himself as Frank. He lives with his teenage&nbsp;
daughter Hannah. He offers them some wine and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.320
turns off the battery run christmas lights. 
Selena and Jim spend the night at Frank’s flat and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.960
privately discuss whether they should stay with&nbsp;
them. Jim believes that they are good people but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:59.040
Selena thinks that they will slow them down and&nbsp;
she would leave them behind “in a heartbeat”. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.080
warns Jim that putting others above one’s survival&nbsp;
is a guaranteed way of getting killed.
 
&nbsp;

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.880
The next morning, Frank and Jim check the water&nbsp;
they have left. The situation isn’t looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.840
good as it has not rained in days and Frank&nbsp;
believes they won’t be able to survive for long,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.880
holed up in the apartment. He then shows Jim&nbsp;
and Selena a recording of a radio broadcast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.320
transmitted by soldiers. The soldiers stationed&nbsp;
near Manchester claim to have found the “answer to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.920
the infection” and are calling survivors to come&nbsp;
find them. Frank suggests they head to Manchester.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.600
Selena initially hesitates but eventually agrees.&nbsp;
The group then heads out in Frank’s car.
 
&nbsp;

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.840
During their journey, they come across a&nbsp;
tunnel. Jim is skeptical of passing through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.160
a dark tunnel but Frank and Selena veto&nbsp;
him and head into the tunnel. The tunnel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.440
is blocked by a pile of car debris and Frank&nbsp;
drives over it, resulting in a flat tire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.880
Jim’s worst fear comes true and the group hears&nbsp;
a bunch of infected people running towards them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.680
Frank and others team up and frantically&nbsp;
change the tire and manage to escape on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.360
time. After travelling some distance, they stop&nbsp;
to stock up food and other essential supplies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.120
They also fill up a large jerry can&nbsp;
with fuel for their long journey.
 
&nbsp;

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.800
The group spends the night in a&nbsp;
pastoral field and have dinner together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.760
After spending time with Frank and his daughter,&nbsp;
Selena’s opinion about life begins to change.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.400
She admits to Jim that just being alive&nbsp;
isn’t enough and there’s more to life. 
 
&nbsp;

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.160
Afraid of being attacked, Jim and Hannah have&nbsp;
a hard time falling asleep while Selena easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.320
dozes off. Jim wakes her up and asks her to share&nbsp;
her secret. Selena passes them pills she takes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:45.920
fall asleep. She reveals that she is a qualified&nbsp;
chemist and the pills are safe. Jim and Hannah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:51.120
take one each and fall asleep while Frank stays&nbsp;
up to watch out for the infected monsters. 
 
&nbsp;

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.080
The next morning, they continue their journey.&nbsp;
After driving for hours, they reach a blockade.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.600
They also notice fires engulfing Manchester in&nbsp;
the distance. To their dismay, they learn that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.200
blockade is deserted. Selena suggests they should&nbsp;
return home but Frank isn’t ready to give up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.480
He looks around for soldiers but eventually loses&nbsp;
hope. He starts getting agitated and screams at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.880
others in frustration. A cawing crow feeding on an&nbsp;
infected soldier’s corpse adds to his frustration.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.880
Frank kicks on the tin wall and tries to ward&nbsp;
off the bird but a drop of contaminated blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.240
lands into his eyes instead. Realizing that he&nbsp;
has been infected, Frank tells his daughter to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.880
keep away from him. But Hannah only grows&nbsp;
worried and walks towards him as the virus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.800
begins to take over Frank’s body. Selena quickly&nbsp;
stops Hannah while Frank is shot dead by soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.360
hidden behind the blockade. It turns out&nbsp;
the blockade isn’t deserted after all. 
 
&nbsp;

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.520
The soldiers take the three survivors&nbsp;
and their car to a fortified mansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.800
They are greeted by Major Henry West who is&nbsp;
commanding the soldiers. The trio take showers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.400
and change into clean clothes. Frank’s death&nbsp;
and its impact on Hannah affects Selena who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.840
had grown close to both over the past few days.&nbsp;
Frank comforts Selena and they start developing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.920
romantic feelings for each other. 
 
Jim later talks to West about the “answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.720
to infection” they were promised in the army&nbsp;
broadcast. West assures him that it may not be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:20.480
what he had imagined but they do have an answer.&nbsp;
The mansion is surrounded by high perimeter walls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.840
and the surrounding ground has been laced with&nbsp;
tripwires and landmines. They use wood fire to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.680
get hot water and cook food. West is also counting&nbsp;
on the infected people to starve to death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.520
He has even kept an infected soldier&nbsp;
named Mailer chained in the mansion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.880
to study the effects of the virus.
Everyone then gathers for dinner. As people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.520
eat whatever the soldier cook has managed to&nbsp;
put together, West has disagreements with his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:51.520
sergeant Farrell over post-infection life. 
After dinner, West takes Jim for a drink. West&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.080
gives him a lecture about survival before&nbsp;
revealing that he had promised to “provide women”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.920
to his soldiers. The soldiers aren’t&nbsp;
just waiting for the infected to die,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:05.040
they also plan to survive by forcing&nbsp;
sexual servitude on the female survivors. 
&nbsp;

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.160
Alarmed by the revelation, Jim attempts to&nbsp;
flee with Selena and Hannah. Sergeant Farrell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.920
tries to help them but unfortunately&nbsp;
the soldiers easily capture them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.080
lock Farrell and Jim in a room.
While imprisoned, Farrell speculates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.560
that the virus must not have spread beyond&nbsp;
British borders. He points out that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.880
virus takes over one’s body so fast that&nbsp;
it would be impossible for the infected to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.520
flee the island and spread the disease. 
The following day, two soldiers take Farrell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.880
and Jim into the woods to execute them. When&nbsp;
one of the soldiers named Jones hesitates to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:42.080
shoot his sergeant, the other soldier shoots&nbsp;
Farrell for him. This angers Jones and he fights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.520
with the other soldier while Jim runs off. He&nbsp;
crosses over the wall and manages to get away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.960
On the other side, he notices the contrails of&nbsp;
a plane flying overhead and becomes hopeful.
 
&nbsp;

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.040
Meanwhile, Selena and Hannah are&nbsp;
ordered by West to become “presentable”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.520
to serve the soldiers and are taken to a&nbsp;
washroom. Selena convinces the soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.640
to give her some time to prepare Hannah. 
Suddenly, the sirens start going off. The West&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.360
learns that Jim had managed to flee and heads&nbsp;
out to hunt him with one of his soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:16.880
Jim ambushes the soldier near the blockade and&nbsp;
kills him. He then steals his gun and runs back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:22.240
to the mansion. At the headquarters, Jim releases&nbsp;
the infected soldier Mailer from captivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:27.120
Mailer attacks the soldiers and the two girls&nbsp;
manage to flee but Selena gets captured by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:32.800
another soldier. Mailer’s bite creates another&nbsp;
monster and they start attacking other soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.320
Jim also takes out a soldier and looks for the&nbsp;
girls as West returns. Jim violently kills the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.920
soldier who has held Selena hostage as she watches&nbsp;
in horror. Fearing that he might be infected,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.640
Selena grabs her machete and proceeds to strike&nbsp;
him but can’t bring herself to go through with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.000
Jim tells her that “That was longer than a&nbsp;
heartbeat.” Selena drops the machete and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.160
two passionately make out. Hannah finds them and&nbsp;
the three then rush to Frank’s car. However, West,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.240
who was waiting for them in the passenger&nbsp;
seat, shoots Jim in the stomach. Angered,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.760
Hannah drives the car and delivers West to the&nbsp;
infected soldier. Mailer drags West out and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.480
Hannah drives away with Selena and Jim.
Selena and Hannah take Jim to a deserted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.760
hospital. Selena performs a life-saving&nbsp;
operation on Jim and another 28 days pass.
&nbsp;

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.440
Jim gains consciousness in a remote cottage,&nbsp;
recovered from his injuries. In another room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.040
he finds Selena sewing together&nbsp;
a large piece of cloth.
&nbsp;

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.480
Suddenly, Hannah comes barging in, yelling,&nbsp;
“It’s coming!”. The three grab the fabric and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:40.160
rush outside in a hurry. It is revealed that it&nbsp;
is a large cloth banner reading the word “HELLO”.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:45.600
A jet flies by and notices the SOS signal&nbsp;
as the trio look optimistically.
