Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.920
Today I'm going to explain a drama, family,
and fantasy film called “Pinocchio."

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.920
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.920
Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.840
&nbsp;
In a faraway land, there lives a poor carpenter

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.640
named Geppetto; he makes a living out of carving
wood and building anything out of it.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.930
One day, he heads to the town restaurant in
hopes of earning more money to have a hearty

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.930
meal.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.619
Inside, he sees some of his friends dining
together but pays no mind to him.

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.160
He tells Moreno, the owner, that the chairs
and the table in the restaurant are no longer

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.720
sturdy, and repairing it would be a great
idea.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.590
Contrary to that, Moreno thinks that everything
in his place is fine as is.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.860
Desperate to earn something, Geppetto insists
that he will charge him a low price, but the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.980
owner dismisses him repeatedly.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.660
Upon exiting, he tries to convince Moreno
that the door needs repair, but Moreno knows

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.420
why Geppetto acts that way.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.190
He invites Geppetto to sit down and serves
him a generous amount of soup and bread.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.230
&nbsp;
Outside, he stumbles upon a puppet theater

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.719
where a man advertises it to the townsfolk.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.680
He invites everyone to join the entertainment
that night for an affordable price.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.739
Curiously, Geppetto takes a peek into the
carriage to see the puppets, but the man pulls

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.280
him away, as it will be a surprise to everyone.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.820
Another carpenter named Mastro Ciliegia is
about to cut a single log into pieces when

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.150
it suddenly moves.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.040
To his surprise, the magical log approaches
him and causes him to fall down.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.320
At that moment, Geppetto arrives to ask him
for some wood, and he sees his colleague in

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.630
a state of shock.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.790
He questions him about what happened, but
he says that everything is fine.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.700
Geppetto continues to tell him about his plans
on creating a puppet, naming it Pinocchio,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.920
and touring it around the world to make a
more decent living for himself.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.909
Still unable to bounce back from what he just
saw, Ciliegia blankly listens to him and decides

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.880
to give the magical log to his dear friend.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.479
Geppetto examines it, leaving him in complete
disbelief that his friend would give him such

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.720
a fine piece of wood for free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.439
&nbsp;
At home, he immediately starts carving the

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.270
log into a human-like shape.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.770
The humble gift has given him a renewed vision
and inspiration in life.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.170
While carving the puppet, he hears subtle
noises coming from inside it—a heartbeat.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.040
Geppetto gets giddier to finish it, so he
starts adding eyes and other parts that resemble

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.310
the human body.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.909
He calls Pinocchio repeatedly and instructs
it to say “babbo” which means “father,"

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.810
but the puppet remains immobile.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.130
After some moments of silence, Pinocchio utters
the word “babbo," taking Geppetoo aback

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.330
in happiness.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.149
He then runs outside to celebrate and let
his neighbors that he is now a father.

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.510
Excitedly, he comes back inside to do some
finishing touches on his creation, even making

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.749
clothes for him.

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:18.540
At this point, Pinocchio is fully alive and
conscious; to make him function to the fullest,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.999
Geppetto teaches him how to walk, but as he
instructs the steps, Pinocchio runs outside.

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.379
He possesses incredible speed, leaving his
father behind worried as he slowly gets out

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.379
of sight.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.659
Unfamiliar with the village, Pinocchio runs
into a home where a talking cricket tries

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.599
to help him by advising him about being an
obedient child.

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.959
The stubborn puppet gets fed up with the talking
cricket and throws a wooden mallet at it,

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.669
seriously injuring the creature.

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.079
He continues to sit by the fireplace where
he warms his feet, when Geppetto comes by

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.319
the home only to hear Pinocchio crying for
help, saying that his feet are gone after

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.120
falling asleep by the chimney.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.640
Extremely worried, his father enters the house
through a window to his rescue and sees almost

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.209
half of his legs completely gone.

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.969
Geppetto carries him home, then scolds him
for running away and causing damage to his

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:57.930
beautifully crafted body.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.359
Pinocchio begs him to make a new set of legs
for him, but his father refuses.

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.450
After some convincing, Geppetto gives in to
his pleas in exchange for him going to school.&nbsp;

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.129
&nbsp;
The following day, Geppetto goes to the nearby

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.830
store to get his son a spelling book that
he needs for school.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.469
However, he does not have money to purchase
it, making him hand over his jacket and waistcoat

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:14.969
to educate his son.

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.439
As they make their way to the school, Pinocchio
gets distracted by the puppet theater stationed

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.709
nearby before entering his class.

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.900
Unknown to Geppetto, his son leaves upon seeing
him return home.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.109
He tries to go inside the theater, but the
man blocks his entrance because he has no

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.180
money.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.079
Desperate to come in, Pinocchio sells his
spelling book to the store owner for four

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.659
coins and watches the puppet show afterward.

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.180
Along with other children, he gets entertained
by the show, especially that it’s his first

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.049
time seeing something of that kind.

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.219
The stage puppets notice Pinnochio in the
audience pretty soon and call him on stage

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:43.809
as he is a puppet as well.

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:47.139
They all welcome him with a big embrace, calling
him their wooden brother, interrupting the

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:48.139
show.

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.840
A big man named Mangiafuoco comes up on stage
to end their brief celebration and let the

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.120
show continue.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.430
He drags Pinocchio off the stage after finding
out that he could move even without strings.&nbsp;

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.139
&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Geppetto awaits for his son outside

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.519
the school, but the teacher repeatedly tells
him that a boy named Pinocchio never entered

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:04.669
his class.

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.700
His worries grow bigger as the puppet theater
is gone, and his son is nowhere to be found.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.139
To ask about the whereabouts of the theater,
he approaches the store owner, who informs

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.209
him that Pinocchio entered the theater to
see the show.

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.489
Geppetto suspects that they robbed his son
because he was too well-made and decides to

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.889
set off on a journey to reunite with him.&nbsp;

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.900
&nbsp;
Mangifuoco sits in front of a bonfire in the

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.090
middle of nowhere and instructs the other
puppets to bring Pinocchio to him to use him

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.870
as firewood to cook his dinner.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.340
Fearful of their master, the puppets abide
against their will; one of them tells Pinocchio

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.050
that to be saved, he should touch the master’s
heart and be nice to him.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.150
Pinocchio pleads with the puppeteer to let
him go to return home to his father, undoubtedly

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.520
worried about him.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.939
Showing emotion, Mangiafuoco decides to let
go of him but chooses to burn another puppet.

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:46.210
However, Pinocchio is against the idea that
someone should pay for something he did and

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.210
accepts his fatal punishment.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.699
Surprised by Pinocchio's act of selflessness,
Mangiafuoco releases him, making all the puppets

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:53.699
celebrate.

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.180
At daybreak, Mangiafuoco wakes Pinocchio up
to give him five gold coins to give to Geppetto

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.250
out of pity.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.919
Sadly, he bids goodbye to the other puppets
who have given him a sense of belonging, even

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.080
for a brief amount of time.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.990
In the rain, he makes his way home in hopes
of reuniting with his father.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.970
Along the way, a cat and a fox are fishing
by the river; he asks them for some help but

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.530
gets ignored by them.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.230
After realizing that Pinocchio has five gold
coins, they quickly approach the boy and suggest

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.250
that he should plant the coins in the Field
of Miracles, a place where they will sprout

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.830
in a tree full of money.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.250
The duo continues to entice him about the
idea as they walk to a restaurant, where the

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.680
two devour significant portions of food.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.090
That night, Pinocchio dreams that they make
it to the magical tree, and the three of them

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.909
collect coins from its branches.

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.020
His fantasy is cut short when the innkeeper
wakes him up, saying that the cat and the

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.430
fox are waiting for him at the end of the
woods.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.469
Alone in the middle of the night, Pinocchio
bravely walks alone to the meeting area when

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:44.260
a familiar voice calls for him.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.539
The talking cricket has reappeared and continuously
guides the boy.

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:50.910
According to him, Pinocchio should retrace
his steps and take the four remaining coins

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.110
to his poor father.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.879
However, the boy refuses to believe the talking
cricket who advises him to be vigilant of

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:58.379
those who promise to make him rich in a blink
of an eye.

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.979
The stubborn Pinocchio has not changed his
ways; he refuses to believe the cricket, who

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.700
only wishes him safety, making him walk away
to reach the woods.&nbsp;

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.940
&nbsp;
Towards the end of the forest, two hooded

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.040
assassins chase him, leading him into an abandoned
house.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.419
He desperately knocks at the door, but a ghostly
girl from a window tells him that no one is

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:14.479
home.

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:17.940
Pinocchio asks for help from the girl, but
she cannot do so because she is dead.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.310
Eventually, the two assassins grab the boy,
forcing him to spit the coins out of his mouth.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.840
They then hang him on a tree and wait for
him to die to get the coins quickly.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.870
Pinocchio dramatically remembers his father
and instantly regrets being a disobedient

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.870
child.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.650
At daybreak, while the assassins, who are
the fox and the cat disguising themselves,

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.749
are asleep, a mythical coachman named Medoro
rescues Pinocchio from the tree and brings

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:41.510
him to the abandoned house where the blue-haired
fairy cares for him.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.380
A snail lady, one of her servants, welcomes
two doctors and the cricket to Pinocchio's

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.380
room.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.270
While the doctors examine his health, the
cricket scolds him for not taking his advice

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.440
seriously.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.699
After the three guests leave the room, the
fairy lets him drink a medicine, which she

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:56.680
claims will heal him in a few days.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.930
He hesitates to drink it because of its bitter
taste and repeatedly says that he doesn’t

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.699
mind dying right then and there.

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:05.259
Annoyed by his stubbornness, she summons four
rabbits carrying a coffin, which Pinocchio

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:06.499
gets afraid of.

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:10.180
The four rabbits drag him out of bed, but
he begs the fairy to give the medicine instead,

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.180
taking back his death wish.&nbsp;

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.949
&nbsp;
In the dining room, the fairy questions Pinocchio

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:16.860
about his journey and how he ended up in the
magical place.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.120
He tells the fairy that he entered a puppet
theater in the event that the school is closed;

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.930
he also lied about not paying for his entrance
in the puppet show.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.439
Suddenly, his nose becomes longer with each
lie he tells, and he gets confused about this.

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:31.690
Finally, the fairy reveals to him that every
time he tells a lie, his nose will grow; she

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.259
is then forced to shorten his nose after the
things on the table are knocked over.

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:38.900
She calls a flock of woodpeckers to do the
job while Pinocchio watches, both amazed and

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.900
embarrassed.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.349
He and the fairy share a special bond during
his stay, forming an unexpected friendship

00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:44.559
between the two.

00:07:44.559 --> 00:07:47.849
The fairy sends him off to find his father,
reminding him to find his way back to her

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:50.080
after his reunion with Geppetto.&nbsp;

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.129
&nbsp;
Learning his lesson, Pinocchio returns home,

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:55.550
where coincidentally, he meets the cat and
the fox for the second time.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.990
The boy still has no idea that the duo is
actually the hooded assassins who once put

00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.990
his life in danger.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.349
In an attempt to commence their evil plan
for the second time, they lead him to the

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:06.900
Field of Miracles once again, where they advise
him to plant the coins and gather water for

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.900
it.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.169
While he runs farther to get some water, the
cat and the fox steal the buried coins, leaving

00:08:11.169 --> 00:08:12.169
the poor boy penniless.&nbsp;

00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:14.919
&nbsp;
At the courthouse, Pinocchio reports the theft

00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:17.770
to the gorilla judge, who asks him what he
wants to happen.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.979
The boy replies that he wants justice and
for the five golden coins to be returned to

00:08:20.979 --> 00:08:21.979
him.

00:08:21.979 --> 00:08:25.550
Weirdly, justice does not favor the innocent
in that place, putting Pinocchio into a life

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.550
sentence.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.499
The gorilla repeats that in their place, the
innocent go to prison.

00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:32.820
Desperate to find a way out, he says that
he has committed a crime before, which practically

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.140
makes him guilty.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.590
The gorilla rethinks about his sentence on
Pinocchio, frees him of his sentence, and

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:38.590
has him liberated.&nbsp;

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.800
&nbsp;
Pinocchio resumes his long journey home only

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.240
to find out that Geppetto has left to search
for him in every place possible and decides

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.560
to search for him overseas in The Great Americas,&nbsp;
thinking that he is still in the hands of

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.070
Mangiafuoco.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.600
Pinocchio gets to the shore and carelessly
dives into the sea.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.040
However, he gets shipwrecked on an unknown
island, where a hooded person carries him

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.170
to safety.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:00.140
As Pinocchio gains consciousness, he gets
up and sees the snail once again, and they

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.140
embrace.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.670
The fairy enters the room, but now as a grown
woman, reminding him that it is still her—his

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.700
dear friend.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.480
While eating, Pinocchio tells the fairy that
he does not want to be a puppet all his life;

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.630
he wants to become a boy like the others.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:15.279
Feeling his sincerity, the fairy promises
to turn him into a real human boy if he studies

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:16.279
and behaves well.&nbsp;

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:18.690
&nbsp;
The following day, Pinocchio attends school

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.010
right away, where the teacher scolds the disobedient
boys.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:27.010
Another boy named Lucignolo is brought to
the classroom, where he is punished as well.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.149
While the teacher writes on the board, the
naughty boy places a frog behind him as a

00:09:30.149 --> 00:09:31.149
prank.

00:09:31.149 --> 00:09:34.610
Not long after that, the teacher notices the
animal inside him, making the whole class

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.100
break into laughter.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.070
This allows Lucignolo to escape class, where
Pinocchio follows and befriends him.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.310
That night, Pinocchio finds out that he is
unwelcome to the fairy’s home after discovering

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:44.750
him skipping school.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.760
From then on, Pinocchio attends classes and
becomes the most studious boy among his peers,

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.440
making him an excellent student.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.339
This comes to the fairy’s attention and
commends Pinocchio for it, promising that

00:09:53.339 --> 00:09:56.320
she will grant his wish of being a real boy
when tomorrow comes.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.300
Happily, he runs outside to invite his friends
for a feast at the fairy’s home.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.779
Suddenly, he hears a lady calling for Lucignolo,
so he runs to him while his friend hides.

00:10:04.779 --> 00:10:08.190
He invites Lucignolo to his party, but he
turns down the invitation because he is going

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.300
to the “Land of Toys” where children like
them can have unlimited fun without schools

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.510
or adults.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.820
That night, Pinocchio decides to accompany
his friend while waiting for a wagon to pass

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.310
by, transporting him to The Land of Toys.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.540
His original plan is to stay in the village,
but after seeing multiple boys on the way

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.240
to have fun, he lets down his guard and decides
to join their journey as well.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.529
All of them arrive at a mansion and immediately
play and start having fun.

00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:32.880
They swim, chase each other, and do all sorts
of fun activities while the light lasts.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.570
The coachman gives them a place to spend the
night, where they still have their fun.&nbsp;

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.500
&nbsp;
The following day, Pinocchio wakes up with

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.170
donkey ears and finds Lucignolo in the same
situation—they are slowly turning into donkeys.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:46.380
Both of them fall to the ground, losing their
balance as their arms and legs turn into hooves.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.829
While screaming for help, their faces become
those of donkeys, and the coachman who lured

00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:51.839
them into the place exalts in joy.

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:55.860
He sells them separately: Lucignolo remains
unsold, while a businessman plans to purchase

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.560
Pinocchio as the two friends cry upon being
apart.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.350
The puppet-turned-donkey ends up in a circus
and is used for entertainment to perform dangerous

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:03.399
acrobatics.

00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:07.019
In the audience, the fairy watches the show,
knowing that Pinocchio has suffered this sad

00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:08.019
fate.

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:10.880
He trips and cripples himself while looking
at the fairy from the stage.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.130
He is then brought out of the show after being
lame and unentertaining.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.320
Moments later, the circus director decides
to drown him and use his skin to assemble

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.540
a drum.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.990
After he is thrown in the sea, the fairy summons
a group of fish that nibbles away his donkey

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.350
skin, bringing his appearance back to normal.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.370
In great confusion, the circus personnel sees
Pinocchio float up, but as a boy, he swims

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.380
away to search for his father despite the
director’s calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.360
&nbsp;
In the middle of the vast ocean, Pinocchio’s

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.700
struggles are far from over.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.130
A terrible dogfish comes from behind him,
and the ravenous sea monster swallows him

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.300
alive.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.210
Inside the fish’s belly, he calls out for
help when a tuna, which was also swallowed,

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.210
approaches him.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.420
It tells the boy that asking for help is useless,
and the chances of getting out are little

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.519
to none.

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:52.250
According to the tuna, the only thing they
can do is wait for the dogfish to digest them,

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.380
which puts Pinocchio in a state of panic.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.060
He then notices a faint light back inside
the fish’s belly.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:01.190
Curious to find what it is, he approaches
the end, and to his surprise, sees Geppetto

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.870
also trapped inside.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.220
Despite their grave and almost inescapable
situation, their unexpected reunion makes

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.000
them celebrate for some time.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.640
The father and son embrace each other as tightly
as possible after being apart for such a long

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.640
time.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.079
Geppetto reveals to his son that living inside
the fish is not so bad after all; because

00:12:16.079 --> 00:12:20.480
of the creature eating non-stop, swarms of
fish enter its body, giving him enough food.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.889
Determined to escape, Pinocchio tells his
father that life outside is much better and

00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:25.940
that there is still a way for them to get
out.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.970
He brings his father near the fish’s mouth
and convinces him to take advantage of its

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.130
open mouth while it sleeps.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:34.180
Geppetto is scared to come out because of
his inability to swim, but Pinocchio assures

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.000
him that he swims well, and as he is made
of wood, he floats.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.639
Hesitantly, Geppetto finally agrees, and the
both of them swim to safety with the help

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:41.639
of the tuna.

00:12:41.639 --> 00:12:44.940
They swim until dawn and safely reach the
shore, where he expresses his gratitude to

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.430
the fish before it swims back to the deep.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.910
&nbsp;
After miles of walking from the beach to the

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.450
countryside, they spot an abandoned house
where they could rest for the time being.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:56.790
They both lay in a makeshift bed, where Pinocchio
realizes that his father is getting sicker.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.589
He goes to a nearby home, where a farmer hires
him to earn milk for his father.

00:13:00.589 --> 00:13:03.519
He willingly works hard, which earns the farmer’s
respect.

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:06.450
He comes back to the house to take care of
his father’s needs and continues to work

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.630
for the following days while being trained.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.259
From then on, he starts earning money while
he continues to study and help Geppetto, who

00:13:12.259 --> 00:13:13.890
is still recovering.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:17.350
Pinocchio once again meets the estranged fox
and cat, now badly reduced and struggling

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.649
with disabilities.

00:13:18.649 --> 00:13:21.810
Learning his lesson and growing smarter, he
does not miss the opportunity to mock the

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.279
duo and ignore their apologies.&nbsp;

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:25.610
&nbsp;
Geppetto and Pinocchio spend their peaceful

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:29.060
lives together in simplicity, fully content
with having each other.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:32.230
On a random day of tending to the sheep, the
fairy appears out of nowhere to forgive the

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.360
boy for all the troubles he got into.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.550
She reminds him to be wiser in the future
so that he can live joyously.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.940
The fairy decides to grant Pinocchio his wish
after they embrace, so she carefully lays

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.779
him down to cast a spell that will turn him
into a human.

00:13:43.779 --> 00:13:47.569
As he wakes up, Pinocchio is astonished to
feel his skin; he rushes home, shouting that

00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:49.149
he is now a real boy.

00:13:49.149 --> 00:13:52.700
This catches his father’s attention, so
he looks outside and proudly sees his son,

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.760
but this time, no longer a puppet but a real
living boy.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:06.560
Both of them celebrate outside their humble
home, and they live happily ever after.&nbsp;
