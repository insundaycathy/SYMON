00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.140
At dinner, there are fathers and sons happily
enjoying their meal.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.670
While talking, an elder man suddenly suffers
from body pain.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.059
He soon becomes mutated with his lower half
mutated in a spider-like creature.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.309
He attacks the family right after that.

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.360
What makes him transform?

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.550
Would other men make it survive from the mutated
father?

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.340
This is Movie Shortens.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.430
Follow us to the movie titled: Infestation.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.080
Be aware, there are spoilers.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.679
Now, let’s begin!

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.800
In a busy telesales company, Cooper is late
for work.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.500
He doesn’t like this job and usually messes
up with the customers.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.110
His boss Maureen calls him in and decides
to fire him promptly.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.890
Just then, the two encounter a high-pitched
noise.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.510
Cooper wails in pain and passes out.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.870
Several days later, Cooper wakes up and realizes
that his body is fully covered in a cocoon.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.430
He is very weak and nauseous with a sting
bite on the face.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.470
While checking around the office, Cooper is
attacked by a giant bug from the ceiling.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.330
He stabs the bug with an umbrella and fights
it away.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.630
He then helps Maureen and other co-workers
out of the webs.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.250
Maureen recalls talking with her daughter
named Sara before the incident.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.140
She runs out to look for the girl.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.760
Cooper says that he will check on Sara and
warns Maureen to get back inside for her safety.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.900
Cooper breaks the cocoon and Sara finally
gains consciousness.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.390
However, Cooper gets pepper sprayed from Sara
who assumes he is a bad guy.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.660
Maureen runs to the car and soon is captured
away by a big wasp from the sky.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.640
More bugs surround the two after that.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.070
As an energetic doctor, Sara learns that these
bugs only follow the noise they make.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.510
She turns the car alarm to distract the bugs
and carries Cooper to a restaurant nearby.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.750
The two meet up with other people there: a
student Leechee, a blonde Cindy, a deaf teenager

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.190
Hugo and his father Albert, Roger, PJ and
a cop.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.360
They discuss how to escape from the bugs.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.890
The cop commands the group not to go anywhere.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.390
Roger and PJ decide not to listen.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.360
They get on Roger’s truck against the advice
of others.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.570
When the truck leaves for a while, Roger is
attacked by a wasp, leaving the truck to drive

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.570
by itself.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.950
PJ jumps out of the truck and ends up being
smashed by it.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.830
The cop also gets killed by a bug from behind
him.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.620
Albert is stung by a wasp while preventing
Hugo from saving the cop.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.649
The survivors flee to a building.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.840
On the top, the group notices that there is
a huge swarm of wasps in the sky.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.590
They are heading to them.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.910
Leechee learns that the bugs are actually
blind.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.230
The group then tries to trap a bug by radio
noise.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.470
Leechee suggests milking the bug to get the
venom to study about this creature.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.810
Later at night, she tells the group that the
venom contains sedatives which put everybody

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.470
to sleep and some proteins from their queen.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.000
The group decides to walk to the nearest military
airbase at Gibson the next day.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.620
On the way, they will stop by their families
to check on their members.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.280
For the moment, they will stay overnight in
the building.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.670
Each will rotate to watch for the bugs while
others take a rest.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.569
During the set up, Sara brings a pair of shoes
that she found for Cindy.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.430
Sara thinks Cindy can’t walk tomorrow in
her high heels.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.819
Cindy, on the other hand, refuses to take
the shoes.

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.480
Meanwhile, Cooper also develops his special
feelings for Sara.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.420
He asks if he can sleep near her, but Sara
doesn’t care about him.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.180
As Cooper is watching for the team, Cindy
finds Cooper saying that she only trusts in

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.670
him among others.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.880
She tells Cooper to abandon the group and
the two can go to a safer place alone.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.470
Cooper refuses her suggestion and decides
to stay with the team.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.710
Cindy reveals to have some feelings with Cooper
but he rejects her.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.520
The following day, Leechee opts to stay behind
to wake up as many people as she could.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.760
Also, she wants to spend more time studying
the bugs instead of going to the military

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.760
base.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.069
The rest follows the plan to walk to the airbase.

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.850
They’ll pass by Hugo and Albert’s house
first on the way to check on Hugo’s mother.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.760
Arriving at Hugo’s house, they discover
that his mother has already passed away.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.600
That’s why the bugs didn’t web her like
other living humans.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.959
After that, Albert takes a gun with him in
case of self-defense and tells the group to

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:51.959
keep going.

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.270
Next, they stop by Cindy’s house to check
on her brother Chad and sister-in-law Susan.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.459
Cindy wakes Susan up from a cocoon.

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.930
All of a sudden, Chad appears with his lower
half mutated in a spider-like creature.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.489
He is collecting cocoon humans in a pile.

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.160
Chad rushes to the group and stabs Susan to
death.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.410
He knocks out Sara and lifts Cindy up.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.850
Cooper rescues Cindy in time, only to get
pierced in the leg.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.370
Hugo and Albert together finally kill Chad.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.900
At night, the team decides to camp at Cindy’s
house.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.129
Sara helps Cooper to sew his wound.

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:25.599
Albert encounters some pain in his abdomen.

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:30.320
Later, he meets Sara in the kitchen, asking
her if she can take care of Hugo as the way

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.069
she did with Cooper.

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:33.969
Sara agrees without hesitation.

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:38.069
Meanwhile, Cindy comes to see Cooper again
and shows her care to him.

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.059
This time, Cooper makes it very clear that
he has no interest in her.

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:43.900
This makes Cindy hurt and pissed.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.430
The next day, the group keeps heading to Cooper’s
dad.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.550
Sara thinks her mother Maureen is still alive
and maybe the bugs just keep her somewhere

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.660
like a hive.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.210
Sara tells Cooper that she’ll not go to
Gibson after visiting his father.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.169
She’ll go to the bug’s nest.

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.509
Suddenly, a group of wasps fly above their
heads.

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.169
The team quickly hides themselves under the
bridge.

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.659
Seeing Cooper and Sara hold their hands, Cindy
becomes jealous.

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:12.409
She steps out and shouts out to draw the bugs’
attention, aiming to expose the whole team.

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:16.039
Albert shoots Cindy in the chest to stop her
crazy action.

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.210
The gunshot alerts the wasps and Sara is captured
shortly after that.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.530
The trio finally reach Cooper’s house.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.030
There they meet up with his father, Ethan.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.249
While enjoying dinner, Albert reveals to be
mutated.

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:31.569
He becomes a half human half spider creature
just like Chad.

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.199
Hugo has no choice but to shoot him to death
to save the others.

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.599
Hugo says that Albert has told him to do so
if something bad happens to him.

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.910
Another bug enters from the window after hearing
the gunshot.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.529
Ethan destroys it with a taser to avoid making
further noise.

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:51.259
As more bugs arrive, the trio run to Ethan’s
shelter, which was built long ago.

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.349
They spend the night in the bunker.

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.809
In the morning, Cooper convinces Ethan to
go to the nest with him and rescue Sara.

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:00.360
Ethan objects to his suicidel idea.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.249
Cooper becomes angry and walks out of the
house alone.

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:05.919
He then tells Hugo better to stay with Ethan.

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.449
On the way to the nest, Cooper encounters
a strange armed man.

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:11.500
He ends up being locked in the prison.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.460
The man and his team thinks Cooper is infected
and soon will be transformed.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.099
No matter what Cooper explains, the armed
members don’t believe in him.

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:22.500
Later, Cooper sees an elder Mexican man in
the prison.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.969
He reveals to Cooper about Leechee, who rescued
him and other people from the cocoons.

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:31.059
The man thinks the others died in the explosion
caused by the flammable red colored gas released

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:32.440
by the bugs and the nest.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.270
A moment later, Hugo and Ethan are captured
and join Cooper in the prison Ethan turns

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.979
out to be stung earlier.

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:42.830
Ethan hostages a girl and threatens the armed
group to free Cooper.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.009
Just then, the Mexican man becomes a mutant
and attacks the girl.

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:50.619
Ethan takes this chance to kill other members
of the arm group, eventually saving Hugo and

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:51.619
Cooper.

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:53.880
The trio decide to follow Cooper’s plan.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.929
They take some of the weapons and bombs from
the armed group.

00:06:56.929 --> 00:07:00.909
To save time, the trio ride the bikes instead
of walking to the nest.

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:04.110
Elsewhere in the nest, Sara slowly wakes up.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.520
She is shocked to see the bug queen consume
the cocooned bodies.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.139
Finally, the trio reach the giant bug hive.

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:15.129
They plan to place the bombs around the area
to bring all the bugs and wasps to hell.

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:19.870
As being stung earlier, Ethan reveals to have
abdomen pain, signaling the mutation.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.560
Knowing he is running out of time, Ethen locks
Cooper to the tree and knocks Hugo to pass

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.560
out.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.719
He will sacrifice himself to destroy the hive.

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:30.960
He leaves the keys so that Cooper and Hugo
can escape later.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.389
In the nest, Ethen runs into Sara.

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:34.990
She then takes him to the queen.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.749
Meanwhile, Cooper and Hugo also make it to
the hive and find the way to see Ethan.

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:42.960
At the queen’s hive, Sara and Ethan soon
are attacked.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.810
Luckily, Hugo and Ethan arrive in time and
fight with the queen.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:51.449
The queen begins to wail in very loud noise,
calling other bugs to back up.

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:55.050
The group suffers from the noise again except
for Hugo, who is deaf.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.279
He throws the bomb inside the queen’s mouth.

00:07:57.279 --> 00:08:01.069
Ethan asks the trio to leave so he can trigger
the bomb by himself.

00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:04.280
However, Ethan turns mutant right at that
time.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.680
Cooper has to press the button, killing his
dad and the queen in the explosion.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.599
Sara and Hugo drag Cooper out of the nest
just in time.

00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:17.310
Several days later, Cooper finds himself waking
up in a hospital, looking outside in a peaceful

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.650
view with Hugo and Sara.
