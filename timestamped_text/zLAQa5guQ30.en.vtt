00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.900
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.180
Today I'm going to show you a horror film
called Veronica.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.640
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.660
Watch out and take careThe day is June 15,
1991; heavy rain takes over the city of Madrid.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.730
Police cars receive a call from a girl asking
for help.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.019
She keeps saying, “He’s inside!

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.279
He’s inside!”

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.039
As the police arrive at the apartment, they
sense something unnatural and are completely

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.729
in shock as they see what’s behind the door.

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:31.109
Three days before the incident happened, Veronica’s
family has a simple life.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.300
She has three younger siblings: Lucia, Irene,
who are twins, and Antoñito.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.070
She is in charge of feeding them, getting
them ready for school, and everything in between.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.470
She mainly takes care of them because their
mother has to work long hours to make ends

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.920
meet after the recent death of their father.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.230
Veronica goes inside her parents’ room to
find pictures of her father, whom she misses

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.539
very much.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.489
She finds one and decides to bring the picture
to school.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.769
Veronica goes to a Catholic school, and nuns
run it.

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.649
In the classroom, the teacher talks about
the phenomenon of a solar eclipse that also

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.699
happens to occur on that day.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.270
The teacher explains that in some cultures,
they believe that darkness takes over the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.329
world when the eclipse happens.

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:14.750
She also says that ancient people use that
day to perform human sacrifices and to summon

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.170
dark spirits.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.090
The faculty gather the students on the school
rooftop to watch and take a glimpse of the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.979
rare solar eclipse.

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.250
Instead of joining the other students in viewing
the phenomenon, Veronica, her friend Rosa,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.159
and their classmate Diana head to the school
basement to perform a séance.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.630
The basement is dark, dusty, and run-down,
but it did not stop the three of them to go

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.689
down there.

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.829
Meanwhile, the rest of the students are excited
to catch a sight of the eclipse.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.880
They all hold a negative film strip to protect
their eyes from the harmful sunlight.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.659
Veronica and her friends continue the séance
using an Ouija board.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.329
They all want to contact a loved one who has
died.

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.840
They close their eyes, touch the glass on
the board, and try to contact spirits.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.790
The glass moves and the three of them start
to get scared.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.590
They ask the “spirit” for its name, and
if it wants to communicate, it responds by

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.020
moving the glass.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.439
Rosa and Diana remove their hand from the
glass, leaving Veronica the only one touching

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.439
it.

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:11.510
The glass moves around the board rapidly and
leaves them all shocked.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.400
Rosa and Diana place their hands on the glass
again and try to ask for the spirit’s name.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.950
Once more, the glass moves rapidly and becomes
too hot to touch, leaving Veronica the only

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.700
one touching it again.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.110
The eclipse happens, and Veronica sits still
while holding the glass as it eventually breaks,

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.170
giving
her a bloody index finger.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.040
Rosa and Diana start to worry about Veronica
because she stays still.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.740
The candles’ lights go out, and they struggle
to find their flashlights.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.120
Veronica is lying unconscious, but she is
murmuring words until she lets out a demonic

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.120
scream.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.030
She blacks out and ends up at the school clinic;
the resident doctor at the school asks her

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.460
questions to know why she fainted.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.880
Without any apparent reason, the doctor advises
her to rest.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.270
As she meets up with her two sisters after
class, they notice the school's headmistress,

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.490
an elderly blind woman who everyone calls
Sister Death, looking directly at Veronica

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.140
as if she can see.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.240
As they arrive home, Veronica goes straight
to her room to observe the Ouija board that

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.460
cut in half after their séance.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.570
She carefully puts her backpack with the board
on top of her closet; she goes outside but

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.480
hears a noise from her room.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.420
As she re-enters, the bag is on the floor;
she places it on top of the closet once again;

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.370
the same thing happens—her bag is on the
floor.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.570
This is the beginning of the paranormal experiences
that Veronica will encounter.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.310
While having dinner, Veronica starts shaking
and is unable to put the food in her mouth.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.520
Her younger siblings begin to get scared and
worry about her.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.520
Veronica snaps out of it.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.680
Still confused, she says that she is completely
fine.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.170
She notices claw and bite marks appear on
her body as well.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.170
After having so many questions in her mind,
she tries calling Rosa, but it seems like

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.000
her friend is avoiding her.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.090
While bathing Antoñito, Veronica hears a
thumping sound from the living room; she tells

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.300
Lucia and Irene to behave and keep quiet,
but both are in their rooms.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.790
The light in her room starts flickering, and
she is locked inside.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.250
Antoñito screams for Veronica from the bathroom
because the water in the bath turned extremely

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.740
hot, leaving the poor boy with burns.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.260
Veronica cleans up for the night as she notices
the TV suddenly turning on; an entity’s

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.159
reflection is seen from the TV as she turns
it off, directly looking at her from behind.

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:22.610
In the middle of the night, her closet mirror
opens out of nowhere; someone calls her, and

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.680
she sees an entity that exactly looks like
her father.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.130
She panics as it drags her back to the bed
and entangles her.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.689
She realizes that it is just a nightmare even
though it seems too realistic to be a dream.

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.400
Veronica’s friends begin to ignore her.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.150
Looking for answers, she goes back to the
basement alone, where Sister Death already

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.349
awaits her.

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.289
The nun warns her about the situation that
she is in and continues to scold her for trying

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.460
to summon someone from the dead.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.880
Sister Death tells Veronica that her siblings
are in danger and that she must protect them.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.500
The nun attempts to propel the spirit to leave
the girl alone, but it is not compelling enough.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.729
Veronica confronts Rosa about why she avoids
her, but she denies that what happened in

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.530
the basement isn’t real.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.569
At home, she draws protective symbols for
her siblings.

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.050
Her sister contacts her from
the walkie talkie; from across their room,

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.830
Veronica sees the spirit, and she runs as
fast as she can to rescue her sisters.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.759
The spirit chokes Lucia, but she wakes up
and claims that it was Veronica who choked

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:19.759
her.

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:23.900
That same night, Veronica has a dream that
her siblings are devouring her flesh.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.629
She shouts for help, but once again, it is
just a dream.

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.439
She woke up to having her first period—finally
reaching womanhood.

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:36.330
She scrubs the blood on her bed and as she
turns it upside down, burn marks are present.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.110
She checks her siblings’ mattresses, and
the same burn marks are also present in the

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.879
form of a human body.

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:46.379
To seek advice, Veronica goes to Sister Death;
the nun reveals to her that she intentionally

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:50.430
blinded herself in an attempt to stop visions
of evil spirits.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.400
She is unsuccessful because even without her
vision, she can still feel and sense dark

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.600
entities.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.289
Sister Death reminds Veronica that the spirit
summoned has to go back through the same door

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:00.550
she opened.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.880
It is crucial that Veronica has to bid farewell
to the same spirit to stop it from being in

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.810
her life and destroy the door opened during
the séance.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.590
Veronica comes over to Rosa’s house; there
is a party going on, and she persuades Rosa

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.229
to bid goodbye to the spirit that they summoned.

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:19.840
She looks for Diana at the house, also forcing
her to finish the séance officially.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.210
She is kicked out of the party, and Rosa does
nothing to help her.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.380
Rosa reveals to her that Veronica whispered
that she would die in three days.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.810
Feeling terrified and alone, Veronica walks
home with a troubled mind as her vision becomes

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:32.810
fazed.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.949
She reaches their bar and desperately asks
her mom to stay at home with them for the

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:36.949
night.

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:41.009
Her mom explains that she is busy and cannot
afford to close the bar for a night.

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:46.100
Veronica and her siblings head home, and she
decides to continue the séance at their apartment.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.400
She comes up with the idea to do it with her
younger siblings.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.270
It confuses them as they are still young,
but they obey their older sister’s commands

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.270
anyway.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.469
Antoñito draws the protective signs around
their apartment.

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:02.120
He flips to the wrong page and draws the symbol
of invocation instead, inviting the evil spirit

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.479
even more.

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:08.340
Ready to hold the séance, except for Antoñito,
all of them touch the glass on the Ouija board.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.639
They command the spirit to say goodbye, but
it refuses.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:15.110
The book instructs that they have to sing
a soft song to properly say goodbye to the

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.819
spirit disturbing them.

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:21.230
All of them sing in unison; they begin to
hear thumping noises around their apartment.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.949
The spirit attempts to distract and scare
them.

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:28.599
The candles’ lights go out, the Ouija board
tears apart in half, and the glass moves around

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:29.660
the apartment.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.779
Veronica follows it fearfully and ends up
in the bedroom.

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:36.030
The spirit comes out from the mattress and
tries to run after her.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.880
She desperately calls the police as the spirit
snatched her little brother.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.680
She runs after the spirit and ends up losing
consciousness for a while.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.779
She finds Antoñito in the bathroom, grabs
him, and they all escape to safety.

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:52.009
Veronica’s mother notices cop cars passing
by at the bar, and she couldn’t help but

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:53.809
worry about her children.

00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:57.469
She leaves the bar in the middle of the pouring
rain and tries to get home.

00:07:57.469 --> 00:08:01.800
When Veronica and her siblings
reach the exit of their building, she looks

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.059
at a mirror and realizes that she isn’t
actually holding Antoñito; it was all her

00:08:06.059 --> 00:08:07.449
imagination.

00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:11.020
With no choice, she comes back up alone to
rescue her brother.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.659
The spirit strikes her, and Veronica hits
her head on a mirror.

00:08:14.659 --> 00:08:18.559
She is now holding a piece of broken glass
as she finds Antoñito hiding in a closet

00:08:18.559 --> 00:08:19.789
calling her name.

00:08:19.789 --> 00:08:24.729
Antoñito refuses to come with her, making
Veronica look at herself in the mirror—realizing

00:08:24.729 --> 00:08:28.370
that she has been possessed by the spirit
the entire time and that she has been harming

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:29.960
her siblings under its control.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.400
In an attempt to end the possession, she tries
to slit her own throat, but the evil spirit

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.100
manages to stop her.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.760
The authorities arrive at their apartment
and are shocked to see Veronica being attacked

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.780
by an invisible force until she passes out.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.650
This sight leaves them speechless.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.600
The paramedics rescue her along with Antoñito.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.710
While the police observe the family’s apartment,
a picture of Veronica catches fire out of

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:52.760
nowhere.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.900
At that exact moment, an officer calls the
detective to inform him that Veronica has

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.900
died.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.140
To this day, Veronica’s story and death
remain a mystery.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.890
Her story is based on a police report that
happened in real life, and the police who

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:11.780
have witnessed her case certifies it.
