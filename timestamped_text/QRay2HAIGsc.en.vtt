00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.621
Welcome back to scary recap, and today, we
will be explaining the horror movie Babadook.

00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:08.900
Before diving in, let us know to warn you
about the potential spoilers we will stumble

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.900
upon.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.030
1:00 to 10:00: Amelia, a single mother, living
with her 6-year-old child Samuel is going

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.380
through an incredibly tough time.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.640
She wakes up again with a weird dream of her
floating in the air.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.630
Samuel wakes her up by telling her that he
had a strange dream as well.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.429
These recurring strange dreams for Samuel
had something related to monsters, and because

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:37.950
of that, he always made his mom check his
closets and bottom of the bed for reassurance.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.130
To put him back to sleep, Amelia would read
her son bedtime stories.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.070
Amelia, who has a hard time falling asleep
on her own, read the stories for herself to

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.110
shut her eyes as well.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.030
Later in the morning, Amelia wakes up to a
loud sound: her six-year-old creating some

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.370
dangerous weapons.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.159
Amelia is furious about Samuel making types
of equipment that could be a potential threat

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:02.440
to others.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.490
However, Samuel shouts that these weapons
were made to protect himself and his mom from

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.410
the monster that appears in his dreams.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.110
Since Samuel is just a young kid, he deliberately
believes in a monster living in the house.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.520
Amelia drives Samuel to his school and heads
to her workplace, where she is employed as

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.720
a nurse in a nursing home.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.890
Later on, Amelia receives a phone call from
her son's school.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.420
When went to visit the principal, Amelia is
fed with the news that Samuel was playing

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.750
with a very threatening tool and could have
hurt someone.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.290
While the principal complained that Samuel
had been in his office way too many times

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.890
and that he needs serious medical treatment
and that Sam has severe behavioral problems,

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.660
Amelia insists that all Samuel needs is serious
talk.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.570
However, this turned into a big fight, and
Amelia told her son was better off without

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.560
this school.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.920
Amelia thought of dropping by the park to
see her sister Claire and her daughter, Ruby,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.640
on their way back home.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.820
They stopped by a department store to buy
some stuff, and that's when Samuel breaks

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.300
the news to a stranger that his dad died while
driving Amelia, who was pregnant, to the hospital.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.700
Later at the park, Claire suggested how her
daughter ruby didn't want to have a joint

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.370
birthday party with Samuel since ruby disliked
Samuel.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.221
Samuel somehow managed to climb to the top
of a swing during this talk and scared the

00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:27.480
adults.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.889
The ride back home wasn't pleasant as Samuel
kept screaming.

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:36.129
Mrs. Roach, the old neighbor of Amelia, noticed
that something was wrong.

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:41.780
10:00 to 21:00, as usual, Samuel pressurizes
his mother to read him a storybook.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.390
This time, Amelia let Samuel choose the book.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.730
Samuel pulls out this red book and gives it
to his mom.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.060
The storybook gave off a bad vibe and was
too scary for a toddler to see its images,

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.269
so Amelia suggested Sam take another book.

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.829
However, Sam argued back that he wanted his
mom to read the story of the babadook.

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.860
In the book, babadook is represented wearing
a long black hat and long black coat.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.769
His eyes were round and terrifying, and he
had long, creepy black claws type of nails.

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.659
The story had sentences written like "when
he visits you, you won't sleep a wink and

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.189
once you see what's underneath, you are going
to wish you were dead."

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:28.500
Amelia started getting this terrible anxiety
attack reading the story of the babadook in

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.950
her head.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.970
In contrast, Samuel got curious and kept on
asking his mom whether the babadook would

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.659
come for him.

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:41.739
After a while, when Samuel would be busy crying
cus of being scared, Amelia tries to calm

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.739
him down by reading another storybook.

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.511
Later that night, Amelia had severe trouble
sleeping as she was curious about the story

00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:51.169
of the babadook.

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.420
She went and picked up the book only to finish
reading it thoroughly.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.139
"You cannot get rid of the babadook," it said.

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:02.659
Insomniac Amelia then went down to watch TV
to feel sleepy.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.689
It was while watching TV when her sexual drive
got triggered.

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:11.040
So she went upstairs to give herself some
alone time to pleasure herself.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.050
Meanwhile, Samuel saw someone standing inside
his cupboard.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.290
He rushed to his mom and yelled at her that
the babadook was in his room.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.569
Amelia made him sleep next to her.

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:26.319
After some time, when Amelia was reading,
she heard three light thumps on the door.

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:32.650
She ignored it, but after hearing three more
loud thumps, she got scared and tried to sleep.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.960
The next day Amelia asks aunt Clair if she
could look after Samuel while she was away

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.280
for work.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.070
Still, Samuel messes up the day by telling
Ruby about the babadook.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.120
Ruby gets beyond terrified, and aunt Claire
complains to Amelia about Samuels monster

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.120
talk.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.680
21:00 to 36:00 While making supper, Amelia
notices that Samuel was conducting a magic

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.090
show in a room that no one was supposed to
enter.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.380
It was the room where Samuels dad, Oskar,
kept his things.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.400
After sending Samuel to his room, Amelia checks
what Samuel had done inside Oskar's room.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.550
There she saw many stuffed animals, and beside
it, there sat a picture of Amelia and Oskar.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.300
Even though Oskar's death happened years ago,
Amelia still can't find a way to move on from

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.360
her husband's death.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.530
During dinner, Amelia finds pieces of glass
in her soup, but there was nothing when she

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.770
checked Samuels bowl.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.720
Amelia suspected that her son did this, but
Samuel kept arguing that the babadook did

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.720
it.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.220
Amelia was getting more and more worried.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.129
After going back to her room, Amelia saw that
the picture of her and Oskar had been scribbled

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:41.199
over.

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.470
She immediately stumbles into Samuels's room,
suspecting him, but Samuel seems to be unaware

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.470
of this.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:54.120
However, he is always ready and prepared to
pull out his DIY weapon to attack the monster.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.110
That night Samuel sees the babadook again
and screams, and that's when Amelia rushes

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.780
to Samuels room to see Sam hiding underneath
his bed, frightened to bits.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.810
Samuel uttered the words "don't let it in"
quite a few times, and that's when Amelia

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.500
notices the babadook book on the table.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.069
Amelia has had enough.

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.770
So she tears the pages of the babadook book
and throws it inside her trash can.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.000
Amelia continues to hear weird noises but
ignores them.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.610
The next day, Samuel and his mom go to Ruby's
bday party, but it doesn't go very well since

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:35.070
Amelia gets offended by one of Claire's friends,
and worse than that, Samuel pushes Ruby from

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.310
the top of a treehouse.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.680
This incident gave Claire more reasons to
hate Samuel and her sister.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.500
On the way home, Samuel gets one of those
disruptive episodes where he sees the babadook

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.689
coming for him.

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:52.600
Due to a febrile convulsion, Samuel is being
taken to the hospital.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.870
Amelia explains to the doctor about her and
Samuel not getting enough sleep.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.540
The doctor gives her pills to sleep soundly
at night.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:05.090
37:00 to 52:00 After taking the pill, both
Amelia and Samuel had a pleasant sleep after

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.099
a long time.

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:11.469
After waking up, Amelia hears the knocks on
her door and sees the thrown-away babadook

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:14.509
book right in front of her doorstep.

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:19.199
After going through it, she realizes that
someone had taped the torn pages and even

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:21.380
added a new plot to them.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.860
In the book, Amelia sees herself killing her
dog and son; eventually, she would take her

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.320
own life as well.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.380
And that would be the end of the story.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.030
Being Terrified to the core, Amelia burns
the book.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:40.360
She asks Claire for help and hints that someone
might have been stalking Amelia and her son.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.510
But Claire ignores her sister.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:48.939
Suddenly Amelia receives another phone call
which spurs out weird creepy noises from someone.

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:52.830
Amelia ran off to the police station to get
some help, but the officers could not help

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:57.009
her because she burnt off the only evidence,
the book.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:59.069
Amelia starts being delusional.

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:03.849
She saw a hole filled with cockroaches when
in reality, it was just a wall.

00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:08.340
While washing the dishes that night, Amelia
sees the babadook standing near Mrs. Roach,

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.389
who was watching tv.

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:14.740
Thinking it was just her delusions acting
up again, Amelia ignored it.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.600
However, things got really out of hand when
she saw the babadook hovering up onto her

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.659
from the ceiling and seeking an entrance inside
her body through the mouth.

00:08:24.659 --> 00:08:30.849
Amelia was scared to death, so she, Sam, and
their dog decided to rest downstairs.

00:08:30.849 --> 00:08:35.050
Even while watching tv, Amelia saw the babadook
numerous times.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:40.230
53:00 to 1:30:00 While Amelia was sleeping,
Sam came to ask for breakfast, but since she

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:45.880
was too exhausted to the point that she couldn't
even respond, Amelia ignored him.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:51.630
Sam's stubbornness didn't help much, and Amelia
roared back at Sam, perhaps in a very unnecessarily

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.190
rude way.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:58.410
To cheer Sam up, Amelia drove him to have
some goodies, but on the ride back home, Amelia

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:03.100
again had a delusional episode, which caused
her to crash into another car.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:08.930
Aṭ this point, the viewers would understand
the toll babadook took on amelia's body.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:14.279
She reacted to everything so rudely and in
very aggressive tones that even Sam was frightened

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:16.170
most of the time.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:21.360
That night especially, Amelia had yet another
delusional episode of seeing her son lying

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.320
dead on the sofa.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:28.850
When Sam woke her up, Amelia was surprised
to see her holding a knife to kill Sam.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:33.940
After a while, she goes so deep into her delusions
that she sees her dead husband standing right

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.160
in front of him.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.000
Though, the bliss of hugging her precious
one didn't even last that long since the babadook

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.600
captured Oskar.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.180
The babadook starts chasing Amelia, and no
matter how hard she tries to escape from its

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.120
clutches, she fails.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:54.010
Finally, when amelia was dying out of exhaustion,
babadook took the opportunity and completely

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.680
consumed her soul.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.750
Amelia, who now had her body controlled by
the babadook, attempted to kill their dog

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.750
Bugsy.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.480
Bugsy, unfortunately, died at the hands of
amelia.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:11.630
Her next target was her son Samuel, who somehow
managed to put some traps and capture amelia.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:16.540
After tying her down, Sam witnesses his mom
going through some horrific stages as if she

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.980
was possessed.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:22.670
He caresses her face gently when she attempts
to choke Sam, leading her to puke an inky

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.700
black material that removed the babadook from
her body.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.579
When Sam recalls to Amelia that "you can't
get rid of the Babadook," an invisible force

00:10:31.579 --> 00:10:33.810
takes him into the bedroom.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:38.080
After Sam has been saved, Amelia has been
forced to re-visit her husband's death by

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.329
the Babadook.

00:10:39.329 --> 00:10:44.520
Furiously, she faces the Babadook, retreating
into the basement, and locks the door behind

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.199
her.

00:10:46.199 --> 00:10:50.600
Amelia and Sam manage to recover after this
awful experience.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.500
Amelia is careful with him, encourages him
to use the weapons he creates and is impressed

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.820
by the magical tricks of Sam.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:03.680
In a bowl, they collect earthworms, and Amelia
carries them into the basement of the Babadook.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.840
She puts the bowl on the ground for Babadook
to eat.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.460
When the beast attempts to harm her, Amelia
soothes it down and it takes the earthworms

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.860
with her into the corner.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.899
Amelia comes back to the yard to celebrate
the birthday of Sam.

00:11:17.899 --> 00:11:22.380
So that was all for today; what did you think
