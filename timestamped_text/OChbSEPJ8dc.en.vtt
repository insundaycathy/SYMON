00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.590
- [Host] Everyone knows when
"Star Wars" takes place.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.057
It's the first thing you see.

00:00:04.057 --> 00:00:08.170
"A long time ago, in a
galaxy far, far away."

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.120
But between the sequels,
prequels, and spinoffs,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.310
it gets harder to pin
down just how long ago

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.890
these "Star Wars" stories happened.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.890
Good news is, this is the
timeline you've been looking for.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.860
Though "Star Wars" has an entire universe

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.090
of outside materials,

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.500
we're gonna stick with the
cinematic timeline for now.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.060
That means all the main
Episodes, Solo, and Rogue One,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.680
and some extended universe
knowledge to connect the dots.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.180
Even so, there's a lot we
won't be able to cover.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.870
So, in the spirit of
"The Rise of Skywalker,"

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.040
we're going to try to
stick to the primary story

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.550
around the Skywalker line.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.010
I know you're dying to hear
about everything on Canto Bight,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.510
but unfortunately, we don't
have time for stuff like that.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.540
To chart our calendar,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.800
we'll be using the standard
BBY and ABY year system.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.290
That's before and after
the Battle of Yavin,

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.980
aka the ending of "A New Hope."

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.700
Okay, no time to waste.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.204
At the sound of the gong, we begin.

00:00:57.204 --> 00:00:58.380
(gong twangs)

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.960
(film reel clicking)

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.530
A long, long, long time ago

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.800
on the oceanic planet of
Ahch-To, Age of the Jedi,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.080
a highly Force-sensitive
denizen founds the Jedi Order.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.830
The Jedi erect their
first temple and village,

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.410
and chronicle their philosophies

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.420
in a collection of ancient texts,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.510
all of which are cared
for by the native Lanai.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.550
You might know them
better as the Caretakers,

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.940
those turtle-nun things
that hang out with Luke.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.600
In addition to these holy sites,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.400
the Jedi establish the
Temple of the Whills

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.900
in the Holy City on Jedha.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.870
The Jedi Order protects the Old Republic,

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.380
the democratic government
based on the planet Coruscant

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.940
that peacefully unites
all the star systems.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.320
That peace is threatened
when one rogue Jedi

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.510
taps into the dark side of the Force,

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.540
driven by anger and fear.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.340
The Order banishes the rogue Jedi,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.300
but he takes a band of followers with him

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.760
and forms the Sith.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.710
The resulting schism leads to a civil war

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.460
that ravages the Old Republic.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.400
Ultimately, the Jedi are victorious

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.760
and force the Sith to
retreat to the darkest corner

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.740
of the galaxy.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.000
The Jedi build a new temple on Coruscant

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.620
atop an old Sith shrine,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.503
which becomes their central
hub for millenia to come.

00:02:02.503 --> 00:02:04.990
Through the years, the Sith lie dormant,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.430
waiting to strike again.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.620
Age of Republic, circa 1000 BBY to 24 BBY.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.960
The Old Republic soft-relaunches
as the Galactic Republic.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.450
In this new governing body,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.480
worlds elect senators to represent them

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.800
on a Galactic Senate.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.970
The Supreme Chancellor
oversees the Senate.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.260
We'll keep the space
politics to a minimum,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.310
but they're important.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.450
I'll just fast forward to 32 BBY.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.720
Wealthy corporations
like the Trade Federation

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.160
have representation in
the now-corrupt senate.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.507
They're in cahoots with
the Sith Lord Darth Sidious

00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:35.450
and his apprentice, Darth Maul.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.010
Sidious is scheming to
restore the Sith Empire

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.470
by way of lobbying and
political influence.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.730
To that end, Sidious has been
posing as Senator Palpatine,

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.510
a representative of Naboo.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.560
To moderate the Trade Federation's reach,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.310
the Galactic Republic passes a law

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.190
that taxes previously-untaxed
trading areas.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.070
That rubs the Federation
in all the wrong ways.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.350
A Jedi Master named Sifo-Dyas

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.880
worries that this dispute
will escalate into war,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.670
so he urges the Galactic
Republic to prepare an army.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.670
When his fellow Jedi refuse to listen,

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.280
Sifo-Dyas takes matters
into his own hands.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.580
He contacts the scientists
on the planet Kamino

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.790
and they begin production on a clone army,

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.540
using the bounty hunter
Jango Fett as a base model.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.170
Shortly afterward, Sifo-Dyas dies,

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.490
and Darth Sidious
incorporates the clone army

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.160
into his master plan.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.940
In protest of the new taxation,

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.930
the Trade Federation sets up a
blockade on the planet Naboo.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.420
Yep, the very same planet that
Senator Palpatine represents.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.840
To end the conflict with
discreet negotiations,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.350
Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.090
sends Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.810
and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.240
to the Federation flagship.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.620
But when they arrive, Darth
Sidious orders their execution

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.800
and the abduction of Naboo's
queen, Padme Amidala.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.400
The Jedi survive the ambush

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.170
and flee to the planet's surface.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.620
On Naboo, they meet a, uh,

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.800
eccentric Gungan named Jar Jar Binks.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.520
He helps escort them to the Gungan City

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.060
and onwards towards
Theed, Naboo's capital.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.890
And then he just kinda sticks around.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.310
They secure Queen Amidala,

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.680
but their ship's hyperdrive
is damaged in the frey.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.470
Hey, if a little astromech
droid named R2-D2

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.040
didn't repair the ship's generator,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.750
they would have been sitting ducks.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.240
So, before they can escort
Padme back to Coruscant,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.300
they have to make a pit stop

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.130
on the desert planet of Tatooine.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.640
While window-shopping for the
replacement hyperdrive part,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.370
they meet a young pilot
named Anakin Skywalker,

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.660
and his protocol droid in progress, C-3PO.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.980
Anakin and his mother are
slaves to the junk dealer Watto,

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.880
but Qui-Gon senses that the
Force is strong in Anakin,

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.650
so he makes a bet with his owner.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.640
If Anakin can win the local pod race,

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.560
then Watto will hand over the
hyperdrive part and the boy.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.360
Watto agrees, Anakin wins, and
they all head for Coruscant.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.340
Senator Palpatine persuades Padme

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.700
to push for Supreme
Chancellor Valorum's removal,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.340
insisting that he's corrupt.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.440
The Senate plays right
into Palpatine's hands

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.300
and elects him in Valorum's place.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.809
Good.

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:53.430
Good.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.660
Then, according to plan, the
Trade Federation attacks.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.940
In the Battle of Naboo, the
Gungans, including Jar Jar,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.220
help fend off the Federation's droid army,

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.230
while Darth Maul confronts
Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.160
Maul kills the master Jedi,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.690
but Obi-Wan slices Maul clean in half

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.810
and lets him fall down a
reactor shaft or something.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.510
With Naboo safe, Obi-Wan
becomes a Jedi Knight

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.940
and Anakin starts training as his Padawan.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.940
The Separatist Crisis and the
Clone Wars, 24 BBY to 19 BBY.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.270
For the next decade,

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.170
the conflict between the Galactic Republic

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.000
and its dissenters escalates.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.100
In 24 BBY, the estranged star
systems and megacorporations

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.880
rally together under
rogue Jedi Count Dooku.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.260
They form the Confederacy
of Independent Systems

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.300
to secede from the Republic.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.100
To avenge their defeat at Naboo,

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.840
the Trade Federation hires
the bounty hunter Jango Fett

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.520
to assassinate Queen Amidala.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.900
In response, the Jedi
Council deploys Anakin

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.690
as her bodyguard while
Obi-Wan investigates.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.350
The trail leads him to Kamino,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.490
where he discovers Sifo-Dyas'
secret clone army, and Jango.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.880
Obi-Wan pursues him to
the planet Geonosis,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.500
where the Confederacy is convening.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.560
Anakin and Padme are busy
having a forbidden romance,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.250
but they head to Geonosis
to rescue Obi-Wan,

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.930
and they all get captured.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.470
But they don't have to wait
long for reinforcements.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.060
Back on Coruscant, JarJar
suggests that the Senate

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.250
give emergency powers to Palpatine.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.060
Sure enough, his dellow felegates agree,

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.010
and Palpatine's first move
is to send an army of Jedi

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.740
and clones to Geonosis.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.750
Everyone throws down at
the Battle of Geonosis.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.760
Mace Windu slices Jango's head off,

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.070
Count Dooku slices Anakin's hand off,

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.980
and The Clone Wars are
officially underway.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.570
The Clone Wars rage on for three years.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.510
It's an excellent TV
series, highly recommend,

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.070
but we're gonna skip to the end in 19 BBY.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.530
With the armed forces of the Republic

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.470
dispatched across the galaxy,
Coruscant is left unguarded.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.770
General Grievous takes
advantage of the opening

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.300
and abducts Chancellor Palpatine
but, you know, not really.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.940
Obi-Wan and Anakin save him,

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.320
then Palpatine convinces
Anakin to execute Count Dooku,

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.870
who is also on board the ship.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.640
Upon their return to the surface,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.250
Anakin learns that Padme is pregnant,

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.800
then Palpatine appoints
him to the Jedi Council.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.090
So things are looking good.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.310
But the other Jedi refuse to
grant him the rank of Master.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.760
Anakin is outraged,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.950
driving a wedge even deeper
between him and the Council.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.700
While Obi-Wan is off chasing Grievous,

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.970
Anakin cozies up to Palpatine,

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.890
who reveals his true
allegiance to the Sith.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.790
Normally, Anakin would turn
him over to the Jedi Council,

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.040
but he's been having
visions of Padme's death.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.480
Once Palpatine tempts him
with the power to save her,

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.760
Anakin is conflicted.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.170
Still, he informs the Jedi Council.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.490
A squadron of Jedi arrive
at the Chancellor's door

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.280
to arrest him, and Mace
Windu has him on the ropes.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.170
Unfortunately, Anakin rolls
up, attacks Mace Windu,

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.540
and Palpatine sends the Jedi Master

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.160
flying with some Force lightning.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.040
Heavily scarred, Palpatine
manipulates the situation

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.220
to demonstrate the danger of the Jedi,

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.960
then initiates Order 66,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.810
which designates all Jedi
as enemies of the republic.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.770
Clone troopers across the
galaxy eradicate the Jedi

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.180
in a great purge.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.310
Darth Sidious knights Anakin
as his new Sith apprentice,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.650
heretofore known as Darth Vader.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.280
In his first act of villainy,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.910
Vader slaughters the
younglings at the Jedi Temple,

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.430
then travels to Mustafar

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.840
to silence the remaining
Confederacy leaders.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.100
Obi-Wan shows up,

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.650
and the two duel through
the fire and the flames.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.900
In the end, Obi-Wan gets the high ground

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.490
and defeats his old friend,

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.490
leaving him to die on the lava banks.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.990
However, Darth Sidious finds
Vader and revitalizes him

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.340
with mechanical limbs and a
noisy breathing apparatus.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.710
Elsewhere, Padme gives birth to twins,

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.150
Luke and Leia, then dies.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.700
Obi-Wan takes Luke into
hiding on Tatooine,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.450
while former-senator
Bail Organa adopts Leia

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.050
and takes her to Alderaan.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.860
Yoda goes into hiding on
the swamp planet Dagobah.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.380
He won't be too lonely, though.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.560
Qui Gon has been hitting
him up as a Force ghost,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.460
and teaching him how to do it, too.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.110
Age of the Empire, 19 BBY to 0 BBY.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.670
The Empire is in full reign of the galaxy,

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.480
so obviously their next big move

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.660
is to build a giant orbital
planet-killing battle station.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.100
Under the cover of a
sustainable energy initiative,

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.570
they construct the
Death Star's superlaser.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.770
The lead scientist, Galen Erso,

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.450
wises up to the Empire's true intentions,

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.410
so in 17 BBY, he deserts the Empire.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.200
He, his wife Lyra, and their daughter Jyn

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.810
go into hiding on the
planet Lah'mu for four years

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.910
while production on the Death Star stalls.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.720
In 13 BBY, agents of the
Empire track down the Ersos,

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.770
murder Lyra, and abduct Galen.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.140
Jyn stays hidden with the help

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.560
of extremist rebel, Saw Gerrera.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.150
Around the same time,
on the planet Corellia,

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.160
scrumrats Han and Qi'ra make moves

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.920
to escape their life of crime.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.390
Han smuggles a valuable vial of coaxium

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.840
away from a botched job for Lady Proxima.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.810
He and Qi'ra plan to use it
to bribe their way offworld.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.150
They make it to the spaceport,

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.400
but Proxima's lackeys snatch Qi'ra.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.220
The crime boss sells her into slavery,

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.550
which eventually brings her
into the custody of Dryden Vos.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.130
He's the figurehead of the
Crimson Dawn crime syndicate,

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:57.140
led by Darth Maul, with
freaking sickass robot legs.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.690
By 10 BBY, Qi'ra becomes one
of Crimson Dawn's top agents.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.760
One of Vos' other criminal
associates, Tobias Beckett,

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.280
goes undercover as an Imperial Mudtrooper.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.360
He meets Han, who has been
serving in the military

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.990
ever since he lost Qi'ra
at the Corellia terminal.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.790
Han believes Qi'ra is still there,

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.950
so he joins Beckett
and his band of thieves

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:16.930
for a train heist.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.840
Oh, and he also brings his
new wookie buddy, Chewbacca.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.250
Too bad the the job goes horribly wrong.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.140
They lose the refined coaxium payload

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.850
and half the team dies.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.350
Tails between their legs, Han, Chewbacca,

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.420
and Beckett return to Dryden
Vos to face the music.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.920
Han and Qi'ra reunite, so Han gets cocky.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.940
He promises Vos a shipment
of unrefined coaxium

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.860
straight from the source,
the spice mines on Kessel.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.650
He's definitely full of hot air,

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.820
but he has to deliver if
he wants to save his neck.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.600
To accomplish this impossible feat,

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.670
Qi'ra recommends they hook
up with Lando Calrissian,

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.620
captain of the fastest ship in the galaxy,

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.340
the Millenium Falcon.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.850
Lando agrees to be their pilot
for a cut of the payment,

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.900
and with that, they're off to Kessel.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.950
This time, the heist is a success.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.880
Using the sophisticated routing system

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.380
of Lando's piloting droid L3-37,

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.020
the Falcon makes the Kessel
Run in less than 12 parsecs.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.180
The team arrives at Vos'
rendezvous spot with the coaxium,

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.230
but they are intercepted
by the Cloud Riders,

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:13.800
a group of nondescript rebels

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.430
who are resisting Imperial control.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.920
Han decides to give them
the coaxium instead,

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.910
so he tricks Vos.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.360
In the ensuing showdown, Qi'ra kills Vos,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.570
and Han kills the double agent Beckett.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.160
Qi'ra stays behind to work for Darth Maul

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.270
in the Crimson Dawn.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.880
Then Han wins the
Millenium Falcon off Lando

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.110
in a game of sabacc.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.750
But that's okay, because
Lando would later win

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.320
all of Cloud City in a card game.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.160
Afterward, the Cloud Riders
give the unrefined coaxium

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.690
to Saw Gerrera.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.540
Over the next 10 years,
cells like the Cloud Riders

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.560
merge to form the Rebel Alliance.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.240
Among their ranks is Princess
Leia, Anakin's daughter,

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.080
raised as Alderaan royalty.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.950
Luke, meanwhile, has
grown into an ambitious,

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.700
if a little whiny, young man
who dreams of becoming a pilot.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.310
On the Imperial side of things,

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.140
Galen Erso reluctantly
completes the Death Star laser,

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.830
but he sabotages it by installing
an exposed reactor module.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.190
One hit would detonate the entire station,

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.090
and that weak spot can be found
in the Death Star schematics

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.650
at the Citadel Tower on the planet Scarif.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.367
He sends this intel to Saw Gerrera,

00:12:13.367 --> 00:12:15.500
and the Rebel Alliance catches wind of it.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.850
They aren't on good terms with Gerrera,

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.880
so they track down
someone who is, Jyn Erso.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.290
She's made a pointed effort
to stay away from the war.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.370
The Rebel leaders convince
her to give them an audience

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.950
with Gerrera, so she leads
them to his base on Jedha.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.870
Eventually, Gerrera shows
Jyn her father's message.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.760
Before it finishes, the
Empire uses their superlaser

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.730
to destroy the Holy City.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.660
Jyn's team barely escapes,

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.640
but Gerrera gets caught in the blast.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.230
Eventually, Rogue One
infiltrates Citadel Tower

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.850
and transmits the schematics
to the Rebel command ship,

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.140
achieving their first major victory.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.240
However, the Empire fires
their laser down at the base,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.870
vanquishing the entire team.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.750
But thanks to their sacrifice,
there's hope for the galaxy.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.540
Age of Rebellion, 0 BBY to 5 ABY.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.800
That hope lasts for all of 10 minutes

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.140
before Darth Vader storms the Rebel ship.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.730
Before she's taken captive,

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.860
Princess Leia dispatches R2-D2 and C-3PO

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.570
with the schematics to get
help from Obi-Wan Kenobi.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.410
The droids wander the wasteland

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.300
until some Jawas grab them and sell them

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.630
to local moisture farmer
Owen Lars, Luke's uncle.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.130
The persistent R2-D2 abandons
the farm to find Obi-Wan,

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:23.700
and Luke follows him out.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.010
When they meet Obi-Wan,

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:26.900
he gives Luke his father's lightsaber

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.130
and offers to bring him along to Alderaan,

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.390
but Luke declines.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.080
He returns to his farm
only to find it decimated

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.460
by Storm Troopers, and his
aunt and uncle burnt to crisps.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.510
First thing's first, they need a pilot,

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.500
so they hit up the Mos Eisley
cantina to find a ride.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.460
Luckily for them, Han Solo
and Chewbacca are in town.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.550
After an Empire spy rats them out,

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.400
they all take off on
the Millennium Falcon.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.110
As they are en route to Alderaan,

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.190
the Empire uses the Death
Star to eradicate the planet,

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.050
so the gang arrives to only find wreckage.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:57.820
The battle station then pulls them aboard

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.010
with its tractor beam, which
works out in their favor

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.900
since they needed to
save the Princess anyway.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.580
While Luke and Han find Leia,

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.480
Obi-Wan goes to shut down
the station's tractor beam.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.457
He crosses paths with Darth Vader,

00:14:08.457 --> 00:14:11.340
and the two reprise
their decades-old duel,

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.980
albeit much slower with a lot less lava.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.900
Luke and the others watch helplessly

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.260
as Darth Vader strikes
Obi-Wan down before them.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.780
With the Princess saved and
the schematic reclaimed,

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.470
the Rebel Alliance regroups on Yavin IV.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.470
They devise a coordinated
attack on the Death Star,

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.350
in which they'll exploit Galen
Erso's faulty reactor shaft

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.210
to blow the whole damn
thing to smithereens.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.630
The odds are low and the
situation looks grim.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.240
With much of the fleet taken
out by Imperial TIE fighters,

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.960
Vader is right on Luke's tail,

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.800
but Han swoops in and bails him out.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.950
Luke takes the shot.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:46.630
It's a slam dunk and
the Death Star explodes.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.880
After this epic failure,
the Empire decides

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.170
the whole giant orbital
planet-killing battle station thing

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:55.320
was a good idea, it
just needs to be bigger.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.380
They commence construction
on the Death Star II,

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.740
near the forest moon of Endor.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.030
For the next three
years, the war continues,

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.840
pushing the Rebels into
hiding on the ice planet Hoth.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.130
In 3 ABY, the Empire tracks
them down and storms their base.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.790
The team splits up, with
Luke heading to Dagobah

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.360
to formally begin his
Jedi training with Yoda,

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.590
while Han, Leia, and Chewbacca
make their way to Bespin

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.530
to take shelter with Lando Calrissian.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.650
Darth Vader anticipates their arrival,

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.380
so he strikes up a deal with Lando.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.540
The posse stumbles right into his trap.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.440
See, the Empire hired Boba Fett

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.950
to track the Millenium Falcon.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.860
Now that the gang is in Vader's clutches,

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.450
Han gets frozen in carbonite

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.060
and Boba Fett hauls him off to Tatooine.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.070
Luke senses that his
friends are in danger,

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.870
so he prematurely ends his training

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.250
and scurries off to help.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.720
He confronts Darth Vader

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.990
and they duel deep inside Cloud City.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:47.330
But the inexperienced fighter
is no match for the Sith Lord.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.820
Vader slices off Luke's hand

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:53.120
and lets him know that he is his father.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.010
You know the line.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.540
Luke then drops into the
depths of the floating colony,

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.650
where the Millenium
Falcon gives him a lift.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:01.840
The heroes are shaken, but
their hope is unwavering.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.730
Over the next year, Luke
acquires a shiny new hand

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.350
and a shiny new lightsaber.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.420
In 4 ABY, he and his friends
lead a rescue mission

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.300
to save Han from Jabba's palace.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.940
In the process, Leia
strangles the gluttonous Hutt,

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.090
while Han sends Boba Fett
spiraling into the sarlacc pit.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.930
Reunited, the Rebels
prepare for a final assault

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.020
on the Empire, whose second Death Star

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.340
is nearing completion.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.240
They set up shop on Endor and befriend

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.790
the local merchandising
opportunities, the Ewoks.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.190
While Lando leads the battle
against the second Death Star

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.600
in the Falcon, Luke journeys
inside to face his father.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.510
Emperor Palpatine awaits him there

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.800
and tries to entice Luke to the dark side.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.550
Luke is unflappable,

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.920
so he and Vader clash lightsabers again.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.610
This time, Luke is triumphant,

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.960
but still won't give in to the dark side.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.200
With Vader incapacipated
and Luke's resolve strong,

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.600
the Emperor whips out his electric hands

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.260
and forces the young
Skywalker to the ground.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.210
Then in his first and final
act of father-son bonding,

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.580
Vader lifts Palpatine and
lobs him over a railing.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.290
Unfortunately, the full force
of Palpatine's lightning

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.480
has done its damage and Vader
is in critical condition.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:10.060
In his final moments, Luke
unmasks his father to say goodbye

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.820
to Anakin Skywalker, his true father.

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.640
Luke escapes, Lando blows
out the Death Star's core,

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.950
and everyone parties back
on Endor with the Ewoks.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.330
With the Empire severely
weakened, the galaxy rejoices.

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:23.910
The pillars of the Rebel Alliance

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.370
become the foundation of a New Republic.

00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:29.100
However, they're not out
of the woods just yet.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.020
For the next year,

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.750
the Rebels ward off
remnants of Imperial cells,

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.920
culminating in the
Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.040
The crash of the Star Destroyer Inflictor

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.000
marks the end of the civil
war, and that same year,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.440
Ben Solo is born to Leia and Han.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.470
Age of the New Republic, 5 ABY to 34 ABY.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:50.370
A decade after the Battle
of Jakku, Rey is born.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.900
According to Kylo Ren,
her parents are drunkards

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.900
who pawn her off to Unkar
Plutt for quick cash,

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.350
but we don't know who they actually are.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.610
Either way, Rey keeps
surviving as a junker on Jakku,

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:03.790
convinced that they'll
return for her one day.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.110
She grows up outside
the Starship Graveyard,

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:08.640
wistfully imagining herself
as a one of the Rebels.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.670
But the truth isn't so glamorous.

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.580
Han Solo loses the Millenium
Falcon to a Red Nikto

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.830
named Gannis Ducain, who
loses it to the Irving Boys,

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.020
who loses it to Unkar Plutt on Jakku.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.380
He and Chewbacca patiently
wait for the tracking beacon

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.670
to go back online so they can reclaim it.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.500
In 21 ABY, the remnants of the Empire

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.820
rise from the ashes of the First Order,

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.210
a legion of more violent,
more vindictive extremists.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:34.960
They're under the leadership
of Supreme Leader Snoke,

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.680
a disfigured and unqualified commander

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.010
with a flair for golden robes and rings.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.840
By 28 ABY, Leia becomes
aware of this looming danger,

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.570
but the Galactic Senate is
unwilling to hear her out.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.860
They don't exactly trust Darth
Vader's daughter, you know?

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.630
So, she resigns from the Senate,

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.840
then aligns with other believers
to form the Resistance.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.550
Luke rebuilds the Jedi Order

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.930
and takes on a new generation of padawans.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:00.920
One of them is his nephew Ben,

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.180
who proves himself worthy of
the powerful Skywalker lineage.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.140
So much so, in fact, that Luke fears him.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.480
In a moment of weakness,

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.530
Luke contemplates murdering
his nephew in his sleep,

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:13.120
but his better judgment returns.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.930
It's too late, though, as
Ben wakes up to see Luke

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.580
with his lightsaber at the ready.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.170
His faith in the Jedi shaken,

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:20.840
Ben slaughters the other pupils

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.230
and burns Luke's temple to the ground.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.060
He runs off with Supreme Leader Snoke

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.700
and takes on a new alias, Kylo Ren.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.640
Guilty about his nephew's corruption,

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.530
Luke turns his back on the Force

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.590
and exiles himself to Ahch-To.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.480
Age of Resistance, 34 ABY to 35 ABY.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.390
The First Order runs with the Empire's

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.840
giant orbital planet-killing
battle station thing,

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.810
only they decided to make it even bigger.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.430
They construct the Starkiller Base,

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.220
a weapon with the size and
inhabitability of a planet.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.510
Leia believes the Resistance's
only hope is to find Luke,

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.310
so she enlists hot-headed
pilot Poe Dameron

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.810
to retrieve a map to Ahch-To.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.330
Kylo Ren has also been
on the hunt for this map,

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.180
looking to kill his former master.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.570
When Poe and Ren collide on
Jakku, Poe gets taken captive.

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.450
But before he does, he
dispatches the astromech BB-8

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:09.650
with the map to get help.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.250
Eventually, BB-8 stumbles upon Rey.

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:16.230
Meanwhile, a Stormtrooper
named FN-2187 goes rogue

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.600
and helps Poe escape
from First Order custody.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.410
Poe gives him a nickname, Finn,

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.290
and they crash land on Jakku,

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.470
but Finn can't find a trace
of Poe besides his jacket.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.920
So, he dons it and heads to the Outpost.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.170
Rey and BB-8 are there, and
the astromech recognizes

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:34.030
Poe's jacket, so they all join forces.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:36.170
With the First Order hot on their trail,

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.060
they take off on the Millennium Falcon.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.480
With the beacon reactivated,

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.310
Han and Chewbacca follow the
signal and board the ship.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:43.960
While sympathetic to the cause,

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.870
Han doesn't want to face the
Resistance, meaning Leia,

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.620
so they hit up Maz Kanata's
place to find a willing ride.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.370
Once there, Rey finds
Luke's old lightsaber,

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:54.920
touches it, and gets
flooded with Force visions.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.620
She barely has time to think it over

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.210
when the First Order attacks, abducts her,

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.240
and takes her back to Starkiller Base.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.010
With the aid of the
Resistance, Han, Chewbacca,

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.050
and Finn infiltrate the Base.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:09.310
While Finn finds Rey,
Han goes solo, mm-hmm,

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.470
to blow up the station's
thermal oscillator.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.270
He crosses paths with Kylo Ren,

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.530
and Han tries to turn
him back to the light.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.550
Rey and Finn watch helplessly

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.070
as Kylo Ren strikes Han down before them.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.250
In a fury, Chewbacca shoots
Kylo with his bowcaster,

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.420
severely injuring him and
blowing up the explosives,

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.100
creating an opening for Poe Dameron

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.750
to destroy the thermal oscillator,

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.730
and Starkiller Base along with it.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.600
As the planet crumbles around them,

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.710
Kylo chases Rey and Finn
into the snowy woods.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:38.250
Kylo slices Finn's back,

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.370
but Rey taps into her latent Force powers

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.250
and overcomes the injured warrior.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:43.320
All three of them escape

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.910
before Starkiller Base finally explodes.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:47.343
With the map to Ahch-To reclaimed,

00:21:47.343 --> 00:21:49.440
Leia sends Rey to find Luke.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.060
But the rest of the resistance
has a problem on their hands.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.020
The First Order is hunting them down,

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.540
and they're all forced to retreat.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.840
From here on in, there's
a harrowing space chase

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.630
as the First Order picks off
Resistance ships one by one.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.680
Leia's in a coma, her buddy
Admiral Holdo takes over,

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.720
Finn and this random engineer named Rose

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.020
head to a casino planet
called Canto Bight,

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.670
oof, there's a lot going on.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.700
On Ahch-To, Rey meets the old Jedi Master,

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.970
but he is unwilling to
join the Resistance.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.180
Even so, Rey persuades Luke to teach her

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.200
the ways of the Force,

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.280
and even though he's fearful
of her power, he obliges.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.330
Throughout their training,
Rey has Force-calls with Kylo,

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.810
and the two become convinced
that they can turn the other

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:28.643
to join them.

00:22:28.643 --> 00:22:30.560
She tells Luke about
her plan to turn Kylo,

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.540
but Luke's not having any of it.

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:35.690
After they clash, Luke has
a heart-to-heart with Yoda.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.440
Yoda suddenly burns
down the old Jedi tree,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.040
assuring Luke that failure
is the greatest teacher.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.070
Luke's worried about
the sacred Jedi texts,

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.820
but Rey swiped them before she departed

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.060
for Snoke's battleship.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.480
Once she's on board, Kylo Ren delivers her

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.730
directly to Snoke.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.000
But in a turn of events,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.070
Kylo Ren gives the Supreme
Leader the Darth Maul treatment,

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:57.000
and he and Rey team up and duke it out

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.870
with the Elite Praetorian Guards.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.200
At the end of the battle,

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.300
Kylo doesn't want to join
the light or the darkness.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.850
He wants to just do his own thing.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.530
He invites Rey to join
him, but she refuses

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.240
and escapes after they
destroy Luke's lightsaber.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.853
In this time, Leia comes to,

00:23:11.853 --> 00:23:13.660
Finn and Rose's mission to Canto Bight

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.350
turned out to be an utter failure,

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:18.430
and Admiral Holdo wiped out a
bunch of the First Order fleet

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.440
by crashing the Resistance
ship into them at light speed.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.170
Badass scene, will not lie.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.570
Despite her sacrifice,

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.950
the First Order have cornered
the last of the Resistance

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:28.300
on the salt planet Crait.

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.040
Kylo Ren intends to make
the killing blow there,

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.940
but Luke basically pulls
the greatest Jedi mind trick

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.250
of all time.

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.410
He creates a Force projection of himself

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:38.900
from across the galaxy,

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.500
and battles Kylo Ren in front of everyone.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.140
Their battle buys the Rebels
enough time to escape,

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.380
but Luke exerts too much energy.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.020
He fades away, becoming
one with the Force.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:53.000
Now Luke is gone, the Resistance
has been all but decimated,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.060
but the spark of rebellion
has restored hope

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.210
to the people across the galaxy.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.890
And that's what we know heading
into "Rise of Skywalker."

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.660
We obviously condensed
a lot of history here,

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.720
so go ahead and fill in
the blanks in the comments.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.780
And remember to subscribe to Cinematica

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.580

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:12.283
I've been your host, Justice,
and we'll see you next time.
