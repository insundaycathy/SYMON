00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.120
on the verge of succumbing to after effects&nbsp;
of the chemicals and smoke from the explosion&nbsp;&nbsp;

turn phoenix into an unveiling or donor who lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.040
who dies in the final moments of any horror&nbsp;
film it often comes down to a moral judgment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:19.520
in the form of come up with life is reward in&nbsp;
death as punishment don't pray too strongly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:28.640
subscribed to this theory and much like the first&nbsp;
don't preach it wants to operate in the gray areas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:37.520
between who's good and who's bad it's just not&nbsp;
really as good as making its audience manipulation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:03.600

her way to children's shelter joining the group&nbsp;
of happy looking kids out front they asked her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:58.480
name she considers everything that just transpired&nbsp;
for a moment that answers phoenix is the blind man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:07.760
a bad guy the first don't breathe gave us plenty&nbsp;
of reasons to cheer for norman is a veteran who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:17.280
lost his sight in the gulf war his daughter was&nbsp;
killed in a tragic car accident he was wrong but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:26.640
the justice system but wider killer work and he's&nbsp;
an old guy in a dilapidated house who just want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:35.040
be left alone by the end of the film it also given&nbsp;
us plenty of reasons to feel bad about cheering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:43.600
for him he seemed to take us statistically&nbsp;
in hunting and murdering the home invaders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:53.280
he had a doctor his child's killer and tied her up&nbsp;
in his basement and despite his protestations to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:01.360
the contrary he was a rapist don't breathe 2 seems&nbsp;
to go the opposite way at the beginning of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:10.160
film he's not only carry all the baggage from the&nbsp;
first movie that would have the audience decidedly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:18.000
not on his side but norman has now adopted a&nbsp;
little girl racer on the lines and is treating her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:27.120
like a cages bird but by the end of the film he&nbsp;
has somehow made inroads towards redeeming herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:34.560
by serving as her protector and repeatedly&nbsp;
sacrificing himself to keep her able parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:43.680
at bay how you feel about norman at the end of the&nbsp;
don't break two will play a big part in whether&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:52.320
you like or dislike it sadly another factor that&nbsp;
will pay a big part is how you interrupt his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.320 --> 00:09:02.160
final words when it seems as though the trait has&nbsp;
subsided and relieve his dead norman in phoenix&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:12.800
here a moment he is banged up and bloody no doubt&nbsp;
but old man seems likely to live that when he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:21.120
bagged her to masterful filmmaker is good at&nbsp;
manipulating the audience like a marionette while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:28.480
hiding the story they used to listen happiness&nbsp;
anger and other emotions don't breathe too does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:36.720
not show any signs of a master filmmaker at work&nbsp;
and skeptical interpretation of the operating line&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:44.880
could be the director rhoda shakes needed norman&nbsp;
to say that so the audience would turn against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:54.000
the blind man pleasing them when he is apparently&nbsp;
mortally is tapped second later a lace skeptical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.280
interpretation could be that norman scrams that&nbsp;
trait to show character growth in its final&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:09.680
moments in the original don't break two you went&nbsp;
out of his way to tell rocket that he is not a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:18.960
rapist but simply somehow who offered his captive&nbsp;
it deal that she willingly accepted if you allow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:28.240
the blind man to impregnate her and then carried&nbsp;
the baby to term she would be set free it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:37.120
horrific obviously but in this twisted mind it&nbsp;
allowed him to justify its actions so which do you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:46.400
believe is a raved and exploited alignment to make&nbsp;
us once and for all went the blind man dead or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:54.160
last minute confession that shows he's ready to&nbsp;
accept punishment and confessed all signs save me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:01.520
moments after the aforementioned exchange&nbsp;
norman is established in sims to be on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:11.200
verge of death phoenix banks are quite as a father&nbsp;
to hang on showing not only that she cares for him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:20.480
but also that she forgives him for what he's done&nbsp;
i can save you she insists you already have he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:29.040
replies and that is that it's a rare sweet moment&nbsp;
in the don't breathe series it's also somewhat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:38.880
disheartening if you take the i wrecked life&nbsp;
for what it should be a confession that he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:46.560
committed such awful crimes while norman's mothers&nbsp;
could perhaps somewhat be justified the killings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:57.040
we witnessed all the extraordinary circumstances&nbsp;
of self-defense and home invasion and took up some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:06.080
very bad people who likely would have murdered and&nbsp;
otherwise harm to others but rape do you really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:14.960
want to think he was saved from any guilt there&nbsp;
again it's open to personal interpretation of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:24.480
introspection what you want to save or effectively&nbsp;
absolve such a man on his deathbed at times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:31.200
don't pray 2 feels like a really dumb&nbsp;
film but it does give you something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:39.120
substantial to work at the aim does phoenix&nbsp;
get a happy ending by choosing the name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:47.360
phoenix to introduce herself to the other children&nbsp;
and the shelter she was effectively choosing to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:56.640
forward in life while embracing the heritage and&nbsp;
still that are by the blind man norman certainly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:05.360
had this issue but he did teach her self-reliance&nbsp;
valuable suspicious of her follow human beings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:14.240
and perhaps the resolve to life a better more&nbsp;
open life after seeing the prison is existence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:23.520
become it she had told those kids her name was&nbsp;
tara that would most likely have indicated that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:31.680
you wanted to put the norman era of her life&nbsp;
behind her that she would ignore his teaching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:40.320
suppressed memories of the man and instead try&nbsp;
most likely falling to rescue the life she had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:47.840
originally been on before the math explosion&nbsp;
with both of her birth parents now gone what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:57.280
did she even go back to obviously she remembers&nbsp;
very little of them in whatever lessons they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:06.960
imparted on her during her first few years of life&nbsp;
most likely artwork take forward instead perhaps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:13.920
he should have got a third route phoenix&nbsp;
tara could have given the third name making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:23.440
something up on the spot to indicate a rebirth and&nbsp;
a new person to develop that might have been the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:31.120
most uplifting and they especially because&nbsp;
the audience have been seeming conditioned to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:40.160
despise not just moments before okay he said&nbsp;
she saved him but are we really supposed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:47.360
want phoenix to grow up to be like the blind&nbsp;
