Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.009
Today, I'm going to show you an action, fantasy,
horror film called “Constantine.”

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:07.009
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.920
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.470
A man digs through rubble in a desert area
and finds an old spearhead wrapped in a nazi

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.470
flag.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.780
As soon as he unwraps the flag, he’s taken
over by an entity and starts moving, void

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.910
of free will.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.200
As he crosses the road, a bus slams into him.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.880
The bus crumbles, and the man gets up and
continues walking.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.340
In John Constantine’s world, heaven and
hell are not only real but exist in dimensions

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.240
parallel to the human world at a different
plane of existence.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.530
John is an exorcist working with his apprentice,
Chas, finding and banishing demons that misbehave

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.620
in the mortal plane.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.690
In a small apartment in Los Angeles, a mother
prepares breakfast for her sick daughter.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.150
She collapses to the floor, screaming, upon
seeing her daughter levitating and snarling.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.210
The family immediately seeks help from men
of faith to save their daughter.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.120
John enters the apartment, and Father Hennesy
meets with him.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.850
He tells John he’s found one that John has
been seeking.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.989
Hennesy tells John he failed to exorcise whatever
is inside the young girl and has called on

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.010
him for help.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.379
The possessed girl is tied up to her bed,
and John opens a window, letting sunlight

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:00.379
in.

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.070
He produces a talisman that casts a shadow
on the young girl, and the girl snaps at him.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.810
John presses the amulet onto the girl’s
forehead, and it immediately starts sizzling.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.950
The girl begins convulsing and screaming as
John mutters an incantation.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.590
The girl stops shaking, but a silhouette pops
out from her neck, looking ready to tear out

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.840
of the girl’s body.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.510
John realizes he must hurry to exorcise the
demon and asks for a mirror.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.240
The family gets a large mirror and helps hold
it above the girl.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.310
John smashes a window and asks Chas to move
the parked car below.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.530
John has the mirror tied to a pulley above
the window and advises everyone in the room

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.000
to shield their eyes.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.400
One of the men takes a peak, and he starts
screaming, his hair turning gray.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.290
John uncovers the girl’s eyes, and the demon
escapes, getting trapped in the mirror.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.650
John orders Hennesy to pull the mirror, but
it doesn’t fit through the window.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.570
John takes over, trying to pull the mirror
out, and sees the demon trying to escape.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.730
He puts all his weight in the rope, and the
mirror flies out the window, falling onto

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.829
the car, smashing to pieces.

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.110
John steps out of the room and sees a sketch
drawing of what looks like a spearhead and

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.520
recognizes it as the Spear of Destiny, the
same spear the man earlier found in the desert.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.970
John tells Hennessy that the exorcism was
not standard, and he vaguely predicts something

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.120
big will happen.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.700
John leaves, and Chas drives him home.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.090
Police detective, Angela Dodson, confesses
to a priest.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.929
She tells him that she’s killed another
criminal.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.559
She’s concerned about the number of killings
she’s done, saying it feels natural.

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.799
She always seems to know precisely where these
bad men are and know the exact moment when

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.299
she should pull the trigger.

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.060
She wonders if there’s something wrong with
her, and the priest tells him God has something

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.060
planned for her.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.579
At home, she has a dream of waking up from
a hospital bed.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.319
She hears the name, Isabel, whispered before
she gets up, sneaking up the stairs to the

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.699
hospital roof.

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:34.159
She removes her medical tag, letting it loose
in the wind before she jumps.

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.329
She falls, smashing through a glass roof into
a pool of water.

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.170
She floats momentarily before waking up back
in her bed, breathing heavily.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.919
The following morning, John Constantine gets
an x-ray of his lungs, and a doctor tells

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:49.049
him he has an advanced form of terminal lung
cancer, only having a short time left to live.

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.280
In the same hospital, Angela arrives at the
scene of a suicide.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.219
She uncovers the corpse and the woman looks
exactly like her.

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.529
Isabel is her twin sister who had been admitted
to the hospital as a mental patient.

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:02.010
Her colleague tells her Isabel jumped from
the roof, but Angela says she knows Isabel

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.579
and she’s not the one to kill herself.

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.959
John’s friend, Beeman, arrives at John’s
apartment with an excited grin.

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.790
He brings with him a plethora of items and
equipment for John.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.230
Beeman gives John bullet shavings from an
assassination attempt on the pope, holy water

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.700
from the river of Jordan, and a screech beetle
that repels demons.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.420
Beeman asks what the new assignment is about,
and John tells him about the exorcism.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.700
John says he saw a demon soldier trying to
exit from the young girl's body into the human

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.700
realm.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.059
Beeman is surprised to hear this, knowing
the demons can only control humans and possess

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:31.590
them but can never enter the human physical
realm.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.419
Just to be sure, John asks Beeman to do some
research into this phenomenon.

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.180
John and Chas then head to a church, and John
again runs into Angela.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.079
Angela speaks with a priest while John goes
straight for Gabriel.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.189
John sees Gabriel’s dark wings and refers
to it as a half-breed.

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.650
Gabriel knows why John has come and tells
John angels still keep track of the most wayward

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.980
souls.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.269
Angela asks the priest to give Isabel a catholic
funeral, but the priest says the bishop has

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.650
decided against it.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.349
Since Isabel died of suicide and is considered
a mortal sin, she cannot be allowed a Catholic

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.439
burial.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.659
Angela tries to reason, but the priest tells
her there’s nothing he can do.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.109
John tells Gabriel about an influx of soul
travel in the mortal realm and asks Gabriel

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:07.870
if God can extend his life.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.510
Gabriel laughs, finding John’s determination
to get into heaven a lost cause.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.629
John reminds Gabriel of all the demons and
hell minions he has banished and sent back

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:15.629
to hell.

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.019
He considers his service a guarantee into
the gates of heaven.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.870
Gabriel answers, that all John has done is
not enough.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.949
Self-sacrifice and belief is the only thing
that will get John into heaven.

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.770
John complains that he’s already done so
much sacrifice, and he believes in God.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.091
But Gabriel points out that John only knows
of God’s existence, but John doesn’t believe

00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:32.199
in the Almighty.

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.610
John argues he’s pulled demons out of children
to save their lives, but Gabriel counters

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.990
that John has only done this for his benefit
so that he’ll be allowed into heaven.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.439
Meanwhile, Father Hennessy runs his hands
through several newspapers, hearing the news

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:44.460
articles in his head as he touches them.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.169
He goes through a pile of papers before focusing
on one: the suicide of a person with a mental

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.430
health condition, Isabel.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.980
Angela reviews footage of Isabel’s death
and hears her mutter Constantine’s name.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.760
She recognizes the name as the rude man in
the church.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.340
As John smokes, he sees someone approach him,
and he realizes it’s a demon covered in

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.949
all sorts of insects.

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.040
The demon attacks John, sending him flying
across the road.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.520
The demon then warns John to leave the demons
alone.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.259
John tries to repel the demon using the screeching
beetle, and the demon gets hit by an oncoming

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:12.319
van.

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:15.759
John then meets with Chas, and the pair head
to Midnite’s Nightclub.

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.270
Inside the nightclub, John sees half-breeds
interacting with one another in peace.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.199
John heads to the back room, where he meets
Papa Midnite.

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.370
Midnite is a holy man who has sworn to neutrality,
taking neither the side of heaven nor hell.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.349
John tells him that a full-fledged demon had
attacked him earlier.

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.139
Midnite considers this impossible as demons
cannot cross over to the human realm.

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.400
This is the rule both sides must agree on
to maintain balance.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.300
The two are interrupted when a demon half-breed,
Balthazar, enters the room.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.860
As he plays with his coin, he addresses Constantine.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.000
John gets insulted and threatens to exorcise
him back to hell.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.469
Midnite steps in, warning both of them that
no hostilities can happen inside the nightclub.

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:52.889
John heads home and Angela knocks at his door.

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.469
She has tracked him down and is asking for
his help.

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:59.050
Angela informs John that she believes her
sister Isabel had been murdered.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.539
Angela explains believes that her sister had
been brainwashed into committing suicide.

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.830
She further stresses that Isabel was a devout
Catholic and would never have taken her own

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:06.830
life.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.139
John still refuses to help, and Angela leaves.

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.129
John sees shadows from his window going after
Angela, and he chases after her.

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.189
John decides Angela’s case may have something
to do with what’s happening in heaven and

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:17.189
hell.

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:20.540
He tells Angela about the existence of heaven
and hell, but not in the way most people believe

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.540
it.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.520
Angela scoffs at the thought and says she
believes people are evil and need no other

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.520
motivation.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.439
John then agrees but asks her to consider
that people can be capable of both good and

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:31.960
evil, but sometimes, get a little nudge from
one of the two sides.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.009
The lights suddenly turn off, and the pair
are stuck in darkness and John takes out a

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:36.270
piece of cloth.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.090
They hear loud gusts of wind from unseen beings
flying overhead.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.099
John lights the fabric, and a large fire blazes
to life, spreading light and exposing the

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:44.310
demons surrounding them.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.530
The demons are burned, screeching, and flying
away.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.620
Angela vomits from the shock of what she had
seen.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.629
John theorizes that demons could be after
Angela, not him.

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:56.830
John asks Angela if she genuinely believes
that Isabel would never commit suicide.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.330
Angela stands her notion that Isabel must
have been murdered.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.710
To know whether Isabel had committed suicide,
John must journey into hell to find her soul.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.560
At Angela's apartment, John prepares a basin
of water and suspends his feet in them.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.060
He asks Angela to leave, and she complies.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.509
Constantine takes Isabel’s cat and stares
into its eyes to establish a connection with

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:14.509
Isabel’s soul.

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:16.889
Constantine’s perception of time slows down.

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:20.470
As time comes to a complete standstill, John
finds himself in hell.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.660
He takes out Beeman’s holy water and keeps
it close for a quick escape.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.759
He makes his way through the hellish landscape
as fiery winds and scorched earth surround

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:27.759
him.

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:31.310
Finally, John sees Isabel at the edge of a
building, and she calls out to him.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.819
Demons approach them from all sides, and Isabel
takes off her medical tag.

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:37.449
It flies in the wind, and Constantine tries
to catch it.

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:40.310
He runs after the flying tag, but the demons
see him.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.830
As Isabel falls from the edge, Constantine
reaches for the tag, and the demons swarm

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.830
him.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.740
As he catches the tag, he smashes the holy
water on his chest and appears back in Isabel’s

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:49.740
apartment.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.069
John realizes Angela and Isabel were twins
and tells Angela that Isabel had committed

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:55.620
suicide and hands her the medical tag.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.130
Father Hennessy finds Isabel’s corpse at
the morgue.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.740
He grabs her arm and tries to read into her
memories but a mark suddenly appears on Isabel's

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.740
wrist.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.389
Hennessy collapses to the ground in fear upon
seeing this symbol.

00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:08.849
He tries to drink from his liquor flask, but
the liquid doesn’t reach his mouth.

00:08:08.849 --> 00:08:11.990
He finds a store next door and tries to drink
from wine bottles, but the liquor stays in

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.990
the bottle.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:16.889
He smashes several bottles open, but the alcohol
still refuses to flow out.

00:08:16.889 --> 00:08:18.800
Hennessy falls to the floor, choking.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.819
He grabs a bottle opener and stabs his palm.

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:24.630
Balthazar appears, playing with his coin,
watching Hennessy suffer.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.680
Hennessy then starts choking from booze, the
liquor flowing out of his mouth.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.860
Balthazar had manipulated him into thinking
he couldn’t drink anything, but was in fact,

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.599
drinking everything he had opened.

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:35.469
Hennessy dies drowned from alcohol.

00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:39.240
John explains to Angela that as a kid, he
had seen demons and other evil entities.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.250
His parents, not knowing what to do, had him
treated, which, in turn, made the situation

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.250
worse.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.710
Unable to cope with what’s happening to
him, the young Constantine commits suicide.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.380
He was officially dead for two minutes, but
in hell, time moves differently, and he felt

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.290
like he had been there for a lifetime.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:57.110
When he returns to life, he realizes that
everything he could see is real.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.850
Both heaven and hell exist simultaneously
on Earth, at the same time, but in different

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.029
planes of reality.

00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:06.269
To maintain control over humans, half-breeds
like Gabriel and Balthazar were created.

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:08.200
These can give whispers to humans.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.649
Some can provide bursts of courage, while
others can provide excruciating fear and dread.

00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:16.090
Angela then gets a call about Father Hennessy’s
death, and the two head to the scene.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.170
John sees Hennessy and notices a bloody mark
on his palm.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.150
Hennessy had carved out the symbol he had
seen on Isabel on his palm for Constantine

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.150
to see.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.740
John takes the symbol and asks Beeman to research
it.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.310
John tries to look for clues in Isabel’s
room.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.440
He believes Isabel would have been smart enough
to leave a clue for Angela.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.240
He says the connection between twins is strong,
and he forces Angela to try and remember anything

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.970
that can help with the case.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.970
Angela then remembers how they’d leave one
another secret messages as kids as a unique

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.490
way of communicating.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.760
She exhales but her breath fogs up a window,
revealing something written.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.420
John sees the message Corinthians 17.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.760
As they drive, Beeman communicates with them
through the phone and explains that the bible

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.010
they should refer to is the bible from hell.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.440
According to the hell bible, Corinthians 17
talks of a son of the devil that will bring

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.079
everlasting darkness upon humanity when unleashed.

00:09:59.079 --> 00:10:02.560
The symbol on Isabel’s wrist is the sign
of Mammon, the son of the devil.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.350
The bible says that Mammon wants to forge
his kingdom of hell, trumping that of Satan’s.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.490
For this to happen, Mammon must possess a
powerful psychic and must be brought into

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.740
this world by a divine being.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.600
Before Beeman could finish, he suspects something
is coming for him.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.579
He hangs up the phone, and insects start coming
out of his eye.

00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:20.040
John and Angela rush to Beeman but are too
late.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.160
They see Beeman dead, covered in insects,
spewing out of his mouth and nose.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.050
The man carrying the Spear of Destiny is seen
walking to a car.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.779
He smashes the window before stealing it and
driving towards Los Angeles.

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:34.210
Angela finally reveals that she, too, had
seen things when she was young.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.510
When she saw Isabel getting an outcast and
being treated for mental illness, she denied

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.880
seeing the demons.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.630
As she got older, her visions slowly disappeared.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.300
She feels guilty, as she feels like she abandoned
Isabel when she needed her.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.089
She wants to experience hell first hand, knowing
her sister is in there, suffering.

00:10:49.089 --> 00:10:51.550
John agrees, and they fill a bathtub with
water.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.300
Angela lies underwater, and John holds her
down.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.470
Angela starts running out of breath and squirms.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.660
She tries to get Constantine off of her, and
she starts to drown.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:04.040
Time starts slowing down for Angela, and in
a split second, she journeys to hell and back.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.769
She finally understands how she could always
tell where the criminals were and when to

00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:08.010
pull the trigger.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.360
She suddenly gets up and runs to Beeman’s
office.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.920
She reaches down and finds Balthazar’s coin.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.649
John arrives at Balthazar’s penthouse, and
John blows through the wall, throwing Balthazar

00:11:16.649 --> 00:11:17.649
back.

00:11:17.649 --> 00:11:19.950
Balthazar pounces on John and starts choking
him.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.750
John reaches into his suit and pulls out brass
knuckles emblazoned with holy crosses.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.190
John gets the upper hand and subdues Balthazar.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:30.490
John stands over Balthazar, preparing to exorcise
him, but John threatens he would instead bless

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.440
him and send Balthazar’s soul to heaven.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.680
Terrified, Balthazar tells John that the key
to Mammon’s arrival on the human realm is

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.380
the Spear of Destiny.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.240
Angela appears behind John, and Balthazar
laughs, saying his only goal was to get Angela

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.240
to the building.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.790
John then shoots Balthazar.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.210
John and Angela then make their way down,
discussing the Spear of Destiny and how it

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.009
plays into Mammon’s plan.

00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:52.740
A figure arrives, standing over Balthazar,
and Balthazar asks to be revived as he’s

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.000
done what was asked.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.050
But the figure simply watches Balthazar waste
away.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.820
Angela realizes that with Isabel dead, she
would be the powerful psychic needed for Mammon’s

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.820
birth.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.630
She suddenly feels a strange sensation.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:07.100
Before they could react, Angela is pulled
away through several walls of concrete.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.589
John chases after her, but Angela is dragged
across the building.

00:12:10.589 --> 00:12:13.500
She flies through the night sky, and John
is left alone.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.560
John then forces his way into Midnite’s
room and declares that he desperately needs

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.889
to use the chair.

00:12:17.889 --> 00:12:21.279
Midnite is insulted and pins John to a wall,
digging into his chest.

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:25.130
John tells Midnite that none of the two sides
are following the rules anymore, and his neutrality

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.250
has been removed, as the demons are already
making a move.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.839
Midnite finally agrees.

00:12:29.839 --> 00:12:32.800
They head into Midnite’s artifact storage
and find a wooden chair used for electric

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.279
capital punishment.

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:37.090
John takes off his shoes, and Midnite wets
the floor.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.790
Midnite then takes a live bulb, opening it,
and readies himself to stab electricity through

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:41.790
John.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.040
As Midnite connects the bulb with John, John
sees the man carrying the spear.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.060
John witnesses the man’s journey and sees
him heading to the hospital.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.750
At the hospital, half-breed demons are gathered,
awaiting Mammon’s arrival.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.920
While planning how they’ll fight an army
of half-breeds, Chas chimes telling Midnite

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.180
and John that half-breed demons become vulnerable
when their outer skin is washed off with holy

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.649
water.

00:12:59.649 --> 00:13:02.949
Angela arrives at the pool where Isabel died
and sees the man carrying the spear.

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:06.410
She shoots him, unloading a full magazine,
but it does not affect the man.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.760
John and Chas arrive at the hospital, and
Chas heads to the water reservoir to bless

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.500
it, turning it into holy water.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.290
John proceeds to the demons.

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:16.949
Chas drops a blessed holy cross into the water
tank, and it turns into holy water.

00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:20.100
John faces the horde of half-breeds and declares
he’ll kill all of them.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.290
John places a lighter at the sprinklers, and
holy water rains on them.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.370
John then dispatches each demon, shooting
them to pieces.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.319
Chas comes in just in time, and the pair head
to Angela.

00:13:29.319 --> 00:13:32.009
The man drowns Angela, and she reappears in
hell.

00:13:32.009 --> 00:13:34.589
She sees Mammon in the flesh, and it enters
her.

00:13:34.589 --> 00:13:38.819
John finds Angela now possessed with Mammon
and rushes in to exorcise the demon.

00:13:38.819 --> 00:13:41.509
Angela and John struggle, and Chas helps to
subdue her.

00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:45.550
John then starts chanting incantations over
Angela, and it seemingly works as Angela snaps

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.800
back to normal.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.529
For a moment, Angela takes a breath, but she
suddenly feels something inside her.

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:54.170
She starts screaming, and they see Mammon
in her stomach trying to claw its way out.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:57.589
Chas joins John chanting, and Mammon retreats
momentarily.

00:13:57.589 --> 00:14:01.360
Chas then suddenly gets thrown back and gets
smashed several times into the floor and ceiling,

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.879
getting killed instantly.

00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:06.339
John places his arms together, creating a
symbol and the room’s roof seems to open

00:14:06.339 --> 00:14:07.339
up.

00:14:07.339 --> 00:14:09.510
But suddenly, Gabriel drops down on John.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.009
John finally realizes that Gabriel’s divine
touch will give birth to Mammon as Gabriel

00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:15.180
uses the spear to cut open Angela.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.019
Gabriel says that humans have become too complacent,
ignorant of the old ways of belief.

00:14:19.019 --> 00:14:22.720
Mammon’s rise would cause much pain and
suffering, and so, those who rise above would

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.620
be truly worthy of God’s love.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.639
Gabriel then holds John up, blowing him away,
smashing him into a glass door.

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:31.100
Now truly desperate, John calls on God’s
help.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.620
John takes a piece of glass and slits his
wrists.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.540
As John bleeds, Gabriel takes the Spear of
Destiny and prepares to unleash Mammon.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.120
As Gabriel brings down the blade, time stops.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.240
The Devil himself then appears.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.830
Lucifer makes his way to John, who lays dying.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.230
Lucifer is excited to see John and even allows
him to have one last cigarette.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:52.140
John then tells Lucifer that Gabriel is in
the other room, about to release Mammon.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.420
Lucifer laughs, believing it to be a trick.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.660
But John tells him to look for himself.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.910
Lucifer then enters the room with the pool
and sees the spear in Gabriel’s hand, inches

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.290
away from Angela.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:05.250
Without hesitation, Lucifer takes Angela away,
saving her from the spear.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:09.329
Time moves again, and Gabriel is in utter
shock, coming face to face with Lucifer.

00:15:09.329 --> 00:15:13.379
Gabriel prepares to smite Lucifer in God’s
name, but Gabriel’s fist stops short.

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:16.110
Lucifer smiles and tells Gabriel God has abandoned
him.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:19.230
Lucifer then declares hell is still his domain
and banishes Mammon back to hell while he

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.310
burns Gabriel’s wings off.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.290
Lucifer returns to John, now ready to take
him to hell.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.480
Lucifer asks what John wants in return for
warning him of Mammon’s plan, and instead

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.129
of asking for an extension of his life, John
instead requests Isabel’s soul be sent to

00:15:31.129 --> 00:15:32.129
heaven.

00:15:32.129 --> 00:15:35.160
And with one gesture, Lucifer agrees and sends
Isabel to heaven.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.069
He then starts dragging John down, but John
suddenly becomes extremely heavy, and he can’t

00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:40.069
move him.

00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:43.759
The walls open up, and the Kingdom of Heaven
reveals itself, accepting John.

00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:48.129
Now that he had committed a selfless sacrifice
for Isabel’s soul, God now accepts him.

00:15:48.129 --> 00:15:50.329
Lucifer is angered and pulls John back.

00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:52.930
He digs into John’s lungs and takes out
the cancer.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:56.100
Lucifer declares that John shall continue
living, giving him more time to prove that

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.310
John’s soul truly belongs in hell.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.759
John wakes up with all of his wounds healed.

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:03.589
Angela also wakes up, and the two see Gabriel
in the pool.

00:16:03.589 --> 00:16:05.959
They see that Gabriel has now been turned
human.

00:16:05.959 --> 00:16:09.970
Gabriel entices John to take revenge and hands
him his shotgun, asking John to shoot.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.879
John instead punches Gabriel.

00:16:11.879 --> 00:16:14.850
Gabriel winces, experiencing pain for the
first time.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:18.660
John and Angela then head to the roof, and
John gives Angela the Spear of Destiny for

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.879
safekeeping.

00:16:19.879 --> 00:16:25.010
Angela agrees, and the two part ways, saying
they’ll meet some other time again.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:35.459
John stares into the night, realizing that
God does indeed have a plan for him.
