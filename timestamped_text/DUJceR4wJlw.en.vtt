00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.960
﻿In part 1 we witnessed dumb and dumber&nbsp;
get trapped in a crawl space by alligators&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.240
with a category 5 hurricane arriving. Haley&nbsp;
tried to get her phone to call 911 and got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.200
snapped up in the process. In part 2 we will&nbsp;
see if we can escape the crawl space alive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.840
and beat the gator-icane in, Crawl.
I want to backtrack a bit because I forgot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.000
to riff on this in the past video, but&nbsp;
the fact that it’s a common myth to zig&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.080
zag when being chased by an alligator is bad and&nbsp;
definitely not an effective strategy at all. 
&nbsp;

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.000
Yah, they can course correct way faster than a&nbsp;
human. Your only advantage is your top speed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.240
endurance. You need to get out of their&nbsp;
short attack range as fast as possible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.400
and zig zagging just slows you down.
&nbsp;

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.600
Okay, where were we. Ah, yes, Haley’s&nbsp;
leg is stuck inside a 1 ton alligator's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.120
mouth and is getting thrashed around&nbsp;
like Dicaprio in The Revenant.
&nbsp;

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.560
Speaking of the bear attack in the Revenant,&nbsp;
which would you guys rather get killed by,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.600
a bear, or a gator? I’m inclined to say a&nbsp;
bear, because I'd rather die to a majestic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.480
animal than a swamp monster, but Joe Rogan&nbsp;
said that bears are likely to just pin you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.360
down and eat you while you’re alive. Getting&nbsp;
chomped on and drowned by death roll would suck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.840
but at least the gator wants you dead as soon&nbsp;
as possible. I don’t know, tough choice.
&nbsp;

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.440
Haley stomping its eyes instead of&nbsp;
floundering like fish out of water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.440
makes me want to up her score back to a&nbsp;
5/10, but she shouldn’t have put herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.200
in this position in the first place, so nah.
The gator releases it’s grasp and she manages to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.240
hobble off on her certainly broken leg, only&nbsp;
to get cornered by another 1 ton beast. 
&nbsp;

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.600
What the hell are they feeding these things?
Somehow shoving rodent traps over their heads is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.080
an effective strategy and foils the gator’s&nbsp;
ambush. While they are distracted she makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.080
her getaway by crawling headfirst into a web of&nbsp;
cables. I know it’s a stressful situation and all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.480
but she easily could have low crawled underneath&nbsp;
the cables instead of right into them.
&nbsp;

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.920
Just when the gator is about to take a&nbsp;
chunk out of her she breaks free. 
&nbsp;

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.200
What is the other alligator doing,&nbsp;
don’t tell me it’s still banging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.920
its head against the wall trying&nbsp;
to get the squirrel trap off.
&nbsp;

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.760
Haley is running out of options, but stumbles past&nbsp;
a screwdriver her dad lost when he was attacked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.040
and did what he obviously didn’t&nbsp;
do, stab it in the eye.
&nbsp;

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.080
This buys her enough time to slip into a crawl&nbsp;
space within the crawl space, where the now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.080
pissed off alligator can’t get to her. 
Well, was going for the phone worth it? I’m&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.920
telling ya, you should have just broken&nbsp;
the wood floor above you and hopped out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.840
If you’d just listen to me, I could save&nbsp;
you a lot of pain and tragedy. 
&nbsp;

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.320
Roughly translated, it’s saying, “come on out&nbsp;
bitch, try that again and see what happens.” 
&nbsp;

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.840
Haley uses this breathing room&nbsp;
to assess her leg situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.120
Can you imagine getting viciously attacked,&nbsp;
narrowly escaping, and then because you’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.640
so pumped on adrenaline pain-killers that you&nbsp;
literally have no idea how bad your injuries are.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.680
Logically, you know you got absolutely mangled.&nbsp;
It could be a couple bite holes in your leg,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.360
or your leg could be hanging on by&nbsp;
a thin piece of flesh. But you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.320
to remove your clothing to know for sure. 
It’s actually not that bad all things considered,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.320
but she’s definitely not keeping that&nbsp;
swimming scholarship. Thanks Dad.
&nbsp;

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.240
Haley tries to stunt the bleeding&nbsp;
by applying a makeshift tourniquet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.560
If you’ve seen my other video, you’d already&nbsp;
know she’s going about it all wrong. 
&nbsp;

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.480
You should only apply tourniquets if&nbsp;
the bleeding is extreme and unable to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.760
be stopped by direct pressure. What’s extreme?&nbsp;
When your description begins with, holy shit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.080
that’s a ton of blood. A good example is&nbsp;
the medic in Saving Private Ryan.
&nbsp;

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.680
God it hurts to remember that scene. 
Yes, Haley’s bleeding a fair bit, it’s not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.800
like she got a papercut, but I wouldn't say it’s a&nbsp;
holy shit that’s a ton of blood type of situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.440
She needs to uncover the full extent of her&nbsp;
injuries by ripping and removing the clothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.720
surrounding the wound, and checking all around it.&nbsp;
You don’t want to find out that the warm puddle of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.800
water you’re sitting in, it’s not water.
 
Judging by the color of the blood with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.040
flashlight on it, and how it’s slowly&nbsp;
pouring out, I'd say it’s a cut vein.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.840
Possibly the subsartorial vein.
Venous bleeding is easier to stop because it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.040
has lower pressures, and should only need 10-15&nbsp;
minutes of direct pressure. Once she controls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.520
the bleeding, she’ll need to dress the wound. If&nbsp;
the wound bleeds through the first dressing, she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.800
needs to apply another on top. If the wound bleeds&nbsp;
through the second dressing, only then should she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.960
consider alternative options to stop the bleeding,&nbsp;
like applying a tourniquet around her thigh.
&nbsp;

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.440
Haley mistakenly thinks that her bleeding&nbsp;
can’t be controlled by direct pressure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.720
so she rips off some thin cloth from her tactical&nbsp;
capris pants and ties it around her leg. 
&nbsp;

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.040
Couple problems here.
She’s using way too thin of a material, she would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.680
be better served by ripping a large enough piece&nbsp;
of clothing that she could fold into something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.000
1.5-2 inches in thickness. The cord from her&nbsp;
capris is too thin and will cause localized nerve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.440
damage. If she had any chance of saving her leg&nbsp;
and that swimming scholarship, it’s gone now.
&nbsp;

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.600
Her placement is decent. It should&nbsp;
be 2 inches above the wounded area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.680
because severed veins or arteries can&nbsp;
contract further up into the body.
&nbsp;

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.080
The next problem is that she ties it up&nbsp;
like it’s a shoelace. She needs to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.880
that screwdriver as a windlass to crank the&nbsp;
tourniquet tight. If it’s not tight enough,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.520
it either won’t stop the bleeding, or it&nbsp;
can actually increase the blood loss. 
&nbsp;

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.480
The remaining problem is that she didn’t record&nbsp;
when she put the tourniquet on, which doctors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:05.840
need to safely treat her, when, or at the&nbsp;
rate things are going, if she gets out.
&nbsp;

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.560
They probably only have a couple of hours&nbsp;
maximum before this crawl space and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.480
roads are completely flooded, making escaping near&nbsp;
impossible. Even a few feet of water will severely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.400
impair their ability to move around and&nbsp;
use weapons. Which are really the only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.200
two advantages they have right now. 
Their window for survival is rapidly closing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.680
They need to break through the ceiling with the&nbsp;
shovel, or run for the basement entrance using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.240
the shovel to fend the gators off. Especially&nbsp;
with more gators showing up to the party.
&nbsp;

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.960
Instead of breaking through the ceiling with&nbsp;
the shovel, big brains is using it as a crutch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.800
to scoot around. Where he’s going, I don’t even&nbsp;
think he knows. How he’s not in excruciating pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.200
by now, I have no clue. Initially I could&nbsp;
understand his confusion as he might have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.400
been in shock. But he’s fairly calm and lucid.&nbsp;
The pain should be overwhelming by now. 
&nbsp;

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.440
Not to mention all the bacteria in his open wound&nbsp;
from the gator teeth, and the disgusting sewer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.240
water. Dave will be lucky to keep his leg at this&nbsp;
point, Haley too with that shitty tourniquet.
&nbsp;

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.920
Haley wants to go to the front of&nbsp;
the house to try to call for help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.680
which is confusing because her phone is destroyed,&nbsp;
everyone has evacuated already, and your voice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.720
won’t carry at all in this hurricane. She’s&nbsp;
just risking her life for no reason again.
&nbsp;

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.080
Meanwhile, Dave kicks his broken leg up onto a&nbsp;
wall and tries to cinch his tibia back into his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.600
leg with the toolbelt.
Sigh. 
&nbsp;

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.320
1. This should have been done a long time ago,&nbsp;
preferably with Haley’s help in the safe area.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.600
I could understand why she didn’t&nbsp;
check and treat his leg initially,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.840
because it was more important to get them&nbsp;
out of the dangerous area first. That and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.800
she had no first aid or medical training. 
2. If you’re an incompentent moron like Dave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:06.400
you should not be setting the broken bone. Trying&nbsp;
to squeeze your jagged exposed tibia back into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.440
your leg could cause more internal damage and&nbsp;
bleeding by severing arteries, muscles, ligaments,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.400
and tendons. It’s also going to be obscenely&nbsp;
painful and you’ll likely pass out trying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.240
and with gators preying on you, now’s&nbsp;
not a good time to pass out.
&nbsp;

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:26.400
3. Using a toolbelt as a splint is an order of&nbsp;
magnitude dumber than Haley using essentially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.920
a shoelace as a tourniquet and attempting to cut&nbsp;
circulation off of her femoral artery by looping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:37.280
the left bunny ear around the right bunny&nbsp;
ear and pulling it tight. He needs to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.640
two ‘rigid’ objects that are long enough&nbsp;
to stabilize both joints above and below&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:48.560
the fracture point. So his ankle and knee.&nbsp;
He could unscrew or break off some pipes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.920
or dare I say, pop off the wood planks&nbsp;
above him, then use his shirt and belt to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:59.120
tie them around his leg. The whole point of the&nbsp;
splint is to immobilize the joints and wound,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.880
so using a leather toolbelt has got to&nbsp;
be the worst thing you could choose.
&nbsp;

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.800
Haley gets to the porous brick wall and see’s some&nbsp;
people in a boarded up gas station 50 yards away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:16.240
and proceeds to yell help, as if they could hear&nbsp;
her. They couldn’t have heard you even if there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:22.000
wasn’t a hurricane. It’d be more effective to&nbsp;
strobe your flashlight, which she does, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:35.840
surprisingly it gets the looters attention.
Too bad it’s a full on gator-pocalypse now. 
&nbsp;

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.560
I’m beginning to think that these are not normal&nbsp;
alligators. The most plausible explanation is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:50.080
a nearby gator farm owner was running experiments,&nbsp;
and breeding them for intelligence and aggression.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.240
That or they installed Neuralink brain&nbsp;
machine interfaces to control the alligators&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.920
so they could murder their annoying&nbsp;
neighbor, Dave, without suspicion.
&nbsp;

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.840
Or they were just hungry gators from a flooded&nbsp;
farm that should have had higher fences.
&nbsp;

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:14.160
The ATM, I get. What I don’t get is risking your&nbsp;
life for a couple three day old cold hotdogs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.320
and 2 dollar sunglasses. I’m not sure I brought&nbsp;
enough Darwin awards to hand out to everyone.
&nbsp;

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.560
Haley, taking her dad’s shitty advice once again,&nbsp;
tries to make it to some access hatch location,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.840
supposedly it’s another&nbsp;
way out of the crawl space.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.720
Except it’s blocked. Wonder what dumbass put a&nbsp;
bunch of heavy boxes right on top of it.
&nbsp;

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:40.640
Maybe, for the millionth time, break the wood&nbsp;
planks or pry them off with the screwdriver or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.080
piece of metal nearby. I know it’s not as easy&nbsp;
as simply judo chopping a hole in the floor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.120
but you’d think being at the precipice of&nbsp;
death would ignite the required ferociousness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.120
necessary to break down walls.
If she could break to the topside, she could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:00.560
grab Sugar and call off this rescue mission. Dave&nbsp;
doesn’t need your help, remember. I’m sure he can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:06.080
hobble out of there himself with his toolbelt&nbsp;
splint slash tourniquet. She has already sunk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:11.040
a lot of sacrifice into his extraction, so&nbsp;
she might as well see it through. She should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.720
make it to the first floor, have him yell, find&nbsp;
his location, then use the tools by the sink,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.160
in the garage, or from his truck to break the&nbsp;
wood floor above him, then pull him out.
&nbsp;

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.440
Judging by the rate of water flowing in, and the&nbsp;
radio saying the levees would likely break soon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.000
they will drown if they don’t&nbsp;
figure this out soon.
&nbsp;

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.160
Beth’s ex-boyfriend fling shows up&nbsp;
to check on Dave after all. 
&nbsp;

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.640
It’s a good thing he didn’t only visit his&nbsp;
condo, but also the old escrowed house. 
&nbsp;

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.240
This fling really knows a lot about this&nbsp;
family for supposedly just being a fling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.880
I’m sensing some stalker vibes here.
While Wayne is trying to rescue two wounded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.320
survivors before the storm surge hits, Wayne’s&nbsp;
partner takes up the important task of checking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:05.200
out the mysterious swingset that's getting&nbsp;
tugged on by something in the floodwaters. 
&nbsp;

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.400
I’m not sure why the swingset is so captivating&nbsp;
to him, literally any random object could be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.960
pulling against it. It’s also inadvisable to&nbsp;
be walking around in the floodwaters because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:23.840
there could be potholes, downed power lines, sharp&nbsp;
objects, fast moving objects in the current..
&nbsp;

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.640
...and hungry alligators.
&nbsp;

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:32.560
Again, realistically speaking this would&nbsp;
be extremely unlikely. But, it is possible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.320
which is why you want to keep your hands&nbsp;
and feet inside the boat at all times.
&nbsp;

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.280
Wayne finds the two bozos and radio’s what’s&nbsp;
left of his partner to grab the snare pole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.600
and help him fish the gators out. 
In this fictional world with gators this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.320
strong and aggressive, I don’t think a snare&nbsp;
pole is a viable option. Where would they even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.200
put the gator once they snare it. Outside?&nbsp;
It could easily swim back over. And with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.920
flood waters rapidly rising they really don’t&nbsp;
have time to waste playing let’s go fishing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.840
Wayne just needs to just break up the wood floor&nbsp;
above them so they can get the fuck out ASAP.
&nbsp;

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.600
Go Haley! Wayne getting mauled is the perfect&nbsp;
distraction for you to make your escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.840
He’s putting up quite the fight too, so you&nbsp;
should have plenty of time to swim to the exit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.440
I know i’m going to get shit for saying&nbsp;
this, but he really is a lost cause. 
&nbsp;

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.200
Haley opts to use Wayne’s brutal&nbsp;
death to make a break for her dad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.840
I honestly don’t know where anything is in this&nbsp;
maze. I know it’s Haley’s childhood house, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.160
maybe she has a better sense of direction, but&nbsp;
still, it seems like you could easily get turned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.400
around and find yourself in a dead end. Especially&nbsp;
since you couldn’t actually see where you were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.120
swimming in the dark murky sewage water.
The second gator locks on to her and tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.120
chase her down, but it’s no match for an&nbsp;
average collegiate swimmer with clothes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.800
on and a shitty tourniquet applied&nbsp;
around her severely wounded leg.
&nbsp;

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.080
Maybe these gators have gotten fat&nbsp;
and slow from having their blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:07.600
diverted to digesting the cops and looters. It&nbsp;
does take 2-3 days for gators to digest most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.960
prey. Not something I'd count on though.
What a smart decision. She could have escaped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.920
the basement and saved both their lives. Now&nbsp;
they both get to drown in each other's embrace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:21.440
Just when all hope seems lost, Dave gives her&nbsp;
a motivation talk about perseverance. 
&nbsp;

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.240
He says that when Haley was little, her sister&nbsp;
Beth could make it the length of the pool on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:31.040
one breath, when Haley couldn’t. And that&nbsp;
night at 2:00 o’clock in the morning he heard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:36.960
Haley outside in the pool trying to achieve a&nbsp;
one-breath lap too. Isn’t that pretty dangerous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.120
being in a pool by yourself as a kid,&nbsp;
nobody around or awake, trying to see how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.480
long you can hold your breath underwater.&nbsp;
Pretty sure that’s how people drown.
&nbsp;

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.360
As they say, if you’re gonna be dumb, you gotta&nbsp;
be tough. With all the heart to heart talks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.160
Dave’s giving, you’d think he would apologize or&nbsp;
at least show some remorse for causing this entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.200
disaster and getting multiple people killed.
The latest strategy Dave devised is to bang&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:09.600
on the pipes while Haley swims to the basement&nbsp;
entrance. He seems to think that banging on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.160
pipes earlier made the alligators angry or&nbsp;
disoriented, and that doing so should buy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:19.600
her enough time to get past them. What evidence&nbsp;
does he have for this? Absolutely nothing.
&nbsp;

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.720
Alligators are tuned to pick up sensitive&nbsp;
vibrations in the water, so banging on pipes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:30.000
could provide some light auditory cover for Haley.&nbsp;
This plan doesn’t account for alligators being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.240
primarily vision-based hunters. You&nbsp;
can bang on the pipes all you want,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.720
but if they spot her, she’s dead.
The other problem with the pipe banging tactic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.520
is that it will draw the alligators right to&nbsp;
him. I still have no clue where they are now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.720
but he should go to that blocked off safe&nbsp;
area before banging on the pipes. 
&nbsp;

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.840
Let’s say that breaking through to the ceiling&nbsp;
wasn’t possible, what should they do. I do think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.640
that hatch that Haley tried to open is still&nbsp;
their best. It’s a potential escape point and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.440
blocked off from gators. If both of them can make&nbsp;
it there, I'm sure they could force it open. 
&nbsp;

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.720
If not, then well, yah trying to create some form&nbsp;
of diversion or distraction while someone goes for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.760
the entrance is the best you can hope for. Haley&nbsp;
could use the shovel to sever Dave’s lower leg&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:19.040
off completely, then use that as bait while they&nbsp;
swim for the stairs. Sorry Dave, but I think you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.440
need to take one for the team. 
Haley mistakenly listens to her dad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:30.480
yet again, and attempts to outswim the alligators.&nbsp;
Dave also mistakenly doesn’t go to the blocked off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.600
area before banging on the pipes, and draws the&nbsp;
attention of the second gator. I don’t see how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.880
either of them will realistically survive this,&nbsp;
but they do have immense strong plot armor.
&nbsp;

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.920
No way he could have seen the gator coming, been&nbsp;
able to initiate the trap with any certainty,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.800
timed it correctly, nor guarantee that the&nbsp;
trap would actually injure it or hold it down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.600
Barry got extremely lucky here.
&nbsp;

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.520
The gator is still a threat, so he&nbsp;
starts bashing it’s head with a brick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.640
Alligator hides are super thick and dense,&nbsp;
especially on these 800 pound monsters, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:17.840
unsurprisingly this doesn’t work. 
Dave then tries shoveling it.
&nbsp;

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:24.160
In the movie he lodges it in the brain stem&nbsp;
of the gator, but I’m also skeptical of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:29.680
effectiveness of a shovel against an alligator.&nbsp;
Daves in a confined space, severely injured,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.320
and trying to swing a full length shovel at&nbsp;
a thrashing gator that’s underwater. I don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.160
think he’d be able to project enough force to&nbsp;
break through the hide and kill the gator.
&nbsp;

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.400
At this point, he didn’t really have any other&nbsp;
options other than to fight like hell with what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:47.120
he had. But that’s exactly the problem, they&nbsp;
didn’t need to let it get to this point. If&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.960
you go rock climbing without a harness&nbsp;
and get tired halfway up the cliff face,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.360
you’re fucked. The solution would have&nbsp;
been to rope up in the first place.
&nbsp;

00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:00.512
Haley makes it to the stairs, but one of the&nbsp;
gators is still there so she decides to one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.512 --> 00:18:05.560
up her dad’s shitty plan by diving through&nbsp;
the drainpipe to make it outside. The drain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:11.600
pipe which leads to the floodwaters outside where&nbsp;
Wayne’s partner and all the looters got massacred,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:17.760
and which the gators have been using to go in and&nbsp;
out of their house. Seems like a bad idea. Someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.720
needs to tell Haley that we are apex predators&nbsp;
because of our superior brains and intellect,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.760
not because some of us are decent swimmers.
Do they have a lagoon under their house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.880
where the hell is this and why does it exist? I’m&nbsp;
sure Haley isn’t putting 2 and 2 together here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.920
but the abundance of rotting corpses is&nbsp;
strongly indicative of an alligator nest. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:43.120
is like their food cabinet. Haley basically&nbsp;
pulled a Liam Neeson in the movie The Grey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:47.280
where he was trying to flee from the wolves, but&nbsp;
accidentally trekked right into their den. 
&nbsp;

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.880
Woops.
I know Haley and Dave don’t really have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.920
an option here, but I can’t imagine how bad the&nbsp;
infections will be from ingesting, swimming in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:05.600
and bathing their severe open wounds in this&nbsp;
disgusting water filled with rotting carcasses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:11.600
feces, mold, rats, and god knows what else. That&nbsp;
is, if they somehow survive long enough to get to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.160
a hospital, which doesn’t seem likely.
Mama gator doesn’t look too happy about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.840
you fucking around in her nest.
One of the corpses has a pistol on it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.840
so she snags it and pulls the trigger on&nbsp;
where she thinks the alligator is.
&nbsp;

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.680
The only thing louder than a bang when you need&nbsp;
it, is a click. She must have known her way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.760
around guns because most people would just freak&nbsp;
out and not be able to fix the problem. 
&nbsp;

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:41.200
She recognized that the gun had a failure&nbsp;
to fire when it presented an audible click.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.240
This means the slide was locked forward&nbsp;
and the firing pin dropped fully,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.520
indicating that the issue was either a bad round&nbsp;
or an empty chamber. The solution in this case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.720
is called a tap rack bang. Tap the base of&nbsp;
the magazine to ensure it is fully seated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:05.840
Rack the slide to get a fresh round in the&nbsp;
chamber, and the bang part should be obvious.
&nbsp;

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:14.480
The gator absolutely ate those 13&nbsp;
rounds. Shame it also swallowed the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.240
Glock too. Could’ve been useful later on. I’m&nbsp;
not sure if those gunshots would scare or attract&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.160
more gators. Best to keep moving.
Haley makes it to the drain pipe which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.280
will probably lead her into a&nbsp;
more dangerous situation. 
&nbsp;

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:30.080
Man, none of this would have happened if&nbsp;
the drain pipe had a proper covering on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.600
Why was it even broken like this.
Haley’s got lungs of steel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.240
but a couple air bubbles tickle the&nbsp;
gator and alerts it to her presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:44.800
Let me guess, she outswims it. Yep. 
I still wouldn’t feel safe at all being on land.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:49.440
Gators are still fast and deadly out of the&nbsp;
water, especially these fictional ones.
&nbsp;

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.040
Haley tries to wave down a helicopter while Dave&nbsp;
is sucking his last breath out of the floorboards.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.920
At the rate of water flow, the helicopter wouldn’t&nbsp;
be able to provide help in time, even if it could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.240
spot you. Getting your dad out before he&nbsp;
drowns should be the first priority..
&nbsp;

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.960
If the water gets any higher, he won’t be able to&nbsp;
let Haley know where he is under the floorboards.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.600
Sugar’s like, hey idiot grab the crowbar and break&nbsp;
the wood up, which i’ve been barking at you to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.840
this whole time.
…&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:27.520
It literally was that easy. A couple seconds of&nbsp;
hitting the planks and they shattered into pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.600
Fucking hell guys. All this devastation&nbsp;
could have easily been avoided.
&nbsp;

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.520
Dave already drowned, so hopefully Haley&nbsp;
knows CPR. Done correctly, CPR has a 90%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.840
resuscitation rate for people who recently&nbsp;
drowned and were removed from the water.
&nbsp;

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:47.040
Haley, isn’t doing them correctly. Her&nbsp;
compressions are far too fast and shallow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.880
and she should be doing 30 of them&nbsp;
between breaths. There’s not enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.880
pressure to circulate his blood,
His head is tilted back with his chin up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.600
and she is pinching his nose and providing&nbsp;
respiration, but she isn’t providing 2 one second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:04.800
breaths and watching for his chest rising. Her&nbsp;
weak breaths won’t be able to force enough oxygen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.680
into his lungs. Of course when she gives up&nbsp;
and beats on him like a drum he wakes up.
&nbsp;

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.560
Now that Dave’s conscious again,&nbsp;
you need to get to the roof,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.360
a gator could make it through&nbsp;
that hole and snatch you like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:20.640
Wayne. The flood waters are also rising rapidly&nbsp;
so escaping by vehicle won’t be an option.
&nbsp;

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.600
What.. Haley you just swam out of waist high&nbsp;
flood waters. You’ve witnessed looters and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:32.480
cops using boats. How is getting to the&nbsp;
car even an option in your head. The apple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:37.680
doesn’t fall too far from the tree.
This definitely is not a cat 5. If it was,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.840
they wouldn’t be able to stand outside due&nbsp;
to the wind speeds. They would literally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.240
take flight. Boats would not be an&nbsp;
option. Helicopters would definitely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.960
not be an option. Hell, you wouldn’t even need&nbsp;
to go outside to know it wasn’t an option. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:55.600
hurricane must have lost some steam at landfall,&nbsp;
or they are nearing the eye of the storm.
&nbsp;

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:10.080
Bad idea. One. the boat probably got damaged&nbsp;
in the attack. Two, they’d have to cross a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:15.360
huge distance to get to it. Three, wading through&nbsp;
floodwaters is dangerous for reasons I've already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:20.240
mentioned in this video. Four, you won’t be able&nbsp;
to control the boat against the currents. Lastly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:24.320
and obviously, because there’s a handful&nbsp;
of aggressive hungry alligators which have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.960
already slaughtered numerous people.
Sure, the levee’s may break and your home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.680
might get wiped out, but that’s a small chance&nbsp;
given the low category rating of this hurricane.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.840
The overwhelming priority should be getting&nbsp;
as far from the gators as possible.
&nbsp;

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:43.040
Even if you did want to use a boat, I'd try to&nbsp;
find the patrol boat and untangle it’s propeller,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:56.400
or just use the boat that’s in your garage.
I’m about to give up here. No splashing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.760
no hunting? You think you can just tiptoe 50&nbsp;
plus yards past a bunch of hunting alligators&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:07.680
in the debris filled floodwaters on a broken leg&nbsp;
that isn’t properly splinted, while holding a dog&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:12.560
when as you said, the levee is about to break&nbsp;
and an immense storm surge is imminent.
