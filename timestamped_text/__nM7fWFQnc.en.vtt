00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.360
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today, I am going&nbsp;
to explain the seventh and eighth episodes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.200
of the South Korean survival drama “Squid&nbsp;
Game” called “VIPS” and “Front Man”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.120
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.360
The last episode ended with Ilnam and Ali&nbsp;
dying while going against Gi-hun and Sangwoo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.160
respectively. Ali is put into a coffin by&nbsp;
the staff while the players who won the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.600
are taken back to the room. Deoksu walks into&nbsp;
the room first and is surprised to see Minyeo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.240
peacefully resting on her bed. She makes fun of&nbsp;
him and is proud that she didn’t have to play the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.360
game because she didn’t get a partner. The most&nbsp;
important aim of the game is for it to be fair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.480
Since the doctor’s death was the reason she&nbsp;
didn’t get a partner, Minyeo was saved. Now, only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.080
seventeen players are alive. In another room, the&nbsp;
overseer gets a call from the VIPs informing him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.080
that they are about to arrive. After the call, the&nbsp;
overseer gets his gun and asks Junho to come out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.420
Junho had kept the phone’s receiver the opposite&nbsp;
way as opposed to how the overseer used to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.960
it, giving away his presence. 
The overseer goes around the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.160
looking for the intruder but gets a call in&nbsp;
between. His staff has found a dead body on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.360
the north coast of the island. When he leaves,&nbsp;
we see that Junho is hiding behind the shelves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.600
Meanwhile, all the players are distressed because&nbsp;
of the last game. All of them lost someone they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.200
were close to. Sangwoo, however, tells Gi-hun not&nbsp;
to think about it too much because the old man was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.160
only a stranger who he had known for a few days.&nbsp;
One of the players had come to the facility with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.280
his wife. Both of them were together in the last&nbsp;
game, and his wife got killed because of him. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.560
loses control and asks everyone to stop this&nbsp;
madness by voting against the last two games.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.280
Sangwoo opposes and argues that the money is worth&nbsp;
the lives of everyone who died, and they cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.160
give it up now. He even tells the man that if he&nbsp;
feels so guilty, he should have died in his wife’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.080
place. Sangwoo has already shown his ruthless&nbsp;
side by tricking Ali into dying, and now Gi-hun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.280
starts to realize how greedy his friend is.
In the meantime, the overseer goes to see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.680
body of the person Junho had thrown into the&nbsp;
sea when he first came to the island. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.560
find Junho’s ID in the man’s pocket and assume&nbsp;
he is the police officer. But the Overseer’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.640
demeanor changes when he sees the ID. Right then,&nbsp;
he gets a call saying that the VIPs have arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.840
The overseer quickly goes to meet his boss, who&nbsp;
is the main man and the organizer of the games.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.280
He takes off his golden bedazzled animal mask and&nbsp;
asks the overseer to receive the VIPs because he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.000
doesn’t want to be the one to welcome them. The&nbsp;
VIPs turn out to be some rich foreigners who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.040
bet on the players’ life as people do with&nbsp;
horses. They are received by the overseer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.840
who apologizes on behalf of the organizer&nbsp;
and takes them to their exclusive lounge. 
&nbsp;

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.720
Meanwhile, in the room, no one sleeps at night&nbsp;
with the fear of being killed. The man whose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.000
wife died is filled with unbearable guilt. He&nbsp;
remembers Sangwoo telling him to die and ties the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.760
bedsheet around his neck. The man finally hangs&nbsp;
himself on the bunk bed. One of the VIPs sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.280
this in the surveillance footage and gets annoyed&nbsp;
because he had bet one million dollars on the man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.960
The others laugh it off, showing that&nbsp;
money is the least of their problems,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.960
and they do this for fun. Simultaneously, Junho&nbsp;
abducts a waiter appointed to serve the VIPs with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.320
drinks. He changes his clothes and disguises&nbsp;
himself as the waiter after killing him. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.680
also places his phone on his sleeves to record&nbsp;
everything he sees. Meanwhile, the players are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.560
woken up by an alarm and see a coffin being&nbsp;
brought inside. They finally see that the man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.600
has hung himself. Before they can comprehend what&nbsp;
happened, they are called for the fifth game. 
&nbsp;

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.120
The VIPs rest in the lavish lounge while watching&nbsp;
the players and deciding who they should bet on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.120
Junho enters the place, and a perverted VIP’s eyes&nbsp;
land on him. He calls Junho near and asks him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.160
stand nearby. This time, the players are brought&nbsp;
to the empty white room again, but this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.640
it has sixteen mannequins placed in front of&nbsp;
them. They are told to choose one randomly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.920
Everyone tries going for the middle ones because&nbsp;
being at the front or back is risky. Before Gi-hun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.040
can choose one, only the first and the last ones&nbsp;
are left. Gi-hun reasons that if he goes first,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.600
he might have more time left and a better chance&nbsp;
at winning. He is about to take the first one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.040
when another player asks him if he&nbsp;
can be the first one. Gi-hun accepts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.000
and takes the very last one instead. 
They are then brought to the place where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.320
they will be playing the game. It has a bridge&nbsp;
of glasses which they are supposed to cross. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.240
some of the glasses are tempered, so they&nbsp;
will break when the player steps on them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.480
making the person fall. The man who took the&nbsp;
first place has to go first and has a higher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.760
chance of winning. The person in the first accepts&nbsp;
his fate and moves forward but falls to his doom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.000
on the second step. Similarly, the second man&nbsp;
steps forward who jumps quickly on the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.520
few glasses but eventually falls. After some time,&nbsp;
it is the priest’s turn to move forward. He starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.000
praying to God instead of moving, angering the&nbsp;
people behind him. The person right behind him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.120
tries to push him off but instead falls off the&nbsp;
glass himself. The priest thanks God for saving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.080
him only to be pushed by the person behind him.&nbsp;
Sangwoo is nervous because they are taking a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.240
of time to cross, which might cause him, Saebyeok,&nbsp;
and Gi-hun to not get there in time. Eventually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.480
the person before Deoksu falls off, leaving him in&nbsp;
the front. He is too scared to move ahead himself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.600
so he tells his minion behind him to go forward.&nbsp;
The man, however, doesn’t agree, saying that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.400
this is a matter of life and death. 
Meanwhile, the VIP who is attracted to Junho&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.120
now asks him to sit beside him. He flirts&nbsp;
with Junho and asks him to take the mask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.640
off. Junho knows if he takes it off, this secret&nbsp;
will be revealed. But the VIP keeps on insisting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.600
With no way out, he asks the man to come to the&nbsp;
other room where he can take his mask off. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.960
man totally ignores the game and goes to the other&nbsp;
room with Junho. He then takes off his robe and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.800
stands naked in front of Junho, expecting sexual&nbsp;
favors from him. Junho, however, gets his gun out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.280
and threatens the man to take his mask off. He&nbsp;
turns out to be a wealthy middle-aged American&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:14.000
man. Junho takes his picture as evidence.
Back in the game, Minyeo pushes Deoksu's minion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.360
off the glass and takes his place. She and Deoksu&nbsp;
throw insults at each other before she agrees to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.920
go before him. She doesn’t want him to waste&nbsp;
her time because only three minutes are left.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.800
She asks him to move and steps on his glass, but&nbsp;
instead of moving forward, takes a tight hold of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.480
him. Minyeo reminds Deoksu of when she threatened&nbsp;
to kill him if he betrayed her. Deoksu tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.520
to get her off him but he cannot make a lot of&nbsp;
movement in the glass. At last, she deliberately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.280
falls off the bridge taking Deoksu with her. Now&nbsp;
only four of the players are left, Gi-hun at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.480
end, then Saebyeok, Sangwoo, and at the front&nbsp;
is an old man who claims to be a glassmaker with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.840
thirty years of experience. The man can tell the&nbsp;
difference between the glasses by looking at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.920
reflection. He easily passes the first few&nbsp;
glasses taking the group closer to victory. 
&nbsp;

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.680
But the VIPs realize he can tell the glasses&nbsp;
apart and turn the lights off. He is now at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.240
last glass but cannot tell which is the tempered&nbsp;
one. When he takes more time, Sangwoo takes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.040
matter into his hands and pushes the man to&nbsp;
the glass in front of him. The glass breaks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.640
and Sangwoo easily steps onto another one and&nbsp;
wins the round. Saebyeok and Gi-hun do the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.840
and pass at the last second. The remaining&nbsp;
glasses automatically shatter into pieces,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.760
injuring the winners as well. Sangwoo and Gi-hun&nbsp;
get minor cuts, but Saebyeok is gravely hurt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.720
Meanwhile, the overseer asks a staff member to&nbsp;
see what is going on with the VIP and the waiter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.840
but they find both of them missing. The staff&nbsp;
also find one oxygen tank missing, indicating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.280
that the intruder has escaped. The overseer gets&nbsp;
on a boat himself to go on a search for him. 
&nbsp;

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:55.120
Sangwoo, Saebyeok, and Gi-hun are the only three&nbsp;
left out of the four hundred fifty-six players who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.920
first arrived. They are taken back to the room&nbsp;
where Gi-hun belittles Sangwoo for killing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.480
man when they could have all made it through.&nbsp;
Sangwoo, in turn, tells him to be grateful that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.640
he was there to do the dirty work for him.&nbsp;
He calls Gi-hun an idiot who doesn’t know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.760
how real life works. Saebyeok, on the other&nbsp;
hand, stays on the bed holding her sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.000
As the two fight, the staff come into the room&nbsp;
and congratulate them for getting through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.240
five rounds and finally making it to the sixth.&nbsp;
They hand the players one box each and invite them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:30.080
somewhere special. Saebyeok goes to the washroom&nbsp;
and takes her clothes off to reveal a glass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.200
stabbed to her abdomen. She painfully takes&nbsp;
it out and bandages the wound with her shirt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.000
The box given by the staff has fancy clothes&nbsp;
inside which the players are supposed to wear. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.520
players are then brought to a triangular dining&nbsp;
table and given a lavish dinner. The guys devour&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.080
it completely except for Saebyeok, who barely&nbsp;
even touches the food because of her injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.880
After they are done, the staff take their&nbsp;
utensils away but leave them with a knife. 
&nbsp;

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.480
Meanwhile, Junho is on the run from the overseer&nbsp;
and ends up on another side of the island.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.960
His phone finally gets reception, and he&nbsp;
sends his superior the pictures he had taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.240
in the facility. But before he can run away,&nbsp;
the staff and the overseer catch up to him. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.680
he lies in between the staff and a cliff and&nbsp;
has no way out of the situation. The overseer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.240
asks him to drop his gun, but Junho stays put in&nbsp;
his place. The overseer doesn’t back up either;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.040
instead, he moves towards the policeman which&nbsp;
makes Junho shoot him on his shoulder. At that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:31.920
moment, the overseer finally takes his mask off.&nbsp;
Looking at his face, Junho freezes in shock. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:38.240
overseer is Junho’s brother Inho, the man Junho&nbsp;
was looking for all this time. Inho points his gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.520
at his little brother and reluctantly shoots him.&nbsp;
Junho eventually falls into the sea and dies. 
&nbsp;

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.800
Back in the facility, the trio comes back to&nbsp;
the room and stays in their respective corner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.480
as far away from each other as possible. Gi-hun&nbsp;
approaches Saebyeok and asks her if she is okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.680
Saebyeok points her knife at him at first but puts&nbsp;
it back when he says he isn’t there to hurt her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.000
Gi-hun asks her to work together with him in the&nbsp;
following round because he doesn’t trust Sangwoo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.840
anymore. Saebyeok, still in pain, asks him what he&nbsp;
will do if he wins the money. Gi-hun says he will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:15.280
pay off his debts, treat his mother and be a good&nbsp;
father to his daughter. Saebyeok tells him about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:21.200
her own brother. The two promise to take care of&nbsp;
each other's families if they win the money. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.000
Gi-hun sees Sangwoo falling asleep on his&nbsp;
bed. He moves towards him with his knife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.960
but Saebeyeok stops him, saying that they&nbsp;
should not go down to his level. Just then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.960
Gi-hoon notices Saebyeok’s injury. She is bleeding&nbsp;
profusely through her shirt. Gi-hun freaks out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.440
and starts yelling at the staff to come in and&nbsp;
save her. As he bangs on the door, some staff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:48.000
come in but they have a coffin with them. 
Gi-hun looks back at Saebyeok only to find Sangwoo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.360
near her with the knife. He had stabbed her to&nbsp;
death while Gi-hun was begging the staff to save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:59.680
her. Gi-hun loses control and shakes Saebyeok’s&nbsp;
limp body, trying to wake her. He attacks Sangwoo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.280
in a fit of rage but is stopped by the guard.&nbsp;
Eventually, they take Saebyeok’s body away and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.800
burn it in the furnace. The two final contestants&nbsp;
of the game are Gi-hun and Sangwoo.
