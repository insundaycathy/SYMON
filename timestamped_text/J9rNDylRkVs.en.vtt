Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.260
Today, I'm going to explain a fantasy, horror,
mystery film called "1408."

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.540
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.849
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.500
Author Mike Enslin arrives at The Weeping
Beech Inn, tired and drenched from the rain.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.900
The hotel owners eagerly tell him about their
inn's haunted history, hoping that he'd write

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.500
about it in his next book.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500
But Mike just wants to get into his room to
rest.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.740
Finally, in his room, Mike sets down an unlit
cigarette on the nightstand and takes the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.920
basket of mini liquor bottles, which he drinks
throughout the evening.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.180
He looks around the room, checking corners
for any sign of hauntings until he calls it

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.530
a night and sleeps.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.070
The next day, Mike records his thoughts of
the inn, commenting more about the hotel's

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.070
food rather than any haunted sightings.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.960
Nonetheless, he adds the inn to his next book.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.609
Very few people attend the book signing for
his new book.

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.229
While answering a reader's question, Mike
reveals he's never seen a real ghost, disappointing

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:49.319
a fan.

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:52.769
One fan asks him to sign his older book, The
Long Road Home, which he wrote before entering

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:54.019
the occult genre.

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.969
The woman asks him if the father and son relationship
in the book was based on real experiences,

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.390
but he denies it.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.770
While surfing on the beach, a plane overhead
distracts Mike, causing him to get pushed

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.690
into the sea by a massive wave.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.370
He wakes up on the shore, coughing up water.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.150
After retrieving his mail from the post office,
Mike finds most of them are brochures of supposedly

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.280
haunted hotels.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.660
Among the mail is a postcard for the Dolphin
Hotel with a warning on the back, saying "Don't

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.660
Enter 1408."

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.690
Curious, he calls the hotel to book room 1408,
but his booking is turned down even before

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.000
he gives a date.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.650
Even when Mike requests to book it on different
dates, the manager denies him and hangs up.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.690
This piques his interest further.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.550
Browsing through old newspaper reports citing
the hotel, he notes two recorded suicides

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.750
in the building.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.520
Mike calls his publisher, Sam, who helps him
find a legal loophole to force the hotel to

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.830
let him book the room.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.580
Sam, however, worries over Mike returning
to New York for the hotel.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.600
Mike assures him that he'll be in and out
of the city after the job.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.700
In New York, Mike arrives at the exquisite
Dolphin Hotel.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.730
The hotel manager, Gerald Olin, tries to bribe
him out of checking into room 1408.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.280
In Olin's office, he tempts Mike with an expensive
liquor, but he doesn't relent.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.550
Seeing his insistence, Olin warns him that
none of their guests lasted an hour in the

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.550
room.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.350
Mike scoffs at it, thinking that it's just
another ploy to oversell the room so he'd

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.520
write about it.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.500
But Olin is adamant about not wanting Mike
to stay in the room, as it would end with

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.000
him cleaning up the mess after.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.700
During his employment at the Dolphin Hotel,
there have been four deaths in room 1408,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.760
so Olin barred anyone from booking the room
again.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.590
Contrary to Mike's research, there have been
56 total deaths from the same room, including

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.140
heart attacks, strokes, and even drowning
in a bowl of soup.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.170
Olin presents Mike with a ledger of all the
deaths in the room's history, permitting him

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.060
to write about the room as long as Mike doesn't
stay there.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.340
Thinking that he's about to back off, Olin
offers Mike the expensive liquor bottle, which

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.920
Mike puts in his bag.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.190
But Mike decides he still wants to stay in
the room, angering Olin.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.120
He challenges Mike to read the ledger first
while telling the story of the first death

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.000
in the room in gruesome detail, creeping out
Mike.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.860
Olin offers Mike to stay in room 1404 instead,
assuring him that the room's layout is the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.660
same, but Mike insists on authenticity.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.310
Olin laughs, noting that his books are abandoned
on bargain shelves only to be read by people

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.860
who want cheap thrills.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.860
Unwilling to back down, Mike asserts his belief
that nothing supernatural exists; thus, he's

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.330
never been scared of haunted hotels.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.150
Olin finally yields and gives him the keys
to 1408.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.570
As they ride the elevator, Olin explains how
the owners haven't closed the room to pretend

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.690
nothing's wrong.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.030
The hotel kept the room tidy, having strict
protocols to prevent accidents during housekeeping.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.110
Still, years ago, a maid gouged her eyes out
with a pair of scissors after getting locked

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.330
in the bathroom.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.290
Upon reaching the 14th floor, Olin gives Mike
one last warning before closing the elevator

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.349
doors.

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.530
As he walks down the hallway, Mike shuffles
through the various crime scene photos on

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.570
the ledger.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.470
The elevator dings loudly, breaking him from
his thoughts.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.220
Mike had walked on the floor at a full circle.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.050
He puts the ledger away and makes his way
to the room, passing by a discarded food tray

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.130
and finding a woman entering a room while
pulling in a stroller.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.160
Mike finally faces room 1408, unlocking the
door and carefully opening it.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.080
He checks from side to side before stepping
into the threshold.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.320
He switches the light on, finding a normal-looking
room inside.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.610
He slams the door shut before settling in.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.170
He places his unlit cigarette on the ashtray,
a reminder of successfully quitting the habit.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.780
Mike expresses his disappointment on the mundaneness
of the room to his tape recorder.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.420
He takes the bible from the nightstand, then
tosses it aside, uninterested.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.220
Next, he checks the minibar then notices the
thermostat is stuck at eighty degrees Fahrenheit.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.490
Mike continues to describe the room's dull
interior and paintings on the tape.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.170
Later, he opens a window and describes the
view from the room, but bangs his head when

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.340
the radio starts playing "We've Only Just
Begun" by The Carpenters.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.169
Two chocolate candies sit on the pillow, which
wasnâ€™t there earlier.

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.699
Thinking it's just a trick, he checks the
closet, tub, and cabinet, expecting someone

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.560
else in the room but finds no one.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.650
A movement from the vent catches his attention.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.360
Sweating, he calls the front desk to report
the broken thermostat, surprised when the

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.840
receptionist agrees to send a repairman.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.560
Unnerved, Mike sits on a chair as he reminisces
on the many hotel rooms he's stayed in for

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.560
a book.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.670
Determined to get a story, Mike reminds himself
not to get rattled.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.340
Proceeding with his investigation, he uses
a U.V. lamp to check the many traces of blood

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.340
in the room.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.160
Then, Mike finds the painting above the fireplace
skewed.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.220
He realigns the painting, hearing ocean waves
in his mind.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.320
The sudden knock on the door makes him jump.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.530
Mike struggles to open the door for the repairman,
but when it finally opens, the repairman refuses

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.900
to set foot inside.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.160
Instead, he tells him how to fix the thermostat
on his own.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.840
Mike successfully fixes the device but finds
the repairman has left.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.020
With the room at a comfortable temperature,
Mike pours himself a drink and sits on the

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.020
bed.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.410
The radio at the bedside blares the same song,
making him drop his drink.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.760
Suddenly, the clock on the radio counts down
from sixty minutes.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.200
Mike remembers Olin's warning that no one
lasted in the room for more than an hour.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.919
A ringing sounds in his ear, causing his head
to ache.

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.940
He checks the busy street outside the window,
yet he can't hear anything but the ringing.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.410
When he looks back in the room, the window
shuts, trapping his fingers.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.550
Mike gets his hand off the window and heads
to the bathroom to check his wound.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.120
He washes his hand, but the water suddenly
turns hot, scorching him.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.460
He wraps his wounded hand with a handkerchief
then jumps when the radio blares The Carpenters

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.600
song again.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.100
Even after the radio is unplugged, it continues
to countdown.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.510
Panicked from the events, he rushes to the
ringing phone from the living room.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.979
Mike demands to be taken to the hospital,
but the receptionist transfers him to Olin

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:57.979
instead.

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.290
While waiting to speak to Olin, Mike looks
around as if expecting another threat.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.120
The line drops suddenly, so he makes his way
out the door.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.630
But the key breaks in the lock, with the other
end disappearing to the other side.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.919
Mike tries to force the door open, but the
doorknob breaks as well.

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.210
Through the peephole, he finds green eyes
staring back at him.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.490
Finding no hope at the door, Mike heads to
the window and yells for help.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.560
He calls a man's attention from the building
across the street, but the man only copies

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.840
his movements.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.100
Mike grabs a lamp to illuminate the man, revealing
that it's also him wearing black clothes.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.740
Behind the other Mike, a woman attacks him
with a hammer.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.370
Mike turns, finding the same woman lunging
at him.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.790
He falls into a corner, but suddenly, the
woman disappears.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.090
Mike checks back to the window, and the other
Mike is gone.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.140
He picks up the lamp and throws it, hoping
that someone will notice it.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.120
Instead, the lamp sizzles and disappears.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.650
Frustrated, he hangs his head low, believing
he's gone crazy.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.410
A girl's voice calls him inside the room.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.280
Mike fumbles around, collapsing into a corner,
waiting for whatever comes next.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.390
Aggravated, he scolds himself for losing focus
and notes the powers of suggestion on his

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.390
recorder.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.850
Then, he spots what looks like a spycam in
the vent.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.039
Mike shouts at the vent, accusing that Olin
spiked his liquor, causing hallucinations.

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:09.600
The television turns on, showing a family
video of himself, his estranged wife, Lily,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.210
and their daughter, Katie.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.949
The happy memory lures Mike closer, bringing
him to tears as he thinks of the family he

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:16.949
lost.

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:19.240
He touches the T.V. mournfully before it shuts
off.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.190
Mike returns to the liquor bottle, thinking
if it can make him hallucinate his daughter

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.190
again.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.880
Suddenly, a man appears in the middle of the
room, climbing over the window before jumping

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.880
off.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.919
Then, a woman in a red and green dress in
the living room does the same.

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:34.340
Next, he hears the sound of a baby crying
from the next room.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.290
He bangs on the wall, begging the mother he
saw earlier for help.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.250
The baby wails louder until the sound echoes
in his head, bringing him to his knees.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.990
Mike picks up a chair and throws it against
the wall, making the wailing stop.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.789
Mike gets up, seeing the light pouring from
the bathroom.

00:07:47.789 --> 00:07:50.890
From inside, a man in a wheelchair laments
over his life.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.430
Mike recognizes his father, kneeling before
him.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.889
His father warns him that he will end up just
like him.

00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:59.009
Mike snaps out of the illusion, trying to
make sense of the situation.

00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:02.220
A whirring sound distracts him, leading him
to the broken wall with blood pouring from

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.340
the cracks.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.500
Mike opens a window and checks the street
below, wondering if he can't die in a nightmare.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.220
Deciding on a more logical approach, he checks
the hotel's map behind the front door, plotting

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.520
his escape through the window.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.210
Gathering his courage, he climbs onto the
ledge and records a message on his tape first

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.870
that if he slips and falls, it was an accident
and not the room's influence.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.970
Inch by inch, Mike makes his way toward the
next room's window.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.539
He counts his steps to calm himself, ignoring
the sounds of traffic below.

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:31.110
But when he looks forward, there are no other
windows on the building aside from room 1408's.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.279
After nearly slipping on the ledge, he struggles
back to the window where the woman in red

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:35.969
and green surprises him.

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:40.130
Mike falls but grabs ahold of the ledge, watching
the woman throw herself out of the building.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.870
Mike climbs back inside the room, just before
the window closes on its own.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:48.050
Exhausted, Mike gets up and notices the hotel
map changed on the front door.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.820
Instead of the hotel floor's layout, he only
sees room 1408 with the rest of the floor

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:52.920
blacked out.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.920
He looks into the peephole and sees a brick
wall outside his door.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.779
An eerie blue glow fills the room.

00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:01.010
The windows in the living room are bricked
up while the window from the bedroom no longer

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.100
exists.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.980
Driven insane, Mike listens to his tape recording
in hopes of bringing back some sense.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.520
When he hears himself say that the bedroom
has no window, he yelps.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.860
The sound of footsteps and an announcement
diverts his attention to the living room,

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.740
where he finds himself with his wife Lily
in the doctor's office.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.660
The couple struggles to accept Katie's cancer
diagnosis.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.010
When he calls Katie, the lights suddenly go
out.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.339
The room is now covered in a red hue.

00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:27.160
Katie's voice begs him for help while Mike
checks around, reaching for the light switch.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.460
With the lights on, he spots the armed woman
behind him from the mirror.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.890
He turns around, but she's not there.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:37.380
In the living room, the thermostat is broken
again, this time stuck at 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.170
He takes his coat from his bag and checks
his laptop.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:44.140
Mike contacts Lily via a video call, but his
face is distorted on the screen.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.760
When Lily hears that he's in the Dolphin hotel,
she gets angry at him for not contacting her

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.950
despite being in the city, not noticing the
urgency in his tone.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.630
Suddenly, the fire sprinklers spray water,
destroying his laptop.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.430
The water causes all the electronics inside
to spark until Mike breaks it.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.519
Mike starts undoing the screws on the vent
where he climbs to escape.

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:04.500
Hearing the baby's cries, he follows it and
begs the mother for help.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.910
The woman looks up, staring coldly at him.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:07.910
It's Lily.

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.940
Frightened, Mike crawls forward and watches
another memory where his father begs Mike

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.290
to stay with his wife after Katie's death.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.730
After his other self leaves, his father looks
straight at him, making him jump inside the

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:17.730
vent.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.830
The vent stretches further, trapping Mike
in a loop until he finds the dead body of

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.820
one of the hotel room's victims.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.019
The body wakes up and chases after him.

00:10:25.019 --> 00:10:28.540
When Mike loses sight of it, he crawls as
quietly as he can, checking every corner before

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.540
moving.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.760
The corpse finds him and grabs him by the
leg.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.920
He kicks its skull to escape and falls back
into the room.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.100
Tired and confused, Mike opens the minibar
for a drink but instead finds a miniature

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.010
version of Olin's office with the hotel manager
mocking him.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.360
Angered, Mike attacks the fridge, which now
returns to normal.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.300
Shaking in fury and fright, Mike grabs the
liquor and the bible in hopes of being saved.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.750
But when he flips through the pages, it's
blank.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.890
On the other side, he sees a vision of him
and Lily joining Katie in her hospital bed.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.790
Lily encourages Katie about the afterlife,
but Mike is hesitant to believe in it.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.980
After Katie died, Mike blames Lily for distracting
Katie with stories about heaven.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.950
The fax machine rings in the room.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.339
Mike opens it and sees a dress come out of
the machine.

00:11:07.339 --> 00:11:09.240
The room's temperature drops to below zero.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.890
He burns the crime scene photos in the middle
of the living room to warm up.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.899
As he's shivering by the fire, his laptop
switches on.

00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:19.160
Lily is still on the call, confirming that
the cops are in the hotel.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.220
But the police are already in 1408, and it's
empty.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.610
Feeling hopeless, he checks the clock in the
bedroom.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.730
He has less than fifteen minutes left.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:31.120
Lily promises to see him at the hotel, but
Mike refuses, not wanting to put her in danger.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.360
Suddenly, his voice sounds from the laptop.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.040
Another Mike appears on the screen, telling
Lily to hurry up and meet him in the room.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.680
Mike tries to stop Lily, but she only sees
the other Mike, who winks at the camera once

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.420
Lily ends the call.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.060
The room erupts in chaos.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.540
The ceiling and floor explode, bursting the
pipes.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.890
The paintings in the room change into horrible
violent scenes with voices crying for help.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.149
Mike reaches for the ship painting, but a
wave of water pours in, throwing him against

00:11:54.149 --> 00:11:55.230
the wall.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.950
Water fills up the room, forcing Mike to sink
below.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.410
Fighting for his life, he swims back to the
surface, finding himself back on the beach

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.720
where he nearly drowned while surfing.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.600
Mike wakes up in the hospital, seeing Lily
by his side.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.019
Being his next of kin, Lily was called in
after he was rushed to the hospital for nearly

00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:11.050
drowning in the beach.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:15.130
Mike, dazed and in disbelief, recounts the
events in the Dolphin hotel.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.650
Lily claims that there is no such hotel in
New York.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.310
The days continue where he and Lily reconcile.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.980
During a dinner date, Mike spots the woman
who jumped off from 1408 in the restaurant.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.529
He snaps out of the vision, realizing that
he was only hallucinating.

00:12:27.529 --> 00:12:30.779
Believing that the room was just a nightmare,
he shares the story with Lily, who suggests

00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:32.350
he writes about it.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.769
Days later, Mike collects his mail from the
post office and finds the same mail he received

00:12:35.769 --> 00:12:37.950
the day he discovered the Dolphin hotel.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.970
But the postcard for the hotel is missing.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.890
Confused, he checks the newspaper clippings
where he learned more about the hotel's history,

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.010
but they've changed.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.330
To find some closure, he writes a book about
room 1408.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.360
Once he's done, he prepares his manuscript
and visits his father from the elderly home.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.519
But his father's condition is worse, staring
blankly into space and not even noticing him.

00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:59.950
Guilty over how he treated his father, Mike
apologizes.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:03.880
Mike rushes to the post office to send the
manuscript, but the clerk says they're closed.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.250
When the clerk turns around, he recognizes
the man from the hotel.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:11.840
The other workers break down the post office,
revealing the walls and ceiling of room 1408.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.589
The world spins before Mike, his life slipping
away as he realizes that he's still in the

00:13:15.589 --> 00:13:17.029
ruins of the room.

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:19.840
Back in the room, the minifridge opens behind
him.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.180
Instead of drinks, however, he finds Katie's
coffin burning inside.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.180
Mike's mind fractures, unable to grasp how
he's back.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.540
Behind him, a white door appears.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.550
Tired of being played at, Mike knocks on the
door, ready to face whatever's on the other

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.339
side, but it disappears.

00:13:33.339 --> 00:13:36.010
Katie appears in the room, asking him for
help.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.120
Despite knowing that it's not real, Mike falls
to his knees and embraces her.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.279
As he promises not to let her go, Katie's
body goes limp.

00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:45.990
The radio blares the song again, and Katie's
body crumbles in Mike's arms.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.450
Mike desperately tries to put her back together,
but it's no use.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.160
Enraged, Mike breaks everything he could get
his hands on, throwing furniture all over

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.899
the room until he collapses.

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:58.540
The song continues to play, with less than
ten seconds left on the clock.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.980
Mike turns away as the clock turns to zero.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.899
He wakes up, and the room is back to its pristine
condition.

00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:06.430
The clock reverts to sixty minutes on the
nightstand.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.700
The phone rings and a receptionist tells him
the hour will repeat until he takes their

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.399
express checkout system.

00:14:11.399 --> 00:14:13.700
In the middle of the bedroom hangs a noose
for him.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.310
The events begin to make sense: all the previous
victims were driven to insanity and suicide

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.029
like what the room is doing to him.

00:14:19.029 --> 00:14:22.130
The room continues to tempt him with his only
way out of the room.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:23.790
But Mike refuses to give in.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.130
He tells the receptionist that he's not checking
out.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.350
The receptionist informs him that Lily is
in the hotel and will arrive at the room in

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.920
five minutes.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.550
Mike denies playing the room's games anymore.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:36.440
Realizing that he's led a selfish life, Mike
refuses to die as so.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.020
He turns the liquor bottle into a molotov
cocktail and sets the bedroom ablaze, taking

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.680
the room down with him.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.910
Finding some relief, Mike lights his cigarette
and relaxes on the armchair.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:48.230
Outside, the hotel guests evacuate as the
fire alarm blares.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.470
Stuck in traffic, Lily rushes to the hotel
on foot.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.000
In the room, Mike listens to the hotel's futile
attempt to save itself.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.660
No longer fearing the evil inside, Mike makes
a recording, saying his final thoughts about

00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.770
the hotel.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:03.000
He throws the ashtray out the window, causing
the room to explode.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.100
He lies on the floor, laughing as the room
is defeated.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.779
Days later, Lily and Sam attend Mike's funeral.

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:11.570
Lily takes comfort that he and Katie are finally
together.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.339
After the funeral, Olin hands Lily a box of
Mike's belongings from the hotel.

00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:18.589
But Lily refuses, not wanting to remember
Mike by his writing.

00:15:18.589 --> 00:15:21.500
Olin assures her, however, that Mike did not
die in vain.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.360
After what he did to the room, it won't be
reopened again.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.290
When Lily and Sam leave, Olin heads back to
his car and opens the box, listening to Mike's

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.290
recording.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.699
While listening to Mike's reunion with Katie's
ghost, Olin hears another girl behind the

00:15:32.699 --> 00:15:33.699
car.

00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:35.760
He checks the rearview mirror and sees Mike's
burnt body.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.420
It disappears instantly, allowing Olin to
watch the little girl outside reunite with

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.810
her father.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.630
Back in the hotel, Mike's ghost smokes in
the ruined room.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:54.029
Katie calls him inside, and he goes to her,
disappearing as he walks.
