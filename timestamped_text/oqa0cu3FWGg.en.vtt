00:00:06.543 --> 00:00:07.951
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:12.175
today I'll show you a psychological thriller film: "The Great Hypnotist" 

00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:14.927
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:19.983
Doctor Bald is a psychiatrist who is good at using hypnosis to cure his patients

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:25.231
one day, Doctor Bald's tutor introduces to him a tricky patient, the girl named Patient Hairy

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.047
who has seen many doctors domestically and abroad 

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:30.479
but none of them can cure her mental illness

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:32.847
Doctor Bald is curious about this case

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:35.855
his tutor just reminds him that she can see ghosts

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:38.351
Doctor Bald doesn't buy that smelly shit

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:41.807
he thinks this patient must have some kind of psychological problem

00:00:42.127 --> 00:00:45.391
though feeling ridiculous, he still agrees to take this case

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:48.207
Doctor Bald works till midnight that day

00:00:48.463 --> 00:00:51.407
when his assistant hands in the medical record of Patient Hairy

00:00:51.535 --> 00:00:54.287
the patient he has promised his tutor to take care of 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.039
Doctor Bald feels tired after a day's work

00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:59.983
he tells his assistant to put off the appointment to tomorrow

00:01:00.303 --> 00:01:02.031
however, the assistant tells him 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.679
that Patient Hairy has been waiting for a long time outside the office

00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:08.687
he is kind-hearted and agrees to meet her at once

00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:11.631
to cheer himself up, he takes a cup of coffee

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.087
but he doesn't see anyone come in after waiting for a while

00:01:15.343 --> 00:01:20.207
Doctor Bald walks out to the living room, only to find Patient Hairy staring at a clock

00:01:20.463 --> 00:01:23.727
she says that the clock runs slow and sets it ahead with her fingers

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:27.887
Doctor Bald shows her to the office and starts the hypnosis session

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.983
from the following conversation, Doctor Bald learns that she's an orphan 

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.031
he pays attention to her life story

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.487
and feels that this may be a good opening to look into her deep mind

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:38.959
as the therapy begins

00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:42.991
Patient Hairy slowly tells the story of her first encounter with a ghost

00:01:43.247 --> 00:01:48.047
in the beginning, she had been puzzled by the sound of marbles before getting to bed

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:50.400
the sound had troubled her for some time

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.783
she was wakened up by the sound that night

00:01:53.103 --> 00:01:55.343
as it was getting closer and more cracking

00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:59.759
she suddenly realized that the sound came from the ground instead of the ceiling

00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:02.831
so she bent down to check if there was anything under the bed

00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:05.583
as expected, a marble rolled out from it

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:09.551
Patient Hairy turned on her flashlight but couldn't find anything there

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:13.967
to make sure it wasn't her illusion, she turned on the flashlight to check again

00:02:14.287 --> 00:02:18.959
this time, however, she was shocked by the face of an old lady living downstairs

00:02:19.343 --> 00:02:21.839
Patient Hairy took it as mischief from her neighbor

00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:23.951
so she stepped down to negotiate with them

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:28.431
much to her shock, the old lady she just saw passed away this morning

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.375
with a funeral portrait right in the middle of the living room

00:02:31.631 --> 00:02:33.807
Patient Hairy couldn't believe her eyes

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:38.095
she also learned from the family that they couldn't find the old lady's ID card anywhere

00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:40.527
as they had to use it to arrange the funeral

00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:43.983
suddenly she noticed that something was wrong with the portrait

00:02:44.175 --> 00:02:47.183
Patient Hairy followed the direction the old lady's eyes looked

00:02:47.247 --> 00:02:51.023
and told the family that the ID card was in a secret compartment of the ceiling

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.287
sure enough, they found her ID card right there

00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:58.959
hearing the story, Doctor Bald can't help stopping her smelly shit

00:02:59.343 --> 00:03:01.135
he takes it as Patient Hairy's lie

00:03:01.327 --> 00:03:04.975
for he believes that a person can't hide between the layers of two floors

00:03:05.295 --> 00:03:08.943
Patient Hairy retorts that what she saw is a ghost instead of human

00:03:09.391 --> 00:03:11.823
Doctor Bald doesn't want to argue with her anymore

00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:14.191
he intends to write down her diagnosis

00:03:14.511 --> 00:03:17.583
but Patient Hairy speaks out what he's going to write ahead of him

00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:20.335
which draws Doctor Bald's interest immediately

00:03:20.527 --> 00:03:23.279
it turns out that this woman is also good at psychology

00:03:23.727 --> 00:03:27.567
Doctor Bald decides to continue and sees what tricks she's gonna play

00:03:27.887 --> 00:03:31.279
then Patient Hairy tells him her second time to see a ghost

00:03:31.663 --> 00:03:34.095
one night, Patient Hairy took a bus home

00:03:34.223 --> 00:03:36.783
where there was no other passenger but herself 

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:39.791
unexpectedly, the bus broke down halfway

00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:43.503
Patient Hairy stepped ahead to ask the driver what was going on

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:47.087
the driver seemed flustered and begged her not to get off the bus

00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:50.799
Patient Hairy was scared by him and ran out of the bus

00:03:50.991 --> 00:03:53.871
then she came across a little girl in red on the street

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:57.007
the girl was drawing a lying human figure on the ground 

00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:58.863
no matter what Patient Hairy asked

00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:03.471
the girl said nothing but cried, and kept looking at the bus Patient Hairy just took

00:04:03.855 --> 00:04:05.711
before Patient Hairy could do anything

00:04:05.967 --> 00:04:09.039
the girl suddenly appeared on the bus leaving with the driver

00:04:09.423 --> 00:04:13.263
however, she continuously pointed at the number plates to Patient Hairy

00:04:13.647 --> 00:04:16.143
seemingly to remind her to find out the bus

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.919
at this time, Patient Hairy noticed a poster at the roadside

00:04:20.047 --> 00:04:23.375
which said that a little girl died in a car accident before long

00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:26.895
and her family was offering a reward to look for clues of the driver

00:04:27.215 --> 00:04:29.583
the girl in the poster was just the one she met

00:04:29.775 --> 00:04:33.167
Patient Hairy was surprised that she just saw another ghost

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:35.791
but she still told the police the plate number of the bus

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:40.527
it soon proved by the police that the driver was responsible for the girl's death

00:04:40.975 --> 00:04:44.815
still, Doctor Bald can't believe her and finds her shit smells worse

00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:49.615
so as to convince him, Patient Hairy even shows him a newspaper reporting the case

00:04:49.935 --> 00:04:53.839
however, Doctor Bald thinks that she cooks up the story after reading the news

00:04:54.095 --> 00:04:57.871
he's tired of the woman's lies and starts to talk about her background

00:04:58.255 --> 00:05:01.903
he soon learns that Patient Hairy's parents abandoned her because of heavy debt

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:04.399
and after that, they committed suicide

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:09.199
she can never forget the red flowers all over the sky on the day she was sent to an orphanage

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:13.423
Doctor Bald realizes that the red flower may be the key to work it out

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:16.431
he quietly goes into the restroom to call a friend 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:18.607
asking about the species of the flower

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:22.575
the answer turns out to be Kapok, which only grows in southern areas

00:05:22.767 --> 00:05:27.567
but Patient Hairy was sent to an orphanage in the north, proving that her stories are made up

00:05:27.887 --> 00:05:29.807
believing that he finds a breakthrough

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:35.183
Doctor Bald decides to continue hypnotizing her with a pocket watch dangling before her

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:38.959
soon Patient Hairy finds herself in a ruin with a door in front of her

00:05:39.087 --> 00:05:42.159
actually, it's a common practice of hypnotherapy

00:05:42.543 --> 00:05:46.447
what hides behind the door is the memory buried in the bottom of the patient's heart

00:05:46.703 --> 00:05:50.287
Patient Hairy opens the door, but her finger seems to be pricked 

00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:52.975
causing a drop of blood to seep out of the skin

00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:55.279
Doctor Bald asks her what she has seen

00:05:55.535 --> 00:05:59.119
she replies that there's nothing around except for a pool of water

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:02.063
while Doctor Bald is going to continue his questions 

00:06:02.191 --> 00:06:06.927
Patient Hairy suddenly becomes frightened and keeps telling him the number "502"

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:09.487
she begs him to stop treatment in despair

00:06:09.615 --> 00:06:12.815
just as Doctor Bald is about to pull her back to reality

00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:16.335
unexpectedly, she says that there's a bridge above the pool

00:06:16.591 --> 00:06:19.087
Doctor Bald is confused a lot by her words

00:06:19.343 --> 00:06:24.335
the next moment however, Doctor Bald finds himself already stuck in Patient Hairy's dream

00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:28.303
she suddenly rushes crazy towards him and pushes him into the water

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:30.991
Doctor Bald struggles to get out of the pool

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:34.703
and when he comes to his sense again, he falls right into his chair

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:38.863
in anger, Doctor Bald has had enough of her lies and tricks

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:44.175
at this moment, the friend he just called sends him materials of Patient Hairy's background

00:06:44.495 --> 00:06:48.847
Doctor Bald figures out that after being abandoned by her birth parents living in the south

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:54.287
Patient Hairy was adopted but later abandoned again by her foster parents living in the north

00:06:54.415 --> 00:06:57.167
for her foster mother was pregnant with her own child

00:06:57.359 --> 00:07:01.711
those two tragedies cause Patient Hairy to be severely traumatized during her childhood

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:05.743
when she should have enjoyed playing marble balls, rather than sufferings

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:10.543
this explains that she tries to cover her darkest memories by making up stories

00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:16.111
it seems everything has fallen into place, but Patient Hairy can't accept what he explained

00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:19.119
Doctor Bald has to ask directly about her fiance

00:07:19.247 --> 00:07:22.191
because she always touches her middle finger since she comes in

00:07:22.255 --> 00:07:25.007
showing that she used to wear a ring on that finger

00:07:25.263 --> 00:07:28.143
Patient Hairy looks flurried hearing his question

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:32.495
she wants to leave the office but falls into Doctor Bald's hypnosis again 

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:37.231
this time, she clearly sees her fiance, who grows up with her in the orphanage 

00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:41.263
however, he dies in a car accident right before the wedding ceremony

00:07:41.455 --> 00:07:43.887
she also sees herself at her lover's funeral

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:47.151
but someone suddenly rushes in and drags her away

00:07:47.471 --> 00:07:49.007
having recalled her of the memories

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:52.783
Doctor Bald finally understands the cause of Patient Hairy's sufferings

00:07:52.975 --> 00:07:55.343
and tries to comfort her to let go of the past

00:07:55.663 --> 00:07:58.351
however, Patient Hairy interrupts his bullshit

00:07:58.415 --> 00:08:01.743
declaring that she has seen a man and a woman standing behind him 

00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:04.239
soaking wet and following him all the time

00:08:04.559 --> 00:08:06.671
while Doctor Bald is going to lose his temper

00:08:06.735 --> 00:08:11.407
he suddenly falls into hypnosis when he hears Patient Hairy's call, "captain"

00:08:11.727 --> 00:08:15.823
Doctor Bald finally gets to face the truth that he has been trying to forget

00:08:15.951 --> 00:08:19.599
"captain" turns out to be Doctor Bald's nickname given by his dead wife

00:08:19.727 --> 00:08:24.847
one night, he was drinking with his wife and best friend in a bar named "502"

00:08:25.103 --> 00:08:29.263
on the way home, he was too drunk and accidentally crashed the car into a river

00:08:29.391 --> 00:08:32.591
resulting in his wife and best friend's death in the accident

00:08:32.847 --> 00:08:35.663
and Doctor Bald was the only one who survived

00:08:36.047 --> 00:08:40.079
after waking up in the hospital, he blamed himself deeply for their death 

00:08:40.335 --> 00:08:45.391
unwilling to face reality, he later hypnotized himself to forget the whole accident

00:08:45.647 --> 00:08:50.703
Patient Hairy tells him the two people standing behind soaking-wet are his wife and best friend

00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:53.583
they love him as always and have forgiven him

00:08:53.711 --> 00:08:58.703
Doctor Bald crashes on the floor and comes back to reality as his assistant runs in

00:08:58.895 --> 00:09:03.631
he finally recognizes Patient Hairy, who is actually his classmate of the same tutor

00:09:03.887 --> 00:09:07.663
it's revealed that Doctor Bald was going to suicide after the accident

00:09:07.855 --> 00:09:10.735
it's their tutor who makes such a plan to cure his pain

00:09:10.927 --> 00:09:15.919
Doctor Bald should be called the patient bald while Patient Hairy is actually his doctor hairy

00:09:16.303 --> 00:09:20.925
the therapy began as the assistant handed in Patient Hairy's medical record

00:09:21.441 --> 00:09:24.513
and the coffee Doctor Bald had was drugged to distract him

00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:28.801
he was hypnotized right at the time when Patient Hairy set the clock 

00:09:29.057 --> 00:09:31.937
while Patient Hairy was pretending to be treated by him

00:09:32.065 --> 00:09:35.585
she deliberately pricked her finger so as not to lose her senses

00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:40.705
however, Doctor Bald soon noticed that something was wrong according to his rich experiences

00:09:40.897 --> 00:09:45.121
right when he hypnotized Patient Hairy and wanna dig deep about her fiance

00:09:45.249 --> 00:09:48.385
he triggered the hidden protection mechanism set by their tutor

00:09:48.577 --> 00:09:53.057
which as a result, enables Patient Hairy to be dragged out of his hypnosis

00:09:53.697 --> 00:09:58.305
so far, Doctor Bald has been successfully cured by Patient Hairy's hypnotherapy

00:09:58.497 --> 00:10:01.505
everyone is happy for him except for Patient Hairy

00:10:01.761 --> 00:10:06.113
due to the hypnosis, she also pulls her memory back to the day of the car accident

00:10:06.369 --> 00:10:08.929
there were actually four people drinking in the bar

00:10:09.057 --> 00:10:11.937
Patient Hairy was also there, but she left early

00:10:12.129 --> 00:10:15.777
Doctor Bald's best friend happens to be exactly her fiance

00:10:15.969 --> 00:10:20.065
she waited anxiously for her lover to come home but only the bad news came

00:10:20.385 --> 00:10:22.369
she also suffers a lot from the accident

00:10:22.689 --> 00:10:24.993
the tutor tries to comfort her to let it go

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:28.321
as she is the only one who's still trapped in the past

00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:31.905
this's Daniel CC movie channel, peace out
