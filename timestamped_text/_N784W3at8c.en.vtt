00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.500
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.839
Today, I'm going to explain a drama, sci-fi
film called "A.I.

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:06.390
Artificial Intelligence."

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.680
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.820
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.540
In the 22nd century, global warming causes
a staggering rise in sea levels, wiping out

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.320
coastal cities worldwide.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.780
Millions are displaced, and the erratic climate
causes famine worldwide.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.170
The few surviving and prospering governments
implement licensing pregnancy to minimize

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.400
overpopulation.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.160
To compensate for the world's need for manpower,
robots or mecha are created.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.200
As mechas do not require as many resources
to survive as humans do, they become necessary

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.529
in society.

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.210
Artificial intelligence inventor Professor
Allen Hobby demonstrates the progress of a

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.570
mecha's intelligence; how it's programmed
to react to damage or pain and to remember

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.530
to avoid the cause of damage, much like a
human would.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.900
But this does not mimic a human's emotion,
which brings Professor Hobby to the next phase

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.680
of his project: a robot child programmed to
love its parents, among other complex emotions.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.719
The mecha child will be marketed to couples
who yearn for a child but cannot obtain the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.079
license to reproduce.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:03.820
Twenty months after the presentation, married
couple Henry and Monica Swinton visit their

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.810
son, Martin, in the hospital.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.369
After contracting a rare disease, Martin was
placed under suspended animation until a cure

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.630
is found.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.360
Martin's doctor, Dr. Fraiser, worries for
Monica, who still hopes that Martin will recover.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.580
He advises Henry to help Monica cope with
her grief, as she's currently suppressing

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.400
it under false hope.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.680
Hoping that this will help Monica move on,
Henry applies to Cybertronics' beta-testing

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.530
and gets hand-picked by Professor Hobby to
test their latest invention, David.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.130
David is a prototype Mecha child programmed
to experience love.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.430
Horrified and offended, Monica argues to Henry,
thinking that he's trying to replace Martin

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.580
with a mecha.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.960
But upon realizing that she needs to fill
a hole in her heart, Monica entertains the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.050
idea of being able to take care of a child
again, even if it's a mecha.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.220
Getting her on board with the idea, Henry
explains how the imprinting protocol works.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.930
Once they decide to keep David, they can choose
to activate his imprinting, making David loyal

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.050
to them, akin to loving a parent.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.700
The imprinting is irreversible; therefore,
if the couple decides to return David, he

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.920
will be scrapped.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.310
He presses the importance that they shouldn't
imprint until they are sure.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.930
That evening, Monica and Henry allow David
into Martin's old room.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.109
David is eager to please his parents, but
remembering that he's not real makes Monica

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.099
uncomfortable, shutting the door on him when
he asks to be dressed by her.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.620
In the morning, David watches Monica prepare
breakfast curiously.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.689
Monica tries to ignore him for the rest of
the day, but David continues to watch her

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.340
around the house.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.760
Frustrated, Monica puts him away in the closet.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.250
Minutes later, Monica feels guilty and opens
the closet for David.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.449
She excuses that they're playing hide and
seek before sending him to his room to play

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:32.499
alone.

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.030
At dinner, David watches the couple eat, fascinated
at their actions.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.569
The child pretends to drink from an empty
glass to mimic Henry, then copies Monica as

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.879
she eats pasta.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.219
When noodles get stuck out over Monica's lips,
David lets out a loud laugh that startles

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.260
the two.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.919
The sudden outburst has the parents laughing
along, finally experiencing the joy of having

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.549
a child again.

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.890
That evening, Monica preps David for bed,
carefully tending to him as she would to her

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.120
real son.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.549
She looks at him lovingly but remembers Martin
in the hospital.

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.370
A tear falls down her cheek, conflicted between
grief and guilt.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.249
The following morning, Monica performs the
imprinting protocol, accepting that she needs

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:07.299
David to cope with Martin's condition.

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.370
Her voice cracks as she says the code to trigger
David's love for her.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.019
As she finishes, David's face changes from
an innocent smile to wonderment.

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.779
For the first time, David calls Monica "mommy."

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.419
Hearing this, Monica grows attached to David.

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.930
One night, Monica is giddy as she prepares
to attend an event with Henry.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.449
Heading down the stairs, Henry worries about
Monica's affection for David, reminding her

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.459
that he's a mecha, but Monica sees David as
a gift.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.730
David comes down the stairs to see them off,
but the parents realize that he has used up

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.930
Monica's expensive perfume.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.309
While Monica looks solemnly at the empty perfume
bottle, she confirms to David that she will

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:40.549
die eventually, leaving him alone.

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.739
Not wanting David to feel alone, Monica takes
an old robotic bear that used to be Martin's.

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.689
Monica gives the bear, Teddy, to David to
keep him company while they're away.

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.239
One morning, David shows Monica that he can
relay the audio from her telephone, turning

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.890
himself into a speaker.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.360
On the other end of the line, Henry demands
for Monica, not hearing her due to David's

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.709
speaker mode.

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.409
David finally hands over the phone, where
Monica receives urgent news.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.340
After a few days, Monica introduces David
to Martin, who has woken up from his suspended

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.439
sleep, cured of his rare disease.

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.700
As the days go by, Martin treats David like
a toy, asking him to perform things and questioning

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.049
how he was made.

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.069
When asked for the first thing he remembers,
David draws a bird with feathers sticking

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:19.629
out of the tail.

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:23.439
One afternoon, Martin requests for Monica
to read Pinocchio to him and David, secretly

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:25.640
hoping to taunt David with the story.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.319
Instead, David is fascinated by the idea of
a puppet turning into a real boy.

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:32.849
During lunch, Martin teases David into an
eating contest.

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.340
Monica and Henry panic, knowing that the act
could break David, but the boys don't listen

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.580
to their warnings.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.099
Finally, David stops as one side of his face
droops, frightening the family.

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:44.060
David is taken for repairs while Monica holds
his hand.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.020
Jealous of how his mother worries for David,
Martin tricks David into secretly cutting

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.039
Monica's hair while she's asleep, telling
him that she will love him if he does so.

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.520
Despite David's objection, Martin manipulates
him until he agrees.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.560
David goes into the parents' bedroom to cut
Monica's hair with a scissor.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.379
But Monica turns, nearly getting scratched
by the blades.

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:05.430
Henry shakes David angrily, demanding why
he did it until Monica stops him.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.889
While setting up Martin's birthday party,
Henry desperately convinces Monica that David

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.819
is no longer worth the risk.

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.310
Monica defends David, still seeing him as
a child that makes mistakes.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.930
At the pool party, Martin's friends taunt
David and use a knife to test him.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.680
This triggers David's defense programming,
making him hug Martin, the only human he feels

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.840
safe with while backing away from the other
boys.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.340
But David backs away too far and drags Martin
to the bottom of the pool.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.580
The adults pry Martin off of David's arms
and resuscitate him.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.690
David watches from the bottom of the pool
as the adults take Martin away, leaving him

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.830
alone.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.669
Because of the event, Monica becomes wary
of David.

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.289
Monica sees David's letters to her, further
complicating her feelings towards him.

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:42.930
But she has no choice.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.900
Monica tells David that they go on a trip
with Teddy the next day.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.969
David is overjoyed at the idea of spending
time with his mother.

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:53.169
On the following day, Monica is in tears as
she drives to Cybertronics to have David be

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:54.169
destroyed.

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.469
Overcome with guilt, she diverts the car into
the woods, where David happily sets up a picnic

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:58.790
mat for them.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.930
Monica stops him, revealing that she has to
leave him for good.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.889
Finally processing her words, David begs and
apologizes for everything he'd done.

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.409
He asks if he can come home after becoming
a real boy like Pinocchio, but those stories

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:10.409
are not real.

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:14.319
Before leaving, Monica gives David some money
and tells him not to be caught by Cybertronics

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:15.570
and other people.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.880
When David doesn't let her go, Monica shoves
him, startling herself and the boy.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.240
Monica apologizes before driving away.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.800
David watches the car as it leaves.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.009
In Rouge City, a mecha named Joe comforts
his client before spending an intimate night

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:30.090
with her.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.849
After the act, Joe happily skips through town
as he makes his way to his next client.

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.580
The hotel owner advises Joe to show his operating
license badge as the Flesh Fair is hunting

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.550
for stray mechas in town.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.939
Joe changes his hair to blonde before entering
the room where his client waits.

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:45.539
He sits next to her but finds the bed wet
with blood.

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:49.330
Another man appears in the room, revealing
himself as the one who killed the woman.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.370
Realizing that he's been set up, Joe hides
in an alley and removes his operating license

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.230
badge so he can't be traced.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.539
Out in the woods, David tells Teddy that he
wants the Blue Fairy from the Pinocchio story

00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:59.289
to turn him into a real boy.

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:02.460
They stop when a truck dumps scrap parts that
abandoned mechas search through to repair

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.550
themselves.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.740
Joe walks into the scene with a moon-like
aircraft appearing behind him.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.520
The mechas run in fear as the Flesh Fair hunts
them down.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.590
The group finds Joe among the crowd, interested
in getting an unlicensed new model mecha for

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:14.680
their show.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.560
Motorists chase after David and other mechas
into a derelict town, firing magnetic discs

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.560
to trap them.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.840
David follows some mechas into an abandoned
cottage and meets a nanny mecha, who offers

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.069
to care for him.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.699
The motorists find and take them, along with
Joe.

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:30.090
While they're hoisted up, David tries to hold
onto Teddy, but he falls.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.129
Branches break Teddy's fall, allowing him
to land safely and chase after David.

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:37.370
At the Flesh Fair, Teddy is picked up and
taken to the lost and found.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:41.110
Outside, the crowd cheers as old and abandoned
mechas are destroyed.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.099
Afraid, David holds onto Joe's hand, who's
surprised at the boy's touch.

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:47.870
Teddy escapes the lost and found, finding
David in a cage.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.740
A little girl picks up Teddy and sees David,
thinking that he's a real boy.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.199
The little girl approaches her father, who's
one of the programmers of the show.

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:58.509
The father is alarmed upon hearing that a
boy is among the mechas.

00:07:58.509 --> 00:08:01.569
Back at the cage, David learns from the other
mechas that the humans are cutting them down

00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:03.559
to maintain superiority.

00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:06.719
The girl's father approaches David and uses
a portable x-ray to make sure that David is

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:07.750
a mecha.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.789
The father is startled, fascinated by David,
but the showrunner is not amused.

00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:15.090
While the two men talk, David watches the
nanny mecha get doused in acid as part of

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.180
a game.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.659
The showrunner insists on putting David on
the show, despite the girl's father's claims

00:08:19.659 --> 00:08:21.660
that he's too valuable to destroy.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.219
The showrunner takes David, who grabs hold
of Joe's hand for safety.

00:08:25.219 --> 00:08:28.009
David and Joe are dragged into the field and
into the acid trap.

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:31.460
The showrunner presents David to the crowd,
ranting about how the mecha child insults

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.029
the human population.

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:36.550
But the crowd turns silent, conflicted upon
seeing a child on stage.

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:40.000
When acid falls onto David's shoulders, he
screams in fear.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.400
Hearing his cries, the crowd is convinced
that David is a real child, horrified that

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.779
the show will harm him.

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:47.870
The crowd turns on the showrunner, throwing
at him instead of David.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.070
The others free David just before the crowd
riots, allowing David and Joe to leave the

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.230
fair safely.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:56.290
In Professor Hobby's office, various photos
of David growing up reveal that he's designed

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.280
from Professor Hobby's late son.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.630
The team reports that David was spotted at
the Flesh Fair, assuring the professor that

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:02.779
he escaped safely.

00:09:02.779 --> 00:09:06.130
While walking in the woods, David and Teddy
freeze upon seeing the moon, thinking that

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.930
it's the Flesh Fair's aircraft.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.029
They take a different route just in case.

00:09:10.029 --> 00:09:13.250
When Joe learns about David's quest to find
the Blue Fairy, he tells him that most women

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.030
can be found in Rouge City.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.010
Joe and David plan to head to Rouge City to
ask Dr. Know about the Blue Fairy.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:22.960
To give them a ride to Rouge City, Joe tempts
a group of teenagers to meet mecha women.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.230
Once there, Joe gives David a tour of the
neon-filled city.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.430
Fascinated by a statue of an angel, David
approaches a church, thinking that the angel

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.800
is the Blue Fairy.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:36.450
Joe takes him instead to Dr. Know, a program
that serves as an all-knowing encyclopedia.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.699
Using the money Monica gave him, David learns
from Dr. Know that the Blue Fairy is at the

00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:42.589
end of the world, quoting a passage by Professor
Hobby.

00:09:42.589 --> 00:09:46.190
Joe is troubled, knowing that mechas who go
to the end of the world never come back.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.750
Joe tries to convince David that humans hate
them, but David insists that Monica will love

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.320
him if he's a real boy.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.670
But according to Joe, a human can never love
a mecha.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:58.220
Upon leaving Dr. Know's store, police take
away Joe, believing that he ended the life

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.660
of his previous client.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.529
Curious, David hops into the helicopter's
driver's seat and powers it on.

00:10:03.529 --> 00:10:06.579
His reckless driving causes chaos that allows
Joe to escape.

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:10.050
Joe jumps inside the helicopter, driving the
vehicle for David.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.040
With Joe driving the helicopter, they reach
the wasteland that was previously Manhattan.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.110
After the sea level rose exponentially, the
city is left in ruins and underwater.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.490
David finds lions statues with water pouring
out of their mouths, remembering Dr. Know's

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.820
message about the crying lions.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.020
Setting down the helicopter in the building
next to the lions, David and Joe search for

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.040
Professor Hobby.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.930
Full of hope, David enters an office and approaches
a chair that's turned away.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.820
But instead of Professor Hobby, David finds
a child who looks exactly like him.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.860
The other David smiles at him and invites
him to read with him.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.060
Thinking that this other David will replace
him, David smashes a lamp against the table

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.029
and the other David's head, revealing that
it's also a mecha.

00:10:45.029 --> 00:10:48.389
Joe leaves out of fear as David lashes out,
screaming that he's special and unique until

00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:50.320
Professor Hobby stops him.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.090
The kind professor assures David that he's
a real boy, claiming that he is his Blue Fairy.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:58.259
Dr. Know's clues on finding the Blue Fairy
were explicitly made to lead David to Professor

00:10:58.259 --> 00:10:59.259
Hobby.

00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:02.209
The journey also tested David's emotions and
how his motivation will lead him to chase

00:11:02.209 --> 00:11:05.279
an unknown dream, which other mechas cannot
do.

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:08.389
Professor Hobby walks out of the office to
gather his team, leaving David pondering about

00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:11.019
his journey being part of someone else's design.

00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:13.910
David enters the other room, finding several
mechas that look like him.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.639
He approaches a window and sees the bird he
remembers as his first memory; a statue outside

00:11:17.639 --> 00:11:18.920
the office.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.660
Several boxes are laid out as David, and his
female counterpart, Arlene, are mass-produced

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.180
to be sold.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.100
Realizing that he was never unique, David
heads outside and drops into the water as

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.089
Joe watches from the helicopter.

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:33.540
Underwater, a school of fishes carries David
until he falls in front of something that

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.050
catches his attention.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:39.510
He reaches out, but Joe finds him and pulls
him away using the helicopter's extended arm.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:43.070
Once above water, David reveals that he found
the Blue Fairy underwater.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:47.170
Before they can go further, Joe is magnetized
by a police helicopter hovering above them.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:50.520
Joe says goodbye to David, asking him to tell
his story to the ladies once he's grown up

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.820
as a real boy.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.340
Joe activates the helicopter's submarine mode
before floating away.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.240
Driven to find the Blue Fairy, David navigates
the helicopter-turned-submarine into an abandoned

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.030
carnival with Teddy beside him.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.610
His impaired driving causes him to trip some
wires that loosen the Ferris Wheel.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.819
Just as David finds the Blue Fairy statue,
the Ferris Wheel collapses on top of the helicopter,

00:12:08.819 --> 00:12:09.870
trapping them.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.220
David's eyes focus on the Blue Fairy, unconcerned
that they are trapped.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.790
David pleads for the Blue Fairy to turn him
into a real boy as the years go by.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.010
Even when the lights in the vehicle die down
and the sea creatures perish, the Blue Fairy

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.060
stands still, smiling as David's glimmer of
hope.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.360
Two thousand years later, the world is enveloped
in ice and snow.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.000
The humans have long gone.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.319
An alien spacecraft tours the city of Manhattan
as they colonize the planet.

00:12:31.319 --> 00:12:35.610
There, they retrieve David's helicopter, finding
the boy and Teddy in the ice.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.480
Once reactivated, David convulses before spotting
the Blue Fairy in front of him.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.000
He slides out of the helicopter and approaches
the frozen statue as the alien creatures watch

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
him.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.190
David touches the Blue Fairy, causing it to
crack and break in front of him.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.810
Only then does the spell break, and David
notices his surroundings.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:54.079
Knowing that he lived with humans, the aliens
scan David's memory to understand him and

00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:55.709
the planet better.

00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:59.100
When David comes to, he's sitting at the dining
table in Monica's house.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.310
The home is just like how he remembers it.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.839
David eagerly searches for Monica, announcing
that he's home.

00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:07.060
Instead, a different voice calls his name.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.709
David finds the Blue Fairy, now alive and
talking.

00:13:09.709 --> 00:13:13.430
David asks her to turn him into a real boy,
but she admits that she cannot do so.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:17.850
The aliens use the Blue Fairy to speak to
David, informing him that Monica is long gone.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.540
David mourns, learning that the Blue Fairy
cannot bring Monica back either, as all organic

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.660
parts of her are long gone as well.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.319
Teddy approaches the two, reminding David
of the time he cut Monica's hair.

00:13:27.319 --> 00:13:30.139
Teddy reveals that he kept the lock of hair
that David cut from Monica.

00:13:30.139 --> 00:13:32.040
Now, the aliens can bring back his mother.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.389
In his old bedroom, David fondly remembers
Joe while Teddy repairs himself.

00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:39.100
They see a figure at the door, thinking that
it's Monica.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.040
Instead, it's one of the aliens who conveys
its fascination with human beings.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.720
The aliens wished to bring back the humans,
using organic traces to clone them.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.970
But it remains imperfect, as the clones only
live for one day.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.139
This means that if they bring Monica back,
it will only be for one day.

00:13:53.139 --> 00:13:56.370
David holds onto hope that Monica will be
special like him, that she will last forever

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.889
just like he did after being trapped in the
helicopter.

00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:02.410
Choosing to have his mother even just for
a day, David heads to her bedroom and finds

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:03.770
Monica in bed.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:07.860
He gazes at her fondly, brushing hair from
her face as tears stream down David's cheeks.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.930
When Monica wakes up, she greets him with
a warm smile.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.540
For this one day, David and Monica spend time
together.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.380
David happily shows Monica paintings of his
journey, plays hide and seek with her and

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.350
Teddy, and celebrates his birthday.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.819
When the lights outside grow dim, David tucks
Monica to bed, worried that she will not wake

00:14:22.819 --> 00:14:24.100
up after.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.710
Hearing her say that she loved him, David
smiles in both grief and joy.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:31.209
Feeling content, David decides to sleep next
to his beloved mother, reaching his dreams

00:14:31.209 --> 00:14:42.389
for the first time in his life.
