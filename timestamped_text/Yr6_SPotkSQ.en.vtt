00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.460
Are you ready to unleash your wildest urges?

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.299
Allegra Geller has created the ultimate

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:09.299
escape.

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.840
A parallel universe called eXistenZ.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.790
Antenna Research is running a focus group
seminar, hosted by the world’s most famed

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.580
game designer: Allegra Geller, with a
demo of her latest VR game “eXistenZ”.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.320
She is shot with an undetected gristle gun
by the realist “Noel Dichter”.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.400
Who is gunned down by security guards.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.200
Meanwhile, the sleep security guard

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.780
and marketing trainee “Ted Pikul” is tasked
with getting Geller out of there, safely.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.850
At a motel, Geller finds that her pod, which
contains the only copy of eXistenZ, got damaged

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.960
since it was ripped out while the game was
downloading.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.199
There’s only 1 thing she can do: plug into
eXistenZ with another player and start troubleshooting.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.660
Pikul is not too keen on this, since he has  tomophobia,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.760
or the fear of being operated on; but agrees to do it.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.420
But first, they got to get him fitted with
a bioport of his own.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.780
Off they go to get an illegal bioport installed
by a black-marketeer named Gas.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.409
But he gives him a faulty one, which damages
the game pod, revealing to both Pikul and Geller his plan

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.100
to collect the bounty on Geller’s head as
soon as she’s dead

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.600
with a bonus added if eXistenZ is also destroyed.

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:16.710
Pikul rivet-guns him dead before Gas can do
so, and with Geller they get to a former ski

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.799
lodge where they meet Kiri Vinokur, Geller’s mentor.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.670
With Kiri’s help, Pikul’s pod is fixed
and his bio-port is replaced.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.330
Once they enter the virtual world, Pikul has
a Rational problem with their actions:

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.990
Am I in control or is the game?

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.939
When they meet videogame shop owner D’Arcy
Nader, Pikul speaks rudely to him and is surprised

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.560
by his impoliteness.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.060
Geller then reveals that his game character
is doing the action, not Pikul.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.520
Nader gives them new micro-pods, through which
they enter another layer of reality.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.420
Here is where they meet Yevgeny Nourish,
who claims to be their contact in the Realist

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.200
underground.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.210
Nourish recommends that Pikul order the special
for lunch at a Chinese restaurant near the

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.210
factory.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.880
It’s a stressful experience being in the restaurant so much in fact that Pikul pauses the game

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.980
"eXistenZ is paused!"

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.400
but we have our Matrix problem: for Pikul

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.760
reality and the game feel the same.
Leaving him very confused.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.780
Back in the restaurant, Pikul has a sudden 
craving for the lunch-special.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.320
Somehow, using the special’s inedible bits,
Pikul mindlessly crafts a pistol like the

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.600
one used earlier, which Pikul then uses to
shoot their waiter

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.000
After all, it's just a game.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.860
Look, let me explain.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.560
Right now,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.240
they are in a Chinese restaurant, which is near a factory... "fish-monger place".

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.740
before that, they were in a videogame shop

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.760
and before THAT, they were in a ski lodge

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.740
The ski lodge is reality

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.420
the video game shop is Level 1

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.580
and the Chinese restaurant with the factory is Level 2

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.740
I hope you understood that, back to the movie.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.280
The game engine has some limitations: the
customers around them seem to pause before

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.480
going back to their meals, after Pikul sheepishly
tells them it was a misunderstanding about

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.480
the bill.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.560
They meet with Yevgeny Nourish after the incident,
privately next to the fisheries of the mutant

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.860
animals which are used for the ‘nervous
systems of the game pods’ and here he reveals

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.090
that the animals are also used to make parts
for guns, and that Pikul and Geller should return to work

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.460
as agents of the Realist underground against Cortical Systematics, who are the “Enemy of Reality”

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.640
They go back to the game store, where Hugh
Carlaw explains that Nadar is a spy for

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.120
Cortical Systematics, and the chinese waiter
Pikul shot was their actual contact to the Realist

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.310
Underground basically inside men on their
side., while Yevegeny Nourish is a double

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.410
agent whose job is to make Pikul and Geller
fail in their mission.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.680
The next day, they duo find a diseased pod
and create a plan to sabotage the game pods

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.840
in the factory by getting Geller infected, and
using her to spread the disease.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.380
Pikul frees her after she becomes infected,
by cutting her umbycord.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.780
The plan goes terribly wrong, because Geller
almost bleeds to death and then Nourish comes

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.570
in with a flamethrower, shooting it at the diseased
pod.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.260
Which bursts, releasing deadly spores all
over the factory.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.880
Geller stabs Nourish in the back with a 
knife and the duo find themselves pulled back

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.900
to the ski lodge.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.000
But the disease of the factory’s pod is
transmitted to Geller’s real game pod in

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.960
the real world, which Pikul rightfully questions.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.290
Pikul’s back scratching is noticed by Geller,
who concludes that Kiri Vinokur gave Pikul an infected

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.310
bioport to destroy eXistenZ.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.020
Geller’s plugs in a ‘disinfecting device’
into Pikul’s bioport.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.560
Meaning they can’t play the game in the mean time

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.780
Geller’s game pod is dying when out of nowhere,
a guerilla fighter enters the room!

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.780
It’s Carlaw!

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.650
And he’s a Realist resistance fighter!

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.870
Outside, the trio witness a firefight by the Realist faction and whoever's around

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.020
Carlaw has one last thing to do however:

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.365
Kill the Demonness Allegra Geller,

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.260
he lines up the sights but gets shot by Vinokur!

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.550
Who reveals he’s a Cortical Systems double
agent!

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.539
He also copied all of her game pod data while
he was fixing her pod.

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.539
While Vinokur is busy talking with Pikul,
Geller shoots Vinokur dead with Carlaw’s

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.120
gun.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.180
Pikul confronts Geller, angry at her casual
murder.

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:05.120
Her defense is that they’re still in the
game.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.400
His: What if we’re not?

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.660
What if this isn't a game?

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.430
Then a twist: Pikul is actually another assassin:
a Realist planted to assassinate her.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.150
But, Geller already knew this: his little
joke in the restaurant clued her in and the

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.510
‘antibacteria plugin’ that’s in his
bioport?

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.699
It’s a bomb.

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.460
With Pikul dead, she cheers her victory, when
a blue headset and controller appear on her

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.460
arm and head.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.499
Pressing a button, she awakens next to an
unharmed Pikul who, together, are sitting on a stage,

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:38.499
along with Yevgenev Nourish, the Chinese
Waiter, the Seminar Leader, Kiri Vinokur,

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.660
Gas, D’Arcy Nadar, Noel Dichter, and others
encountered in the game.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.380
Yevgeny Nourish, is actually the game designer of
the demo of the game, "tranCendenZ"

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.780
and confides privately with his assistant that it was‘disturbing’,

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.260
with it’s ‘anti-game’
undertones,  having the assassination of a game designer. Ouch.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.340
He suspects that someone amongst them must
have influenced the game.

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:03.550
Pikul and Geller along with a familiar dog
approach Nourish and ask a simple question:

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.400
“Don’t you think you should suffer for
all the harm you’ve done and intend to do

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.509
to the human race?” for “deforming reality”.

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:15.810
Nourish’s assistant, Merle calls for security,
but Pikul and Geller grab pistols hidden under

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.800
the dog’s false mane and shoot Merle and
Nourish to death.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.129
The play-testers are frozen or have subdued
reactions as Pikul and Geller leave.

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:26.169
They find the person who played the Chinese
waiter sitting down in a chair, and aim their

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:27.169
guns at him.

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.569
He pleads for his life and then asks them,
uncertainly “if they are still in the game?”

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.480
The movie ends framing Pikul and Geller standing
together, guns pointed towards the camera.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.900
Thank you so much for watching, ladies and gentlemen

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.760
