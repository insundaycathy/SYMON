Hi guys, K-Movie Recapped here. Before we
start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today, I’m

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.680
going to explain a 2017 Korean Crime-Thriller
movie called V I P. The movie tells the story

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.949
of a handsome psychopath who is suspected
of committing serial murders and rapes around

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:24.240
the world, and is chased by South Korea, North
Korea and the CIA. Following a string of brutal

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.759
murders, a weary South Korean detective homes
in on a suspect: the son of a high-ranking

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.110
North Korean official.
The story starts on an empty street in North

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.050
Korea. A teenage female student is walking
alone on the side of the road. Suddenly, 3

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.760
students in a car come and kidnap her. She
wakes up naked in an unknown room, surrounded

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.750
by men who are raping and torturing her. It
turns out that they are a gang of psychopaths

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.800
who have also killed her whole family. The
gang leader, Kim Gwang-Il, comes to her to

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.990
finish her. He strangles her with a string
of wire.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.101
A North Korean officer, Lee Dae-Bum, is investigating
this heinous crime. He and his team gather

00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:07.409
evidence at the crime scene, only to find
out the horrifying things that the psychopaths

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.590
have done to the girl’s family. He already
has a suspect, but when he reports it to his

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.740
superior, he is asked to let it go. It seems
like his superior is hiding something. He

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.390
even gets demoted and moved to another place.
3 years later in South Korea, the police found

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.159
a dead body of a girl with signs of rape and
torture. Similar murder cases have happened

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.590
several times recently in South Korea, but
the police have not found the serial killer

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.399
yet. This makes the local residence anxious
and pushes the police to find the killer.

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.950
A leading detective, Chae Yi-Do, tells his
team to match the DNA found at an eggplant

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.020
inside the victim's body with someone he already
suspected. On the other hand, The National

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.469
Intelligence Service, or N I S for short,
is discussing the case. They already know

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.179
about the identity of the killer, because
they are the ones who brought him here from

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.469
North Korea 2 years ago. They call him the
V I P.

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:06.480
The DNA result turns out to be a match. Chae
and his team raid Kim at his hideout. But

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.400
when they arrive, there are also some N I
S agents trying to take him too. Chae and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.459
his team have an arrest warrant for him, so
the N I S back down. Seeing this, one of the

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.709
N I S superior agents panics and immediately
provides a lawyer for Kim Gwang-Il.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.409
In the Interrogation Room, his lawyer gives
a bunch of alibis for him. When asked about

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.599
the DNA result, Kim says that he and the victim
have a farm together as a hobby. The farm

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.069
has some cucumbers and eggplants. At that
moment, Chae is sure that he is the killer.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.319
Because he hasn’t said anything yet about
the eggplant. After that, his team gathers

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.390
CCTV and dashboard camera videos all around
the city to prove the whereabouts of Kim during

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.340
his alibi. After hours of manually checking
the video, they get the evidence that proves

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.189
his alibi wrong.
On the other side, someone is torturing Kim's

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:00.519
gang members. After killing one of them, he
releases the other in the middle of the street.

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.829
The N I S find him and quickly take him into
their custody. They make an agreement with

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.140
the chief of police, they will make that man
responsible for all of the murder cases but

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.700
they want Kim released to them. Seeing this
as a win-win solution, which can close the

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.500
murder case, he accepts the offer.
The N I S brings Kim’s gang member to Chae

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.829
but he can’t accept it. He talks to the
chief of police and he tells him to just let

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.519
Kim go. This will make N I S happy and they
can close the murder case since they also

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:33.110
found that men's DNA inside the victims. Just
before the N I S take Kim, he provokes Chae

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.269
which makes him angry and hits Kim. This makes
him get suspended from the task force.

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.459
Feeling defeated, he goes back home and finds
an unknown man inside. It turns out to be

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.439
Lee, the officer from North Korea. He tells
him his identity and the story about how he

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:53.420
and his men are tortured by Kim. He is the
only one who survives and comes to take revenge

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.280
on Kim. Kim is the son of a high-ranking official
in North Korea. Because of that, he couldn’t

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.090
touch him. But now his father has been arrested
so if he brings Kim back to North Korea, they

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.180
will arrest him too. They finally agree on
working together.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.200
Under the N I S custody, Kim assaults one
of the woman agents. Knowing about this, Park

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.820
beats the shit out of Kim. Kim keeps smiling
without showing any remorse. The N I S and

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.960
C I A have an agreement to give Kim to the
C I A so they wouldn’t have to deal with

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.740
him anymore. When the C I A come, they tell
them that it is actually their plan to move

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.340
Kim from North Korea to South Korea. They
want the banking information of Kim’s father

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.440
in China that he knows. On the other side,
Lee tells Cheo that Kim also killed someone

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.090
in Hongkong. They record the video when they
torture and rape the victim, then sold the

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.449
video to fund their operation. In that video,
Kim’s face is shown clearly.

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.530
Kim becomes angry which makes Chae satisfied
that finally, he can get rid of the smirk

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.470
on Kim’s face.
Unexpectedly, the chief of police suspended

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.289
the whole of Chae's task force, making them
unable to enter their office. Chae drives

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.880
the car alone with Kim but he couldn’t find
out the solution. Park finds him and tries

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.240
to convince him to let it go. He agrees and
lets the C I A take Kim. But just before they

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.550
go away, Kim manages to snatch a gun from
one of the C I A agents and shoot Kim. The

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.440
C I A panic and quickly grab Kim away from
the scene. Seeing that, Park chases them.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.440
Unexpectedly, Lee comes and rams the C I A.
He takes Kim into his car and drives away.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.780
Lee brings Kim back to North Korea by boat.
But it turns out that the whole boat’s crew

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.720
is Kim’s underlings. Lee doesn’t know
that recently Kim’s father has come back

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.919
to power. They kill Lee and throw his body
into the sea. Park then learns about it from

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.599
his superior, but he can’t do anything about
it. He only can wait for a future chance while

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:51.539
seeing Chae lies on the hospital bed helplessly.
5 years later in Hongkong, Park is hired by

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.800
the CIA to take Kim into their custody. Kim’s
father has now been executed, so he has lost

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.030
his power. They give him the location of Kim
and a gun to take care of his men. He goes

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.190
to the location and wipes all of Kim’s guards
one by one. When he finds Kim, instead of

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.310
taking him to the C I A, he shoots him multiple
times, torturing him, just before he shot

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.069
him in the head. He then mutilates his body
and puts it inside a bag. He goes out from

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:18.990
the building to meet the C I A and gives the
bag to them. Just before he leaves, he tells

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.050
the C I A to take care of their own problem
from now on.
