00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.240
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.
Today I will show you a crime, drama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.920
horror film from 2009, titled The Loved Ones.
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.240
The film opens with Brent, a teenage boy&nbsp;
driving through the countryside with his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.400
father Dan in his old car. While teasing each&nbsp;
other over the state of the vehicle and their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.160
tastes in music, Dan takes out and lights&nbsp;
a cigarette, which Brent disapproves of.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.960
Distracted by his father's actions, Brent doesn't&nbsp;
see the person standing in the middle of the road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.600
until Dan calls attention to him. Brent manages&nbsp;
to dodge the stranger at the last second,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.200
but the car crashes against a tree, killing Dan.
Six months later, we find Brent at school chatting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.000
with his best friend Jamie. They discuss their&nbsp;
plans for prom, and Jamie shares some plant and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.400
protection with Brent, encouraging his friend&nbsp;
to have fun. The moment is interrupted when a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.200
classmate of theirs and certified goth, Mia, walks&nbsp;
in to use her locker, completely ignoring the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.640
presence of both boys next to her. Jamie stares&nbsp;
at her, speechless and obviously infatuated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.880
After Mia leaves, Brent nudges into Jamie&nbsp;
following her, and he does exactly that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.120
only to return seconds later with exciting&nbsp;
news: she's accepted his invitation to prom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.400
Another girl walks in then: Lola, a shy-looking&nbsp;
gal, who asks Brent to go to prom with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.160
Brent turns her down as politely as he can&nbsp;
since he's going with Holly, his girlfriend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.600
Lola doesn't react, but she's&nbsp;
quite obviously not pleased.&nbsp;

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.840
After classes are done, Brent leaves the&nbsp;
school to meet with Holly at the doors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.080
who offers a ride because she's finally passed&nbsp;
her driving test. Brent asks her to guess who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.720
has invited him to the dance but doesn't offer&nbsp;
an answer. They end up making out in Holly's car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.120
where she keeps asking for the answer to his&nbsp;
previous question. He doesn't reply at first,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.840
asking for more layers of clothes to be lost&nbsp;
before he replies. When Holly takes off his shirt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.160
we get to see various scars on Brent's body&nbsp;
and a razor blade hanging on his necklace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.920
Cutting and smoking seem to be the method Brent&nbsp;
has chosen to deal with the trauma and guilt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.720
left by his father's death. As their making out&nbsp;
becomes more intimate, the couple becomes unaware&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.280
of their surroundings and, most importantly, of&nbsp;
the fact Lola is outside the car watching them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.080
through the window with increasing irritation.
A couple of hours later, Holly drives Brent to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.760
his house and asks him if he should pick him up&nbsp;
there for prom, since his mother doesn't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.720
she's gotten her license yet. It seems Brent and&nbsp;
cars are a touchy topic in the household, but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.200
promises he'll tell her later. He doesn't return&nbsp;
Holly's "I love you" but as he gets off the car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.120
he finally shares with her the answer to his&nbsp;
question: it was Lola who invited him to prom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.200
After Holly is gone, he enters his&nbsp;
house and goes directly to his room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.760
where he is writing some stuff down in the dark&nbsp;
while listening to heavy metal music. His mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.040
Carla, interrupts him, expressing disapproval when&nbsp;
she learns Holly will be driving Brent to prom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.640
The way she words things makes Brent think&nbsp;
she blames him for his father's death.&nbsp;

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.720
Feeling angry and frustrated after such a talk,&nbsp;
Brent leaves the house together with his dog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.720
heavy metal music playing on his earbuds and the&nbsp;
necklace held so tightly in his fist that it hurts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.280
him. He should be getting ready for prom (as we&nbsp;
see Holly doing in her own place) but instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.520
he enters a rocky, isolated area where he starts&nbsp;
climbing a cliff and enjoying the thrill of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.240
danger. Once he makes it to the top, he smokes&nbsp;
while listening to his music, which doesn't allow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.120
him to hear his dog barking angrily at something.&nbsp;
His mother tries to reach him on his phone, but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.040
ignores the call just as a figure approaches him&nbsp;
from behind and covers his face with a piece of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.600
cloth, intending to knock him out. Brent tries to&nbsp;
fight back with no luck and during the struggle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.440
his phone is kicked away. The stranger&nbsp;
takes a sleeping Brent away on their truck.&nbsp;

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.600
Meanwhile, back in town, Jamie is picking Mia up&nbsp;
at her house. She doesn't look very excited at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.760
the prospect of prom, only getting more annoyed&nbsp;
when her mother and father -a police officer-&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.480
ask them to wait so they can take a picture. In&nbsp;
another part of town, we see a very excited Holly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.120
arriving at Brent's place, only to be approached&nbsp;
by his mother, who a moment ago was at the cliffs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.840
worriedly looking for her son. She asks Holly&nbsp;
if she's seen Brent, but we all know she hasn't.&nbsp;

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.440
Night falls. Jamie and Mia&nbsp;
are on their way to prom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.280
Holly and Carla continue to try to&nbsp;
reach Brent on the phone to no avail,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.000
but they finally get a clue when they hear whining&nbsp;
outside: Brent's dog is back and he's quite hurt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.040
Carla calls Mia's father, Mr. Valentine, to tell&nbsp;
him about what happened, but the cop doesn't take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.520
her seriously at first since Brent disappears&nbsp;
for hours often. During this conversation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.040
his wife shows obvious distress, as if this&nbsp;
brought back old, painful memories. Mr. Valentine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.960
changes his mind and takes the problem seriously&nbsp;
when Carle tells him their dog had been stabbed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.600
Said dog is now in Holly's car, who is trying&nbsp;
to take him to the vet while Carla talks to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.840
the police officer, but she stops the car when&nbsp;
she realized the dog hasn't survived the trip.&nbsp;

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.280
Two different cars are followed next: first,&nbsp;
Jamie's. He and Mia have made it to prom and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.000
they enter the school ground together, although&nbsp;
Mia is obviously not in her best condition. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.520
other car is the truck that kidnapped Brent,&nbsp;
which is stopped in the middle of the road so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.440
its driver can pick up the dead animal. The&nbsp;
truck then goes on until they make it to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.200
house in the middle of the countryside, and&nbsp;
when the canvas covering the back is lifted,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.320
the kidnappers are finally revealed: it's Lola&nbsp;
and her father, Eric. Lola is worried that Brent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.480
may've died but Eric checks his pulse and assures&nbsp;
her he isn't, which makes her bend over Brent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.320
and check herself by putting her ear on his chest&nbsp;
and making sounds to the rhythm of his heartbeat.&nbsp;

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.440
Lola and Eric enter the house, carrying&nbsp;
Brent with them. Lola goes to her very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.920
unsettling and honestly kinda creepy room to&nbsp;
update her scrapbook with a picture of Brent.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.320
Her father interrupts her when he brings him a&nbsp;
gift: a pink dress and a pair of shoes to match.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.560
He intends to leave while she changes but she&nbsp;
asks him to stay so he can tell her how she looks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.000
which ends up with Eric giving her daughter's&nbsp;
undressed very inappropriate glances.&nbsp;

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.720
They go to the dining room then, where Brent is&nbsp;
waking up to find this strange house decorated to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.120
simulate prom. He's been changed into a suit&nbsp;
and tied to a chair in front of table where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.920
other three people -also dressing rather nicely-&nbsp;
sit: Lola, Eric and a woman with a round scar on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.800
her forehead that Lola calls Bright Eyes. She&nbsp;
seems to be out of it. Eric leaves his seat to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.440
grab Brent so Lola can inject bleach into his&nbsp;
throat to destroy his vocal cords. They smile&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.320
and tease Brent while doing it, as if it was just&nbsp;
a cute little game. After the injection is done,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.280
Lola sits on Brent's lap and asks her dad for&nbsp;
a picture. Eric takes it, but asks for a second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.720
one together with Bright Eyes. Lola isn't happy&nbsp;
with this idea but accepts anyway. Bright Eyes is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.720
dragged onto Brent's lap as well, and she yells&nbsp;
when Lola pulls her hair for the photograph.&nbsp;

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.760
Back in the school, Jamie and Mia drink and smoke&nbsp;
inside the car while listening to heavy metal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.880
not joining the party just yet. In contrast to&nbsp;
this, we see Lola's house again, where she and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.720
her father are enjoying take-out chicken while&nbsp;
Brent tries to undo the knots of the rope that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.120
ties him and Bright Eyes stares at nothing. Lola&nbsp;
finds a wishbone in her chicken and offers it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.760
to her dad to make a wish together - Eric wins it&nbsp;
and, even when he swears he's made a wish for her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.520
Lola is not amused. Incredibly annoyed, Lola asks&nbsp;
her father who looks prettier: she or Bright Eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.480
Feeling stuck between a rock and a hard place,&nbsp;
Eric replies that both look pretty, which makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.200
Lola even angrier. She starts force-feeding&nbsp;
chicken and milk to Bright Eyes and, when she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.160
realized Brent is watching, decides to try to do&nbsp;
the same to him while using baby talk. Since Brent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.160
won't open his mouth for her, Eric stands up and&nbsp;
goes to pick a hammer that he brings back to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.760
table as a threat. It works, Brent nods his answer&nbsp;
to Lola's "isn't finger-licking good?" question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.040
He also asks for the toilet, and Lola tells&nbsp;
him he'll be allowed to go if he licks her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.840
finger first. He obeys, and the not-so-innocent&nbsp;
enjoyment Lola is getting from it causes her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.880
jealous dad to stop them. Brent still needs to go&nbsp;
to the toilet (or so he claims, since he's most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.760
likely attempting to escape) but Lola, instead of&nbsp;
taking him to the bathroom, chugs a glass of milk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.640
and then holds against his now open zipper so he&nbsp;
can pee in it. When Brent doesn't manage to do so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.800
he gets threatened again for possibly lying:&nbsp;
he must pee before Lola counts to ten or her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.440
dad will nail him to the chair with the hammer he&nbsp;
used to hurt his dog. Brent pulls it off by nine.&nbsp;

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.480
When Lola gets closer and threatens to cut his&nbsp;
member, Brent kicks her back as he finally manages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.440
to free his hands from the ropes. He hops his way&nbsp;
out of the house, since his legs are still tied,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.960
and hides under Eric's truck to have a hidden&nbsp;
place where to cut the remaining rope off with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.800
his razor blade. Eric leaves the house&nbsp;
and when he doesn't see Brent around,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.880
hops inside the truck to give him chase.&nbsp;
Brent rolls away when the engine is turned on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.680
believing to be safe now, but Eric pulls back and&nbsp;
the truck lights instantly fall on his victim.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.240
Brent runs away and climbs a tree where the truck&nbsp;
crashes when Eric goes after him. He walks around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.400
the tree without knowing what to do, but Lola&nbsp;
arrives then with a flashlight that allows them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.040
to see Brent clearly among vthe branches. They&nbsp;
start throwing rocks at him, laughing and clearly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.040
enjoying his pain, until Brent finally falls,&nbsp;
first hitting the truck and then the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.240
They take him back to the house, where he's tied&nbsp;
to a chair again. Eric proceeds to hammer a knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.880
on Brent's feet as punishment for hitting Lola.&nbsp;
At first Lola just watches, but then she moves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.760
to sit on Brent's lap, asking him to cry. But he&nbsp;
doesn't, which makes her frustrated and angry.&nbsp;

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.760
At the same time, Mr Valentine is&nbsp;
investigating the cliff and finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.760
Brent's phone and music player, which he takes&nbsp;
back to Carla, who is waiting in her house with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.360
Holly and telling him how Brent believes she&nbsp;
blames him for the accident, but she doesn't.&nbsp;

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.160
Back with Brent, who's been sitted between Eric&nbsp;
and Lola and must endure how she shows him her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.160
creepy scrapbook. It's not just an album&nbsp;
of memories, there are pictures of all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.560
boys they've kidnapped and tortured for their&nbsp;
fake proms through the years. One in particular&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.200
calls his attention: Timmy Valentine, the only&nbsp;
one that managed to escape - Brent immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.040
recognizes him: it's the guy that had stood in&nbsp;
the middle of the road and caused the accident&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.280
that killed his dad. Anger eats him from&nbsp;
inside: it's all Eric's and Lola's fault.&nbsp;

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.080
Lola tells her dad he's ready to draw on Brent,&nbsp;
and after a quick cut to the school to see that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.720
Jaime and Mia still haven't left the car, we see&nbsp;
the results of Lola's "drawing": using a fork,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.120
she's carved their initials inside a heart on&nbsp;
Brent's chest. Both her and Eric proceed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.840
throw salt at the wound, making Brent scream and&nbsp;
wiggle in pain while they make fun of him for it.&nbsp;

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.880
While Brent is being punished, her mom is still&nbsp;
in their house, waiting for news. Same for Holly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.040
who finds the card Brent had prepared for her and&nbsp;
contained the words "I love you" that he owed her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.640
And at school, Jaime and Mia finally&nbsp;
decide to leave the car, even if Mia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.120
can barely stand, not feeling very well.
It's time for the coronation at Lola's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.400
prom. She's the queen, of course, and Brent&nbsp;
is named king. All of them get paper crowns,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.280
even Eric, who takes a picture of the royal couple&nbsp;
before his daughter decides to play some music.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.920
It's the actual school dance we see first,&nbsp;
though: Mia and Jaime are slow dancing together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.080
and Mia starts touching Jaime's groin, getting&nbsp;
stares from everyone around them and the attention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.800
of a teacher, who kicks them out of the party.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Lola is trying to dance with Brent as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.960
well while her father throws glitter at them. She&nbsp;
explains to him that the song they're listening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.880
to is the one she wants to be played during her&nbsp;
wedding, which she'll have when she finally finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:12.240
her prince. Brent isn't her prince, however, so&nbsp;
she asks her dad to dance with her instead. Lola&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.480
tells Eric he is her prince, always has been, and&nbsp;
there will be nobody good enough to ever replace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:22.000
him. She closes her eyes and leans in for a kiss&nbsp;
- Eric hesitates at first, but as he gives up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.480
leans in to kiss Lola, they're cut off by Brent&nbsp;
making noise - he's noticed his razor blade on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.040
chair and he's sat on it on purpose to hide it.
We cut to Holly again then, who is talking to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.680
Mr Valentine - the cop promises he's sent out an&nbsp;
investigation team and will contact her if he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.560
any news. Holly returns to Brent's room and, after&nbsp;
failing to contact her mother on the phone because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.280
of the late hours, she cries her heart off.
At Lola's, we see Eric chopping the head off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.280
roadkill they picked up later and passing the body&nbsp;
to his daughter before grabbing a bucket of water.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.600
Under Brent's watching eyes and while he tries&nbsp;
once again to cut the rope with his blade,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.120
they go into the living room and move the&nbsp;
carpet to reveal a secret door on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.040
Screeching from various creatures can be&nbsp;
heard when they open it to feed them with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.040
the animal and throw the water at them.
A little image parallelism occurs then:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.640
Eric leaves the house to grab his tools at&nbsp;
the same time a professor leaves the school&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.360
to find Jaime and Mia making love inside the car.&nbsp;
After the couple is kicked out by their teacher,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.240
we go back to Eric, who hands his electric drill&nbsp;
to Lola so she can drill a hole on Brent's head.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.720
After doing so twice, they start pouring hot&nbsp;
water into it, revealing the procedure behind what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.520
happened to Bright Eyes: lobotomization. Luckily&nbsp;
Brent manages to finish cutting the rope tying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.520
his hand before they're done, and he pushes them&nbsp;
away from him before grabbing the falling drill to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.680
cut the rope on his ankles, then proceeds to use&nbsp;
to knife he takes off his feet to use it on Eric&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:41.680
repeatedly. Furious, Carla jumps on him, but he&nbsp;
manages to shake her off before going after Eric.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.280
He pushes him inside the pit and watches how&nbsp;
the creatures -who turn out to be the previous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.520
lobotomized victims- feed on him. As Brent&nbsp;
stares at the horrifying scene in front of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.320
him with disgust, Lola approaches him from behind&nbsp;
and pushes him into the pit as well. Getting even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.720
angrier when she realizes she can't save her dad,&nbsp;
she starts throwing things into the pit before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.120
closing it. Some of those things turn out to be&nbsp;
the flashlight and the hammer, which Brent uses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.040
to defend himself from the other victims, leaving&nbsp;
him as the only living being left in there.&nbsp;

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.040
Back in town, Jaime takes an&nbsp;
exhausted Mia back to her house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.000
trying not to look suspicious or awkward in front&nbsp;
of her father. Another parallelism occurs here:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.320
as Lola checks on Bright Eyes, Mr Valentine&nbsp;
goes inside the house to check on Mia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.520
who is crying in her bedroom, wondering why "he"&nbsp;
isn't found. He goes back to his own bedroom then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.360
and he tells his wife Mia is fine while looking&nbsp;
at a picture on his night table: it's Timmy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.160
Valentine, the victim that escaped - his son and&nbsp;
Mia's brother, the boy she's asking to be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.880
Another revelation happens while Lola puts a&nbsp;
pillow on Bright Eye's face to get rid of her:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.600
the woman had been Lola's mother. Speaking of&nbsp;
revelations, Holly has one while sleeping on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.320
Brent's bed: he remembers him mentioning Lola's&nbsp;
failed invitation to prom, so she decides to call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.440
Mr Valentine and inform him of this. Mr Valentine&nbsp;
quickly gets in his car and drives to Lola's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.840
house, where he breaks in after seeing the blood&nbsp;
on the floor through the window. He manages to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.240
find the pit thanks to the noises Brent is making&nbsp;
by throwing bones at the doors, but right after he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.800
opens it, Lola appears behind him and pushes&nbsp;
him in as he did with Brent. She walks back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.400
when he tries to shoot her with the officer's&nbsp;
gun then grabs the knife and Brent's necklace,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.880
which she puts around her own neck. Before leaving&nbsp;
the house, she tells Brent that she'll go after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.160
Carla and Holly to hurt them like Brent hurt her&nbsp;
and her dad. The doors of the pit are left open.&nbsp;

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.720
Morning comes. Brent is still in the pit, and&nbsp;
after watching the piles of bones for a while,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:30.560
he gets an idea. As this happens, Lola is walking&nbsp;
along the road, barefoot, shoes and scrapbook one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.440
hand, knife on the other. When she sees a car in&nbsp;
the distance she quickly realizes that's Holly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.760
who never heard back from Mr Valentine. She&nbsp;
throws the scrapbook at her car to make her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.040
stop then jumps in to attack Holly.
While the girls struggle in a fight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.680
Brent is creating a pile of bones and bones that&nbsp;
help him climb out of the pit. He wastes no time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:53.200
in escaping by using the police car Mr Valentine&nbsp;
had arrived with, driving at an insane speed. In a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.760
matter of seconds, he makes it to the spot on the&nbsp;
road where Lola is chasing Holly - Brent quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.960
recognizes his girlfriend and drives around her,&nbsp;
hitting Lola instead. As soon as he stops the car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.680
Holly gets inside and cries when she realizes&nbsp;
who is driving. They take a moment to reunite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.760
and bask in each other's presence, but they're&nbsp;
interrupted by the painful groans of Lola, who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.240
is dragging herself on the road behind them, knife&nbsp;
still in hand because she still wants her revenge.&nbsp;

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.400
Brent sees her and after sharing a look with&nbsp;
Holly, he doesn't hesitate: he starts the car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.440
to run over her. Lola watches her end come to&nbsp;
her in slow motion. With the danger and horrors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.080
finally over, Brent drives back to his home, where&nbsp;
he and Holly reunite with Carla in a tight hug.
