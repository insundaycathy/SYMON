00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.520
of duty and winds up in a coma when he wakes&nbsp;
up civilization has collapsed and the dead are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.400
he meets morgan jones a nice guy who gives him the&nbsp;
rules on how zombies work if you get bit you turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.600
into one head shots are the only way to take them&nbsp;
out for good they are attracted to noise though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.240
so avoid guns when possible and most importantly&nbsp;
they never actually say zombie in this show every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.840
group has a different name for them but our group&nbsp;
mostly calls them walkers so rick says cool thanks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.080
man maybe i'll catch you later and now works on&nbsp;
a mission to find his family riding a horse into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.560
the ruins of atlanta epic shot turns out though&nbsp;
major cities are not where you want to be because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.640
densely populated areas are now densely packed&nbsp;
with zombies luckily we're saved by a friendly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.680
guy glenn who introduces him to our season 1 ogs&nbsp;
there's andrea t-dog and merle who's a real a-hole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.200
picks a fight with t-dog but sheriff rick's here&nbsp;
to lay down the law handcuffs them to the roof to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.760
cool off but now the group is trapped so they come&nbsp;
up with a disgusting plan to rub zombie guts all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.520
over themselves yes if you smell like the dead the&nbsp;
zombies kind of ignore you more on this later then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.760
as the group's leaving t-dog accidentally drops&nbsp;
the handcuff key down the drain sorry man you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.000
suck anyway merle's abandoned on the roof this&nbsp;
group has a nice campsite outside the city and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.520
wouldn't you know it rick's family is here he's&nbsp;
reunited with his wife lori and his son carl aka&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.840
coral his best friend and partner shane is here&nbsp;
too but while they thought rick was dead he and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.080
laurie started getting it on now that rick's back&nbsp;
though lori puts an end to that real quick in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.920
group his old man dale who owns the rv and mostly&nbsp;
stands on top of it keeping watch then there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.000
carol the meek little housewife who has an abusive&nbsp;
husband and there's daryl merle's hot-headed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.920
younger brother who's a real cool hunter type with&nbsp;
a crossbow he is not happy they left his brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.320
handcuffed to the roof but when they go down to&nbsp;
rescue him he's already gone oh he found a saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.800
and cut his hand off to escape one night at camp a&nbsp;
bunch of zombies get in and eat all the background&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.680
characters including andrea's sister amy who comes&nbsp;
back as a zombie and oh it's traumatizing andrea's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.000
gotta put her down carol's abusive husband though&nbsp;
not sad good riddance so with the camp not safe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.520
anymore the group hits the road they go to the&nbsp;
center for disease control hoping it's still up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.280
and running looking for a cure unfortunately it's&nbsp;
not there's only one scientist left alive they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.560
never even got close to a cure and the group&nbsp;
showed up just in time this place is about to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.440
self-destruct so our group gets out of there boom&nbsp;
and they leave the cdc a smoking ruin in season&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.280
two our group hits a traffic jam and a whole herd&nbsp;
of zombies are coming they hide under the cars but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.440
carol's daughter sophia gets spotted and has to&nbsp;
run away and they can't find her they do find a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.640
deer but oh what carl gets shot girl yeah it was&nbsp;
a random hunting accident from this guy who lived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.680
nearby on herschel's farm conveniently herschel&nbsp;
is a doctor well a veterinarian but close enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.880
to save carl he needs more meds though so shane&nbsp;
and this guy go on a run to get him but on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.200
way back they're swarmed they're not gonna make&nbsp;
it so sheen's like sorry guy i pick carl over you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.800
shoots him in the leg uses him as zombie bait&nbsp;
to get away hardcore shane then shane shaves his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.040
head to reflect his new hardcore persona so carl&nbsp;
survives rick gives him a sheriff's hat which he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.400
never takes off for the rest of the series so if&nbsp;
he is still missing though so the search continues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.320
and it's daryl who's the mvp here with his&nbsp;
survivalist track and skills and we get to see his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.080
softer side here he really bonds with the grieving&nbsp;
mother carol these two become best friends hershel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.760
has a daughter maggie who goes on a run to town&nbsp;
with glenn he finds the last box of condoms and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.280
maggie's like well it's the apocalypse why not&nbsp;
but these two fall in love and aren't together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.120
the rest of the series then there's a problem when&nbsp;
herschel's barn is full of zombies yeah he doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.800
admit their daddy thinks they're sick and will one&nbsp;
day be cured shane is like oh hell no and leads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.760
the group on a zombie barn massacre and turns&nbsp;
out zombie sofia has been in there the whole time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.600
oh it's tragic rick and jane argue over this but&nbsp;
shane's like rick you're too soft for this world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.680
there's no good and bad anymore the right decision&nbsp;
is the one that keeps us alive meanwhile laurie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.200
finds out she's pregnant so she tells rick about&nbsp;
her and shane which was fair they thought he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.720
dead but shane's not letting it go laurie can't&nbsp;
take two steps this season without shane coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.640
onto her in fact back at the cdc shane got&nbsp;
drunk and stepped way over the line so these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.080
best friends continue to butt heads one day they&nbsp;
meet some strangers who teach him the lesson you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.120
can't trust anyone in the zombie apocalypse&nbsp;
long story short they end up with a prisoner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.080
and the group takes a vote on what to do with them&nbsp;
dale's the only one who's like we can't kill this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.560
guy we gotta be good people unfortunately that&nbsp;
night a zombie gets in and bites stale oh r.i.p&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.840
dale and eric decides to let this guy live and&nbsp;
shane doesn't approve he takes him out to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.200
woods and kills him then roughs his face ups as&nbsp;
the prisoner escaped so they go out searching for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.800
him and shane leads rick to a deserted meadow&nbsp;
yeah he's gonna kill him it's like rick you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.640
too soft you can't keep your family safe so i'm&nbsp;
gonna do it for you but maybe rick's not too soft&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.160
because oh sneaky knife stabs his former best&nbsp;
friend r.i.p shane but shane doesn't stay dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.600
what how's that possible he wasn't bit turns&nbsp;
out there's a secret rick learned back at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.920
cdc that he finally shares with the group everyone&nbsp;
is infected the bite just gives you a fever that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.480
kills you but no matter how you die everyone comes&nbsp;
back that same night a zombie heard shows up beats&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.080
the rest of the background characters and our&nbsp;
group leaves the farm a smoking ruin everyone's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.080
arguing about what to do next but rick's in no&nbsp;
mood he's like look this ain't a democracy anymore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.920
it's a rictator ship so in season three the&nbsp;
group's on the road they're really rough and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.080
eating dog food but soon they hit the jackpot when&nbsp;
they find a prison with real tall fences that once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.680
kept prisoners in now it'll keep the zombies out&nbsp;
first they have to clear all the walkers already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.920
inside and our groups become expert zombie killers&nbsp;
now but there's always danger herschel gets bit on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.160
the leg and rick has to amputate hoping to stop&nbsp;
the infection which luckily works so life at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.760
prison's good for a while but zombies always get&nbsp;
in and no one gets t-dog ript dog and wouldn't you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.400
know what the baby's coming right now maggie's&nbsp;
gotta do an emergency c-section baby judith is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.240
okay but laurie dies r.i.p laurie and young carl&nbsp;
has to shoot his mom in the head before she turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.360
oh it's traumatizing no coral rex dramatized&nbsp;
two he spends a few episodes hallucinating lori&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.280
and is generally unhinged meanwhile andrea got&nbsp;
separated from the group back at the farm she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.880
gets saved though by someone with a katana and&nbsp;
zombies chained to them what this is michonne&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.280
the katana wielding badass her walker bodyguards&nbsp;
act as camouflage similar to the guts trick and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.240
since she cut out their mouths they can't bite&nbsp;
her one day they're too noisy though she has to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.800
kill him but it doesn't help they're still found&nbsp;
by merle yes he survived and now has an awesome&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.280
knife hand he takes them to the town of woodbury&nbsp;
a huge successful survivors community because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.280
they built big walls and seems like an amazing&nbsp;
happy place it's led by a handsome charismatic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.720
man they call the governor he's like hey you&nbsp;
guys are welcome to stay and andrea is like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.800
yeah of course in fact these two start hooking up&nbsp;
but michonne doesn't trust this guy decides to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.880
off on her own of course she was right he is a&nbsp;
bad dude and immediately sends merle to go kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.880
her instead merle finds maggie and glenn it's like&nbsp;
hey man sorry about the handcuff roof thing but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.400
takes him prisoner and instead of the friendly&nbsp;
welcome andrea got he gives them the decidedly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.840
unfriendly welcome michonne finds the prison fills&nbsp;
the group in they go for a rescue mission where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.760
michonne finds another of the governor's secrets&nbsp;
he's got a zombie daughter yeah he refuses to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.160
accept she's really gone it's like don't hurt her&nbsp;
but she's like man this a zombie and all katana&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.400
this pushes him over the edge he's full crazy now&nbsp;
and in their ensuing fight michonne oh stabs him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.240
in the eye that's okay though he gets to wear an&nbsp;
eye patch now which just makes him look cooler&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.600
merle tries to join our crew but no one wants him&nbsp;
there except his brother daryl to earn his keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.680
merle goes on a solo assassination mission but&nbsp;
oh he misses the governor and the governor does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.680
not miss so when daryl arrives he finds zombie&nbsp;
merle you were a bad guy but still my brother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.400
r.i.p merle and one episode morgan is back but&nbsp;
he's crazy now tries to kill everyone on site so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.480
now the governor's right into war busts in there&nbsp;
guns blazing but our group's ready for him and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.680
manages to chase him off the governor is like&nbsp;
hey you cowards turn back and fight but they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.880
like wait we're not soldiers we're just civilians&nbsp;
but he's crazy and all mows them all down also we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.480
found out andrea betrayed him left her there with&nbsp;
a zombie so when the group gets there oh she's bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.040
r.i.p andrea so in season four the group takes in&nbsp;
all the woodbury survivors most notably tyrese and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.240
his sister sasha we learned the three interview&nbsp;
questions to see if you can join the group how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.080
many walkers are killed how many people he killed&nbsp;
and why rick's trying to get some farming going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.680
but when a pig gets sick some people catch the pig&nbsp;
flu when tyrese goes to visit his girlfriend and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.800
quarantine oh someone has killed her and the&nbsp;
killer is carol who hoped to stop the spread&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.800
yes carol is no longer the meek house wife we knew&nbsp;
she's a hardened survivor secretly teaching the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.080
kids to use knives she's like look rick i did&nbsp;
what had to be done for the good of the group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.000
but rick's like yo that wasn't your call to make&nbsp;
you are banished and it didn't work anyway thus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.920
sickness spreads all the rest of the extras die&nbsp;
luckily our main characters all make it but now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.760
there's a new threat because the governor is&nbsp;
back after the battle he went home and left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.680
woodbury a smoking ruin he wandered the earth&nbsp;
grew depression beard met some sisters who had a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.080
daughter that renewed his will to live ended up in&nbsp;
a new camp that notably had a tank so he decided&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.840
he should be in charge he took the tank and some&nbsp;
hostages over to the prison and to show he means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:07.760
business oh beheaded herschel no rip herschel&nbsp;
so it's governor fight round two tank boogaloo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.440
daryl busts out his sick call of duty skills&nbsp;
takes out the tank no problem and the governor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.600
oh katana through the chest governor is defeated&nbsp;
so our group survives but they're all split up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.840
they've left the prison a smoking ruin rick's out&nbsp;
of commish for a while and with no dad rules carl&nbsp;&nbsp;

in action he's not messing around he's kill you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.160

fact it's right here when rick puts on his famous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.680
murder jacket so named because he becomes a feral&nbsp;
beast who bites people's necks out tyreese made it&nbsp;&nbsp;

which claims to be a safe place unfortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.920
though one of these girls is crazy and thinks&nbsp;
zombies are friends in fact she kills her sister&nbsp;&nbsp;

so she can have a fun sister zombie friend oh&nbsp;

sister she tried to kill herself in season two but&nbsp;
now she's a hard survivor so far though she's been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.520
a bit of a background character mostly just holds&nbsp;
judith while rick's busy she and daryl find some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.080
moonshine so they get drunk and have a big fight&nbsp;
then have a good cry then burn their house down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.480
you know as you do they get separated though when&nbsp;
beth is abducted by a random car and more on that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.320
later maggie and glenn got separated too by the&nbsp;
way last season he stole an engagement ring from a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.880
zombie and proposed cute she's off looking for him&nbsp;
but turns out glenn was still at the prison there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.400
he finds tara one of the sisters the governor&nbsp;
befriended she's the snarky one they work together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.120
to escape and soon find a new group abraham's&nbsp;
a funny bad-mouthed military guy rosita's his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.760
cool sexy girlfriend eugene apparently is a top&nbsp;
scientist who abraham's taken to dc to help cure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.200
the zombie apocalypse but it's like really the&nbsp;
guy with the mullet long story short all our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.360
groups find maps to terminus and reunite there&nbsp;
it's a happy friendly place here have a burger i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.520
promise we aren't cannibals turns out though they&nbsp;
are cannibals and our group's on the menu so in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.960
season 5 things look bleak as our group's about to&nbsp;
be butchered but at the last second boom explosion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.680
yes carol and tyrese were late to the party and&nbsp;
quickly discerned the situation so carol goes full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.200
commando mode and single-handedly bloom blasts a&nbsp;
hole in terminus that's just the distraction our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.160
group needed they all escape and leave terminus&nbsp;
a smoking ruin so are groups back on the road&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.000
pretty soon they find a priest father gabriel&nbsp;
who's got a nice secluded church with a bunch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.920
of canned food right then though terminus comes&nbsp;
back for revenge but our group takes them out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.600
immediately abraham tells the rest of the group&nbsp;
about their mission how eugene's a top scientist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.680
they have to get to dc and he can cure the zombie&nbsp;
apocalypse and it's like wow this is great this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.680
must be the start of the main plot where our group&nbsp;
saves the world our group splits up for now though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.760
because they have to go save beth beth was brought&nbsp;
to a hospital where doctors and cops are still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.680
playing dress-up but this place is also secretly&nbsp;
devious and she's a prisoner here very long story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.480
short they do a hostage exchange but beth's like&nbsp;
hey you're evil and stabs her then oh get shot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:44.640
in the head no they were so close r.i.p beth the&nbsp;
dc mission's also a failure they immediately run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.360
into car trouble and pretty soon eugene is forced&nbsp;
to admit he's not actually a top scientist he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.120
just a regular nerd when he saw this big beefy&nbsp;
guy used a bunch of big words to convince him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.040
be his bodyguard that's right curing the zombie&nbsp;
apocalypse is not where this show's going the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.880
zombies are here to stay so now our group has no&nbsp;
clear destination they try this one neighborhood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:06.400
where tyrese gets bit no they try to amputate but&nbsp;
it was too late to rip tyrese and now our group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.600
has hit rock bottom no vehicles no food or water&nbsp;
wandering the earth without purpose or direction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.920
the imagery of this shot exposes the duality of&nbsp;
the title the walking dead referring not just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.000
to the reanimated corpses but to our survivors&nbsp;
themselves and in case you didn't pick up on that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.160
rick says it five minutes later but now we meet&nbsp;
a stranger who's this nerdy justin timberlake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.920
looking guy he's like hey guys my name's aaron&nbsp;
you can come join my nice safe community but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.600
it's like no offense bub the last people who said&nbsp;
that tried to eat us but the group's got to check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.400
it out and so we've made it to alexandria it's an&nbsp;
upscale virginia neighborhood that's been totally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.320
unscathed because right at the beginning they&nbsp;
built giant walls and it's not run by cannibals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.200
or an unhinged megalomaniac the leader is this&nbsp;
nice woman deanna she videotapes rick to document&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.680
his sexy apocalypse beard because this place was&nbsp;
designed to be self-sustaining it runs on its own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.320
grid they've got power and water so yeah nothing&nbsp;
devious here just people that got really lucky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.520
rick's like hey they're all soft if we don't&nbsp;
like how they do things we'll just take it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.840
from them they had to turn in all their guns but&nbsp;
carol puts on an act as the meek housewife again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.400
bakes cookies for everyone so no one suspects her&nbsp;
of unlocking the armory and stealing some back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.560
carl's a teenager now and he meets a teenage girl&nbsp;
enid she came in from the outside too and is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.600
having trouble adjusting she has a motto jss just&nbsp;
survive somehow and so naturally these two form a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.360
romance rick gets a love interest too but turns&nbsp;
out she has an abusive husband but rick's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.120
standing for that he's gonna murder this guy in&nbsp;
the town square deanna's like whoa rick we don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.360
do that here but rick pulls out a gun and gives&nbsp;
an unhinged rant about how they're all too soft&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.520
shane would be proud so michonne knocks him out&nbsp;
for his own good so diana wants to kick rick out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.760
but father gabriel doesn't understand how locks&nbsp;
work so zombies get in but rick saves the day like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.400
hey you guys need me just then randomly morgan&nbsp;
is back he's a pacifist now who's taking a bow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.720
never to kill again so he fights with a stick the&nbsp;
least lethal of all weapons so season six begins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.160
when our group finds a big zombie herd luckily&nbsp;
they've got a good plan on how to hurt it away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.480
from alexandria but some loud noises draws the&nbsp;
herd right towards it cause alexandria is under&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.960
attack by a group of raiders called the wolf pack&nbsp;
rick gets back just in time but alexandria is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.960
surrounded glenn is still out there trapped on a&nbsp;
dumpster but this guy opts for a quick death and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:07.440
like a douchebag takes glenn down with him no not&nbsp;
glenn oh r.i.p glenn just kidding actually five&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.440
episodes later we find out glenn's okay he hid&nbsp;
under the dumpster some more of our crew is still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.760
outside sasha and abraham start flirting in fact&nbsp;
soon they end up together abraham dumps rosita but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.280
for now they find a rocket launcher daryl makes&nbsp;
friends with the married couple dwight and sherry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.040
but they're on the run from another bad group&nbsp;
and decide to jack his motorcycle and crossbow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.800
at alexandria the situation's grim brick and&nbsp;
family tried the old-fashioned guts trick to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.320
try to sneak on out of there but it only works&nbsp;
if you act like a zombie and this kid draws too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.240
much attention to himself gets eaten and then&nbsp;
rick's girlfriend screams too all her other son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:39.120
blames rick so michonne's got to stab him but he&nbsp;
fires and hits carl in the eye coral so with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.960
stealth mission a complete failure it's time for&nbsp;
plan b kill all the zombies our group are pros&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.120
but they're getting overwhelmed luckily just then&nbsp;
the cavalry comes back with a convenient gas truck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:52.320
and a rocket launcher luckily zombies are dumb&nbsp;
they all walk into the fire and alexandria is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.320
a smoking ruin they manage to rebuild carl's&nbsp;
fine too he gets to wear an eye patch now which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.920
just makes him look cooler rick and michonne&nbsp;
living as platonic roommates but one day it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.800
not so platonic these two get it on and they're&nbsp;
together the rest of the series so life is good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.280
for a bit and things are quiet but soon we meet a&nbsp;
new character who's a kung fu master people call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.840
him jesus for obvious reasons he's a friendly guy&nbsp;
and he's here as an envoy from another survivor's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.320
community the hilltop they've got a lot of food&nbsp;
but they don't have any guns and there's a gang&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.920
who calls themselves the saviors that are taking&nbsp;
half their stuff every week rick's like hey no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.240
sweat my people are very good at killing so they&nbsp;
go to the savior outpost and slaughter them all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.800
but soon after the road is blocked by a couple&nbsp;
more saviors and turns out every road is blocked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.360
by even more saviors this gang might be bigger&nbsp;
than we thought soon our group is surrounded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:41.440
on their knees in the woods and it's time to meet&nbsp;
the big man himself it's negan he wears a leather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.480
jacket and carries a baseball bat loose seal he's&nbsp;
a smiley charismatic type of psychopath and man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.720
does he love to hear himself talk he explains he's&nbsp;
not going to kill them all he needs them alive so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.160
he can take half their stuff every week but to&nbsp;
make a point he's got to kill one of them right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.160 --> 00:15:00.080
now he's going to pick randomly and season 6 ends&nbsp;
on a cliffhanger we don't see who it is but you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:05.680
watching the recap you don't have to wait to find&nbsp;
out that he picks abraham no oh r.i.p abraham&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.840
daryl's not having this he tries to fight back&nbsp;
but that's against the rules and for his insolence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:16.000
sneakin's gonna kill another one no glenn no not&nbsp;
glenn he was the best of us been around since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.280
episode one and his wife maggie is pregnant&nbsp;
but negan don't care he kills him brutally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.280
and so in season seven they spend the first half&nbsp;
of the season at the mercy of negan's whims you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.920
never know if he's gonna cook you spaghetti or&nbsp;
cut your guts out but finally rick has had enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.080
it's time to fight back the leader of hilltop is&nbsp;
this slimy politician gregory but the people of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.840
hilltop find a new leader in maggie yeah she's&nbsp;
been living there since she was pregnant and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.360
they had a doctor and she's proven herself to be&nbsp;
leadership material but we'll need more allies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.240
for this fight so it's time to meet the kingdom&nbsp;
so named because their leader is the king king&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.800
ezekiel who's really committed to the character of&nbsp;
a fantasy king jerry is his best friend and loyal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:56.080
bodyguard who's just having fun with it his other&nbsp;
bodyguard is shiva his pet tiger carol's like what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.920
show am i on ezekiel's actually a normal chill&nbsp;
dude though he just used to do community theater&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.920
and was a zookeeper and he's got a crush on carol&nbsp;
eventually these two get together but the kingdom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.440
is also under the thumb of the saviors and so&nbsp;
long story short rick convinces them to join&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.680
them there's also oceanside a coastal community of&nbsp;
all women because the saviors killed all their men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.280
so now they don't like strangers long story short&nbsp;
tara befriends them although they don't actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.880
agree to help fight our group kind of just&nbsp;
takes their guns then there's the trash people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.800
a bunch of goths who live in the dump and have&nbsp;
very quickly developed their own strange culture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.040
but rick eventually convinces them to join too&nbsp;
now the savior home base is a big scary industrial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.600
building called the sanctuary daryl is a prisoner&nbsp;
there for a while and soon negan takes eugene too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.280
earlier he found out that eugene's a smartypants&nbsp;
who knows how to manufacture bullets he wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.200
eugene to make bullets for him but ideally not as&nbsp;
a prisoner as a full-blown member of negan's gang&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.960
with all the rights and privileges that entails&nbsp;
when eugene sees the price of disloyalty he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.120
like yup negan i'm in all the way and he starts&nbsp;
to really enjoy his position of power as chief&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.960
engineer another of negan's top lieutenants is&nbsp;
dwight the guy who stole daryl's motorcycle and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.120
crossbow apparently negan caught them and forced&nbsp;
jerry to become one of his wives and ex-boyfriends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.280
of negan's wives get hot ironed to the face so&nbsp;
that's what happened to dwight obviously dwight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.200
hates negan but he's been broken there's nothing&nbsp;
left in him but obedience but one day sherry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.320
escapes so dwight goes back to their home but&nbsp;
she's left him a note i didn't know if you turned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.880
me back into negan so i'm not here and it's tragic&nbsp;
cause he wasn't gonna he brought beer and pretzels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.480
like they always said they would so after this&nbsp;
dwight finds our crew like hey negan's gotta go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:18.800
down i'll be your man on the inside so soon negan&nbsp;
rolls up in force to punish their disobedience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.960
sasha was captured earlier so he threatens to&nbsp;
execute her but well she's already dead yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.480
she pleaded to eugene for help but the help he&nbsp;
gave her was a suicide pill but she figured what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.520
the heck i'll turn myself into a weapon and oh&nbsp;
she almost gets negan r.i.p sasha but now rick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.280
has the trash people on his side but oh they&nbsp;
double-cross him negan made him a better offer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.680
and so once again rick is on his knees and to&nbsp;
teach him a lesson this time negan's gonna kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:45.040
carl but oh tiger attack yes hilltop in the&nbsp;
kingdom arrive just in time chase negan off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:50.320
for now and now the triple alliance is ready for&nbsp;
all-out war so in season 8 it's zombie apocalypse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.240
warfare time which sometimes involves just wasting&nbsp;
a lot of bullets but there's other cool stuff like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.240
armored cars and using zombie herds against your&nbsp;
enemies it's kind of a convoluted season a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:03.600
of back and forth but the most noteworthy things&nbsp;
the king's tiger dies shiva father gabriel loses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.080
sight in one eye and morgan gives up on his no&nbsp;
killing bow he starts killing everyone again maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.840
there's a middle ground there but the biggest&nbsp;
loss of them all is carl he got bit no coal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.560
yes even though he's a seasoned zombie killer&nbsp;
now it's always dangerous sometimes you get bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.800
r.i.p carl now they still have dwight as an inside&nbsp;
man and one day he leaked some plans but turns out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.440
negan knew he was a traitor and gave him fake&nbsp;
plans so our group walks into an ambush and are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.200
totally surrounded now the saviors have plenty of&nbsp;
bullets left because eugene's been manufacturing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:37.280
them but now at the last battle they all backfire&nbsp;
yes eugene finally grew a spine and a conscience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.520
and saved the day so our group easily wins the&nbsp;
day rick has his final showdown with negan the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.200
question is what to do with the other saviors but&nbsp;
rick goes into mercy mode gives an impassioned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.280
speech about how the living need to stick together&nbsp;
because the real enemy is the dead and indeed many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.120
of these saviors become valued members of the&nbsp;
group like this nice guy alden in fact rick lets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.920
negan live too yeah he sentences him to prison for&nbsp;
life to prove that they're the good guys morgan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.080
renews his vows of non-violence and decides to&nbsp;
cross over to fear the walking dead and become the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.840
new main character over there and dwight goes back&nbsp;
to find that sherry liked his offering of beer and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:11.040
pretzels she says come find me so they go off to&nbsp;
fear too so in season nine the good guys won and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.280
the future looks bright maggie though is not happy&nbsp;
that negan's still alive she's gonna kill him but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.640
when she sees how much he hates being locked up&nbsp;
she's like never mind i'm gonna leave you here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.160
to rot so life in the zombie apocalypse is pretty&nbsp;
good now with all the communities working together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.440
until the bridge that connects them all finally&nbsp;
collapses so rick has got to lead a massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.880
construction project one day though rick runs&nbsp;
into some zombie trouble and oh ends up in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.720
bad situation trying to make it home but instead&nbsp;
he leads the horde right to the bridge he's gotta&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:38.800
stop him from crossing so the dynamite he's gonna&nbsp;
take the shot oh rick grimes boom blows the bridge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:44.080
and himself up all the ultimate sacrifice to save&nbsp;
the communities miraculously though rick survives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.760
and in fact he's found just then by the leader&nbsp;
of the trash people jadis there's been a whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.680
mystery with her she's in communication with&nbsp;
some super group that has helicopters in fear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.960
the walking dead and the world beyond we learn&nbsp;
a little bit about this group the civic republic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.720
military the crm they're gonna give her a ride in&nbsp;
exchange for a prisoner so she's like well that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.840
was a freebie so rick grimes our main character&nbsp;
flying off the show on a helicopter off to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.000
whole new series of adventures in theoretically&nbsp;
his own spin-off movies we immediately cut to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.440
whole new group of characters having some zombie&nbsp;
trouble when they're saved by a little girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.720
with rick and carl's sheriff's hat yes this is&nbsp;
a grown-up judith grimes we've had a time jump&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.480
alexandria is still prospering they have a&nbsp;
windmill now but they're not very friendly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.760
these days they went through some bad stuff during&nbsp;
the time jump in fact they've been out of contact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.920
with the other communities rick's bridge was never&nbsp;
rebuilt this new group is magna the hot-headed one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.360
yumiko the cool level-headed one incidentally&nbsp;
these two are dating there's also connie who's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.880
deaf and her sister kelly and luke the funny&nbsp;
music nerd they quickly proved themselves to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.480
be capable survivors and yeah they're fighting&nbsp;
with slingshots and bow and arrows eugene's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.080
bullet factory didn't work out i guess and now a&nbsp;
decade after the start of the zombie apocalypse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:46.720
there's no ammo left there's also no gas left we&nbsp;
don't do cars anymore we're riding horses over at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.720
the kingdom carol has grown out long hair and is&nbsp;
officially married to king ezekiel they adopted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.000
this kid henry who's been training in morgan's&nbsp;
way of the stick but the kingdom is starting to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.680
fall apart ezekiel's trying to organize an inner&nbsp;
community fair to bring everyone back together so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.800
carol and henry go on an adventure and their first&nbsp;
stop is the old hermit of the woods obi-wan daryl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.400
kenobi he never stopped looking for rick grimes&nbsp;
he's been living out here by himself this whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.960
time well not totally by himself because he has&nbsp;
a dog now named dog eventually we get a flashback&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.040
to see how they met he belonged to a woman leia&nbsp;
and she and daryl fell in love but one day she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.560
too disappeared without a trace maybe that'll&nbsp;
come up later now the hilltop is also thriving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.320
but maggie's not the leader anymore in fact she&nbsp;
left the show she met a woman named georgie who's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.520
apparently an expert on medieval technologies and&nbsp;
drives around the country teaching people how to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.560
build windmills and stuff maggie was like hey&nbsp;
i could use a change of scenery i'm coming with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.800
you and big bad negan is not very scary anymore&nbsp;
he's befriended young judith grimes and is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.880
the funny man that lives under the stairs but in&nbsp;
six years no one taught father gabriel how to lock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.920
a gate and so one day the negan is friggin&nbsp;
he goes on a bit of a walkabout but realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.840
there's nothing out here for him anymore he just&nbsp;
goes back to his cell later during a blizzard he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:51.040
risks his life to save judith and dog yes negan is&nbsp;
trying for a redemption arc now the main problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.960
this season begins when rosita and eugene run&nbsp;
into a zombie herd but this is no normal herd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:00.560
because the zombies are whispering to each&nbsp;
other smart talking zombies are they evolving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:05.280
what the butt our crew ends up cornered in a&nbsp;
cemetery and they are expert zombie slayers but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:11.040
not when they dodge then stab you with a knife&nbsp;
all these new walkers are terrifying turns out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.600
though they're not smart evolved walkers they are&nbsp;
just people who wear zombie masks yes this group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.080
is called the whisperers and they've taken the&nbsp;
guts trick to the extreme they wear zombie faces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.760
and live among them full time luckily they're a&nbsp;
lot less scary when they don't have the element&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.440
of surprise and soon our group takes one prisoner&nbsp;
this young girl named lydia she's like hey please&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:32.640
don't send me back they are awful especially their&nbsp;
leader my mother alpha she's a cult leader like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.480
figure who's been completely broken by the zombie&nbsp;
apocalypse and eventually we learn the whispers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:41.440
have no reasonable motivation their motto is we&nbsp;
are the end of the world alpha has completely rid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.120
herself of human emotions in fact she's abusive&nbsp;
to her daughter to make her stronger but daryl's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.400
not gonna stand for that he's leading a rescue&nbsp;
mission with stickboy henry who in a very quick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.560
time formed a romance with lydia so on the day of&nbsp;
the inter-community fair everyone's having a great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:57.360
time including some whisperers in disguise they&nbsp;
end up capturing a bunch of our group and reveal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:03.840
their true power alpha has a absolutely massive&nbsp;
zombie horde that her people are controlling she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.760
like look if you guys cross into our territory&nbsp;
we'll unleash it on ya and to mark the border of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:14.080
that territory heads on pikes yes alpha killed&nbsp;
like a dozen minor characters in one fell swoop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.320
but also some bigger ones like enid yeah carl's&nbsp;
old girlfriend who's an adult now and started&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:23.200
dating nice savior alvin r.i.p enid and tara who's&nbsp;
been around for a long time now and grew into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:30.000
leader of hilltop r.i.p tara and say it ain't so&nbsp;
it's stick boy henry tennis years after carol lost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.160
sofia she's right back here again so now in season&nbsp;
10 our group is at the mercy of the whisperers for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.000
now they seem to have a cold war standoff kind of&nbsp;
tense peace but more bad things start happening is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.920
this coincidence or is it the whisperers leads&nbsp;
to unrest in the community silence the whispers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:48.480
graffiti a lot of this hate is unfairly directed&nbsp;
at lydia so she goes to another outcast for advice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.400
it's negan yes he's allowed out of his cell these&nbsp;
days for good behavior and he really befriends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.720
lydia here becomes her uncle negan one night some&nbsp;
people try to kill lydia but negan's there to save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:01.040
her unfortunately he pushed this one way too hard&nbsp;
and killed her that definitely violates his parole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.600
the council votes to finally just execute him but&nbsp;
before they can someone's let him out of his cell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.880
negan is friggin once again and now he goes to&nbsp;
alpha like hey they were going to execute me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.200
let me join you although negan's not a good&nbsp;
fit for the whisperers this guy really loves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.000
to hear himself talk back at alexandria there's&nbsp;
a new baby yes it's rosita's she's dating father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.640
gabriel these days and somewhere along the line he&nbsp;
became kind of a badass but father gabriel is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.040
the father it's actually siddique who rosita was&nbsp;
dating before him he's alexandria's doctor and a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.960
real good guy but he's been having ptsd lately&nbsp;
because he was with the whisperers when they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.960
beheaded everyone and made him watch luckily a new&nbsp;
doctor joined the group this nice guy dante who's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.560
here to help out but when dante comes to comfort&nbsp;
him he does the tongue click tick which sadiq&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:45.200
remembers the whisperer that was holding him down&nbsp;
also did dante's an undercover whisperer and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.200
kills him are a piece of deak one day this season&nbsp;
michonne meets this guy virgil who's like hey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.080
i've got an island off the coast with a bunch of&nbsp;
weapons that can help you fight the whisperers but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.160
long story short he has no weapons he's crazy but&nbsp;
michonne does find a cell phone that apparently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.880
belongs to rick grimes the first clue they've had&nbsp;
in all this time so michonne says goodbye to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:06.720
stepdaughter judith and her and rick's son rick jr&nbsp;
all so cute mama's going back into badass mode to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.920
bring your daddy home and so michonne leaves the&nbsp;
show to go find rick which now just leaves bffs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.760
daryl and carol as the last two standing from&nbsp;
the first three seasons this season carol wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.200
revenge on alpha for killing henry and makes some&nbsp;
pretty reckless moves while trying to kill her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.080
one day she chases alpha who leads our group down&nbsp;
into a mine shaft where she is hiding her massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.920
zombie horde our group finds the exit but carol&nbsp;
plants some dynamite which does not destroy the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.000
herd but does trap magna and connie this is sad&nbsp;
for daryl he and connie had been really hitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.440
it off she does make it out by the end of the&nbsp;
season but our group doesn't find her yet and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:40.800
now finally the time has come alpha's unleashing&nbsp;
her full horde whisperer negan has quickly risen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.960
the ranks in fact one day she's like hey man want&nbsp;
a bang he's like well it's been a while i'm in but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.280
tell me you're taking the zombie mask off and she&nbsp;
does not so yeah that happens and now it's time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:54.080
for the battle of hilltop the commander is aaron&nbsp;
yeah remember nerdy justin timberlake well he lost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:58.720
a boyfriend then lost an arm so he's had a drastic&nbsp;
transformation now with a sexy apocalypse beard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.200
and a medieval weapon for an arm and yeah without&nbsp;
guns our group goes full game of thrones they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.320
putting up a valiant fight but the whispers make&nbsp;
tree sap bombs and leave hilltop a smoking ruin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.320
after the battle alpha finally lets her guard&nbsp;
down around which is just what he was waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:18.400
for because negan oh assassinates alpha sorry&nbsp;
girl you're kinda hot but you're too crazy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:23.760
he delivers her head to the person who let him out&nbsp;
of a cell just for this purpose it's carol yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.920
this was part of her long game to finally avenge&nbsp;
henry and negan was hoping to earn some points on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.680
his redemption arc so he could be an accepted part&nbsp;
of the group anyone who was there will never fully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:36.160
forgive him but at least they accept he's on their&nbsp;
side for now but alpha had a right-hand man this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:41.920
giant beta who is an absolute monster so he rounds&nbsp;
up the zombie horde and is coming for revenge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.640
it's the whisperers round two beta boogaloo&nbsp;
he goes into alexandria with no resistance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.480
our group evacuated to a more defensible location&nbsp;
pretty soon he tracks them down and so they make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.640
their final stand things look bleak but some&nbsp;
reinforcements arrived who's this crazy ninja&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:59.520
guy in a mask turns out he's a new friend of&nbsp;
maggie yes she's back on the show it's a long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.480
story short daryl kills beta and they lead the&nbsp;
horde off a cliff the whisperers are defeated but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.080
life goes on there's always new problems eugene&nbsp;
had been reaching out on the radio looking for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:12.320
other communities and one day someone answers and&nbsp;
it sounds like a hot girl yeah eugene has a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.720
radio girlfriend stephanie and they make plans to&nbsp;
meet up so he recruits a few chaperones into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.680
booty call crew along the way they meet a zany new&nbsp;
character princess who is a little bit crazy but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:26.400
very nice and friendly but eugene's lady love does&nbsp;
not arrive instead our group's ambushed by a bunch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.520
of stormtroopers what they're taken prisoner by&nbsp;
this advanced new group maggie has some troubles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.840
of her own she's on the run from a group called&nbsp;
the reapers and when she sees that negan is out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.400
of his cell she is not happy about that because of&nbsp;
course he killed her husband glenn but negan these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.040
