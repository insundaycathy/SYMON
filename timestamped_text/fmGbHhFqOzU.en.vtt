00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.670
Welcome back for another 5 minute movie recap.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.200
Today, I'm going to give you an overview of
the 2020 American science fiction action horror

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.240
film called 'Underwater'.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.460
The film is directed by William Eubank.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.110
The story follows a group of employees on
a drilling facility at the bottom of the ocean.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.310
While they are in the deep ocean waters, they
come into contact with dangerous unidentified

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.060
creatures, after the facility is destroyed
by an earthquake.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.660
Warning: there will be spoilers ahead, so
please proceed with caution.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.940
A powerful earthquake strikes Kepler 822,
a Tian Industries research and drilling station

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.230
near the Mariana Trench's bottom.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.899
As the quake destroys parts of the facility,
mechanical engineer Norah Price and her coworkers

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.120
Rodrigo and Paul make their way to the escape
pod bay.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.380
However, when the three arrive, they discover
that all of the escape pods have already been

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.350
released, with Captain Lucien being the only
person in the vicinity.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.730
They arrive at a control base and discover
scientist Emily Haversham and engineer Liam

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.030
Smith, who are unable to communicate with
the surface.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.629
Lucien proposes walking one mile across the
ocean floor to Roebuck 641 and attempting

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.590
to resurface from there using pressurised
suits.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.650
Rodrigo's faulty helmet implodes under the
water pressure as they descend in a freight

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.040
elevator.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.890
Smith and Paul go to investigate when the
remaining crew notices a distress beacon from

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.120
one of the escape pods below.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.211
When they arrive, they discover a corpse in
the ruins.

00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:24.030
A monster rises from the rear of the corpse
and strikes.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.020
Smith dispatches the monster and brings it
inside.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.320
Haversham studies the creature and discovers
that it is a previously unknown species.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.640
The five navigate their way to the ocean floor,
when Kepler bursts above them, nearly burying

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.320
them in debris.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.440
Smith is injured, but Price and Lucien come
to his aid.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.980
They pass via an access tunnel and arrive
at an intermediate station, where they may

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.310
charge and clean their suits.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.910
Smith's oxygen scrubber, on the other hand,
has been severely damaged by the debris.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.450
Paul is ambushed by an unknown monster while
passing via the access tunnel, pulled underwater,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.820
and murdered.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.880
Before leaving the access tunnel, the crew
discovers that Smith's broken oxygen pod would

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.080
cause him to suffocate from the poisonous
gases of the explosion.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.649
Price, Lucien, and Haversham agree to assist
Smith in walking since they do not want to

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.799
leave another crew member behind.

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.170
The four head out over the ocean floor, but
Smith is dragged into a cave by a humanoid

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.300
monster.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.060
Lucien frees Smith, but is separated from
the other three.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.319
Price is pulled along with Lucien, but Lucien
sacrifices himself to keep Price safe from

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.400
the growing pressure disparity.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.450
Price finds herself alone at the abandoned
Shepard station.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.540
She searches Lucien's locker and discovers
a pentagram sketched on an old schematic of

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.709
the original drilling location.

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.400
Price is able to repair her broken diving
suit before continuing on her way to Roebuck.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.230
She reunites with Haversham and Smith while
walking down the ocean floor and assists in

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.740
the drag of Smith.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.909
They try to slip past a nest of humanoid monsters
dangling from the ceiling as they enter Roebuck.

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.329
The animals are awakened by the sound of Haversham's
oxygen alarm.

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.129
Price gets half eaten by one of the creatures,
but she frees herself by killing it with her

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.659
flare pistol while inside its body.

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.549
She launches another flare into the distance
and discovers that the creatures are the offspring

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.709
of an old gigantic entity known as Cthulhu.

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.150
When the three get at the escape pod bay,
Price learns that only two of the pods are

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.150
operational.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.189
Price and Haversham load the sick Smith into
a pod, and Price convinces Haversham to take

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:17.580
the final one.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.799
In the meanwhile, Cthulhu appears and assaults
the Roebuck, while the lesser monsters follow

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.739
the two escape pods.

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.269
Accepting her fate, Price causes an overcharge
of the nuclear core of the Roebuck, leading

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.389
in a huge explosion that destroys her, Cthulhu,
and the monsters.

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.980
The escape pods make it safely to the surface.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.090
Tian Industries has refused to cooperate with
the inquiries into the events and is planning

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.370
to extend its drilling activities.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.370
There is also an alternate ending, in which
they overload the core.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.370
Price finds her way to the broken escape pod
and rewires it, leaving just as the Roebuck

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.370
explodes.
