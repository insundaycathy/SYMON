00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.370
If you were forced to participate in an aliens
sick game of who lives and who dies, what

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.620
could you do?

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.750
In this video on Nerd Explains.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.590
I'll tell you how to beat, The Circle.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.870
Very intimidating name by the way.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:18.870
The Circle.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.189
I’m going to throw us onto one of the red
circles and see how we fare.

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.550
We don’t have perfect knowledge and we don’t
know how this ends, we know what the characters

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.169
know at the start.

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.949
Can we beat this situation?

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.870
Let’s find out.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.280
For some reason we wake up before everyone
else, maybe we’re more immune to alien tranquilizers

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:50.200
than everyone else, idk.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.910
All we remember is running from alien ships
before we blacked out and were tractor beamed

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.140
into the ship.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.410
We're in a circular room with a bunch of strangers.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.300
There are red circles underneath everyone.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.480
There are arrows pointing to each person,
and a black half dome in the middle of the

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.480
room.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.480
We can’t see the rest of the room, it’s
too dark.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.080
There isn’t much to go off of at this point.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.930
It’s best just to hang out and see what
happens.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.690
Everyone is still standing but asleep, until
a lady wakes up.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.590
She’s pretty bewildered and tries to step
off her red circle.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:35.900
Nope, gets a nice warning buzzer that’d
make Dennis Reynolds flinch.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.710
She tries to touch another person, same thing.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.110
Another woman wakes up, freaks out, steps
off her red circle, and the black thing in

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.710
the middle of the room shocks her with a red
energy beam, dropping her to the floor unconscious.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.220
It might be a non-lethal taser, but we get
a look at the lady who was beamed, and there’s

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.680
blood coming out of her eye.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.720
I’m not a doctor, but I think that means
either she’s dead or she coincidentally

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.020
suffers from haemolacria like the bond villain
in Casino Royale.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.750
We’re gonna go with her being dead though.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.430
This is weird because the first woman tested
these boundaries and wasn’t killed.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.350
She was warned by a buzzer.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.520
The second woman to awake was killed immediately
when she stepped off.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.470
Why was the first woman spared but not the
second.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.390
It’s possible this alien thing only allotted
the entire group 1 warning for breaking a

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.720
rule of touching and moving.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.689
A loud buzzer goes off and wakes everyone
up.

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.120
A dude freaks out, starts to run, and gets
blasted.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.730
It’s pretty clear that we need to keep our
hands and feet inside the circle at all times.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.549
From what we can tell, there are fifty participants
with sparse recollection of how and why they

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.930
are at the circle, other than they were running
from alien ships of course.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.409
You have all races, ages, classes, disabilities,
professions, pregnancy statuses, etc.

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.640
I’d say it’s too random to be random.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.439
Everyone here was probably chosen purposefully
because they are distinct from the other people

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.439
in some way.

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:13.639
A beeping countdown sounds off, and the plasma
globe in the middle of the room kills another

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.920
person, seemingly at random.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.819
There’s no way this is random though, what’s
the point of it being random.

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.370
We inevitably realize that our hands are changing
what arrow is lit up on the floor, and that

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.290
closing our hands confirms our selection by
evidence of a distinct beep noise.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.480
These arrows are pointing to other people.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.659
It’s a voting mechanism for who gets lasered
next.

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:44.049
We can only see and control our vote, so we
don’t know who other people are voting for.

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.680
After two minutes pass, another person is
zapped, the person with the most votes.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.150
It doesn’t take a psychologist to realize
that this situation will devolve into discrimination,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.450
tribalism, and manipulation.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.859
It’s probably best we stay quiet.

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.459
Once people realize that their vote kills
people, anything we say or do will be used

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.919
against us.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.810
People will look for any reason to take us
out.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.700
Just like with the police, it’s best we
keep our mouth shut and not incriminate ourselves.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.920
This is not the time or place to go on a political
or ideological rant as we’d probably just

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.320
piss people off and make enemies.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.280
We should also avoid lying unless we have
to.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.420
It’s better to stay quiet than to lie, but
if we’re pressed, it’s better to lie than

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.790
to admit to something that damns us.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.510
If we did commit a crime in the past, and
the cop in the room does try to get us targeted

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:47.510
to save his own ass, just deny everything,
nobody can prove anything.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.760
Stick to lies about opinions that nobody can
disprove, if we have an unpopular opinion,

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.350
don’t voice that shit.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.280
We later see with one man and woman, falsifying
a marriage might sound like a decent idea.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.150
I mean, who would want to kill someone in
front of their wife or husband?

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.840
The problem is that it’s a giant, unmanageable
lie.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.880
If anyone gets suspicious of us and questions
both of us, we’ll easily get found out.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.310
Someone just has to ask, what year did you
both meet, say it at the same time on the

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.310
count of 3.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.070
We’ll most likely answer differently.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.440
If we get found out for lying, our chances
of being marked for death goes through the

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.590
roof.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.590
Surviving this game is obviously going to
be heavily dependent on carefully choosing

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.990
the words that come out of our mouth, or whether
we say anything at all.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.520
The group begins choosing who lives and who
dies in order to buy them time to figure out

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.000
what to do, starting with the elderly, two
minutes a pop.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.650
People with perceived low value, or people
that are at the last rungs of their life will

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.280
be the first to go.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.580
If you are elderly, look sickly, don’t speak
the common language, have criminal looking

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.390
tattoos, your chances of surviving go way
down.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.300
If you are a child or pregnant, your chances
probably go up.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.190
We can’t exactly control these things though.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.800
This alien energy orb in the middle of the
room is killing another person every 2 minutes.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.720
At fifty people in the room, that gives us
100 minutes before everyone is dead.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.580
Not a lot of time.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.810
Maybe if we can understand what’s going
on, the motivations behind it, a potential

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.080
goal the alien’s might have, we can find
a way out of this in time.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.670
Other participants try to find out more info
about each other in hopes that they can understand

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.900
how things are related and why they were chosen.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:43.990
This part of the movie made me want to ram
my head through a wall.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.630
You are on the clock, spit it the fuck out
beth.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:54.220
*Tropic thunder spit that shit out man* Go
wahoos?

00:06:54.220 --> 00:07:07.710
Are you fucking kidding me, people are going
to die based on time you take and the words

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:13.860
you need to be carefully and quickly selecting,
and you chose the most valueless mix of sounds

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.880
to contribute?

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.460
I’m not entirely sure nobody voted that
round..

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.770
The best thing we can do is to contribute
something about our abduction, or about the

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.240
rules of the game.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.800
We’d provide value, humanize ourselves,
but we won’t reveal anything personal that

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.560
people can use against us.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.110
Ya know, like saying you know another person
because you’re cheating on your wife with

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:50.640
them, it’s just, like why say that, just
keep that to yourselves man.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.870
Keeping quiet only helps us avoid being aggressively
targeted.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:08:00.090
The opposite is also true though, if we are
quiet and unhelpful, we can be targeted because

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:04.430
the group doesn’t see that we’re providing
any contribution or value towards solving

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.430
the problem.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.630
We need to humanize ourselves or else we’ll
be easier to kill.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.940
If we are tied with someone else, and we have
humanized ourselves more, contributed more

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.450
valuable things, we are less likely to be
killed.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:19.230
Seeing the aesthetic of the room, the voting
mechanism, it’s pretty reasonable to assume

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:24.220
that this is some form of game, experiment,
or intelligently designed means of selection.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:29.510
I mean, why set up a situation like this if
you were simply going to exterminate everyone.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:34.310
We can probably rule out the circle as a means
of selection based on the randomness and lack

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:36.570
of clarity around the rules.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.939
If people are killed based on the flip of
a coin or because they happened to be the

00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:45.440
first person to break an obscure rule that
nobody knew, how good can the selection be.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.050
I mean shit, even Jigsaw announced his rules
upfront.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:55.089
This also means there is no strategy that
needs to rely on merit or morals.

00:08:55.089 --> 00:08:56.089
Sweet.

00:08:56.089 --> 00:08:59.699
If you thought sacrificing yourselves was
a possible way to win the game by showing

00:08:59.699 --> 00:09:04.560
that you won’t devolve into indignity, it’s
most likely not.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.779
Later on this is somewhat confirmed, as we
didn’t see anyone beam up to heaven to smoke

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:22.449
weed with James Franco for sacrificing themself.

00:09:22.449 --> 00:09:27.210
We can’t rule out this whole thing being
an experiment, but it would suck as lab rats

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.360
don’t often regain their freedom.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.420
The other option is that this is some form
of game.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.980
Regardless, we need to test the game or experiment
to find out what all the rules or parameters

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.980
are.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:43.410
We need to make public suggestions to try
new strategies that could help us understand

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.720
how to beat the game.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.249
Again, this is when speaking up can make us
valuable and humanize us more.

00:09:49.249 --> 00:09:53.740
Let’s just quickly run through a myriad
of potential strategies.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.490
What if nobody votes?

00:09:55.490 --> 00:10:00.490
All the voting lights lit up in a unique way
indicating that everyone successfully didn’t

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.490
vote.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.730
Unfortunately, this didn’t stop the killings.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.000
Someone at random was shocked at the end of
the round.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.420
What about voting for an empty spot from a
previously killed person?

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.050
Nope, someone at random was killed again.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.949
What if everyone votes for themselves?

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:21.459
You can’t, it just automatically selects
the next spot to your left or right.

00:10:21.459 --> 00:10:26.370
You can however, step off your red circle
to sacrifice yourselves, if that’s your

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.370
thing.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:31.790
Doing so will reset the 2 minute countdown
until someone is to be lasered again.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:36.740
What if everyone votes for the person to their
right, equal votes for everyone forcing an

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.250
all participant tie?

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.980
Well, we actually don’t know what would
happen.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:46.029
A guy defected and chose a pregnant woman
instead of the person to his right.

00:10:46.029 --> 00:10:50.910
Another person saw this and voted for that
guy, forcing a tie between a man and a pregnant

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.910
woman.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.420
They revoted and killed the guy who defected,
breaking the tie.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:00.829
It’s fair to assume that if this strategy
was successful, they’d all tie.

00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:06.189
As we found out, if a tie occurs and isn't
broken, everyone tied will be killed.

00:11:06.189 --> 00:11:09.949
It’s probably a good thing they didn’t
try this again.

00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:15.160
Based on our previous failed strategies, and
the rules we discovered, the circle does allow

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.749
for a scenario where one person can survive.

00:11:18.749 --> 00:11:23.579
If it comes down to two remaining people,
and one person doesn’t vote while the other

00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:31.519
does vote, or if one person sacrifices themself,
the next round will consist of only one survivor.

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:37.019
Since you can’t vote for yourselves, and
nobody can vote for you, the last person might

00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:38.120
not be killed.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.279
Sure, we could end up lasered even as the
last remaining person, but it’s a Pascal's

00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:48.720
Wager type situation where the only reasonable
assumption and action to take is the one where

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.249
we have a possibility of surviving.

00:11:51.249 --> 00:11:55.269
We can only assume that this is a last man
standing type game.

00:11:55.269 --> 00:12:00.459
At this point we might want to consider if
we want to win, or if we can live with ourselves

00:12:00.459 --> 00:12:02.050
if we do win.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.519
Most likely, at some point, we’ll have to
vote out and kill a child.

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:09.450
And you thought Monopoly ruined families and
friendships.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.730
But as they say, don’t hate the player,
hate the game.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:17.990
Let’s say we want to win, and be the sole
survivor no matter the cost.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:22.329
In order to do that, the game needs to come
down to two people at the end that won’t

00:12:22.329 --> 00:12:23.329
tie each other.

00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:25.760
It’s a type of Prisoner’s Dilemma.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.779
If both people vote for each other, they both
die.

00:12:28.779 --> 00:12:34.279
If nobody votes, it’s a 50/50 that we die,
which is still unpreferable.

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:39.990
The only way that we can 100% survive is if
the other person doesn’t vote while we vote

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.230
for them.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.060
Who wouldn’t vote though?

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:49.740
A person that is inclined to sacrifice themself,
like Shaun, an elderly or sickly person.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:54.899
The problem is that they will most likely
be voted out early on, so suggesting a voting

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:57.730
direction that spares them won’t work.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.110
What about someone that we can fool into not
voting.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:06.190
The Circle is similar to a game called, So
Long Sucker, where the only way to win is

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.279
by eliminating other players through deceit
and betrayal.

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:15.629
Like in So Long Sucker, eliminating enemies
isn’t as important as propping up gullible

00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:19.740
allies that you can betray more easily in
the endgame.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.110
This is true in the circle as well.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:27.360
In order to fool someone into not voting,
that person has to be gullible enough to believe

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.379
that we will sacrifice ourselves for them,
and that they don’t need to vote as we’ll

00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:35.379
step off our circle to be lasered voluntarily.

00:13:35.379 --> 00:13:38.829
Of course, we aren’t going to sacrifice
ourselves.

00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:44.639
As the countdown draws down, we distract them
with some emotional last words, we fake stepping

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:50.540
off our circle, then at the last second, we
cast our vote for them, causing them to be

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.100
killed off leaving us as the sole survivor.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.970
Who would genuinely believe that we’d sacrifice
ourselves for them?

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:02.980
It has to be a person that most people wouldn’t
question sacrificing themselves for.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.059
Like, a pregnant woman or child.

00:14:05.059 --> 00:14:11.649
I know, I know, it’s fucked up, but I already
said that winning this game comes at a cost,

00:14:11.649 --> 00:14:14.339
and whether you’re willing to pay it is
up to you.

00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:19.230
I'm not saying pregnant women or children
are inherently more gullible.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:23.459
I’m saying that they are gullible because
it’s normal and generally accepted that

00:14:23.459 --> 00:14:29.399
people should sacrifice themselves for children
or pregnant women in a lifeboat scenario.

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:33.610
To put it in perspective, it would be much
harder to convince the discount version of

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.930
Jordan Belfort that you'll sacrifice yourselves
for him.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:42.850
He has no reason to believe or trust you,
why on Earth would someone sacrifice themself

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.160
for that person.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.970
They are arrogant, but they know it’s against
the norm for people to sacrifice for them.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.629
Hopefully I'm making sense here.

00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:55.439
They are gullible because it’s a cultural
norm for people to sacrifice themselves for

00:14:55.439 --> 00:15:00.029
them, and they are more likely to falsely
trust you based on this.

00:15:00.029 --> 00:15:04.660
This game is as much about sociopathic charisma
as anything.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.999
Once the game comes down to us and that other
person, we have to turn the emotional knob

00:15:08.999 --> 00:15:09.999
up.

00:15:09.999 --> 00:15:14.769
We need to distract them by telling an earnest
but untrue story about how we’ve lived a

00:15:14.769 --> 00:15:19.809
lot of life, and that we’re okay with her
living so the baby can have a chance at life

00:15:19.809 --> 00:15:20.809
too.

00:15:20.809 --> 00:15:24.451
Maybe a story about how we shouldn’t be
the survivor, as we’ve killed someone in

00:15:24.451 --> 00:15:29.070
a drunk driving accident a couple years ago
and that we’re honestly not that great of

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.120
a person.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.749
Like faking a come to jesus moment where we
are okay with letting go of life.

00:15:34.749 --> 00:15:39.129
Tell her she needs to promise to make the
best of things, and make sure her kid has

00:15:39.129 --> 00:15:40.629
a great life.

00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:45.749
Ask her what she’s going to name her kid,
get her mind off of any need to vote.

00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:47.540
If it’s a kid, do something similar.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:52.379
They have a lot of life to live, we’ve already
lived enough and want to give them a chance,

00:15:52.379 --> 00:15:53.489
yadda yadda.

00:15:53.489 --> 00:15:57.720
We’re essentially re-affirming that they
don’t need to vote as we’re going to sacrifice

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.009
ourselves for them.

00:15:59.009 --> 00:16:04.360
It also helps that earlier on we set the groundwork
for this and earned their trust, which I'll

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.060
come back to in a bit.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:10.579
This sounds like a nifty plan, but how do
we ensure that the game comes down to us and

00:16:10.579 --> 00:16:13.660
someone else we can fool into not voting.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.360
Suggest a voting direction that spares them.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.009
Most people would probably agree with us and
nobody can paint us as being selfish and predatory.

00:16:21.009 --> 00:16:26.079
We also earn trust points with the child or
pregnant woman that will be important once

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:29.529
it comes down to them and us, like we talked
about earlier.

00:16:29.529 --> 00:16:33.689
While there is likely to be conflict with
this suggestion, it’s our best bet at getting

00:16:33.689 --> 00:16:35.660
a majority to spare them.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:42.529
We absolutely do not want the game to come
down to us and sweater vest, he will 100%

00:16:42.529 --> 00:16:46.160
vote for us and cause a tie, getting both
of us killed.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.459
Hopefully we’ve effectively swayed enough
votes in favor of protecting the child or

00:16:50.459 --> 00:16:51.790
pregnant woman.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:55.889
There are still a lot of people left though,
so how do we ensure that we make it to the

00:16:55.889 --> 00:16:57.100
final round.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:02.870
There are some important, albeit counter-intuitive,
aspects of the So Long Sucker game that can

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.530
be applied to the Circle.

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:08.620
Overtly trying to win is actually an effective
way to lose.

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:13.919
If we are found to have gamed, betrayed anyone,
or have a strong potential to influence the

00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:18.829
direction of the game, we will be targeted
as a predator that needs to be eliminated

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:21.100
in order to level the playing field.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:27.130
This is why we don’t want to assume any
leadership positions, just make light-handed

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.130
suggestions.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:32.269
Trying to develop a super-strategy that plans
ahead of everyone’s moves and outmaneuvers

00:17:32.269 --> 00:17:35.779
everyone is hopeless, given the complexity
of the game.

00:17:35.779 --> 00:17:41.279
There are too many interactions between people
with dynamic psychologies and backgrounds,

00:17:41.279 --> 00:17:45.049
too much of the game depends on randomness
and unknown rules.

00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:48.700
We can’t compute the possible plays of everyone.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:54.010
If we try, we’re likely to get too aggressive
or make a mistake that reveals us as trying

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.950
to game everyone else.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:02.130
The next best thing to do is give others enough
room to make mistakes, or more realistically,

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.960
enough rope to hang themselves with.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:10.549
People will get aggressive, lash out, prey
on others, say stupid things, discriminate

00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:12.790
in order to save themselves.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:17.360
All of these things are likely to get the
majority to vote for them next.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.850
Probably the best way to ensure we make it
to the final round is to just stay quiet and

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:22.950
reserved.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:28.010
Subtly influencing the group to spare the
pregnant woman or child is the most important

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.140
play.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.280
As the participants get whittled down, our
leverage goes up.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.289
Once it’s down to a handful of people, the
pregnant woman or child, who hopefully trust

00:18:38.289 --> 00:18:43.669
us more than others, will vote in our favor
in order to eliminate anyone they think will

00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:44.970
be selfish.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.750
They know they need someone who is willing
to let them live, so they need to keep us

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:55.010
alive, and will help us vote out anyone else
that will be viewed as more selfish.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.590
This gets us to the final round with them.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:03.700
So to recap, we’ve ensured our survival
by staying relatively quiet, we’ve ensured

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.350
the survival of another person that thinks
we’ll sacrifice ourselves for them, and

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:13.330
now we can hopefully distract them and deceive
them enough to where they don’t vote.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:18.070
Once the countdown draws down, we cast a last
minute vote, killing them.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:23.159
Once we get returned to Earth, we will probably
want to go see a therapist and get some anti-depressant

00:19:23.159 --> 00:19:24.330
medication.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.659
But hey, we won.

00:19:26.659 --> 00:19:31.330
If you’ve seen the movie, this is pretty
much what Eric does in order to win.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.640
From what I can tell, it’s the only way.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.580
It’s by no means a surefire way to win.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.899
You still have a super low chance of winning
despite all of these strategies and tactics.

00:19:40.899 --> 00:19:44.669
There are too many dynamic variables and things
out of your control.

00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:50.030
These people had 100 minutes to figure this
out after being abducted, drugged, and chaotically

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.100
forced into a life and death game.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:56.220
I’m almost certain I would die if placed
in the same circumstances.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:01.520
I’m pretty sure I either over-thought this
or missed something completely.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.870
If you have a better suggestion for winning
the death game in the Circle, i’d love to

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.010
hear about it so please leave a comment.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:18.870
Thanks for watching, see ya later.
