00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.080
﻿If your ‘friend’ led you into an uncharted&nbsp;
cave inhabited by man-eating half-humans,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.640
what would you do?
In this How to Beat video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.160
we’ll follow the amateur cavers,&nbsp;
see if we can make better decisions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.360
and ultimately attempt to beat the&nbsp;
Crawlers in, The Descent. 
&nbsp;

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.360
Think you can do better, let us know in the&nbsp;
comments! Enjoy these How to Beat videos,&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.360
Let’s get to it.
We start out following&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.240
three sassy adventurous ladies white water&nbsp;
rafting. After they break through the rapids,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.280
Paul shares a moment with Juno before driving home&nbsp;
with his wife and daughter. He starts daydreaming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.480
about slowly taking off Juno’s wetsuit while&nbsp;
behind the wheel, and veers out of his lane.
&nbsp;

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.400
That was some final destination shit. Paul may&nbsp;
have cheated death prior to this, but honestly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.720
it was straight up his fault for daydreaming&nbsp;
about checking out his wife’s friend. He should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.560
have saved those thoughts for later when his&nbsp;
wife and kids weren’t in the car with him. 
&nbsp;

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.040
Still, who the hell thought strapping an open&nbsp;
PVC pipe to their roof and loading it with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.200
a bunch of copper rods was a good idea.&nbsp;
They’re definitely getting charged with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.160
manslaughter for catapulting half a dozen metal&nbsp;
javelins through Paul and Jessica’s faces.
&nbsp;

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.600
Sarah wakes up in a hospital bed clueless as to&nbsp;
what happened. She rips off all the wires, tubes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.080
and gadgets she’s hooked up to so she can wander&nbsp;
the hospital to find someone who can bring her up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.720
to speed. I think they have little buttons on&nbsp;
the beds that alert the staff. You could just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:03.840
push that and not rip out all the important&nbsp;
stuff that’s probably keeping you alive.
&nbsp;

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.760
Oh it was a PTSD nightmare. Yah, I&nbsp;
guess it makes sense that you’d be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.360
fairly distraught and impulsive.
Junos gotta be feeling a little guilty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.560
about sending Sarah’s husband&nbsp;
bedroom eyes pre-crash.
&nbsp;

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.360
One year after the ‘incident’, Sarah, Juno,&nbsp;
and Beth get back together to go spelunking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.400
in the Appalachian mountains. They’re joined&nbsp;
by two inexperienced sisters, Sam and Rebecca,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.880
as well as Juno’s half-reckless, adrenaline&nbsp;
junky base jumper friend, Holly.
&nbsp;

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.480
Holly laments that the cave they are to explore is&nbsp;
just a tourist trap and offers no real challenges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.040
and probably has a gift shop in it. I haven’t&nbsp;
read the brochure for the cave-diving adventure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.440
you’re embarking on, but I have read the&nbsp;
synopsis of this movie, and I gotta say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.600
I’m not sure we’re talking&nbsp;
about the same cave.
&nbsp;

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.800
Sarah seems resentful of Juno for ditching&nbsp;
her the day after the crash, as she should be,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.120
and is obviously still traumatized by&nbsp;
the horrific loss of her family. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.480
she’s keeping antidepressants bedside&nbsp;
to cope with her night terrors.
&nbsp;

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.680
All this to say, taking Sarah spelunking with&nbsp;
two noobs being led by the person she resents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.760
who will be encouraged to push their&nbsp;
limits by her adrenaline-addict friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.760
doesn’t seem like the greatest idea.
Maybe it would be okay if the cave was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.080
tourist trap with a gift shop inside, but&nbsp;
I'm going to guess that it’s unmarked or was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.200
sealed up by the locals for a grave&nbsp;
reason that they will ignore.
&nbsp;

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.080
Holly mentions that it’s a level two cave&nbsp;
in the fictional Boreham Caverns. I’m not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.640
sure level 2 is even a thing. What cave&nbsp;
they think they are headed into doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.720
matter because Juno left the guide book in&nbsp;
the glove box for some stupid reason.
&nbsp;

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.640
Worth mentioning that everyone in the group&nbsp;
should have had a copy of the guide book or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.120
map of the cavern they are entering in case&nbsp;
they get separated or lost, or yah know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.920
so they can actually find their way around.
On their 2 mile long hike to the entrance of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.080
the tourist trap, they run into the throat cut&nbsp;
carcass of a bull elk. Nature, or bad omen? 
&nbsp;

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.160
They reach the entrance and everyone&nbsp;
rappels in. Sarah notices what looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.000
like a bloodstained handprint on the&nbsp;
wall and neglects to tell anyone about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.280
it because it’s probably nothing. Just like the&nbsp;
elk was probably just attacked by a bear. 
&nbsp;

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.120
Sarah looked like she was about to get impaled by&nbsp;
a copper rod. I still don’t think bringing a PTSD&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.800
stricken person cave diving was a good idea.
Sam asks which way they need to go next. Juno&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.840
replies that there’s only one way out of this&nbsp;
chamber. Down the pipe. Before hard hostering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.160
her.. ice climbing axe? Why does she have an ice&nbsp;
climbing axe? Why is everyone following someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.240
who brought an ice climbing axe into a cave that&nbsp;
has no ice? If ice climbing axes were required&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.680
tools for this expedition, why is Juno the only&nbsp;
person with one? Not looking good here.
&nbsp;

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.160
You know what would have been a good idea,&nbsp;
bringing ascenders instead of a fucking ice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.120
climbing axe so you can climb out the way you&nbsp;
came in incase the tunnel is blocked, flooded,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.640
your equipment fails, or you run into homicidal&nbsp;
cave gollums. The cave very well could be flooded,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.040
with all the water pouring into it.
I’m also gonna take a hot guess that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.440
didn’t inform the park rangers, let&nbsp;
alone anyone of their plans.
&nbsp;

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.720
Once inside the cave, they light some flares and&nbsp;
hangout for a few. Sarah hears the giggling of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.320
deceased child and wanders off by herself to see&nbsp;
if Jessica got a head start on them. Can’t wait&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.960
to see how she does in the claustrophobic confines&nbsp;
of the next tunnel they have to go through.
&nbsp;

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.800
Not well. Sarah gets stuck, both mentally and&nbsp;
physically. Beth goes back and pretty much does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.520
everything right, tells her to breathe slowly,&nbsp;
cracks some jokes, and tries to lead her out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.840
The problem is that this cave is experiencing&nbsp;
tectonic shifts for some reason.
&nbsp;

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.920
Good thing nobody was on the other&nbsp;
side, or wait, that would be bad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.400
because they didn’t bring any ascenders or&nbsp;
let the park rangers know their whereabouts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.360
According to Juno the only way out is down the&nbsp;
pipe, so going back wasn’t an option anyways.
&nbsp;

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.120
According to the guidebook nobody brought,&nbsp;
which from your memory contradicts what Juno&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.040
said about there being only one way out. You&nbsp;
didn’t say anything at the time, and now you’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.600
here. Turns out, Juno was bullshitting them&nbsp;
and led them down a different unmarked cave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.760
so that everyone would be dependent on her and&nbsp;
she could play the fearless leader role.
&nbsp;

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.960
Needless to say, it backfired hard. 
Leading a group of noobs into an unmarked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.320
unmapped cave that nobody knows you are at, is&nbsp;
unbelievably reckless. The fatal accident in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:42.080
the Nutty Putty Cave serves as a stark warning of&nbsp;
this. Even in well mapped caves, with experienced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.280
cavers who had expert backup, a man still lost&nbsp;
his way and got irretrievably stuck. 
&nbsp;

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.360
The fact that this is an unmapped cave means&nbsp;
that there might not be a way out at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.080
Which means Juno is even more of an idiot,&nbsp;
if that was possible, for not bringing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.200
ascenders to climb out the way they came. 
And Juno was concerned about Holly being reckless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.280
Speaking of, if Holly had experienced Boreham&nbsp;
Caverns previously, she must have known Juno was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.240
leading them elsewhere and didn’t say anything.&nbsp;
Both of you are untrustworthy bitches.
&nbsp;

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.880
Still, it’s not all on Juno and Holly. In&nbsp;
caving, the consequences for entering the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.880
wrong cave are exceedingly high. Everyone&nbsp;
should have been checking their guidebooks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.640
and making sure they were in the right&nbsp;
area and going to the right cave.
&nbsp;

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.480
Juno is right about one thing,&nbsp;
if they stay, they die.
&nbsp;

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.600
While everyone’s fighting, Sarah is&nbsp;
scouting around with her headlamp. 
&nbsp;

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.360
Strange, but she doesn’t say anything.&nbsp;
I could see her passing that off as more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.720
PTSD hallucinations or the darkness playing&nbsp;
tricks on her eyes. The clicking sounds could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.040
be passed off as more bats or something.
The journey deeper into the cave in search of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.080
an exit is halted by a gigantic underground&nbsp;
precipice. Judging by the time it took for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.120
that rock to hit the ground, a fall would&nbsp;
be fatal. Juno pops some flares and spots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.840
a tunnel across the cavern. Could be a dead end,&nbsp;
but they don’t really have any other options.
&nbsp;

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.480
Rebecca volunteers to trad climb the&nbsp;
overhang and rig up a line using cams.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.240
Nice of you to volunteer, and maybe&nbsp;
you are the only trad pro here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.880
but shouldn’t the self-proclaimed badasses&nbsp;
Juno or Holly be the default choice for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.640
this high-risk operation, considering&nbsp;
they got you all into this mess.
&nbsp;

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.480
I’m not a trad climber, but I do rock&nbsp;
climb and have some general experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.600
Firstly, I wouldn’t clip a giant power drill on&nbsp;
my harness when I'm traversing an overhang. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.240
trad gear is heavy enough, and dead hanging&nbsp;
from a ceiling is hard enough. Secondly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.880
some of those cam placements in flared wedges&nbsp;
look a bit sketchy, and she’s not giving them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.200
a tug-check before placing her weight on them.&nbsp;
I get she’s limited on options though.
&nbsp;

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.600
When she goes for her third cam placement,&nbsp;
she finds an old bolt which had to have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.920
placed by a human explorer. Might as well&nbsp;
use it, even though you’ll probably just be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.960
following them to the dead end where they died.&nbsp;
If whoever explored this cavern had made it out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.640
it would have been in the brochure.
I’m sorry, I'm not being optimistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.240
I’m sure that explorer found a&nbsp;
groundbreak just around the bend. 
&nbsp;

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.600
I’d still place my own cam somewhere around it.&nbsp;
Why solely trust your life to an old bolt some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.320
other dumbass who came down here placed. That&nbsp;
was the first bolt she found on the overhang,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.480
meaning the other bolts they placed must have&nbsp;
been shallow and zippered out on a fall.
&nbsp;

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.160
Rebecca makes it across and rigs up&nbsp;
a line that they can shuttle across.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.400
Juno is the last to cross. Instead&nbsp;
of shuttling over like everyone else,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.760
she decides to clean the route in&nbsp;
case they need the gear again.
&nbsp;

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.720
Cleaning the route is a bit risky. Rebecca’s&nbsp;
cams were hastily placed and not to be relied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.800
upon. I think Juno should have shuttled&nbsp;
across, and if they needed the gear again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.560
they could just go back and clean it.&nbsp;
This play does put you on the wrong side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.640
of another tunnel collapse though. 
Juno’s struggling hard, looks like we’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.840
going to be finding out if those cam&nbsp;
placements were solid or not.
&nbsp;

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.960
What the hell was Rebecca doing? There is no&nbsp;
reason the rope should have slipped her hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.040
like that. I don’t think her figure 8 belay&nbsp;
device was set up properly, it doesn't look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.000
like the rope was looped around its neck. That&nbsp;
and her hand wasn’t in the brake position, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.040
it should have been. Her belay gloves also suck&nbsp;
because that little amount of rope slip caused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.800
enough friction burn to cut straight through&nbsp;
her hand forcing her to dump the rope.
&nbsp;

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.520
I want to say Juno was lucky she&nbsp;
wasn’t also relying on Rebecca’s cams,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.520
but I don’t think that bolt is any better.
&nbsp;

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.480
Hey, at least you got your gear back.
Further into the cavern they find a mural. How did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.040
the homo-sapien artist get up there to paint it,&nbsp;
that’s like 20 feet up on a smooth wall.  
&nbsp;

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.080
Beth remarks that it’s a map.&nbsp;
There’s the mountain they’re under,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.080
with the cave they are in and two exits.&nbsp;
I think that’s a bit of a stretch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.720
Even if it’s a map and there is an exit, there’s&nbsp;
no directions as to where the exit is.
&nbsp;

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:02.080
Nobody notices Smeagol trailing them, so they&nbsp;
blindly march onwards only to end up at a fork in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:07.600
the cave. Juno, using her lighter as a barometer,&nbsp;
catches an air current in one of the passages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.760
which means it likely leads to the surface.&nbsp;
At least she’s a clever idiot.
&nbsp;

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.160
Holly, mistakes phosphorescent rock&nbsp;
for daylight, takes the idiot baton&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:23.840
from Juno and sprints down the corridor and&nbsp;
falls into the mouth of another cave.
&nbsp;

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.960
You dumb bitch. Escaping these tunnels would have&nbsp;
been hard enough in full health. Now they have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.800
haul you and your broken leg around too.
At least they brought someone along with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.480
medical training. Well, she’s&nbsp;
a med student, so barely. 
&nbsp;

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:51.040
Sam has everyone hoist Holly out of the water and&nbsp;
v. Getting her out of the water mostly helps them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.760
check for blood loss. Aligning the bone most&nbsp;
likely wasn’t necessary. Her leg could have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.480
been immobilized in its current position and&nbsp;
manipulating her leg just caused more pain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.840
writhing, and damage. It does provide&nbsp;
a strong dramatic effect though.
&nbsp;

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.440
Meanwhile, Sarah is tripping balls playing hide&nbsp;
and seek with her dead daughter. She finds an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:20.320
old rusty miner’s helmet which must have&nbsp;
belonged to whoever put that bolt in.
&nbsp;

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.640
Looks like he’s not doing so well. Of&nbsp;
course nobody believes her. Why would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.320
they? It sounds psychotic and Sarah’s&nbsp;
been known to have hallucinations.
&nbsp;

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:34.400
Sarah has the total opposite reaction that I would&nbsp;
expect. She wants to see if that man-thing she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.360
saw could help them find a way out. I don’t even&nbsp;
know what to say to that. If I was in this group,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.760
and someone told me that, sure I wouldn’t&nbsp;
believe them, but I’m going to place myself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.080
in the middle of the pack just in case.
The crew continues to follow the air current,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.400
which leads to a room filled with the&nbsp;
bones of dead animals, and probably some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.880
humans. I’d say this is ample supporting&nbsp;
evidence for Sarah’s monster-sighting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.400
Best start fashioning weapons out of the&nbsp;
bones and anything else you can find.
&nbsp;

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.360
Juno can’t find a breeze and doesn’t&nbsp;
know which way they need to go,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.520
so Sam and the others start yelling for&nbsp;
help like imbeciles. Yah, good idea,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.880
let’s attract the thing that’s slaughtered&nbsp;
hundreds of animals that were bigger,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.840
stronger, faster, and let’s be&nbsp;
honest, smarter than you.
&nbsp;

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.360
Finding the way out is your last priority&nbsp;
right now. The exit could be a mile from here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.000
or nonexistent. The last thing you want to do&nbsp;
is line up in a single file in a confined space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.520
with these things attacking you. It would&nbsp;
be better to all band up in the middle of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.760
the room with weapons in hand. You probably&nbsp;
don’t want to get up next to the wall with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:46.720
them climbing around like spider-monkeys.
Wow, literally nobody stayed together. Now they’re&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.680
all easy targets to get picked off one by one.&nbsp;
Juno puts up a hell of a fight against 2 of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.320
gollums, and shanks one of them dead with her ice&nbsp;
axe. Who knew that thing would come in handy.
&nbsp;

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.920
Beth runs back to help Juno, but&nbsp;
Juno’s in full rage mode.
&nbsp;

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.600
Probably shouldn’t have snuck up behind&nbsp;
someone who just fought to the death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.400
So many movies do the whole, friendlies almost&nbsp;
kill each other, thing, but back down before a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.720
fatal blow it dealt. I’m glad this movie&nbsp;
took it there, because realistically,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.760
friendly fire happens a lot more&nbsp;
than we’d like to admit.
&nbsp;

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.480
Rebecca’s headlamp ran out of battery. Apparently&nbsp;
she decided that instead of packing spare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.520
batteries, she’d just bring a giant glow stick&nbsp;
that’s totally useless at lighting up the cave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.520
So useless, that she unwittingly walked&nbsp;
right under another crawler.
&nbsp;

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.600
Now that there’s a lull in the violence and the&nbsp;
crawlers are distracted eating your friend.. 
&nbsp;

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.600
..it’s a good time to assess their strengths&nbsp;
and weaknesses. Strengths: Fast, good climbers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.800
sharp teeth, sneaky. Weaknesses: They don’t&nbsp;
see so good, or Sarah would be dead.
&nbsp;

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.800
Basically, shut the fuck up, pick up&nbsp;
something you can use as a weapon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.600
and no, the glow stick doesn’t count, try to&nbsp;
find your friends, try not to get separated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.880
from your friends, then try to quietly find a way&nbsp;
out. The boneyard is proof that there is.
&nbsp;

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.440
If you’re feeling frisky, and a couple of you&nbsp;
are together and have fashioned a shiv out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.320
animal bones, you can bait the creatures in front&nbsp;
of you by tossing stones, then spear them through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:21.840
the neck or chest. Sounds dangerous, but it’s&nbsp;
better to be the hunter than the hunted. 
&nbsp;

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.160
Or you could spoon each other in a corner&nbsp;
while crying in hopes that your ‘friends’&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.320
make a noise which distracts the monsters long&nbsp;
enough for you to attempt an escape. 
&nbsp;

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.600
Oh now everyone pulls out&nbsp;
their ice axes and knives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.680
where were those when you first got attacked?
&nbsp;

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.240
Sarah also uses her friend's unintentional&nbsp;
diversion to spark up a fire torch out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.800
an old oil can on the ground. Clever, but&nbsp;
I'm not going to award her any points for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.760
this. Having to be resourceful because of your&nbsp;
piss poor planning means you’re still an idiot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.080
Any caver worth their salt would tell you to bring&nbsp;
a couple spare sets of batteries at least.
&nbsp;

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.960
Rebecca and Sam are trying to link&nbsp;
up with the rest of their group.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:20.080
Difficult when you can’t make any sound.
Fuck yah. Honestly, these things aren’t that hard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:25.200
to kill if you can group up on them. I say sitting&nbsp;
on my comfy couch in an air conditioned apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.960
under zero threat of a gruesome death.
They can hug it out somewhere else.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.720
The sounds of their fight and the crawler’s&nbsp;
screeching will attract more of them, and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.960
don’t know how many of them there are.
Juno tells Rebeca and Sam about a way out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.680
marked by the explorer that came before them. That&nbsp;
it should lead them to the cave entrance which the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:47.040
man-eaters use to go outside and hunt animals.&nbsp;
First, they need to find Sarah. Tall task,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.080
but it’d be damn hard to live with&nbsp;
yourself if you just left her. 
&nbsp;

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:55.440
Not sure why Juno holstered her ice axe. I’d&nbsp;
have that baby cocked back ready to strike.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.480
Although Juno has been a bit trigger happy with&nbsp;
it, so maybe holstering it was a good idea.
&nbsp;

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.640
Sarah finds Beth in the carnage. How&nbsp;
the hell is she still alive? She took&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.120
an ice axe through the neck. Beth tells her&nbsp;
that Juno killed her, and to not trust her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:14.080
I know Juno pulled a dick move dragging you guys&nbsp;
into this cave, and wasn’t the best friend, but to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.880
say that she is a murdering psychopath is crazy.&nbsp;
You jumped up behind her when she was fighting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.680
for her life. You got caught in the cross-fire.&nbsp;
It was just a shitty case of friendly fire.
&nbsp;

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:28.560
Beth’s lamentations are drawing the attention&nbsp;
of the humanoids. Her dying wish is to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.040
Sarah finish her off with a rock so she doesn’t&nbsp;
have to experience getting eaten alive. 
&nbsp;

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:41.600
Love each day. Sarah doesn’t even make a step&nbsp;
before another albino flesh eater descends on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.320
her. Sarah’s in no mood for it’s shit, and head&nbsp;
stomps it like Ryan Gosling in Driver.
&nbsp;

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.600
Best get some distance from the commotion now.&nbsp;
You gotta shoot and scoot with these fuckers.
&nbsp;

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.240
The caveman’s girlfriend shows up for date night&nbsp;
and finds what’s left of his head after Sarah curb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:05.120
stomped him. Needless to say, she’s pissed.
Sarah makes a run for it and trips into the pond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.760
full of god knows what. Haven’t we learned&nbsp;
by now that running only makes things worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.400
Standing and moving so incredibly still that&nbsp;
you become invisible is the best defense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.560
And where is that pocket knife you had.
She is smart to hold her breath, collect herself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.760
and ever so slowly Navy SEAL out of the crawler’s&nbsp;
toilet so she doesn’t make more noise.
&nbsp;

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.560
Doesn’t help her though, the&nbsp;
albino bat-bitch is onto her.
&nbsp;

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.800
Pocket knife. Where’s your god&nbsp;
damn pocket knife? If everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.960
did a little preparation and planning they&nbsp;
wouldn’t have to struggle for a hail mary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.920
everytime they found themselves&nbsp;
in a near-death situation.
&nbsp;

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.080
Sarah climbs up onto the rock and freezes when&nbsp;
she hears another coming around the corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.240
It steps on her but thinks it’s just another&nbsp;
animal carcass and moves past her.
&nbsp;

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.960
She carefully grabs another bone club and by the&nbsp;
look in her eye, it’s time for vengeance.
&nbsp;

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.000
So the tally is 1 for the crawlers, and&nbsp;
like 5 or 6 for the girls. As long as they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.320
have light, they have an immense tactical&nbsp;
advantage. These creatures are only human,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.400
and have all the same weaknesses. 
Sarah lets out a bloodcurdling scream.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.800
I don’t think she was doing it to get the&nbsp;
attention of the others, however if she was,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.040
outright screaming isn’t the best way. Your&nbsp;
friends may just think you got whacked. Best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.840
to yell something like, “I’m Okay, Help Me.”&nbsp;
This way they know you aren’t a goner and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.000
wasn’t a man-eater yelling or something.
Juno and the others hear her scream and try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.400
get to her, but when Juno turns the corner she&nbsp;
finds an entire family of these things. 
&nbsp;

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.600
Juno’s team is in a pretty good spot. The corridor&nbsp;
is narrow enough that only one crawler can attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.480
at once, but tall enough that she can stand&nbsp;
and fight. She could pull a Leonidas and make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:49.440
this passage the proverbial hot gates. The last&nbsp;
place you want to be is surrounded in the open,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:54.080
or forced into a crawl with them behind you.
They opt to run for it but get forced back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:58.720
to the precipice. So instead of pulling a&nbsp;
Leonidas, you guys pulled a persian.
&nbsp;

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.680
Sam, in a utterly moronic move, tries to&nbsp;
trad climb back across the overhang. There’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:08.240
just no way to fight in that position, it’s&nbsp;
physically demanding so you’ll be making noise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:15.840
it achieves literally nothing, and&nbsp;
it goes about how you’d expect.
&nbsp;

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.560
At least she took one of them with her.
They all keep forgetting that after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.240
every noisy altercation they need&nbsp;
to relocate, and another crawler&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:33.760
gives Rebecca an involuntary c-section.
Juno’s brain is misfiring from all the action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.480
and ditches Rebecca to leap off the cliff into&nbsp;
the water. She finds no salvation though. 
&nbsp;

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.520
You’re telling me this thing was holding its&nbsp;
breath this whole time after getting shanked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.600
and falling. Give me a break.
Sarah jumpscare pulls Juno up from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:55.520
the slippery rocks. She’s lucky her&nbsp;
face didn’t catch an ice axe.
&nbsp;

00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:11.840
Juno and Sarah go back to back tomb raider style&nbsp;
against the rest of the crawler family.
&nbsp;

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.200
Damn! Some badass ladies. If there’s more&nbsp;
of them, they are definitely on their way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.400
Unless you plan on fighting some&nbsp;
more, I suggest you get moving.
