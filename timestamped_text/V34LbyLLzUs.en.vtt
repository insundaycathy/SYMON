regan puts the radio on for marcus when&nbsp;
he suddenly hears beyond the sea plane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.880
they realize this means someone else is playing it&nbsp;
but emmett says the song plays on a loop and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.720
it's been picked up since he moved to the hills&nbsp;
regan tells marcus that she thinks the song choice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.800
is a code and that she can use a map to find where&nbsp;
the song is being played if she can find a boat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.760
marcus tries to convince her otherwise but regan&nbsp;
leaves in the morning when everyone is asleep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.640
evelyn pleads with emmett to go look for regan&nbsp;
mentioning how she already lost one child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.440

tracks after some crows make noise a monster comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.880
to the train car she is in regan utilizes the&nbsp;
hearing aid and fires one shot at the monster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.800

the monster lunges toward her but emmett arrives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.800
in time to shoot it in the head he tries to bring&nbsp;
regan back and he also must enunciate his words&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.000
since he can't communicate in sign language with&nbsp;
her regan is still adamant about going through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.320
with her plan meanwhile after resting reagan&nbsp;
lost her hearing aid devastated but emmett came&nbsp;&nbsp;

from the bunker to gather medical supplies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.280

evelyn stops by beau's memorial shrine to pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.000

to grab medicine bandages and two oxygen tanks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.240
marcus steps out of the bunker for a moment to&nbsp;
check out emmett's compound and is startled by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.560
what appears to be a woman's decomposing corpse he&nbsp;
knocks something over and alerts a nearby monster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.560

locks himself and the baby inside the vault&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.400
and the oxygen tank is running dangerously low&nbsp;
and both marcus and the baby are having difficulty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.480
breathing air regan and emmett stop by the marina&nbsp;
to get a boat but emmett sees what looks like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.200
little girl crying he approaches her but the girl&nbsp;
places a rope around his neck other survivors led&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.520

her to dive she does so and emmitt creates noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.360
that attracts a monster it attacks the survivors&nbsp;
and emmett stabs the leader in the leg so he can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.240
scream and attract the monster emmett jumps in the&nbsp;
water and when a creature goes after him it drowns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.120
regan then appears on a boat and grabs emmett&nbsp;
and emmett reveals he has the hearing aid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.280
kept safe in his mouth evelyn makes it back to&nbsp;
the bunker but finds that one of the monsters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.600
has made it in there she places one of her oxygen&nbsp;
tanks near some fuel as the monster rises up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.360
evelyn shoots the tank blowing it up and causing&nbsp;
the monster to catch fire but it doesn't kill it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.800
the sprinklers go off and the falling water gives&nbsp;
evelyn a chance to head back down and make it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.960
her boys in time evelyn was worried to see marcus&nbsp;
has passed out from oxygen deprivation but then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.680
he wakes up evelyn closes the vault safely this&nbsp;
time bregen and emmett make it to an island where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.440
the survivors were playing this song they meet&nbsp;
a man who is part of the group he asks emmett&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.280
if he figured out the message but emmett admits&nbsp;
it was all regan the man explains that once the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.880
national guard realized the monsters couldn't swim&nbsp;
they began sending boats away from the cities but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.800
most people ruined it by screaming and attracting&nbsp;
the monsters in the morning emmett hears a noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.160
coming from the boat and he finds that a monster&nbsp;
managed to arrive on the island on the boat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.200
emma tries to warn the islanders but the&nbsp;
monster begins to attack and kill people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.320
regan and emmitt join the man as he honks his&nbsp;
car horn to get the monster away from the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.360
he brings the two to the radio station before&nbsp;
the monster drags him away and kills him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.560
regan and emmett lure the monster into the radio&nbsp;
station where the song had been playing emmett&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.160
does what he can to distract the monster while&nbsp;
regan makes her way into the control room at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.600
same time evelyn steps out of the vault and finds&nbsp;
that the monster made its way into the bunker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.560
and it tries to attack evelyn and the boys in&nbsp;
the vault regan puts her hearing aid on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.640
microphone and the frequency weakens the monster&nbsp;
marcus hears the noise over the radio and plays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.680
it to weaken their monster he steps out of the&nbsp;
vault and grabs evelyn's pistol shooting the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.840
monster in the head while regan grabs a microphone&nbsp;
stand and jams it into the other monster's head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.920
