00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.320
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m&nbsp;
going to explain a Norwegian dark&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:15.920
fantasy film called “Trollhunter,” Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.040
At the beginning of the movie, three Norwegian&nbsp;
friends, namely; Thomas, Johanna, and Kalle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.640
are in a car. They study in the Volda University&nbsp;
College and are out to make a documentary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.560
about recent bear attacks happening&nbsp;
in the town as a college project.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.000
Kalle is the cameraman responsible for shooting&nbsp;
all the footage of their study. The three drive to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.760
the site where a bear’s dead body has been found&nbsp;
and interview local hunters. Interestingly, all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.360
the hunters have the same comment; they claim that&nbsp;
the bear tracks look odd and made up and assume&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.800
that the head of the Norwegian Wildlife Board,&nbsp;
Finn Haugen, is hiding something. The hunters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.560
also share their mutual hatred for a fellow hunter&nbsp;
named Hans, who all of them are suspicious of. 
&nbsp;

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.200
The comments make the student’s documentary&nbsp;
more interesting, so they decide to do more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.120
research on Hans. They find out that Hans lives in&nbsp;
a campground and interview his neighbor. According&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.560
to the neighbor, Hans stays out most of the night&nbsp;
and doesn’t return till sunrise. The group waits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.840
for him to return home that day. When they finally&nbsp;
meet him, they ask for permission to be with him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.840
on one of his night adventures. However, Hans&nbsp;
strictly denies the idea and asks them to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.000
away. The trio notices marks from a potential&nbsp;
bear attack on Hans’s car and films it. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.720
are adamant about finding what Hans does at&nbsp;
night, so they wait in their car nearby his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.200
van until it gets dark. At night, Hans gets into&nbsp;
his car and drives away as the group follows him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.320
They drive behind his car the whole night and&nbsp;
see him board a ferry the next day. The group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.240
decides to get on the ferry too. When they reach&nbsp;
the destination, they again follow him to a hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.240
Finally, at night, they see him&nbsp;
get into his car and drive away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.440
The trio knows this is their chance to find out&nbsp;
what he is doing, so they follow him closely. 
&nbsp;

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.720
However, they lose him after reaching a gate that&nbsp;
says the further entrance is prohibited. But the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.560
sign doesn’t stop the group as they open the gate&nbsp;
and go inside, knowing that Hans is there too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.120
They reach a dark and quiet jungle and&nbsp;
get out of the car to look for the hunter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.200
The strangely quiet jungle unsettles the group,&nbsp;
but they do not stop the pursuit. All of a sudden,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.880
a loud screech is heard, and a bright light&nbsp;
flashes nearby. The group freezes in their tracks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.320
too scared to go check what it is. Just then,&nbsp;
a terrified Hans approaches them hastily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.840
and asks them to run away. The group starts to run&nbsp;
without questioning him. Some unknown entity is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.680
following them; however, the college students do&nbsp;
not know what. The unknown entity almost catches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.560
Thomas and inures him in the process, but the&nbsp;
group manages to run away in Hans’s car. 
&nbsp;

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.840
Hans is quiet throughout the journey but&nbsp;
surprisingly accepts when the group asks to join&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.720
him for a hunt. He then explains that the entity&nbsp;
that followed them earlier is a mythological&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.640
creature from the Scandinavian folklore&nbsp;
called Trolls. Trolls live in isolated rocks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.400
mountains, or caves. Hans describes them as ugly&nbsp;
and slow-witted creatures. They always come out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.760
at night because the light turns them into rocks.&nbsp;
The Trolls are anti-Christianity and can smell the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.720
blood of people who believe in Christianity from&nbsp;
afar. Hans finally confesses that he isn’t a bear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.320
hunter but a Troll hunter. There is a massive&nbsp;
light mounted on his car, which he uses to turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.440
the Trolls into stone and kill them. The group&nbsp;
doesn't believe Hans’s story but agrees to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.480
with him on an adventure. The following night,&nbsp;
Hans takes the group on a Troll hunt with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.080
Before leaving, he makes them rub Troll’s smell&nbsp;
on their body so the Trolls wouldn’t smell humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.280
Hans carries a flashgun that shoots out forceful&nbsp;
UV rays, and they finally make their way towards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.040
the jungle. Later, Hans gets a call from someone&nbsp;
who asks him to get a Troll’s blood sample.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.080
After walking for a while, he asks the group to&nbsp;
stop at a place. He plans to bring out the Tolls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.560
from their hidings, so he leaves the group&nbsp;
and goes further into the woods alone.
&nbsp;

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.840
As the trio waits for Hans to return, they start&nbsp;
believing that Hans was just making up stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.400
But suddenly, a loud growl is heard. The trees&nbsp;
start shaking, and a massive three-headed creature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.520
emerges from between them. The group is terrified&nbsp;
and starts running towards their car while the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.160
Troll pursues them. They finally reach the car,&nbsp;
but the Troll arrives there while following their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.360
smell. Thankfully, Hans is ready for the creature&nbsp;
and flashes it with the light mounted on his car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.280
The creature immediately turns into&nbsp;
stone, surprising the group. Thomas,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.680
Johanna, and Kalle are excited to have found&nbsp;
such a brilliant being and believe that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.800
will be famous overnight because of the camera&nbsp;
footage. Hans, however, is mad at the group for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.960
not telling him that they are the followers of&nbsp;
Christianity. That is why the Troll could smell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.800
and follow them. However, the trio insists&nbsp;
that none of them follow Christianity. 
&nbsp;

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.200
Hans finally reveals that he doesn’t get paid&nbsp;
enough for the hunts and doesn’t want to put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.920
his life in danger anymore. He wants to expose&nbsp;
the truth about Trolls to the world, and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.200
is why he agreed to bring them here. The following&nbsp;
morning, the head of the Norwegian Wildlife Board,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.840
Finn, arrives at the scene. The group gets to know&nbsp;
that Finn actually works for the Troll Security&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.160
Service (TSS). The Norwegian government doesn't&nbsp;
want the world to know about the creature's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.160
existence, so they have formed a secret committee,&nbsp;
TSS, to solve any problems related to Trolls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.880
Hans is an official Troll hunter who has been&nbsp;
appointed to kill Trolls who come close to humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.120
Hence, to hide the deaths of the Trolls,&nbsp;
they cover it with bear attack stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.760
Every news about the bear’s attack till now&nbsp;
has been a cover-up for some Trolls’ death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.400
Hans reveals that for the past few weeks,&nbsp;
Trolls have been more aggressive than usual,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.200
and the TSS wants to find out about the reason.&nbsp;
That is why they asked to collect a Troll’s blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:56.000
sample last night, but Hans was unsuccessful.&nbsp;
So, he wants to go for a hunt again today. 
 
&nbsp;

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.400
Finn realizes that the students are filming&nbsp;
the whole interaction and warns them that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.720
will not be allowed to keep the footage. But&nbsp;
the warning doesn’t stop the trio. At night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.280
they go to a different location to hunt the&nbsp;
creature. When they reach there, Hans uses a sheep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.120
as bait to attract the Trolls. The idea works, and&nbsp;
after a while, a different kind of Troll appears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.880
and starts devouring the sheep. Hans dresses up in&nbsp;
a metal suit and gets a syringe. He then bravely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.600
approaches the creature to try to get his blood&nbsp;
samples. Hans manages to get the blood but angers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.640
the Troll in the process. It attacks Hans and&nbsp;
easily overpowers him. It even tries to eat the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.720
man, but the metallic suit resists it. Hans plays&nbsp;
dead, making the Troll leave. The trio approaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.240
him and helps him up. Hans quickly follows the&nbsp;
Troll and kills him by flashing his light. 
&nbsp;

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.640
The next day, they take the blood samples to the&nbsp;
lab to get them tested and find out they will get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.840
the result after some days. The group then leaves&nbsp;
for another mission together. They notice several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.400
fallen trees and figure it is the work of a Troll.&nbsp;
They follow the Troll’s footsteps and reach an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.840
abandoned mine. But before they can exit the mine,&nbsp;
a family of Trolls enters, blocking their way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:12.960
The group is beyond terrified, especially the&nbsp;
cameraman Kalle, who is shivering in fear. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.480
confesses that he believes in Christianity, making&nbsp;
the group more nervous. Meanwhile, the Trolls get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.520
Kalle’s smell and attack the group. They use&nbsp;
the UV lights to somehow get out of the mine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.800
but Kalle is dragged in by the creatures. Thomas&nbsp;
and Johanna sit down on the ground, not able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.560
process their friend’s death. They take his broken&nbsp;
camera and go back to Hans’s trailer. After some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.520
days, they hire a new Muslim cameraman, not sure&nbsp;
how the creature will react to her smell. 
&nbsp;

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.240
Finn calls Hans again, this time to assign&nbsp;
him a task to kill the most dangerous Troll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:50.320
of them all called the Jotnar, who is easily&nbsp;
50–100 meters tall. Hans knows this Troll will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.760
the hardest to kill, so he upgrades his van with&nbsp;
sharp metals to keep it away. The group travels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.240
to the mountains to look for the Troll. On their&nbsp;
pursuit, they get a call from the lab who reveals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.200
that the Trolls have rabies. That is why they&nbsp;
had been overly aggressive over the past month.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.120
The group remembers that Thomas was bitten&nbsp;
when he first encountered the Troll, so they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.320
fear he might have rabies too. Thomas claims he&nbsp;
will get tested once they get back. Just then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.920
they see the Jotnar Troll making its way towards&nbsp;
their van. Unfortunately, the van’s mounted lights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.640
stop working right then. Hans thinks of a&nbsp;
plan and starts singing a Christian hymn,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.520
confusing the Troll and attracting it towards&nbsp;
him. They take this opportunity to drive away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.640
After a while, Hans manages to fix the lights. 
They drive from right under the Troll’s leg and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.760
finally manage to flash it with the lights. The&nbsp;
Troll turns into stone and crumbles to the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.320
and the group is relieved. Thomas keeps the hard&nbsp;
drive with the footage of the documentary with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.760
him. Just then, Finn and his men arrive and try&nbsp;
snatching the camera and the hard drive from them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.880
Thomas frantically snatches them both and runs&nbsp;
away, leaving his friends behind. After a while,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.000
he reaches a road and sees a truck driving his&nbsp;
way. The scene cuts as the screen goes black.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.560
An epilogue tells us that no one has ever&nbsp;
heard from the students after the incident,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.040
but we can assume that someone from the truck&nbsp;
took the footage from Thomas and leaked them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.880
the press. With no options left, Norway's prime&nbsp;
minister confesses about the Trolls’ existence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.520
in a press meeting. At the end of the movie,&nbsp;
the whole world knows about the Trolls.
