Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:06.500
Today, I'm going to explain a horror, sci-fi
film called "Alien."

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.500
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.760
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.410
A commercial space cargo vehicle, the Nostromo,
detects a mysterious transmission on its way

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.800
back to Earth.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.140
The ship's artificial intelligence, Mother,
wakes up the crew from stasis to investigate:

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:32.369
Warrant Officer Ripley, Captain Dallas, Executive
Officer Kane, Navigator Lambert, Science Officer

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.460
Ash, and Engineers Parker and Brett.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.140
After analyzing the ship's condition, Lambert
sees that they have gone off-course while

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.829
Ripley cannot contact traffic control for
assistance.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.500
Dallas explains that Mother changed their
course after detecting the transmission and,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.420
as protocol, they must investigate it.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.569
Lambert plays the transmission, which is coming
from a nearby planetoid, but it's not like

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:58.589
any signal they've heard before.

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.850
The team detaches the Nostromo from the cargo
ship and heads to the planetoid to begin their

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.210
operation.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.579
Their landing causes damage to the ship, leading
the team stranded while Brett and Parker repair

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:09.600
the damages.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.570
Dallas, Kane, and Lambert head out to investigate
the source of the signal while Ash monitors

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.780
their feed.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.090
The trio navigates through the harsh environment
until they discover an alien spacecraft that

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.359
seemed to have crashed onto the planet.

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:26.469
Their connection to the Nostromo is interrupted
as they enter the ship, losing their communication

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:27.850
with Ash.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.100
The three enter the alien ship, observing
the strange design in the darkness.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.859
They climb to the control room and find the
deceased giant humanoid creature that seemed

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:37.799
to be the ship's pilot.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.320
Back at the Nostromo, Ripley successfully
translates the transmission, which she declares

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.179
as a warning, not an S.O.S.

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.899
She wishes to warn Dallas and his crew, but
Ash suggests that she stays.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.229
In the spacecraft, Kane finds a hole that
leads to a vast cave-like area.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.600
With heavy breaths, Kane searches the area,
seeing eggs under the blue mist.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.259
While observing the mist, Kane slips down.

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.499
He walks to the eggs, curious about the strange
objects.

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:07.409
Shining a light on one, he confirms a living
creature still inside.

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.400
The egg opens up like a flower, revealing
a small throbbing creature.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.740
Kane goes closer to investigate but is jumped
by the reptilian creature, grabbing his face.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.209
Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane
back to the Nostromo.

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.599
With the creature still attached to Kane,
Ripley refuses to open the ship as per quarantine

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.730
protocols.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.290
But Ash opens the door instead, letting the
trio in.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.110
In the infirmary, Dallas and Ash remove Kane's
broken helmet, revealing the Face Hugger still

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.400
attached to him.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.620
When Ripley arrives, Lambert hits her, angered
that she wanted to leave them in the sanitation

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.620
area.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.620
Ripley argues to Dallas that it's against
the law to let the thing inside the ship.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.170
Uncertain of what the creature is, Ash carefully
moves one of its "fingers," but the Face Hugger

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.939
coils its tail tighter around Kane's neck.

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:53.050
They put Kane inside the X-ray machine, observing
that the creature is keeping him alive.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.840
Dallas orders the creature to be removed,
despite Ash's warning that it might kill Kane.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.579
With Kane set on the table, Ash makes an incision
on the Face Hugger, but its blood drips, melting

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.110
a hole in the floor.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.180
The acidic blood penetrates its way two levels
down the ship before stopping.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.080
Seeing the damage the Face Hugger's blood
caused, they postpone the operation and focus

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.080
on repairing the ship.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.049
Ash continues to study the creature, still
uncertain of what it is.

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.260
Ripley asks his findings, learning that the
Face Hugger's cells turn into polarized silicone

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.240
to withstand adverse conditions, making it
difficult to destroy it.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.480
Ripley criticizes him for breaking the quarantine
law, reminding him that she's in charge of

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.489
the Nostromo when Kane and Dallas are out
of the ship.

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.879
Ash defends that he is merely doing his job.

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.120
Later on, Ash calls Dallas and Ripley back
to the infirmary.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.220
The Face Hugger is gone, but Kane is still
alive.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.060
The three cautiously search the infirmary,
knowing that the creature could still attack

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.200
them.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.030
Ripley checks Kane, jumping when the Face
Hugger falls on her shoulder.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.730
She throws it on the floor and sees it unmoving.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.930
Ash takes the creature and studies it.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.980
Fearing what it could do, Ripley urges them
to get rid of it, but Ash intends to study

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.090
it further, as it is the first time they have
encountered such a creature.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.959
Dallas allows Ash to decide what to do with
it.

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.250
Walking away from the infirmary, Dallas explains
to Ripley that their contracts dictate that

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.730
he only commands the ship, but Ash is in charge
of the science division; therefore, it's Ash's

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.430
call on what to do with the creature.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.530
Despite the unfinished repairs, Dallas orders
them to exit the planetoid and connect back

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.130
to the cargo ship.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.160
With the team's effort, the Nostromo launches
off successfully.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.780
Resting at the dining hall, the team discusses
what to do with Kane.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.880
Parker suggests freezing him to stop whatever
disease he may have.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.000
Dallas finalizes that Kane will go into quarantine,
to which Ripley suggests that they all will

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.010
after being exposed to him.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.810
Lambert reports that it will still take ten
months to return to Earth, dampening their

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.250
mood further.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.500
Kane finally awakens in the infirmary, seemingly
fine yet still confused about what happened.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.810
With Kane's recovery, the crew enjoys a feast
before being put back in cryo-sleep for the

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.610
rest of their trip home.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.130
The feast ends when Kane starts choking.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.910
He convulses on the dining table, grunting
in pain.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.580
The men attempt to hold him down, but something
shrieks as blood splatters from Kane's chest,

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.380
causing everyone to recoil.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.160
Kane continues to convulse, red in pain.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.880
His chest bursts open, revealing a tiny creature
coming out of his body.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.650
Lambert shrieks in horror as the creature
moves around as if inspecting them.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.510
Ash stops Parker from attacking the creature,
believing that it may have the same acidic

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.250
blood as the Face Hugger.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.130
The creature wails then runs away, retreating
to the air vents.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.710
Before dealing with the creature, the crew
takes a moment of silence for Kane before

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.660
launching his body into space.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.960
Afterward, Brett constructs cattle prods to
eliminate the alien creature without going

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.020
near it.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.130
Ash shows a tracking device that will give
off a signal when it detects movement.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.820
Dallas splits them into two teams, ordering
them to capture the creature and send it into

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.400
the airlock.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.250
Ripley searches with Parker and Brett, armed
with cattle prods and a net.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.890
They head inside the supply room, detecting
something inside one of the closed drawers.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.760
The three prepare themselves for the creature,
holding out the net and cattle prod in case

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.950
it attacks.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.600
Parker opens the door, only to reveal the
crew's cat, Jones, inside.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.870
Once the adrenaline washes off, the three
laughs it off.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.370
Parker tells Brett to chase after the cat
so they can't mistake it for the creature

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.990
again.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.150
Following the cat inside the Nostromo's hold,
Brett hears something moving above his head,

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.560
but the cat meows in another direction.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.740
He finds Jones hiding behind machinery, scampering
away in fear.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.880
Once the cat is away, Brett picks up a skin-like
material from the floor.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.840
Recognizing it from the alien creature, he
drops it and continues to look for Jones.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.630
Water drips from above the landing leg compartment,
imitating rain.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.130
Brett takes a moment to enjoy the rain, not
noticing a creature hiding in plain sight.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.250
Brett finally locates Jones, but it hisses
at him.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:55.460
The fully-grown alien hangs behind Brett,
scaring the cat while Brett remains unaware.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.820
Finally realizing that Jones is afraid of
something else, Brett looks behind.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.810
Frozen in fear, the alien grabs Brett by his
head and pulls him up.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.140
Ripley and Parker hear his screams, seeing
the blood, but Brett and the alien are nowhere

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.140
in sight.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.280
The crew regroups, discussing their next options.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.140
The alien has retreated into the air ducts,
allowing Dallas to calculate where it could

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.360
head next.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.050
He intends to trap the alien and lead it to
the airlock to send it into outer space.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.190
With Parker and Lambert guarding the opposite
opening and Ripley and Ash managing the control

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.010
system, Dallas goes inside the ducts with
a flamethrower to force the creature into

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.240
the airlock.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.810
He struggles between the cramped space, listening
to Lambert's directions on where to go.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.930
But Lambert's tracking device loses the signal,
halting Dallas' progress.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.460
Dallas finds slime on the floor but doesn't
see the creature anywhere.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.530
The tracker starts beeping, showing something
moving towards Dallas.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.120
Lambert cries for him to run away, but the
creature ambushes him.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.470
After losing communication with Dallas, the
surviving crew meets up again, hoping to find

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.620
another way.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.960
Parker is enraged, and Lambert is filled with
grief.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.050
Ripley suggests following Dallas' original
plan, but Lambert is terrified of abandoning

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.180
the ship, but their shuttle cannot support
four people.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.260
Parker rejects the idea of escaping, wanting
revenge against the alien.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.710
Ripley, now in charge after Dallas is gone,
pulls her crew together.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.420
She insists on flushing out the alien into
the airlock, but they will be more careful

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.670
this time.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.800
She orders Parker to refuel the flame thrower
and asks Ash if he has any other information

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.360
or suggestion.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.730
When he denies it, she asserts that she will
collect information directly from Mother instead.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:36.229
Inside Mother's system, Ripley accesses the
ship's logs, seeing that Ash has been secretly

00:08:36.229 --> 00:08:39.789
ordered to retrieve the alien, even if it
meant the crew's lives.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:44.589
The revelation has Ripley exasperated, not
noticing that Ash is sitting next to her.

00:08:44.589 --> 00:08:48.220
She lunges at him, enraged that her people
have been betrayed.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.750
Ripley heads out, hoping to check on Lambert
and Parker, but Ash closes the doors on her,

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.850
preventing her from telling the rest.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.740
She confronts him, stunned to see white liquid
dripping from his forehead.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.300
Ash pulls her hair and throws her down and
against the wall.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.370
With Ripley indisposed, Ash prepares a magazine
to insert down her throat, choking her.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.550
Parker and Lambert find them, but Ash overpowers
them.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.250
Parker slams a fuel tank on Ash's shoulder,
freeing Ripley.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.079
Ash seizes and spins, spewing liquid from
his mouth.

00:09:17.079 --> 00:09:21.310
Parker hits his head, revealing that Ash was
a robot all along.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.709
The mechanical body continues to fight despite
its damages.

00:09:24.709 --> 00:09:28.579
Lambert stabs it with a pole, finally disabling
him.

00:09:28.579 --> 00:09:32.800
Moments later, Ripley navigates through Ash's
wiring to reactivate him.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.029
Once he's reactivated, Ash reveals that he
was specifically designed and added to the

00:09:37.029 --> 00:09:39.730
crew to retrieve the alien specimen alive.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:43.990
Ripley asks how they can exterminate the alien,
but Ash reveals that they cannot.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:48.920
He deems the creature a perfect specimen,
admiring its purity and lack of morality.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:54.019
Before Ripley deactivates Ash, he smiles,
mocking their slim chance of survival.

00:09:54.019 --> 00:09:58.120
With Ash out of the way, Ripley decides to
take Lambert's idea: escape to the shuttle

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.990
and blow up the ship, the alien along with
it.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.180
Out of rage, Parker incinerates Ash's body
before they leave.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:09.069
Ripley heads to the shuttle to prepare their
escape while Parker and Lambert gather coolants

00:10:09.069 --> 00:10:10.319
for the trip.

00:10:10.319 --> 00:10:13.930
While activating the shuttle, Ripley hears
Jones and investigates.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.230
Meanwhile, Lambert and Parker arrive at the
hold.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:21.310
Lambert hurriedly gathers the supplies while
Parker keeps watch for the alien.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:24.760
Once they've gathered all the coolants from
the machines, they move to collect more from

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.100
the suits and the supply room.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.180
Ripley searches for the cat in the shuttle,
hoping to save it.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.050
Jones startles Ripley, making her jump.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:37.560
With all the fright she went through, Ripley
tearfully gathers the cat into a cage.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.259
In the supply room, Lambert spots something
moving in the shadows.

00:10:41.259 --> 00:10:44.889
The alien corners her, now standing taller
than her and Parker.

00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:48.940
Parker tells her to run, but Lambert is frozen
in fear and despair.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.829
Parker lunges to save his teammate but is
captured.

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:55.779
Parker yells for her to run just before the
alien eliminates him.

00:10:55.779 --> 00:10:58.610
Lambert cries in fear, unable to move.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.420
Hearing their cries, Ripley runs to the supply
room to help them.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.910
Before she could reach them, however, the
screams stop abruptly.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.410
She goes inside and sees that Parker and Lambert
are dead.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:14.300
Mixed with panic, confusion, and grief, Ripley
heads to the engine room and activates the

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.810
Nostromo's self-destruction system.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.779
Her face filling with tears, she hears the
system announce that the self-destruct mode

00:11:20.779 --> 00:11:22.220
is starting.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.480
The ship fills with steam as Ripley runs back
to the shuttle.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.423
With a flamethrower in one hand and several
coolants tucked on the other, she climbs down

00:11:28.423 --> 00:11:29.423
the cargo hold and hears a moan in the darkness.

00:11:29.423 --> 00:11:30.423
Ripley searches around, seeing an odd material
meld at the bottom of a cargo ship.

00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:31.423
Within it, she finds Dallas, still alive but
cocooned.

00:11:31.423 --> 00:11:32.423
She turns to the other side and finds Brett
in the same condition.

00:11:32.423 --> 00:11:33.423
Hearing the pain in Dallas's voice, Ripley
grieves for her comrades before incinerating

00:11:33.423 --> 00:11:34.423
their bodies, putting them out of their misery.

00:11:34.423 --> 00:11:35.423
Broken yet still determined to survive, Ripley
retrieves Jones and hurries back to the shuttle.

00:11:35.423 --> 00:11:39.670
With only three minutes left before the detonation,
Ripley spots the alien blocking her path.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:44.439
Heart pounding loudly, she runs back to the
engine room, disabling the self-destruct.

00:11:44.439 --> 00:11:49.019
But the override doesn't work and only buys
her an extra five minutes to escape.

00:11:49.019 --> 00:11:54.160
The frustrated Ripley runs back to the shuttle,
carefully checking if the alien is still around.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.790
Seeing no sign of it, she carefully moves
forward, seeing that the cat is unharmed.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:04.009
She grabs Jones and steps inside the shuttle,
gasping for air once she closes the doors.

00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:08.860
With one minute left, Ripley hurriedly activates
the shuttle, fastening herself as the aircraft

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.589
prepares to launch.

00:12:10.589 --> 00:12:14.470
Mother counts down to the Nostromo's destruction
as the shuttle speeds out.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:18.850
Ripley watches with cold eyes as the Nostromo
explodes into a bright light, ending the journey

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.509
for her crew.

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:23.459
Ripley falls limp on her seat, thinking of
her team.

00:12:23.459 --> 00:12:27.959
She closes her eyes, grasping the idea that
the alien went down along with the spacecraft

00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:29.889
that she called home.

00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:33.139
After taking time to rest, Ripley prepares
her cryosleep.

00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:36.910
She takes Jones, cradling the cat before loading
it into the first chamber.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.519
Then, she prepares her chamber but checks
the shuttle's system before going in.

00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:43.759
A hand moves, startling her.

00:12:43.759 --> 00:12:47.680
The alien has wedged itself into the shuttle's
engines, escaping with her.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.519
Ripley hides in the cabinet and into a spacesuit,
keeping her eyes focused on the vicious creature.

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:56.470
Quietly, she loads a harpoon gun before opening
the door.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:00.259
Ripley leaves the cabinet slowly, avoiding
the alien's attention.

00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:05.019
She sings softly to herself to calm her nerves
as she blasts gas to lure out the alien.

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:09.199
Ripley turns away when it falls on the floor,
hoping that the alien won't see her.

00:13:09.199 --> 00:13:13.819
The alien appears beside her, screeching as
Ripley opens the airlock, driving the alien

00:13:13.819 --> 00:13:15.259
out the door.

00:13:15.259 --> 00:13:18.410
The creature is sucked into space but grabs
hold of the door.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.819
Ripley fires the harpoon gun, forcing it to
release.

00:13:21.819 --> 00:13:26.000
When she closes the door, the gun gets stuck
inside, allowing the alien to pull the rope

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.620
and climb into one of the shuttle's exhaust.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.509
Ripley blasts the engine, incinerating the
alien inside the exhaust.

00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:37.490
She watches it blast off into outer space,
finally rid of the nightmarish creature.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.490
With the fight finally over, Ripley records
her report on what happened to Nostromo and

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.749
her team.

00:13:42.749 --> 00:13:54.709
She goes back into hypersleep while the shuttle
takes her back to Earth.
