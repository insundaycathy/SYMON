Welcome back to Mrs Rundown, in todayâ€™s video I&nbsp;
am going to be recapping the events of Step Up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.560
a 2006 Romance film. Spoilers ahead!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.440

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.760
Brothers Mac and Skinny Carter and their&nbsp;
best friend Tyler Gage attend a party where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.560
they have a fight with their nemesis, PJ.&nbsp;
Following the party, the trio break into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.960
the Maryland School of Arts and trash the&nbsp;
theatre. When a security guard appears,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.640
Tyler helps the two escape, accepting&nbsp;
full blame for the vandalism himself.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.560
He is sentenced to 200 hours of&nbsp;
community service at the school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.440
There, he watches Nora Clark's dance&nbsp;
class preparing for her "senior showcase",&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.400
an audition performance which will&nbsp;
determine if she gets a position&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.200
with an attending professional dance company.
When Mac and Skinny visit Tyler on the school's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.800
lot, Nora watches from a window&nbsp;
as Tyler dances with his friends,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.440
mockingly a mashup of break-dance and the&nbsp;
moves he recently observed. When Andrew,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.680
her dance partner sprains an ankle, she finds&nbsp;
herself without a partner for her routine.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.600
Auditioning sophomores to replace him, none&nbsp;
meet her expectations. Tyler offers to help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.880
but Nora initially refuses. After proving&nbsp;
he can handle the routine, she reconsiders,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.960
convincing Director Gordon to let him&nbsp;
rehearse with her. Initially they clash,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.400
but as rehearsals continue, they grow&nbsp;
closer and learn from each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.440
Tyler also befriends Miles, a music student&nbsp;
with a crush on Nora's friend, Lucy.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.640
Nora's bond with Tyler grows, and one day she&nbsp;
takes him to a special spot on the waterfront&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.360
where she first envisioned her routine. She&nbsp;
had always imagined it as an ensemble dance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.640
rather than a duet. Tyler is inspired to help her&nbsp;
dream come true, recruiting younger dancers from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.600
the school to perform in her number. Brett signs a&nbsp;
recording deal with a company, betraying Miles for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.600
the opportunity. Disgusted, Nora breaks up with&nbsp;
him. Meanwhile, Tyler continues to try to balance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.840
his new goals, new friends, and nurturing&nbsp;
a troubled relationship with his old ones.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.200
Tyler asks Director Gordon if she will admit&nbsp;
him into the school, and is told he must prove&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.920
he deserves a chance. Nora suggests using&nbsp;
the showcase also as his entrance audition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.360
After dancing together at a club where Miles&nbsp;
and Lucy perform, Tyler and Nora finally kiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.720
Rehearsals continue until Andrew returns,&nbsp;
seemingly healed from his injury. Feeling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.520
he is no longer needed, Tyler angrily accuses&nbsp;
Nora of using him like Brett treated Miles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.880
Leaving the group, he returns&nbsp;
to his janitorial work.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.320
However, as the choreography is now&nbsp;
much too difficult for Andrew, he falls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.680
pulling himself from the&nbsp;
routine. Again without a partner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.840
crushed, she considers abandoning her&nbsp;
dance career for college after all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.680
Her mother's encouragement inspires her to&nbsp;
rewrite the choreography without a partner.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.800
Later during a party night at Omar's, Skinny&nbsp;
comes by against his mother's insistence he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.760
stay at home and gets kicked out by Mac and&nbsp;
Tyler. Frustrated, Skinny walks back home in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.200
a huff before spotting PJ arriving at a store&nbsp;
with his friend. Skinny steals PJ's unattended&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.240
car and foolishly drives back to Omar's, wanting&nbsp;
to hang out with the girls. Mac and Tyler are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.520
trying to get Skinny to abandon the car when PJ&nbsp;
and his friends arrive and fatally shoot Skinny.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.840
After the funeral, both Mac and Tyler realize&nbsp;
that they need to make better life decisions.&nbsp;

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.760
Tyler shows up at the last minute on the evening&nbsp;
of the showcase. He tries to persuade Nora to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.400
let him perform with them, and to forgive him.&nbsp;
Initially declining, she suddenly changes her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.280
mind as Tyler wishes her luck and walks away.&nbsp;
When the curtain opens, the whole ensemble&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.400
performs the original choreography with Miles'&nbsp;
latest musical score. The crowd is blown away.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.400
Backstage, a proud Director Gordon introduces Nora&nbsp;
to a director of a professional dance company,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.640
hoping to sign Nora. Meanwhile, Mac congratulates&nbsp;
Tyler for his performance. Thereafter, Director&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.000
Gordon introduces Tyler as a "transfer".&nbsp;
Nora is elated and embraces him. Repeating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.320
her original advice that he'll need to get some&nbsp;
tights, the movie ends with them sharing a kiss.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.680
