00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.880
Welcome back to Movie Recaps. Today I will&nbsp;
show you an action thriller film from 2012,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.480
titled Man on a Ledge.
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.000
Nick Cassidy is an ex-cop and an escaped convict.&nbsp;
We see him as he checks into The Roosevelt Hotel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.800
under the name Joe Walker. The hotel valet leads&nbsp;
him into his requested room. He has a nice meal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.600
and, after, he cleans every trace of himself from&nbsp;
the room, apart from a single note. Nick opens the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.120
window and steps out on the ledge of the hotel,&nbsp;
where he will spend a few of the most important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.920
hours in his life. To find out why he's doing&nbsp;
that, we have to go back a month earlier. At the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.080
time, Nick was in prison and got his final appeal&nbsp;
denied by the court. He will have to serve out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.640
entirety of his 25-year sentence. His ex-partner&nbsp;
Mike Ackerman comes to visit him in prison to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.840
tell him that his father is dying. He promises to&nbsp;
get him a day outside so he can see him. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.320
Nick only gets to go to his funeral. Mike and his&nbsp;
fiancée express their condolences to both Nick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.720
and his brother Joey. His brother's girlfriend&nbsp;
Angie leaves them a moment to talk in private.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.880
The brothers get into an argument and break into a&nbsp;
fight that quickly gets split up by Nick's guards,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.280
giving Nick ample opportunity to steal one of&nbsp;
their guns. Once armed, he makes Joey unlock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.920
his cuffs, impairs the prison guard's vehicle, and&nbsp;
escapes in his brother's car. A chase through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.560
graveyard with the police ensues, which he manages&nbsp;
easily while changing his clothes as well. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.400
chase leads them out to some train tracks where&nbsp;
he rams his car into a moving train and manages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.960
to slip away before the cops can get to him. Nick&nbsp;
gets to a hideout, where he finds all the things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.600
he might require, left there by his accomplice.
Back at the Roosevelt, the authorities are already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.520
aware of the situation with Nick and they're&nbsp;
shutting down the block. Police and emergency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.840
vehicles arrive at the site, along with Detective&nbsp;
Jack Dougherty. He heads straight to the room and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.640
introduces himself to Nick, saying he's there&nbsp;
to help. In the meantime, Detective Dante Marcus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.640
manages the situation at the base of the hotel&nbsp;
where people have already gathered, invested in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.960
the spectacle. Dougherty gives his best first&nbsp;
attempt at convincing Nick to come back in, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.520
Nick threatens him to get another negotiator or&nbsp;
he'll jump. The detective turns back in the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.520
met by Marcus and they take a look at Nick's&nbsp;
last note, saying: I will exit this world as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.520
I entered - innocent. They still don't know&nbsp;
who he is and Marcus wants to print the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.680
to find out more about him. Dougherty calls the&nbsp;
negotiator Lydia Mercer and tells her that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.240
have a jumper who has requested her specifically.&nbsp;
Marcus's team is already investigating Nick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.480
still thinking that he's Joe Walker. When Mercer&nbsp;
gets to the hotel, Dougherty informs her of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.640
scene and tells her that he's about to jump in&nbsp;
2 minutes. Mercer gives the room a look around,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.800
gets a little bit more info, and introduces&nbsp;
herself to Nick in the last possible second.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.640
He tells her that everything will change for&nbsp;
him today, one way or another and he needs her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.640
to understand that he's ready to die for that.&nbsp;
Mercer is curious why he even brought her there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.880
if that's the case, to which he replies that&nbsp;
it's because she’s famous and he needs a crowd.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.840
Dougherty doesn't trust her and gives her&nbsp;
five minutes to get her head in the game.&nbsp;

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.080
Meanwhile, Mike is looking for Nick, completely&nbsp;
unaware of what is actually happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.000
He thinks there's something suspicious about&nbsp;
Nick's escape, so he tells his colleague to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.240
check for anything unusual in the communication&nbsp;
between the Cassidy brothers. At this point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.400
we are introduced to another major player in&nbsp;
Nick's life, David Englander, the owner of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.960
Roosevelt Hotel. He's a nasty rich guy with his&nbsp;
hands on everything in the city and no interest in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.960
the wellbeing of others. Dougherty informs Mercer&nbsp;
that they didn't find any prints in the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.200
She thinks she can trick Nick with a cigarette&nbsp;
to get a print but fails the first attempt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.800
Mercer implies knowing that Nick isn't on the&nbsp;
ledge just to end his life, but to make some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.240
sort of statement. She tells him that, unlike the&nbsp;
crowd on the street, she actually cares. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.240
Joey calls Nick to tell him that they arrived.&nbsp;
Nick tries to mess with Mercer's head to get her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.480
away so he can talk to his brother without her&nbsp;
realizing it. Joey and Angie are part of Nick's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.120
rouse. The media gets in on the spectacle too and&nbsp;
they report on Mercer's involvement in the case,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.720
dragging up an incident from a month ago when&nbsp;
she couldn't persuade an officer not to jump from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.440
a bridge. She didn't take that incident lightly.&nbsp;
Dougherty and Mercer are suspicious about the lack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.120
of information they have on Nick, so Dougherty&nbsp;
will try to find something and she can focus on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.840
Nick. Simultaneously, he's talking to Joey while&nbsp;
he and Angie are breaking into one of Englander's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.000
many properties, just on the other side of the&nbsp;
hotel where Nick is standing. As the security&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.320
system is being disarmed for the night shift, Joey&nbsp;
and Angie drill holes on the roof of the place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.560
setting up an explosive device. They signal&nbsp;
Nick and he makes a fuss to distract Mercer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.640
and the crowd down below as they activate the&nbsp;
explosive. Joey and Angie enter the property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.120
while Nick continues to fool Mercer. He asks for&nbsp;
a cigarette and she shares her last one with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.680
Nick knows a lot about Mercer's carrier and tells&nbsp;
her that it's because they have a lot in common.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.440
She doesn't think that he wants to jump and he&nbsp;
tells her not to give up on him. When she pulls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.600
back into the room she hands the cigarette to&nbsp;
an officer so they can get a print from it. Joey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.520
informs Nick that they've entered the building.
In the meantime, Mike gets back to the station&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.920
and learns about the jumper, but not who he is.&nbsp;
Mercer gives another shot at persuading Nick to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.160
come back inside, when a news helicopter flies&nbsp;
dangerously close to them, almost pushing Nick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.720
over the ledge. Mike finally sees it's him on&nbsp;
the news feed. He gets a call about a storage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.680
unit in Joey's name. Joey and Angie lower down&nbsp;
the elevator shaft in Englander's building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.880
He takes care of the security cameras and&nbsp;
they move toward Englander's vault room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.440
Angie notices a sensor inside and they back&nbsp;
up so they don't activate it. Dougherty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.960
and Mercer realize that Nick is waiting for&nbsp;
something and she needs him to speed up his ID.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.920
Mercer comes back out and asks Nick what's really&nbsp;
going on. He gives her some kind of armchair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.200
psychology answer. She tries another approach when&nbsp;
Joey begins talking in his ear again. Since Nick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.360
can't answer him directly, he uses his answers to&nbsp;
Mercer as clues about what he and Angie should do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.840
about the sensor. Joey doesn't understand him,&nbsp;
but Angie realizes what Nick is trying to say.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.640
She says that it's a heat sensor and they need&nbsp;
to cool it down. They use a fire extinguisher to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.800
take care of the sensor. Nick tells Mercer that&nbsp;
he knows she pulled a print of his cigarette and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.000
is about to find out who he is. Simultaneously,&nbsp;
Mike goes to Joey's storage unit and finds Nick's,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.800
Joe Walker's, and his own file in a cabinet.&nbsp;
Marcus gets Nick's prints back and calls Mercer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.400
He tells her who Nick is and that he was in&nbsp;
prison for stealing Englander's 40 million dollars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.880
"Monarch" diamond. Marcus also tells her that he's&nbsp;
the owner of the hotel, with an office there and a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.040
diamond exchange across the street. Mercer and&nbsp;
Dougherty realize that Nick's plan is to prove&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.280
his innocence. She finds out that Mike was his&nbsp;
partner and calls him explaining the situation as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.840
he's burning the files he found in storage. Marcus&nbsp;
calls Englander's security and tells them to check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.440
on the vault. Simultaneously, Joey and Angie are&nbsp;
right outside the vault, trying to get in. Mercer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.520
confronts Nick and asks him what the whole point&nbsp;
of his stunt is. Nick tells her to send a team to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.080
the diamonds exchange, sending Joey into a panic&nbsp;
because they aren't finished there yet. He insists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.240
that he's innocent and needs Mercer's help because&nbsp;
Englander had set him up for stealing the diamond.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.800
She doesn't believe him. Then, Nick says that&nbsp;
this is his retrial and instigates the crowd below&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.360
to agree with him. Simultaneously, Englander's&nbsp;
security is being escorted by the police toward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.000
the other building. Nick tells Joey about it&nbsp;
and he asks him to buy them some time to hide.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Suddenly, Nick begins throwing money off the&nbsp;
ledge, and the crowd flocks the street, blocking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.080
the way for the police and the security to get&nbsp;
to the entrance of the exchange. Angie sets up a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.840
camera to get the passcode when the security guy&nbsp;
enters it, while Joey finds them a hiding spot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.560
The security and the police officers get inside&nbsp;
the building and come up, just as Angie and Joey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.360
get inside the hiding spot. Simultaneously,&nbsp;
Marcus talks to Englander about Nick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.120
Englander is pissed about the situation and thinks&nbsp;
that it's not a coincidence that Nick chose the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.200
same day as his major press conference about&nbsp;
a new building property to perform his stunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.720
Marcus says that he shouldn't worry, but gets&nbsp;
threatened that his life would be ruined if he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.360
doesn't fix the situation. Back at the exchange,&nbsp;
the security guard takes the police inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.000
vault room, entering the code. He explains all the&nbsp;
security measures to the officers which are enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.480
to convince them that no one can break-in, then&nbsp;
he informs Marcus about it. Marcus goes to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.720
hotel room and gives Mercer 15 minutes to get Nick&nbsp;
off the ledge or his sending in the tactical team.&nbsp;

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.760
Meanwhile, Mike is speeding toward the hotel.&nbsp;
Joey and Angie get out of hiding and go back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.160
the vault room. Mercer tells Nick that tactical&nbsp;
will come after him if he doesn't get down so he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.400
tells her about what happened when the diamond&nbsp;
was stolen. Apparently, the diamond was stolen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.720
by Englander's men, who jumped Nick when he was&nbsp;
transporting it. Englander was getting closer to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.040
being bankrupt, but instead of selling the diamond&nbsp;
and admitting to that, he got insurance for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.240
Mercer wants to believe him but hesitates&nbsp;
when Nick tells her that Englander's thugs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.800
were probably cops. She goes to investigate&nbsp;
his story when Mike arrives at the hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.440
He checks in with Marcus before he goes up. A&nbsp;
police officer brings in some documents they found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.840
in Nick's cell and Mike offers to take them to the&nbsp;
room. Mercer voices her suspicions about Nick's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.160
guilt to Dougherty, but he's pretty sure that he&nbsp;
did it. She asks Marcus about it too and tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.000
that Nick was cooperating with Internal Affairs&nbsp;
about another case involving a cop called Joe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.880
Walker. She thinks that it's connected to Nick's&nbsp;
case, but Marcus denies it. When Mercer tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.440
that Nick won't jump, he orders the tactical team&nbsp;
to get into position. Meanwhile, the crowd and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.760
the media all have different opinions about Nick's&nbsp;
presumed guilt. Mike takes a look at the documents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.520
from Nick's cell and removes a few of them before&nbsp;
he gets into the room and delivers the rest to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.160
Dougherty. Mercer questions him about Englander,&nbsp;
but he says that he had nothing to do with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.840
She's suspicious of Mike too and isn't letting him&nbsp;
get near Nick even though he insists that they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.720
friends. At the same time, Angie crawls through&nbsp;
a vent to get into the vault room. When she gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.880
inside, the first thing she needs to do is disarm&nbsp;
the security system and she needs Nick's help for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.200
that. Mercer calls him back into the room again,&nbsp;
but Nick asks her to buy him some more time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.800
Dougherty finds bomb schematics in the documents.&nbsp;
Simultaneously, Nick tells Angie how she can short&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.720
circuit the main processor to shut down the&nbsp;
sensors. She has a moment of doubt on which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.280
wire to cut but gets the right one eventually.&nbsp;
Angie uses the wire to fry the processor and turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:58.240
off the sensors. Joey opens the vault room door,&nbsp;
then drills through the vault itself to open it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.240
The tactical team is getting into position and&nbsp;
Mercer asks Nick if there really is a bomb.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.320
Dougherty tells her that she needs to clear the&nbsp;
window. She argues with him and Marcus about what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.320
they should do, but since none of them want to&nbsp;
listen to her she steps on the ledge next to Nick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.560
Angie and Joey break into the vault finally and&nbsp;
open it up to reveal all of Englander's riches.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.480
They have their sights on only one thing though -&nbsp;
the Monarch diamond. While they search through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.200
vault, Mercer and Nick stand side by side on the&nbsp;
ledge. Unfortunately, they don't find the diamond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.680
and when they call Nick to inform him, Mercer sees&nbsp;
him talking to Joey. Nick tells her what his plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.240
was. Since the diamond isn't in the vault, Joey&nbsp;
has to switch to plan B. They activate the alarms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.320
to distract the police and the security. Englander&nbsp;
goes to take a look at the vault and tells his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.240
guard to keep the police out while he checks on&nbsp;
the real safe where he keeps the Monarch. He's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.400
relieved to find it there and decides to take it&nbsp;
with him. Mercer comes back into the room and asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.800
to talk to IA. Mike returns and pulls Dougherty&nbsp;
out of the room, locking him out so he can speak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.680
to Nick alone. He calls him back in, saying he&nbsp;
can help. Nick tells Mike that they're talking to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.720
IA which makes Mike nervous and he reaches out to&nbsp;
grab him. At the same time, Marcus orders tactical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.360
to get Nick and two agents drop down. Nick manages&nbsp;
to escape them and jumps from one ledge to another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.480
until he gets back inside the hotel. The crowd&nbsp;
gets unruly when they see what's going on. Marcus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.640
and tactical manage the search for Nick as he&nbsp;
runs through the hotel. Meanwhile, Englander&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.040
gets back to his office and finds Joey and Angie&nbsp;
waiting for him there. Joey frisks him and finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.360
the diamond. They make him cuff himself to the&nbsp;
safe in his office and leave with the diamond.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.600
When they get to reception, they give the valet&nbsp;
a bag telling him to hold it. The man takes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.640
diamond out and puts it away. Englander gets to a&nbsp;
phone and tells Marcus that Joey has the diamond.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.840
Then Marcus tells tactical that Nick has a&nbsp;
bomb trigger and they have to take him down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.240
Mercer is searching for Mike and Nick through&nbsp;
the hotel when she gets a call-back from IA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.640
The agent tells her that they have circumstantial&nbsp;
evidence on Mike and Marcus. Nick is being chased&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.880
down by the tactical team. He runs into the&nbsp;
valet who hands him his jacket with the diamond,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.040
then shows the officers in the other direction.&nbsp;
They still catch up to Nick who steps out on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.760
ledge again and climbs up the hotel. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
Marcus finds Joey and Angie and he tortures them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.840
for information about the diamond. Nick gets to&nbsp;
the roof at the same time as Mercer and tactical.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.800
He gets on his knees when Marcus arrives and&nbsp;
arrests Mercer for obstruction. Marcus orders&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.280
the tactical team to back down so he can remain&nbsp;
alone with Nick. When they leave, Englander gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.280
Joey up on the roof and threatens Nick that he'll&nbsp;
kill Joey if he doesn't give him the diamond.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.600
Nick returns the diamond, but Englander still&nbsp;
tells Marcus to kill them. Mercer gets out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.920
her restraints and immediately heads back to the&nbsp;
roof. Marcus tells Nick to jump off the roof or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.720
he'll throw his brother off. Suddenly, Mike shows&nbsp;
up and shoots him down, but he gets shot too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.480
He apologizes to Nick for setting him&nbsp;
up as Marcus is ready to kill them both.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.920
Mercer arrives in time and kills him. Joey calls&nbsp;
over to Nick that Englander is getting away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.000
With nothing left to lose, Nick jumps off the&nbsp;
roof and fortunately lands on the air mattress&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.040
the police set up earlier. He runs after Englander&nbsp;
and confronts him in front of the crowd. Nick runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.200
over to him and knocks him down so he can get the&nbsp;
diamond. Once it's in his hand he shows it to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.680
crowd who cheer in his favor. Later, Mercer picks&nbsp;
Nick up from prison and they go to a bar where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.400
everyone is happy to see him. His father, who&nbsp;
was alive and helping him the entire time, is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.120
happiest. In the final moments, Joey asks Angie&nbsp;
to marry her with a ring he stole from Englander.
