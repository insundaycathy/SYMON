00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.080
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain a horror,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.600
mystery, and sci-fi film called "Black Box."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.760
Nolan Wright, a photographer, struggles to&nbsp;
remember anything about his life after a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.240
fatal car accident that caused severe&nbsp;
damage to his brain. Unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.160
the accident had also claimed the life of his&nbsp;
wife, Rachel. As a result, his young daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.360
Ava, has to work hard to remind him of things&nbsp;
he used to do and the people he once knew.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.040
To recover his memories, he watches a video&nbsp;
of himself when he first held Ava. He then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.280
flips through a photo album and sees pictures&nbsp;
of his family, but nothing comes back to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.800
Feeling discouraged, he tosses&nbsp;
the album away and gives up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.800
He tries to get up from the couch, but suddenly,&nbsp;
a mysterious figure holds him down and chokes him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.160
As he struggles to break free, Ava&nbsp;
calls out to him and wakes him up.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.440
Ava tells him they have to leave the house soon&nbsp;
if he wants to show up on time to his appointment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.440
As he cleans up, Ava shows him a picture of&nbsp;
a woman to check if he remembers her name.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.200
When he says "Karen," Ava corrects her and&nbsp;
tells him that it's "Cathy." Nolan recalls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.440
that Cathy has been her boss for 12 years, and&nbsp;
he was the lead photographer in their office.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.720
As he grabs his phone from the desk, Nolan hears&nbsp;
a voice message from the office of Dr. Brooks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.520
asking him if he wants to participate&nbsp;
in a cognitive research study.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.840
He ignores the call and&nbsp;
heads out the door with Ava.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.160
When they arrive at Ava's school, she&nbsp;
asks him to try their secret handshake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.240
When he makes a mistake, Ava assures&nbsp;
him that he'll remember it again.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.520
Nolan soon meets with Cathy at the office of&nbsp;
the Southern Texas Chronicle to find out if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.920
he can get his job back. However, when&nbsp;
Nolan starts showing her work samples,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.120
Cathy interrupts him and says that&nbsp;
the publisher refuses to hire him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.000
Furthermore, she points out that his new photos&nbsp;
do not have the same quality as his past work.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.600
Nolan heads back to the car in dismay and goes to&nbsp;
the hospital to see his friend Dr. Gary Yeboah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.040
Gary offers Nolan some money after hearing&nbsp;
that his former publisher turned him down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.240
but Nolan refuses. Gary notices Nolan's&nbsp;
bandaged hand and asks him what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.080
Nolan says that he punched a wall in&nbsp;
frustration. Gary hints that it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.080
like Nolan to do that at all, noting that&nbsp;
he's never seen him lose his temper before.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.000
Nolan's phone rings, and he sees&nbsp;
that it's a call from another doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.240
Gary tells him to consider Dr. Brooks'&nbsp;
offer, noting that she's one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.840
leading researchers in her field even&nbsp;
though her studies sound a bit risky.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.160
They both go to Dr. Brooks' office, but&nbsp;
Gary leaves Nolan behind to do his rounds.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.520
Inside the office, Dr. Brooks goes over the&nbsp;
details about Nolan's accident and notes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.960
he has recovered quite well. However, the Doctor&nbsp;
informs him that the pathways to his memory have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.680
not been totally corrupted and suggests that&nbsp;
he try undergoing hypnosis to recover them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.360
Nolan agrees, so Dr. Brooks immediately&nbsp;
prepares him for the session.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.200
After falling into a trance, Nolan soon finds&nbsp;
himself in the dark, hearing only the ticking of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.640
watch and a strange cracking sound. In just a few&nbsp;
moments, a hand suddenly grabs Nolan's shoulder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.040
causing him to jump up from the sofa.&nbsp;
As the Doctor tries to calm him down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.000
Nolan tells her that he had similar&nbsp;
experiences in his nightmares.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.640
Dr. Brooks explains that hypnosis&nbsp;
allows him to access his subconscious,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.840
but patients don't usually see&nbsp;
anything until after a few sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.440
She assures Nolan that his memories&nbsp;
are still hidden in his mind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.320
and she can recover them with her therapies. Nolan&nbsp;
leaves her office, saying he'll think about it.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.680
Ava waits for Nolan at the school, but her father&nbsp;
had forgotten to pick her up, so a school official&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.200
takes her home. When she arrives, she ignores her&nbsp;
father and goes straight to her room. The school&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.240
official warns Nolan that she will have to contact&nbsp;
child services if he forgets to pick up Ava again.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.200
Back at the hospital, Dr. Brooks explains&nbsp;
that she wants to try using a device she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.360
calls the "black box," which will allow him to&nbsp;
experience his memories as if he is dreaming.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.560
Before the start of the session, Dr. Brooks tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.160
Nolan that he needs to imagine himself&nbsp;
in a safe room that only he can enter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.440
Then, he undergoes hypnosis with the new&nbsp;
device and soon finds himself in a bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.840
The Doctor assures Nolan that nothing can harm&nbsp;
him in his safe room as long as he stays there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.480
but she warns him not to open the door because&nbsp;
she won't bring him back once he leaves. She then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.440
instructs Nolan to imagine an analog watch, which&nbsp;
he can use to access key memories in his mind.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.920
Pushing the crown will take him to one&nbsp;
of his memories. Turning the knob forward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.360
will allow him to go to the next one while&nbsp;
turning it backward will let him go back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.320
Pushing the crown in will take&nbsp;
him back to his safe room.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.080
Upon pushing the crown, he is&nbsp;
taken back to his wedding day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.880
He watches as the bride approaches him, but&nbsp;
her face is blurred when he lifts the veil.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.760
He looks around to find that the faces of other&nbsp;
people are blurred too. In the back, he notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.640
a man with contorted limbs approaching him. When&nbsp;
the man reaches him, he wakes up from the session.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.720
When he tells Dr. Brooks about the&nbsp;
contorted person, she says that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.640
could be his brain trying to keep him from&nbsp;
remembering to protect him from the trauma.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.880
At home, Nolan looks at the pictures of Rachel&nbsp;
on his phone and sees an image of his wedding,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.160
which was held outdoors, not inside a church.&nbsp;
He puts his phone down and notices a chopstick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.600
on the floor. As Nolan twirls it around in his&nbsp;
hand, he remembers eating sushi. The next day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.360
he takes Ava to a sushi bar and tells her that&nbsp;
he once brought her there when she was three.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.960
Later on, he goes to Dr. Brooks' lab for another&nbsp;
session and tells her that she took Ava to a sushi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.240
bar called Nise. The Doctor says that she's&nbsp;
envious because she loves that restaurant too.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.400
As they prepare for another session, Nolan&nbsp;
asks whether he would recover naturally if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.520
they stop the therapy. She tells Nolan that he's&nbsp;
suffering from a condition called prosopagnosia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.800
which causes the blurring of&nbsp;
the faces. Dr. Brooks tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.200
to try longer sessions until they get to a&nbsp;
point when he would see the faces clearly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.680
She advises him to say, "I run my mind it doesn't&nbsp;
run me" when he encounters the contorted man.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.040
When Nolan gets to the safe room, he pushes the&nbsp;
crown and finds himself in a bedroom holding a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.000
broken hanger. He hears an infant crying on the&nbsp;
baby monitor, so he goes into the next room to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.440
console her. Nolan looks at the baby and sees&nbsp;
that her face is blurred. When he looks outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.480
he notices that he's not in his house. He then&nbsp;
hears a lady sobbing in another room and follows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.040
her voice until he reaches the room. When the&nbsp;
woman turns to him, her face is blurred as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.840
Nolan notices that she has bruises on her&nbsp;
arm, suggesting that she had been beaten.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.200
He suddenly hears cracking sounds and sees the&nbsp;
contorted man climbing out of the baby's crib.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.720
He starts repeating the sentence that Dr. Brooks&nbsp;
told him. Despite this, the man continues to crawl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.440
toward him until he grabs Nolan by the neck.&nbsp;
When Nolan wakes up, he tells the Doctor that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.000
the contorted man had choked him. Dr. Brooks&nbsp;
surmises that Nolan must be getting closer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.840
to recovering his memories because his mind&nbsp;
is trying hard to keep him from remembering.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.320
Nolan noted that he was in an apartment&nbsp;
that seemed familiar to him, and yet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.320
he and Rachel had always lived in their&nbsp;
current home since they got married.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.080
Nolan visits Gary and asks him if he ever&nbsp;
got into a physical fight with Rachel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.400
Gary assures him that he never hurt his wife&nbsp;
because he would hear about it from Rachel if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.720
something serious had happened. When Nolan&nbsp;
mentions the apartment, Gary says it could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.360
be a hallucination, and his mind may have mixed&nbsp;
up a few things due to his stressful situation.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.880
While waiting for Ava at school, he starts looking&nbsp;
up the apartment he saw in his memory and decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.840
to find the building. While driving around, he&nbsp;
starts recognizing the area and parks the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.280
He leaves Ava behind, but she calls out to him&nbsp;
when the car door locks, so he takes her with him.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.000
Inside the building, he sees the dents on&nbsp;
the stairs and recalls a man tumbling down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.480
On the second floor, he comes across&nbsp;
a door that seems familiar to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.360
He knocks on the door, and a little girl opens it.&nbsp;
He asks to see the girl's mother, but he decides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.080
to go inside and take a peek before the child&nbsp;
could call her. When he enters the living room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.800
he sees the mother getting up from the sofa.&nbsp;
Nolan apologizes and walks out of the apartment.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.360
Nolan revisits Gary and gives him the address&nbsp;
of the apartment so he could investigate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.480
Gary writes the address down on his hand.&nbsp;
Nolan suspects that he had an affair,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.800
but Gary assures him that&nbsp;
he wouldn't do such a thing.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.240
Nolan goes back for another session with&nbsp;
Dr. Brooks. Once inside the black box,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.440
he gets back to the wedding, where the contorted&nbsp;
man appears again. Nolan tries ignoring the man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.960
but he keeps getting closer until he&nbsp;
finally reaches Nolan and hits his face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.320
Instead of waking up, he goes back to the safe&nbsp;
room and turns the crown. He turns up at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.960
apartment and goes straight to the room where he&nbsp;
saw the crying woman. When the contorted man shows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.000
up, Nolan knocks him down by kicking him. Nolan&nbsp;
turns the crown on the watch again and ends up in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.440
a hospital bed with extensive injuries. He sees a&nbsp;
woman watching over him, but her face is blurred.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:37.360
Nolan looks at the woman again, and this time, her&nbsp;
face becomes clear. When he turns the crown on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.600
watch to go back to the apartment, he discovers&nbsp;
that the crying woman was the same lady watching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.240
him at the hospital. Nolan turns the crown to go&nbsp;
back to the wedding and sees the same woman when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.880
he lifts the veil. He then remembers that she is&nbsp;
also the mother of the child in the apartment.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.320
When he gets back to the safe room, he realizes&nbsp;
that he has the memories of another man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.520
When he looks out the window, he sees a different&nbsp;
face in the reflection. He realizes that he's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.000
Nolan and starts recalling the day he proposed to&nbsp;
his wife and the time he brought their daughter to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.280
a sushi bar. Sitting next to him at the restaurant&nbsp;
was Dr. Brooks, whom he recognizes as his mother.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.680
Dr. Brooks hears him calling her "mom" and&nbsp;
realizes that her son Thomas has finally recovered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.480
his memories. She explains that Thomas had slipped&nbsp;
down the stairs and was taken to the hospital,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.360
but it was already too late when they got there.&nbsp;
So Dr. Brooks downloaded all of Thomas' data&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.680
from the hospital's servers and waited until she&nbsp;
could upload his consciousness to another patient.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.040
She tells Thomas that he's been gone for two&nbsp;
years. She recounted that when she transferred her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.440
consciousness into Nolan's brain, she knew that&nbsp;
her black box had worked when he grabbed her hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.120
However, his memory was not fully intact, and his&nbsp;
brain was still adjusting, so she didn't force&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.240
him to remember. After Thomas failed to recover&nbsp;
his memory on his own, she decided to invite him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:57.520
back to her lab and use the black box. The Doctor&nbsp;
then shows him a picture of his daughter, Ashley,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.440
and tells him that he now has&nbsp;
another chance to do things right.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.840
He gets out of the hospital and&nbsp;
fetches Ava from the school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.560
He tells Ava that he wants to drop her off&nbsp;
at Gary's place for a few days because it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.960
not safe to be with him. Ava starts worrying&nbsp;
about how he'll get through a day without her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.720
but when she raises her concerns,&nbsp;
he gets annoyed and snaps at her.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.720
When they arrive at Gary's house, Ava grabs&nbsp;
his hand and writes something on his palm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.760
Gary offers to let him stay at his place, but&nbsp;
Thomas insists on going back home on his own.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:31.280
So Thomas drives away with tears flowing from his&nbsp;
eyes. When he gets to the corner of the street,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.200
he looks at his palms to see Ava's message,&nbsp;
which reads, "Don't forget about me."

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.680
Thomas goes to the apartment to see Miranda,&nbsp;
but she only recognizes him as the stranger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.480
who walked into her living room uninvited the&nbsp;
other day. She threatens to call the police,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.080
so Thomas tells her that he went to school&nbsp;
with her husband, but they fell apart.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.280
Miranda hears Ashley ask about dinner, so she&nbsp;
tells Thomas that she has to prepare her something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.000
to eat. Thomas asks for another moment with&nbsp;
her, so she hesitantly invites him inside their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.520
apartment. Once inside, Thomas asks her if she&nbsp;
remembers Dr. Brooks' studies about restoring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.080
someone's consciousness using their brainwaves.&nbsp;
He tells Miranda that the experiments worked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.040
and reveals that he's Thomas, her husband. She&nbsp;
frowns in disbelief and asks Thomas to leave.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.720
Thomas starts telling her about&nbsp;
details that only he would know.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.360
For example, he points out that he decided&nbsp;
to keep the wallpaper in the apartment even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.760
though she hates it because he wants it to&nbsp;
remind him that he wants to move out someday.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:33.040
Thomas explains that the man who used to be living&nbsp;
in his new body was already brain-dead. He says he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.360
intends to use the opportunity to make things&nbsp;
right again and promises not to hurt her again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.040
However, his attitude soon changes when he notices&nbsp;
that Miranda has removed all his pictures in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.400
apartment. Thomas grows furious, wondering why&nbsp;
Miranda has removed any trace of him in her life.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.840
Miranda asks him to leave, but he gets&nbsp;
mad and tries to go to Ashley's bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.040
Miranda tries to stop him, prompting&nbsp;
him to shove her against the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.280
He goes ahead and enters the bedroom,&nbsp;
where he sees Ashley doing her homework.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.480
Ashley, who's wearing headphones, is oblivious&nbsp;
to what's happening outside her room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.720
As Thomas watches his daughter, Miranda approaches&nbsp;
him from behind and hits him in the head.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.080
Thomas wakes up to find himself in front of Ava&nbsp;
just outside Gary's house, bleeding from the blow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.560
to his head. He runs to his car and sees the&nbsp;
contorted man in the reflection on the window.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.200
Thomas drives away and visits his mom to&nbsp;
ask her how he ended up outside Gary's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.800
house with no recollection of what&nbsp;
happened. Dr. Brooks suggests that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.400
his mind took him to a place where he&nbsp;
felt safe in an attempt to protect him.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.000
Meanwhile, Gary sees the address of&nbsp;
Miranda's apartment in his hand and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.760
starts looking it up on the internet. He&nbsp;
learns from a news article that Thomas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.360
had died there two years ago and figures&nbsp;
out that he was related to Dr. Brooks.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.680
Dr. Brooks prepares Thomas for&nbsp;
another session inside the black box,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.480
telling him that he'll get better&nbsp;
when he gets rid of the contorted man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.080
She advises him to treat the man&nbsp;
like a virus that he has to kill.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.400
Inside the black box, Thomas is&nbsp;
taken back to their apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.520
As he looks at the pictures on the&nbsp;
wall, he hears a banging on the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:07.520
After unlocking the door, the contorted man enters&nbsp;
and stands up slowly to straighten himself up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.120
When the contorted man turns around,&nbsp;
Thomas discovers that he is Nolan.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.560
Thomas lets Dr. Brooks know&nbsp;
about what he found out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.080
but she tells him that the manifestation&nbsp;
is just his mind trying to hold him back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.640
Thomas starts beating Nolan up, but&nbsp;
he wouldn't fight back. He then grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.160
a knife and tells his mother to begin the&nbsp;
countdown to take him out of the black box.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.640
As he gets ready to stab Nolan, he&nbsp;
hears Ava's voice asking for her dad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.720
Ava arrives in the lab with Gary&nbsp;
and tries to wake up her father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.920
Despite his weakened condition, Nolan tries to&nbsp;
respond, whispering that he's there for Ava.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.320
Thomas becomes convinced that Nolan is still&nbsp;
alive, but his mom insists that it's not him.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.840
He tries to stab Nolan again, but this time,&nbsp;
he hears Ashley's voice asking him to stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.560
He recalls that Ashley was begging him&nbsp;
to stop while he was beating up Miranda.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.960
Ashley tries to help her mom by pushing&nbsp;
Thomas away, but he kicks her forcibly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.200
Miranda shoves Thomas to protect Ashley,&nbsp;
causing him to fall down the stairs.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.920
Thomas starts feeling remorseful and lets go of&nbsp;
Nolan. He looks at his pictures on the wall and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:13.200
heads to the door to leave the safe room. As&nbsp;
the alarm on the E.E.G monitor sounds off, Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:18.320
Brooks starts the countdown and removes the black&nbsp;
box from the patient's head. She holds his hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:23.520
thinking that he's Thomas, but as he wakes up, he&nbsp;
calls Ava over and does their secret handshake.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.920
In the black box, Thomas sits alone in the&nbsp;
dark, feeling regretful about what he's done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.800
to his wife and daughter. Dr. Brooks tries&nbsp;
to put Nolan back in the black box again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.000
but Gary stops her and reminds her&nbsp;
of the oath she took as a physician.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.320
Then, as he leaves the lab, Gary&nbsp;
sees the black box and dismantles it.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.840
Nolan gets back home feeling sorrowful over the&nbsp;
time he lost when he was trapped in his mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.600
When Ava comes over to his room, Nolan&nbsp;
tries to make up for the lost time and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.600
tells her to grab a book so he can read to her.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.240
After being dismissed from her position,&nbsp;
Dr. Brooks sits in front of the computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.240
at home and tries to activate the black&nbsp;
box again. She writes a few lines of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.240
code then loads Thomas' brainwave file&nbsp;
from a backup folder on her hard drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.160
She peeks into the box, then&nbsp;
calls out to Thomas and smiles.
