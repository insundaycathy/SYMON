00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.080
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain a drama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.360
horror, sci-fi film called "Under the Skin."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.320
A speck of light bursts across a dark space&nbsp;
in a room and shines over a sphere that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.600
slowly transforms into an eye. During the&nbsp;
transformation, a woman speaks inaudibly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.800
She adjusts her speech until she's&nbsp;
able to utter recognizable words.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.640
Somewhere in Glasgow, Scotland, a motorcyclist&nbsp;
stops by the side of a road to pick up an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.240
unconscious young woman from a field and&nbsp;
puts her into the back of a white van.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.640
Later, a female undresses the seemingly&nbsp;
dead woman and wears her clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.200
After dressing up, she stares at the&nbsp;
woman as a tear flows from her eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.080
As she prepares to leave, the Female sees an ant&nbsp;
crawling on the woman's body, so she bends down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.800
and picks it up. She allows it to crawl on her&nbsp;
fingers as she curiously observes the insect.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.160
Up in the sky, strange lights covered by&nbsp;
thick clouds hover on top of a tall building,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.120
slowly moving away from each other. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
the Female leaves a dilapidated house as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.720
Motorcyclist unloads his bike from the van. After&nbsp;
the Motorcyclist takes off, the Female goes to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.840
mall to buy some clothes and accessories. Back&nbsp;
in the van, the Female puts her lipstick on then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.120
drives through the streets of Glasgow, observing&nbsp;
the people walking by. Not long, a man alone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.240
on the sidewalk catches her watchful eye, so she&nbsp;
calls his attention by honking the horn. When the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.280
man approaches the van, she rolls down her window&nbsp;
and asks him for directions to the M8 motorway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.520
After the man gives her the directions,&nbsp;
she asks the man if he's busy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.360
The man tells the Female he's going to meet&nbsp;
someone, so she lets him go on his way.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.880
Later, she asks another man for directions&nbsp;
to the post office. The Female attempts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.920
get acquainted with the man by asking&nbsp;
him for some personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.800
However, she becomes disinterested when&nbsp;
the man tells her that he has a family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.480
When the Female spots another man on the&nbsp;
highway, she tells him that she got lost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.120
looking for the M8. Before the man could give her&nbsp;
the directions, she asks him if he's walking to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.160
be home with his family. When she learns that&nbsp;
he is living by himself, she offers him a ride.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.280
When the man hops into the van, she asks&nbsp;
him what he likes about being alone. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.080
man tells her there's no one to nag him. The man&nbsp;
doesn't seem to attract the Female's interest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.200
so she lets him out of the van and&nbsp;
continues driving through the streets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.400
After a while, the Female comes across&nbsp;
another man starts conversing with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.680
When she hears his friend calling&nbsp;
for him, she takes off immediately.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.480
Finally, the Female manages to pick up a man that&nbsp;
seems to amuse her. As they drive, the Female asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.040
the man if he has a girlfriend. After learning&nbsp;
that the man is unattached, she starts flirting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.200
with him by complimenting his looks. The man&nbsp;
responds by telling her that she looks gorgeous.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.280
When they arrive at the house, the&nbsp;
man cheerfully follows the Female,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.920
excited by the thought of sleeping with her.&nbsp;
Inside, she starts taking off her clothes as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.200
she looks seductively at the man. The man strips&nbsp;
off his clothes as well while he walks after her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.920
As the man goes further, he starts sinking into&nbsp;
the floor that appears to be made of liquid.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.120
When the man is submerged, she&nbsp;
walks back and picks up her clothes.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.840
Later that night, the Female goes on the&nbsp;
prowl again, but she couldn't find anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.080
that pleases her eye. The following day,&nbsp;
she goes to a beach and tries to pick up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.800
a swimmer by waiting by his towel. She asks&nbsp;
the Swimmer for a good spot to surf, but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.600
tells the Female that he's still not familiar&nbsp;
with the place. He had set up a tent nearby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.240
spending most of his time swimming and reading.&nbsp;
The Swimmer discloses that he's from the Czech&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.160
Republic, and he went on a trip to Scotland&nbsp;
because he wanted to go somewhere secluded.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.680
Their conversation is interrupted when they see a&nbsp;
woman struggling to swim to the shore. The Swimmer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.640
hesitates to save her, but when he sees another&nbsp;
man running towards her, he runs over to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.600
The woman soon gets lost in the water, so the&nbsp;
Swimmer rescues the other man trying to save her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.320
The Female watches the rescue attempt, but&nbsp;
she's utterly apathetic to their predicament.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.360
When they reach the shore, the man swims back&nbsp;
into the sea to find the woman. The Swimmer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.520
exhausted from being battered by the waves,&nbsp;
just lies on the shore and doesn't stop the man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.040
The Female walks toward the Swimmer&nbsp;
and hits him in the head with a rock.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.440
Later, she drags the body across the&nbsp;
beach while ignoring a crying baby nearby.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.400
The Female heads back to the dilapidated house&nbsp;
with the unconscious Swimmer on the passenger's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.880
seat. Later that night, the Motorcyclist&nbsp;
folds up the tent that appears to belong to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.200
the Swimmer while the baby cries alone near&nbsp;
the shore. The Motorcyclist picks a piece&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.960
of clothing on the ground near the infant,&nbsp;
but he completely ignores the wailing child.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.080
Soon, the Female drives around the city again&nbsp;
with the intent of picking up another man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.360
A man in another car hollers at her during a stop&nbsp;
at an intersection, but she couldn't understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.640
him. The car drives away, but the Female manages&nbsp;
to catch up to the man as he walks toward a club.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.200
She tries to follow him, but she quickly&nbsp;
turns around when she sees a large crowd.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.000
As the Female walks away, she comes across a group&nbsp;
of women who drag her with them into the bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.160
The confused Female doesn't know what to do, so&nbsp;
she joins them. The Female, unsettled by the crowd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.600
and the loud music, couldn't stay long inside, so&nbsp;
she finds her way out. When she walks into another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.080
door, she finds herself in an underground lounge&nbsp;
area where she comes across the man who hollered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.840
at her earlier. The man offers to buy her a&nbsp;
drink in the hopes that they could spend some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.400
time together. He is surprised when the Female&nbsp;
tells him that she saw him on the road earlier.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.480
After dancing for a while, the Female takes him to&nbsp;
the dark room at the house. The man dances in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.280
dark, oblivious to the strange surroundings,&nbsp;
as the Female takes off her clothes. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.920
the man removes his pants, the Female starts&nbsp;
walking backward, enticing him to follow her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.440
Soon, he sinks into the dark liquid, but he still&nbsp;
gazes at the Female without any concern about his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.640
current predicament. As she walks off, the man&nbsp;
starts to show signs of confusion as he observes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.440
the Female from below. When the Female leaves,&nbsp;
he looks at his surroundings and sees another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.320
man in front of him. He reaches out to touch the&nbsp;
other man's hand, but he suddenly drifts away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.160
Soon, the other man's body appears to implode,&nbsp;
leaving nothing but his skin. Afterward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.080
the man's pulverized remains are funneled to&nbsp;
a trough that leads to an opening on the wall.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.600
The following day, a man from another car buys&nbsp;
her a rose while she's stuck in a traffic jam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.880
When she looks at the rose, she notices some&nbsp;
blood on the covering. The Female is alarmed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.040
by the sight of blood on her hands, but she is&nbsp;
somewhat relieved when she sees that it came from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.920
the wound on the flower peddler's hand. When the&nbsp;
Female listens to the radio, she hears a report&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.040
stating that a man's body has been found washed&nbsp;
up on the beach. His wife and 18-month-old child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.120
are still missing, but the police had to stop&nbsp;
the search due to the thick fog in the area.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.480
As the Female continues driving around the city,&nbsp;
she starts observing other women walking on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.520
streets. Soon, she meets another man and&nbsp;
takes him for a ride. The man expresses his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.840
admiration for her, telling her that there's&nbsp;
something about her eyes that captivates him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.720
She smiles at him to feign interest, but she&nbsp;
immediately turns her attention back to the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.760
When she takes him to the house, the man&nbsp;
hesitantly follows her. Later on, the woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.120
is approached by the Motorcyclist in the dark as&nbsp;
she applies lipstick. After examining the Female,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.160
the Motorcyclist stares deep into her eyes as&nbsp;
if he's communicating with her telepathically.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.480
After the Motorcyclist leaves, the Female gets&nbsp;
out of the house and walks on the streets alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.480
When she stumbles to the ground,&nbsp;
she remains to lie face down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.200
dumbfounded by the experience. The Female&nbsp;
finally gets up when a man helps her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.880
As she continues walking around the&nbsp;
city, she observes the people around her.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.320
When the Female drives around&nbsp;
the city in her van again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.840
a group of rowdy men approaches her and&nbsp;
bangs on the vehicle while she's parked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.480
Instead of panicking, She calmly drives away&nbsp;
to find other men to take back to the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.520
The Female soon spots a man walking alone,&nbsp;
so he asks him for direction to Taynuilt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.840
When she learns that he's headed to the&nbsp;
supermarket along the way, she offers him a ride.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.520
When the man gets inside the van, he takes off&nbsp;
his hood, revealing his disfigured face. She asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.840
him why he shops at night, so the Disfigured Man&nbsp;
tells him that people bother him during the day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.320
because they're ignorant. As she asks him more&nbsp;
questions, she learns that the man has never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:59.440
had a girlfriend. Soon, the Female stops at a&nbsp;
corner, asking him if he wants to look at her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.520
She tells him that she liked the feeling&nbsp;
when she noticed him staring at her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.560
The Disfigured Man starts to feel uncomfortable,&nbsp;
but he denies it when the Female points it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.800
He insists that he just wants to go to the&nbsp;
supermarket. When the Female asks him if he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.440
ever thinks about being with a girl, the man&nbsp;
doesn't respond. She takes his hand and lets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.440
him touch her face. When she learns that&nbsp;
he liked it, she lets him touch her neck.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.960
After a while, the Female tells the man that she&nbsp;
has a place nearby and invites him to come with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.760
her. Inside the dilapidated house, they come&nbsp;
across a strange figure walking in the dark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.120
She tells the Disfigured Man that he won't let the&nbsp;
strange figure stop them. When the man looks back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.760
at the figure, she tells him to pay attention&nbsp;
to her as she walks backward and undresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.440
As they walk in the dark, the man tells himself&nbsp;
that he's dreaming. The Female, now fully naked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.400
concurs as she walks backward. She continues&nbsp;
walking as the disfigured man sinks to the floor.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.440
Later on, the Female walks down the stairs&nbsp;
and looks at herself closely in the mirror.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.520
Not long after, the Female walks out&nbsp;
of the house with the Disfigured Man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.400
Still naked, the man walks across a field&nbsp;
as the Female watches him from her van.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.760
Meanwhile, the Motorcyclist stops by a&nbsp;
house and smashes a parked car’s window.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.320
After opening the trunk, he walks to a garden&nbsp;
and approaches the Deformed Man as he climbs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.880
through the fence. Afterward, he puts the&nbsp;
Deformed Man on the trunk and drives away.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.400
While driving down the highway, the Female comes&nbsp;
across a thick fog, leaving the van and walking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:32.320
She stops by near a beach and listens to someone&nbsp;
singing close by. Meanwhile, the Motorcyclist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.160
stares at himself in the mirror in the house as&nbsp;
he tries to figure out where the Female went.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.960
After a long walk, the Female ends up in&nbsp;
a restaurant, where she orders a slice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.120
of chocolate cake. She takes a small&nbsp;
piece and slowly puts it in her mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.120
only choking and spitting it out. While&nbsp;
she's walking away from the restaurant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.520
a man tells her that the bus will be arriving&nbsp;
shortly, so she decides to wait at the bus stop.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.160
When she gets on the bus, the driver warns&nbsp;
her that she might freeze because she's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.040
dressed for the weather. Another man on the bus&nbsp;
approaches her and asks her if she needs help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.440
The driver tells him to leave her alone, but the&nbsp;
Female tells the man that she does need help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.840
After getting off the bus, the Female, now&nbsp;
wearing the man's jacket, follows him to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:17.040
grocery store. As the man shops for food, she&nbsp;
wanders around the store, bewildered by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.400
different items being sold. When they reach the&nbsp;
man's house, he prepares them something to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.800
She ignores the food and turns her attention&nbsp;
to the T.V., showing a man performing stand-up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.840
comedy. She watches the T.V. intently, trying to&nbsp;
understand what's causing the audience to laugh.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.840
When the man plays music on the radio, she starts&nbsp;
tapping her fingers on the kitchen table. That&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:43.200
night, the man brings tea to her room and tells&nbsp;
her goodnight. Instead of going to bed, the Female&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.560
looks at her naked body in the mirror, moving&nbsp;
her legs and arms. Elsewhere, the Motorcyclist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.400
meets up with three others, but they split in&nbsp;
different directions to look for the Female.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.040
The man and the woman take a walk in the&nbsp;
woods and stop by an abandoned castle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.240
The man notices that she appears to be cowering in&nbsp;
the corner, so he asks her if she wants to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.800
He leads her down the stairs and takes her&nbsp;
home. That night, the Female allows the man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.440
to kiss her. She closes her eyes and waits&nbsp;
as if she's doing it for the very first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
When they get to bed, he strips off her&nbsp;
clothes as the Female lets him take control.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.440
However, the man struggles as he tries to&nbsp;
penetrate her. When she suddenly feels something,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.440
she stops the man and grabs a lamp to&nbsp;
look at her private parts. The confused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.120
man asks her if she's alright, but she just&nbsp;
stares at the window through the curtains.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.120
In the morning, the Female takes a walk in the&nbsp;
woods on her own. Along the way, she comes across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.600
a logger who tells her to be careful because it's&nbsp;
slippery around the forest due to the weather.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.440
The Logger assures her that she won't&nbsp;
get lost because the pathways are marked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.800
Before going on his way, the Logger&nbsp;
tells the female to enjoy her walk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.200
Meanwhile, the Motorcyclist cruises along&nbsp;
the highway in search of the Female.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:57.920
Soon, the Female comes across a cabin, so she&nbsp;
decides to rest there for a while. She slides into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.960
a corner of the room and sleeps there. However,&nbsp;
she is soon jolted awake when he feels someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.000
aggressively stroking her legs. She runs towards&nbsp;
the woods and hides on a massive rock for a while,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.280
but she soon emerges when she sees no one pursuing&nbsp;
her. When she gets to the road, she comes across a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.840
logging truck and goes inside. She looks around&nbsp;
and tries to start it, but the keys aren't on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:23.040
the ignition. When she sees the Logger on the&nbsp;
road, she honks the horn to alert other people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.440
With no one coming to her rescue, she gets&nbsp;
off the truck and runs back to the woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.720
The Logger chases her and soon catches up to her.&nbsp;
The Logger pins her down and forcefully strips off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.880
her clothes. The Female, terrified and confused,&nbsp;
struggles as the Logger continues to force himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.120
on her. When the Logger pulls off her bra,&nbsp;
he realizes that he had ripped off her skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.240
When he looks at the Female, he is startled to see&nbsp;
her pitch-black flesh underneath the torn skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.840
The Logger runs away as the&nbsp;
Female tries to gather herself.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.640
The Female feels her way around the woods,&nbsp;
strolling and trying to hold herself together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.720
She then decides to remove the torn&nbsp;
skin, revealing her proper form.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:06.960
She kneels, looking at the human face as it blinks&nbsp;
at her. Later on, the Logger sneaks up on her and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:12.400
pours gasoline on her body. The Female gets up&nbsp;
and walks away as the Logger lights up the fuel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.800
As the flames reach her, she does not scream,&nbsp;
but she runs out of the woods and collapses on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.560
the snow. Elsewhere, the Motorcyclist stands&nbsp;
on a hilltop, looking in all directions, still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.200
trying to find the Female, who has been reduced&nbsp;
to ashes as the snow slowly extinguishes the fire.
