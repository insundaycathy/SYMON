00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.210
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.040
Today I will show you an American dark comedy
film from 2020, titled The Hunt.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.200
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.950
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.060
A woman, Athena, is seen sitting on her desk,
texting.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.060
She's texting with her friends, sharing memes,
when they start talking about the Manor and

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.220
the Hunt.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.450
A stewardess leans over to a man, asking him
if he would like something to eat.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.580
She says they have caviar, but he isn't interested
and goes on to list things that can only be

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.180
made in a kitchen.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.769
When the stewardess tells him that, he makes
some snarky remark and asks for Champagne.

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.819
She goes to get it and when she comes back
to pour it, suddenly a man stumbles inside,

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:39.660
scaring her and the others.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.659
The Champagne man says that one of them is
awake, when an older gentleman jumps up and

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.050
tries to calm the stumbling man, telling him
he's a doctor.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.539
He makes him lie down on the towels and stabs
him, to the surprise of everyone there.

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.039
The man isn't dead so he flings a bottle around,
until Athena walks in and stabs him with her

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.039
shoe.

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.429
The others mention something about "it" not
even starting yet.

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:04.159
But, as she cleans her shoe, says that there
is no sentimentality in war.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.610
The older man from before drags the stumbling
man into another compartment of the plane.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.590
He's still alive and asks for help, but unfortunately
the blonde woman he calls to is unconscious.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.210
Later, the same woman wakes up outside, with
a gag in her mouth which she can't take off.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.340
She stands up and sees another woman with
a gag across a river, making a makeshift compass.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.170
The woman acknowledges her existence for a
second, but walks away in the same time a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.610
man walks by behind the first woman.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.530
She follows him to a field with a giant crate
in the middle.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.380
A few other people are seen approaching the
box.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.750
One of them says it's a trap, but the man
still goes to open it.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.050
The others hide.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.020
He opens the crate and a pig runs out, then
he looks inside and pulls out a rack filled

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.300
with weapons.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.600
All of the people in the field go toward the
crate, including the blonde from before.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.000
She finds the keys to the gags and helps one
of the people out of it.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.090
No one knows what's happening.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.940
Suddenly someone starts shooting at them,
so they all hide.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.380
The blonde thinks she dodged a bullet, but
suddenly gets shot.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.760
One of the people on the field shoots toward
the place where the shots came from before,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.520
but gets killed too.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.269
The others are still hiding.

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.319
A woman runs out and falls in a ditch, so
one of the guys goes to help her, only to

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.870
find her impaled, though still alive.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.069
He helps her up and they run when suddenly
he steps on a landmine.

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.730
They explode.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.260
Another guy manages to run away from the shooting.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.950
He gets to a fence.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.930
Someone approaches and he almost shoots him,
but it's the man who opened the crate.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.670
Two others run toward them.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.430
They all jump the fence, except the crate
man.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.379
He gets shot with a spear and decides to face
his attackers, only to be killed moments later.

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.739
The other three escape and get to a gas station.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.260
The owners are a couple, thinking the people
are robbing the place.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.340
Blue shirt tells them they don't want their
money, he just wants to know where he is.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.829
They tell him that he's in the state of Arkansas.

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.459
He asks for the phone to call the police and
they say they'll trace the call and be there

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.459
soon.

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.019
The woman eats a cookie and immediately chokes
on it, like it's been poisoned.

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.730
Suddenly, the couple are wearing gas masks
and throw a smoke grenade at them.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.779
Before blue shirt can shoot them, the man
kills him first.

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:09.890
They choke the other one with the grenade
and then kill him too.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.669
The woman vents the gas station.

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:15.040
Later, they clean it up, disposing of the
bodies.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.939
The woman sees that blue shirt has a wedding
ring and starts feeling bad.

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.680
Her husband tells her that it doesn't matter
because he surely is a bad man.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.969
Probably even uses the N-word.

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:29.370
The couple argue about the subtleties of racism,
when they get a call on the radio.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.030
They tell the woman on the other end who they
managed to kill and she tells them that another

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.370
one of the hunted is approaching their way.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.370
They prep the gas station, as she walks toward
it and walks in to find them ready and greeting

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.650
her warmly.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.859
Crystal asks for a box of cigarettes and gets
her emergency money, then asks what state

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:45.969
she's in.

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:49.909
The woman answers her as she gets her change,
but Crystal notices something is wrong and

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.220
attacks them.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.409
She grabs the shotgun from under the counter,
kills the man first and then the wife.

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.549
Crystal checks the gas station and finds the
bodies, then grabs some rubber bands and some

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.549
ammo.

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.969
She drops her jacket and leaves the station.

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.079
There's a truck in front, so she goes to check
it out.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.110
First she sees that the plates are fake, showing
Croatian ones underneath.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.489
Then she finds a trip wire, connecting the
door to a bomb.

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.340
She hears the others talk on the radio she
snatched and hides in the bushes.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.890
They're looking for her, because they can't
find the couple from the station.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.490
They send a drone to check the station out
and someone shoots it down.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.570
The man that shot the drone appears, smashing
the drone further and as he goes toward the

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.690
truck, Crystal stops him telling him that
it's rigged.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.060
She tells him that by shooting the drone he
basically told them that they're at the gas

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.160
station and then starts walking toward some
train tracks she saw earlier.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.620
The man follows her.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.280
He tells her he has a theory about why they're
there, being hunted down.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.610
Apparently, he had read an article about a
group of liberal elites that kidnap people

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.220
and take them to a manor to hunt them down.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.630
Crystal doesn't really believe his theory.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.430
She hears a train approaching and tells the
man to run so they could catch up to it.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.470
They hop the train and once inside they find
a group of immigrants, hiding.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.790
The man says that they're not real, that they're
crisis actors.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.310
They also don't speak English.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.810
Crystal isn't convinced in his theories again.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.340
Suddenly, the train stops and the military
police searches the compartments.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.500
Crystal and the man, along with the immigrants,
surrender.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.250
The police is frisking them, when the man
decides to tell one of the officers that the

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.450
two of them are American and that the refugees
are actually crisis actors.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.430
The officers don't speak English and step
aside, when one of the immigrants speaks to

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.360
the man in fluent English with an American
accent.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.990
He says they don't believe him and the man
freaks out.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.930
The immigrant tells him that he's the only
actor and that he needs to calm down.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.100
The man tackles him and puts a grenade in
his pants, as everyone else hides.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.400
The guy blows up.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.440
Next, Crystal is in a truck being taken to
a refugee camp.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.130
Once there, she is taken to an officer who
asks her for her papers.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.970
She asks where she is and when they don't
answer, she begins guessing and finally guesses

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.760
right - Croatia.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.160
She asks them to call the American embassy.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.930
But instead, they bring in Don, another one
of the people that were hunted along with

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.930
her.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.560
The two of them go to the camp kitchen to
eat, while Don keeps sharing the same theories

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.600
with her as the other guy.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.600
Suddenly an official from the American embassy
shows up to pick them up.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.280
Later, they're seen riding with him through
the woods.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.050
Don has told him everything about their predicament
and the official is shocked, saying he'll

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.240
contact the state department and the military
to find the people that hunted them.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.310
Crystal realizes that there's something strange
about the guy, knocks him out and pushes him

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.700
out of the car.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.360
Then she backs up over him, killing him.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.280
She finds a gun in his jacket.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.930
While she looks through the trunk, Don is
freaking out that she killed the official,

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.050
until he looks inside and sees the other guy
that was with her before, dead.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.860
She finds a map and Don says that he thinks
they are the only two left.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.700
Don wants to leave in the car, but she says
no.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.360
She wants to use the map to find the people
hunting hem and retaliate.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.240
She tells him a gruesome story her mother
used to tell her, when the pig suddenly appears

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.420
again.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.800
At the bunker, the group of people hunting
them is chatting about what's politically

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.510
correct and what isn't.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.790
One of them is a soldier, their consultant.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.050
He asks them to be quiet, but they just make
fun of him.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.400
Athena's voice is heard over the radio, telling
them to shut up.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.040
One of them goes out to pee and when he gets
to a tree, Don distracts him with the pig

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.740
and Crystal kills him.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.750
Back at the bunker, the group hears a noise
outside.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.840
The soldier gives them instructions on what
to do, which they barely follow.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.280
All of them are scared, so when Don drops
the pig inside, they shoot it dead.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.370
The woman is upset that they killed the pig,
when suddenly Crystal kills one of the men

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.740
and shoots at the others.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.940
She incapacitates the soldier, then stabs
the woman.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.630
She fights one of the other men for a riffle,
but he takes out the ammo.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.530
She finds another bullet in the chamber and
shoots him.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.740
Then she goes to the sniper and kills the
last one as well.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.710
She thinks she's got them all, but suddenly
the soldier tackles her and they fight.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:55.070
Crystal pulls a pipe out of the celling and
beats him up with it, but doesn't kill him.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.970
The woman is still alive and she calls her
a hick.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.560
Crystal picks up a gun and goes to shoot her,
when Don shows up.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.710
He finds a gun and Crystal tells him to ask
the woman why they were doing that to them.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.940
She gives a stupid answer and Crystal wants
to kill her, but Don stops her, saying she's

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.000
a woman and should be spared.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.020
Crystal asks the woman if she should be afforded
mercy just because she's a woman and as she

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.370
answers no, Crystal shoots her.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:22.930
Don freaks out and suddenly Athena's voice
appears on the radio, asking if he got Crystal,

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.900
to which she points her gun at him.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.510
He says he's not one of them, as Athena keeps
asking what's going on over the radio.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.780
She tells Don to kill Crystal, as he pleads
with her not to trust the woman on the radio,

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.650
but she shoots him regardless.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.690
Crystal tells Athena that Don is dead and
Athena tells her to come and get her.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.810
Crystal sits down next to the soldier and
has a civil conversation with him, until she

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:45.620
asks where Athena is.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.060
She tells him that she won't give up and presses
his wound so he tells her where she is hiding.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.590
He gives her the information, but cautions
her that she was preparing for the hunt for

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:54.590
months.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.230
Crystal kills him too.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.320
A flashback to one year earlier takes us to
Athena's office, where two people from the

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.120
company are waiting for her.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.090
They talk about the text message she had about
the hunt.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.360
She says it was only a joke, but they tell
her that there are people who believe that

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.730
it's true.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:10.860
Athena laughs.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:15.140
But the man is persistent, calling it a possible
PR nightmare, telling her that she has to

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.260
step down from her position.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.890
She asks for a list of the people that have
made the conspiracy theory about her hunting

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.650
human beings.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.130
Another flashback to eight months prior to
the hunt, the group is choosing the people

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.950
that will be a part of the hunt.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.410
They have difficulty choosing, but Athena
tells them to continue.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:36.050
Suddenly, the slide shows a picture of Crystal,
as the man presenting the slides reads her

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.930
opinions about Athena.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.730
She gets angry and chooses her as her arch
nemesis.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.950
In the present, Crystal is walking towards
a manor.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.810
Athena talks to her on the intercom, saying
that if she doesn't leave her gun there, she

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.210
will activate the C4 under the gate.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.960
So Crystal leaves the gun there and walks
inside.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.230
Beethoven is heard in the background, as Crystal
cautiously walks inside the house and sees

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.570
the pictures of herself and the others on
Athena's wall.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.150
Athena is waiting for her in the kitchen,
cooking.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.890
She asks if she killed Don, but doesn't tell
her if he was one of them.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:11.430
Crystal doesn't know who she is, but it seems
Athena doesn't know who Crystal is either.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.900
They talk about why she organized the hunt
and Crystal makes fun of her for doing it

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.680
for the wrong reasons, coming full circle
and making the conspiracy theory a reality.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.320
And also because, she has the wrong Crystal.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.430
The woman that posted the awful conspiracy
theories online about Athena was another Crystal

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.620
with the same surname as hers.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.510
After all is revealed, Crystal grabs a knife
and goes after Athena.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.850
They fight savagely, equaling in strength
and stamina.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:40.590
Crystal throws everything she can find at
Athena, including an expensive bottle of Champagne,

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.170
which Athena manages to save from shattering.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:48.050
She kicks her over the fireplace, but Athena
gets a shotgun and goes after her upstairs.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.920
They fight for the gun, but Crystal pushes
her down the stairs and jumps down.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.200
Athena goes for a knife next and stabs Crystal.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.320
They fight outside for a moment and get to
the kitchen again, where Athena stabs Crystal

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.020
with a vegetable cutter, but as she kicks
her Crystal pulls her in and stabs her with

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.950
the other side of the cutter.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.480
Athena dies, but Crystal survives.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.790
She gets up.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.830
Eats the toast and closes her wound with a
blow torch.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:16.290
She cleans herself up and puts on one of Athena's
dresses as well as her shoes.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.300
Before she leaves, she takes the expensive
Champagne.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.330
She walks outside and sees Athena's private
jet.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.210
When she walks inside the jet, she tells the
stewardess and the captain that she killed

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:30.140
their bosses and threatens them with a gun,
telling them to take her home.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:34.130
She sits down and the stewardess prepares
a snack and the Champagne for her.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:41.050
Crystal invites her to eat and drink with
her.
