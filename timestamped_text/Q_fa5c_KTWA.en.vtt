00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.540
Time flowing backwards, changing the past,
and stopping World War 3.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.320
How can a secret agent do all 3, when terrorists
from the future are doing everything to stop

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.320
him?

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.770
I’ll be explaining the story and diving
into the possibilities of time travel.. and

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.180
THIS... is how to beat the Time Inversions
in TENET.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.230
We start off in an Opera House in the Ukraine,
following a CIA agent whose mission is to

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.860
extract an asset.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.390
The character has no name so I'll be calling
him John.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.050
Terrorists have stormed the Opera house, taking
everyone hostage and planting bombs.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.650
John finds himself trying to disarm a bomb
and nearly gets killed by a terrorist, but

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.650
is saved when a masked man kills the terrorist
by firing a bullet in reverse.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.350
What the hell is going on?

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.080
The masked man disappears, as John is able
to destroy the bombs, save the hostages, but

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.760
gets kidnapped and tortured by the terrorists.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.060
To protect state secrets, he kills himself
with a cyanide pill, only to find himself

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.150
waking up on a boat.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.990
Where his superior tells him he is now part
of a top secret mission, involving the mysterious

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.409
code word: Tenet.

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.729
Landing in Scandinavia, he meets a scientist
who is studying objects from the future, which

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.299
have somehow had their time reversed or ‘inverted’.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.979
These Inverted objects will always move backwards
in time, for example bullets will go back

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.680
into the gun instead of coming out of it.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.570
Now the implications behind this are freaking
awesome.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.359
There are so many ways for someone to take
advantage of this, not just firing a bullet

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.389
in reverse.

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:39.249
For example, I’d go full Walter White here
and combine sodium and chlorine gas to make

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:43.659
salt, because when that process is inverted,
it makes a timed gas bomb.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.130
You could do the same thing with hydrogen
and oxygen to make water, which in reverse,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.399
will blow up.

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:50.399
Cool right?

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.899
These objects are believed to be debris from
World War 3 in the far off future which John

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.200
has to stop.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.340
He decides he must get to the bottom of who
is making the inverted bullets, and why.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.289
He goes to Mumbai and teams up with a British
agent named Neil who seems like he knows more

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:06.529
than he’s letting on.

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:11.459
Together they break into the home of an arms
dealer, whose wife tells them that the inverted

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.629
bullets are being made by Andrei Sator, a
rich Russian arms dealer.

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.319
John finds out that Sator has a wife named
Kat and gets into contact with her.

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.920
She tells him about Sator’s import/export
facility in Freeport.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.900
Neil and John tour the facility, discover
there is a secret vault and make a plan to

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.900
break in.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.671
Later, we see their plan in action as Neil
and John are in the facility at the exact

00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:33.209
same time that a plane crashes into Freeport.

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.450
Triggering the facilities factory reset causing
it to go under lockdown.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.830
They are able to break into the vault, entering
this room that’s split with a divider with

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.000
these two machines at the end.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.159
This room houses a ‘turnstile’: a machine
that inverts the time of anything that comes

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.250
through it.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.750
They notice that there are holes in the glass
divider made by bullets from the future that

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.790
haven’t been fired yet, then a man in a
SWAT uniform jumps out and attacks John except

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.780
he’s moving… backwards - he’s inverted!

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.260
At the same time, his normal time counterpart
runs past Neil who chases after him.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.459
If I was going to fight an inverted person,
I’d ALWAYS check if they are hurt: cuts,

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.810
bruises, limps, if they are not: Get Out.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.810
And Run Away.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.810
Why?

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:06.810
Because you can tell if you won or lost a
future fight depending on how injured they

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.810
appear.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.810
if they’re in reverse, you’ve already
hurt them in the fight that’s about to happen.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.011
This might be the start of the fight for you,
but it’s the end of the fight for them.

00:03:10.011 --> 00:03:14.150
They learn that the metal box John saw in
the opera house is full of plutonium and heading

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.170
to Italy.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.671
Which leads him to Sator who he meets on his
yacht and talks to him about the plutonium.

00:03:17.671 --> 00:03:19.650
He tells Sator the plutonium will be passing
through Tallinn.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.530
Why he wants it isn’t clear but it’s linked
to a metal drum filled with gold bars and

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.530
papers with his name on them.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.370
Papers and gold that had been sent into the
past.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.790
John leaves the boat and reunites with Neil
and a team of agents in Tallinn.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.370
They steal the case of plutonium from a convoy,
and suddenly Sator and his men drive by to

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.609
take the plutonium, inverted and wearing masks.The
reason why they need the masks is because

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.180
their breathing is reversed, breathing out
oxygen instead of in.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.440
If they breathe in normal air, they’ll suffocate.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.629
An obvious weakness in inverted people is
their dependency for the masks.

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.489
The first thing I would try to do is rip them
off or break them.

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.879
Sator threatens to kill Kat if John doesn’t
give up the case of plutonium, so John tosses

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.499
it over to Sator, as a mysterious silver car
crashes and inverts itself.

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:04.159
Sator escapes, Neil and his team get caught
in a shootout, while Kat and John get taken

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.590
by Sator’s men.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.969
Inverted people are in the future, so they
know what you are going to do.

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:08.969
Therefore, negotiating with them is risky
since they know you’re every move.

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:09.969
But you still have one advantage.

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:15.370
Keeping a spy satellite overhead can help
you track when and where someone has been

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.370
inverted.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.950
You can set up traps ‘ahead of time’ like
diverting traffic, spike strips, or even sabotage

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.840
the supply of masks and oxygen tanks if you
know where they are.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.820
Sator’s men drag John to a warehouse where
he talks to an inverted Sator inside the turnstile’s

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.120
divided rooms.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.090
The Russian man threatens to kill his own
wife if John doesn’t tell him where the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.680
case of plutonium went.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.131
Kat gets shot and John lies about where he
left it, but gets blindsided as a normal-time

00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:40.131
Sator appears, asking the exact same questions.

00:04:40.131 --> 00:04:43.450
Suddenly, a team of special forces raid the
compound, led by Ives who rescues John in

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.380
the nick of time.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.910
Sator was using a trick called the ‘temporal
pincer maneuver’ where a team inverts themselves

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.880
and tell their normal time counterparts knowledge
of the future for the upper hand.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.990
Something Sator and his men did to find out
more about the plutonium robbery.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.530
I might try to go one step further, and use
this method against someone, by pretending

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.380
to be one of the inverted soldiers and tell
the normal-time soldier false information

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.070
that leads them into a pre-set trap.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.070
This of course only would work if you knew
they were planning a temporal pincer maneuver.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.070
Man..

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.070
This is getting crazy..

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.650
John, Kat, and Neil invert themselves to reverse
Kat’s gunshot wound which heals her, while

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.640
John goes back into the past to help himself
out.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.680
Driving the same mysterious silver car we
saw before, going back to stop himself from

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.830
handing off the plutonium.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.510
But we see that his past self pulled a trick,
tossing an empty box to the inverted Sator

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.380
and the plutonium into the silver car.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.100
The car crashes and Sator takes the plutonium
and sets the car on fire causing an explosion.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.510
But because John is inverted, he goes through
hypothermia and has to go to the hospital.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.700
When he wakes up, he realizes one very key
thing: The past cannot be changed, it can

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.760
only be turned back.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.690
This is a very important difference, but there
is still a way you can beat it.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.620
Defeating an outcome that has already happened
will not work, but creating an outcome that

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.550
has yet to occur is possible.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.620
I would try to make someone in normal time
believe that things are destined to go one

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.030
way, tricking them into action for a specific
outcome.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.620
This kind of strategy needs careful planning,
and some knowledge of the future from your

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.610
inverted self, but definitely a way to win.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.680
Dressed in SWAT gear, John and Neil sneak
Kat into Freeport to revert themselves to

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.630
normal time just as the plane crashes.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.370
John gets blown away by an inverted explosion
and dragged into a fist fight with his past

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.370
self.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.370
Escaping, Kat, Neil, and John make it back
to the turnstile where they are reverted back

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.370
to normal time.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.840
John finds out that Sator plans on inverting
the entire world by combining the 9 pieces

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.000
of inversion technology including the plutonium
to create what they call ‘the algorithm’.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.250
Hooking this inversion bomb up so that if
he dies, the bomb blows up.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.250
A bomb he’s keeping in the ruins of an old
Soviet city.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.250
The plan is for Kat to distract Sator before
he kills himself long enough that Neil and

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.250
John can take out the algorithm from the bomb.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.250
Making sure it won’t invert the world when
it explodes.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.250
The two field agents link up with Ives and
his spec-ops team to perform a temporal pincer

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.860
maneuver: Neil inverts himself with the blue
team and John goes in with the present-time

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.880
red team.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.240
Something very crucial they bring up is when
working with an inverted team mate: if you

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.540
plan on meeting up with them and they don’t
show, it’s a clear sign that something bad

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.540
happened to them.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.540
Remember, by the time the inverted team mate
links up with you, they should’ve survived

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.540
and done their job so if they don’t show,
they probably died.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.540
It doesn’t mean mission abort!

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.540
But it does mean, be very careful.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.540
The teams split up and enter the city where
Sator is hiding the bomb.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.540
John and Ives go inside the complex, but can’t
reach the bomb to disarm it because the gate

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.540
is locked.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.540
They get ambushed by one of Sator’s men
who begins to put the algorithm into the bomb.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.340
Kat kills Sator to avoid running into her
past self and kick starts the dead-man’s

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.360
switch.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.150
At the same time the dead inverted man accidentally
gets shot by Sator’s man, and immediately

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.500
gets up, unlocks the gate, and runs out, because
he’s closing it in reverse.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.880
This dead guy coming back to life actually
gives me an idea: you could pretend to be

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.400
a dead inverted soldier when you’re actually
a normal one.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.820
Since the guards are thinking you’re probably
inverted, you could easily ambush them.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.820
Or setup inverted distractions, like going
through a door and locking it which would

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.820
draw the guards in seeing the door or gate
suddenly fly open.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.160
John and Ives make it through the gate, get
the algorithm out of the bomb and escape just

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.100
before it blows up, as Neil comes to rescue
them.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.800
Ives, Neil and John agree to spread the pieces
of the algorithm around the world but John

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.800
realizes that Sator will find these pieces
in the past.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.020
Not only that but he finds out he inverted
himself way into the past to recruit Neil

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:30.730
for this mission, that Neil was the man in
the opera house and who opened the gate, AND

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.650
that John was the one who started TENET.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:39.240
This whole movie was one GIANT temporal pincer
maneuver set up by himself and Neil to save

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.240
the world!

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.240
With the past set up, the last thing John
does is assassinate Priya, letting Kat and

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.240
Max go on with their lives.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.700
There you have it, ways you can beat someone
using the time inversions and ways to use

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.700
them.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.700
But what do you think?

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.700
What else could be done?

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.180
What crazy ways can inversions be used for?

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.680
Let me know in the comments down below.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.420
With that said, thank you so much for watching,
leave a like and subscribe and if you want

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.940
more videos like this, there’s already a
playlist up on the channel where I’ve covered

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:02.660
how to beat child eating shapeshifters, masked
serial killers, and survive death games.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.530
Until next time, have a damn good day.¬¬¬
