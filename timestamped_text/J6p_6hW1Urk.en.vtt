00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.360
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.&nbsp;
Today I will show you an action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.680
sci-fi, thriller film from 2006, titled Children&nbsp;
of Men. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.440
The year is 2027. For almost two decades,&nbsp;
humanity has been incapable of reproducing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.520
and it's now on the brink of extinction - this&nbsp;
has caused society to collapse. The United&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.360
Kingdom is one of the few remaining nations with a&nbsp;
functioning government, which has caused a wave of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.760
refugees to illegally enter the nation. This has&nbsp;
brought the army to patrol the streets, catching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.120
immigrants for imprisonment or even execution.
The story begins when our protagonist, Theo Faron,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.360
enters a bakery to get some coffee and hears the&nbsp;
news on the tv: the youngest person in the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.440
passed away. After years of struggling with&nbsp;
his celebrity status his age had earned him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.840
he was attacked by a fan for not wanting to give&nbsp;
out his autograph. Everyone in the shop seems to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.480
be devastated by this tragedy, but Theo doesn't&nbsp;
look too bothered. He leaves the bakery and only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.800
stops a few feet away to add whiskey to his coffee&nbsp;
when suddenly there is an explosion from the shop.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.400
There's lots of screaming and alarms going&nbsp;
off, but thankfully Theo doesn't get hurt.&nbsp;

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.880
With an annoying ringing in his ears and still&nbsp;
unbothered, Theo goes to work as if nothing had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.680
happened. In the office, almost nobody is getting&nbsp;
actual work done, they're too busy crying over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.160
loss of the world's youngest person. Theo takes&nbsp;
this as an opportunity: he lies to his boss and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.080
tells him he's upset over the news too, so he&nbsp;
asks permission to finish his work at home before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.560
leaving. On his way back, the train he's taken&nbsp;
is constantly on the receiving end of stones from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.040
rebels and indigents. There also are many cages&nbsp;
filled with refugees and guarded by the cops on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.080
the station. This still doesn't make Theo even&nbsp;
blink. Outside the station, Theo meets with his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.720
old friend Jasper Palmer. After a hug, they get&nbsp;
in Jasper's car and drive to his place in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.040
countryside while discussing the bakery explosion,&nbsp;
considering the idea it may've been the government&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.760
itself that planted the bomb. They see a bus&nbsp;
pass by, taking refugees to a camp in Bexhill.&nbsp;

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.240
Jasper's place is hidden in the woods, so hidden&nbsp;
that they need to stop the car and move some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.800
decoy branches away to be able to pass. Jasper&nbsp;
makes fun of Theo for his lack of love life and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.440
his alcohol problem, he also offers him to come&nbsp;
live with him, but Theo turns down the offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.800
Once they're inside the house, we learn&nbsp;
through photos and newspaper clips that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.800
Jasper used to be a political cartoonist&nbsp;
and his wife Janice was a photojournalist.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.600
These days, however, Jasper became a hippie and&nbsp;
pot dealer, and Janice is in a catatonic state&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.920
since she was tortured. There are also are old&nbsp;
pictures of Theo with a woman and a little boy.&nbsp;

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.040
After saying hi to Janice, Theo and Jasper hang&nbsp;
out on the couch smoking and discussing various&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.280
topics. Jasper mentions his main client&nbsp;
is an immigration cop at the Bexhill camp,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.040
and they argue over the possible existence&nbsp;
of the Human Project, a secret scientific&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.720
organization with hidden facilities where they're&nbsp;
trying to find a cure to humanity's infertility.&nbsp;

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.360
Theo is back at his home the next day and when he&nbsp;
leaves for work, he's kidnapped in the street by a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.760
militant group called the Fishes. Face covered,&nbsp;
they put him in the van and don't uncover him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.800
until they have him in Fishes territory. When Theo&nbsp;
opens his eyes again, he is in a protected room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.720
and he sees for the first time in years his&nbsp;
ex-wife Julian Taylor, who apologizes for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.880
theatrics but they had to do this to avoid the&nbsp;
police. She's been a wanted woman since their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.360
activist days, but Theo has left that life behind.&nbsp;
After explaining they weren't the ones who put the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.760
bomb in the bakery, Julian takes Theo outside&nbsp;
for a walk. The reason why she's made him come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.920
is that she needs transfer papers for a refugee&nbsp;
girl to get to the coast, and Theo can get them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.720
through his cousin. Theo turns down the idea&nbsp;
and when Julian offers monetary compensation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.520
he says he doesn't need her money: an obvious&nbsp;
lie. Since he isn't collaborating, Julian makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.680
her people cover his face again and take him&nbsp;
out of their place. While on the van, one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.840
the Fishes tells Theo this has never happened and&nbsp;
that they'll always be watching him. Another one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.920
gives him a paper sign to hang on the tube in case&nbsp;
he changes his mind, then Theo is thrown in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.800
middle of the street with some change for the bus.
Sometime later, it seems Theo does end up changing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.480
his mind, because he pays his cousin&nbsp;
Nigel -who works as a minister- a visit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.920
A fancy car with its own driver picks him&nbsp;
up and takes him to the private residence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.920
where the minister keeps and restore classic&nbsp;
works of art, like Michelangelo's David, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.320
is missing a chunk of its leg. After hugging,&nbsp;
they have lunch together with the minister's son,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.240
who ignores them completely while playing&nbsp;
on a screen connected directly to his body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.720
After asking his cousin about his wife, Theo asks&nbsp;
for the transfer papers by making up a story that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.800
they're for his girlfriend to be able to visit&nbsp;
her very sick brother in Brighton. Nigel points&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.720
out it's a huge favor since it's highly controlled&nbsp;
and, after yelling at his son to take his pills,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.000
he asks Theo to follow him to the window,&nbsp;
where he tells him he'll see what he can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.480
Theo wonders why Nigel keeps all this art when in&nbsp;
a hundred years there won't be anyone to look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.600
it, Nigel replies he just doesn't think about it.
Hours later, Theo is at a pub and is approached&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.760
by one of the Fishes, Luke, who saw the&nbsp;
sign Theo had been given posted outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.840
Theo explains he did get the papers, but they're&nbsp;
joint, so he is the one who will have to escort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.040
the girl, a task he'll accept if he's paid more.&nbsp;
Luke accepts because Julian thinks highly of Theo.&nbsp;

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.280
The next day, Theo is approached by one of the&nbsp;
Fishes again while he's betting on the dogs - a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.160
woman that shows him the same sign he used the&nbsp;
day before. He follows her outside and onto a bus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.800
where Julian is waiting for him. She asks about&nbsp;
the papers before reminiscing about the old days,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.920
but they end up arguing over the way&nbsp;
they handled the passing of their child,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.640
Dylan, and eventual separation. When they reach&nbsp;
their stop, they hurry out of the bus and Theo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.960
takes the chance to ask why he was chosen,&nbsp;
Julian says she trusts him. He also asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.120
what will happen to them, and Julian says she&nbsp;
doesn't know before pecking his lips. She says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.280
he's only come for the money. After crossing a&nbsp;
bridge, they walk under it to meet with Luke,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.520
who gives Theo his money as soon as he asks for&nbsp;
it. While explaining to him that he'll be taken to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.440
the first check point in Canterbury and then he'll&nbsp;
be on his own with the girl, they get in the car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.600
where Theo is introduced to a woman named Miriam&nbsp;
and the young girl he'll be escorting, Kee.&nbsp;

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.320
They drive to Canterbury. Theo sleeps at the&nbsp;
beginning of the trip, but when he wakes up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.720
later on, he and Julian reminiscence about their&nbsp;
old days as activists and play a little game with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.040
a golf ball. When they're about to reach their&nbsp;
destination, they're ambushed by an armed gang.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.000
Julian gets shot. They manage to drive away from&nbsp;
the gang, but then it's the police that arrive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.960
and chase them instead. Luke has no other option&nbsp;
but to stop the car - however, when he gets out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.160
he shoots both cops before returning to&nbsp;
his place behind the wheel and getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.320
everyone out of there as soon as possible.
They stop to say their goodbyes to Julian.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.400
The two women cover the body with a shawl and&nbsp;
pray, while Theo pretends to be unaffected until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.880
he distances himself from them, then he allows&nbsp;
himself to cry. It doesn't last long though,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.960
because Luke quickly tells them to get back in the&nbsp;
car so they can leave before they're caught again.&nbsp;

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.480
It's nightfall when they reach a Fishes safe&nbsp;
house, where the entire group is meeting to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.040
vote for their new leader. Theo asks for a ride to&nbsp;
London, but he's told it's too dangerous and he'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.240
have to wait until the next day. Instead, he's&nbsp;
offered a shower and clean clothes. After washing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.720
up, he chitchats with one of the Fishes before&nbsp;
Miriam comes looking for him to take him to Kee.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.600
She takes him to the barn while the&nbsp;
Fishes vote for Luke as their new leader.&nbsp;

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.800
Inside the barn, Theo is left alone with Kee,&nbsp;
who says Julian told her stories of their child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.480
and if things got bad, she should talk to Theo&nbsp;
because he's the only one she can trust to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.040
her to the boat called The Tomorrow. Theo doesn't&nbsp;
want anything to do with this, so to convince him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.840
Kee takes off her dress and reveals her secret:&nbsp;
she's pregnant. Theo is shocked, not believing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.240
what he's seeing, but the moment is interrupted&nbsp;
by Luke, who takes them all back to the house.&nbsp;

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.320
They watch the news on the tv: Julian's body&nbsp;
has been found, and they're now looking for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.640
people that were with her in the car. The police&nbsp;
think they'll be able to identify them soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.240
An argument starts then about what they should&nbsp;
do with Kee: the Fishes don't want to make her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.400
public because the government will take her baby&nbsp;
away, but Theo thinks she needs proper care.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.760
There's also the matter of the Human&nbsp;
Project being rather difficult to contact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.000
so they may lose their only chance if they don't&nbsp;
go to meet that boat. Kee decides to stay and have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
her baby in the safe house, but she still wants to&nbsp;
be taken to The Tomorrow after her baby is born.&nbsp;

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.840
Later that night, Theo can't sleep, so he is awake&nbsp;
to hear the noises of people arriving outside. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.000
sneaks around to secretly learn what's going on:&nbsp;
it's the people that attacked them earlier. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.840
ambush had been Luke's plan so he could become the&nbsp;
leader and take control of the baby to use it as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.400
political tool in their revolution. Theo won't&nbsp;
allow this, so he rushes to Kee's and Miriam's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.720
bedroom to tell them what's going on and help them&nbsp;
escape. They sneak outside and while hiding from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.800
the guards, they carefully approach each car -&nbsp;
they disable two of them and enter the third one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.040
which won't start. Theo gets off and starts&nbsp;
pushing it, gaining the attention of the Fishes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.520
Theo gets back in the car, which still doesn't&nbsp;
start but at least is moving thanks to the fact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.440
they're going downhill. The men are going after&nbsp;
them but aren't allowed to shoot because the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.520
is in the car, so they try to grab them through&nbsp;
the window, but Theo and Miriam push them away.&nbsp;

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.880
The car stops once more mid-hill, Theo gets&nbsp;
out to push it again. It gets it moving, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.720
it also gives the chance for one of the Fishes to&nbsp;
catch up with them and point his weapon and Theo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.040
who pushes him off by hitting him with the door.&nbsp;
At the base of the hill, the car gets stuck in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.440
mud, so Theo gets out to push while Miriam&nbsp;
jump starts it. It takes her a few tries but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.520
the car does end up working, so well in fact&nbsp;
Theo has to run after it to get back inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.840
Miriam stops it for him and with Theo back&nbsp;
with the women, they manage to escape the farm.&nbsp;

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.400
Theo tells Miriam he knows of a place where&nbsp;
they can hide and takes them to Jasper's house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.960
who receives them with open arms. While having&nbsp;
diner, they discuss their options: the Human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.680
Project's boat will have two stops, and neither of&nbsp;
them looks good. Windsmore is too far away to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.400
it there in time, and the Bexhill is the refugee&nbsp;
camp. Jasper thinks that's the solution, and tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.120
them to eat while he gets some things ready.
The next morning, Miriam is outside practicing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.440
something similar to yoga and Kee is braiding&nbsp;
Janice's hair. Theo approaches her and asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.440
her about the pregnancy: she's eight months&nbsp;
pregnant and she doesn't know who the father is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.600
At that moment, Jasper returns with a plan: the&nbsp;
group can go to the Bexhill camp and meet with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.920
Jasper's cop buyer, who will smuggle them inside&nbsp;
so they can get to their boat. Kee accepts this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.440
plan. Night falls. While Theo is having a drink,&nbsp;
he hears the others sharing a smoke and chatting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.520
Jasper tells the women the story of how Theor&nbsp;
and Julian met: as protestors in the middle of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.240
rally by chance, and their relationship took a bad&nbsp;
turn when they lost their kid to the flu pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.360
Not being able to hear more of it, Theo&nbsp;
leaves them to their chat and goes to bed.&nbsp;

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.440
The next morning, everyone's woken up by&nbsp;
the alarm: the Fishes have found them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.440
Jasper gives Theo the instructions of how to&nbsp;
contact Syd then sends him to the car with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.160
the women, refusing to go with them. He wants to&nbsp;
stay, saying he's gotten out of worse situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.840
Theo drives the girls away but stops the&nbsp;
car at a hill to look at what's going on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.320
in the house from afar: the Fishes arrive and&nbsp;
not liking Jasper's answers, they shoot him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.400
Theo doesn't tell Kee this, he says everything&nbsp;
is ok before driving away for good this time.&nbsp;

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.680
They make it to their meeting point the next day:&nbsp;
an abandoned school. While Kee enjoys the swings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.000
Miriam tells Theo about her old job as a midwife&nbsp;
and how she saw the infertility issue affect all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.360
her patients little by little. A truck arrives&nbsp;
then: it's Syd, their contact. After exchanging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.280
the password, Syd gets them in the truck&nbsp;
and drives them away to the refugee camp.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.720
Kee has her first contraction on the way,&nbsp;
they tell Syd is just her being carsick.&nbsp;

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.680
They make it to Bexhill, and Syd tells them to&nbsp;
put on sad refugee faces before moving them from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.240
the truck and into a bus filled with refugees&nbsp;
that quickly leaves the area. Soon enough, Kee's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.720
contractions start getting worse and by the time&nbsp;
they make it to the actual camp, her water breaks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.800
A guard notices her estate of distress, so&nbsp;
Miriam distracts him by acting as if going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.440
through religious mania, so she's taken away&nbsp;
to be executed. He's also about to take Kee,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.200
so Theo points at the water on the floor between&nbsp;
her legs and says it's urine and excrement,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.320
effectively driving him away.
Theo and Kee leave the bus and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.240
join a line where Theo loses Kee for a short&nbsp;
moment when a guard tells him to lose his clock,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.320
but they reunite soon after. The line that is&nbsp;
eventually released into the city that became&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.000
the refugee camp, and there they look for&nbsp;
Marichka, a Romanian woman that takes them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.840
to a safe abandoned building and gives them&nbsp;
a private room where Kee can have her baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.800
Labour is hard on Kee, but Theo guides her, and&nbsp;
eventually she gives birth to a healthy baby girl.&nbsp;

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.040
The next day, Syd comes by to check on&nbsp;
them. The city's become a dangerous mess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.880
after a wall blew up and people started to&nbsp;
flee, so Syd's come to help them escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.440
When he sees the baby, he promises he'll take&nbsp;
them to a boat, but Marichka is against this idea,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.840
implying he isn't a good man. Syd takes out his&nbsp;
gun then and reveals he knows there's a bounty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.560
on their heads that he plans to earn. On their&nbsp;
way downstairs, Marichka manages to push Syd off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.800
and Theo jumps on him to get him away from Kee.&nbsp;
After Marichka hits him with a stick, the three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.200
of them start running away, with Syd breathing&nbsp;
on their backs. They go down a hallway to reach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.880
a street and when Syd gets stuck on the door,&nbsp;
Theo finishes him off with a brick to the head.&nbsp;

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.680
Theo asks Marichka about the boat, and after&nbsp;
some confusion on her part, she catches on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.360
and starts guiding them to it amidst all the&nbsp;
fighting between the military and the Fishes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.800
She makes them enter a building and after&nbsp;
showing the baby to the owner through a window,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.960
they're allowed to enter a very nice apartment.&nbsp;
There they eat, rest and get better shoes for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.200
Theo while two elderly women play with the baby.&nbsp;
One of the guards tells them they need to leave in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.040
an hour, so when that time passes, they put&nbsp;
Kee on a wheelchair and leave the building.&nbsp;

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.080
They're running again, and soon they're found by&nbsp;
Luke and the Fishes. Luke takes Kee and the baby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.080
with him and leaves the other Fishes to shoot&nbsp;
Theo and Marichka. They're about to do so when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.240
more military arrives, giving Theo and Marichka&nbsp;
a chance to run from them and try to find Kee.&nbsp;

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.880
Theo gets separated from Marichka but he&nbsp;
keeps going, avoiding soldiers and Fishes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.960
until he makes it inside a building under&nbsp;
heavy fire. After climbing various stairs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.960
he finally finds Kee and her baby near Luke, who&nbsp;
is trying to convince them of his good cause when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.760
a bomb goes off in the building, ending his life.&nbsp;
Theo grabs Kee and the baby and escorts them out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.960
not having trouble leaving the building&nbsp;
because everyone is awed by the baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.640
The refugees touch them as if they were a&nbsp;
vision, and when they are stopped by the Fishes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.280
they also let them pass. While leaving the&nbsp;
building, the soldiers who enter noticed the baby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.600
and start yelling to stop the firing so they can&nbsp;
let them pass. As they walk away everyone outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.600
stare at them in shock, but the fire resumes&nbsp;
when the trio is far enough from the building.&nbsp;

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.880
They quickly get back to the building entrance&nbsp;
where they had been captured and reunite with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.640
Marichka, who finally takes them to an underground&nbsp;
passage where their boat is waiting for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.560
After refusing to join them, Marichka&nbsp;
pushes the boat and sends them to the sea.&nbsp;

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.280
Theo rows until they make it to the bouy that will&nbsp;
serve as their rendezvous point. While waiting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.680
Kee notices blood on the boat and Theo tells&nbsp;
him it's his, he's been shot, but he's fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.920
When the baby starts crying, Theo teaches her to&nbsp;
burp her, and Kee decides then that she will call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.480
her daughter Dylan, after Theo's child. It is&nbsp;
then that Theo loses consciousness and perhaps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.080
even passes away exactly as The Tomorrow&nbsp;
arrives to take Kee and Dylan to safety.
