00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.639
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.930
Today, I'm going to show you a drama, sci-fi,
thriller film called “Gattaca.”

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.380
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.280
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.020
In the future, humans have perfected genetic
sequencing and DNA manipulation.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.150
Parents now have the choice to edit their
children’s genes during insemination.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.760
Diseases can now be eliminated, as well as
bad traits such as body odor, baldness, and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.330
undesirable physical characteristics can be
removed.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.660
Lives are considerably longer and humans now
enjoy the benefits of living a long and healthy

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.660
life.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.750
These edited babies have become the norm and
are classified as valid members of society.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.930
Even with this advancement, some humans are
still conceived and born naturally.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.980
These natural-born and naturally conceived
people are treated as second-class citizens

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.290
and are derogatorily called faith-births or
God children and are classified as in-valids.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.940
Jerome Morrow prepares to head to work as
a mission navigator in Gattaca.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.280
It’s noticeable that his morning routine
is unlike any normal person’s morning preparations.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.629
He begins by shaving as much excess hair as
he can.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.760
After a shower, he gets into an incinerator
and removes all the dead skin from his body

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.220
before burning it.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.250
He takes a urine pack and conceals it around
his thigh.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.020
He then takes a fake fingertip, filling it
with blood stored in a fridge and places it

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.020
on his own.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.470
At his desk, Jerome cleans his keyboard, using
a small vacuum to remove any dead skin or

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.470
hair.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.570
His boss, Director Josef, approaches and tells
Jerome he’ll be a mission flight navigator

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.240
on a flight to Saturn’s moon, Titan.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.200
He also informs Jerome that he’ll be undergoing
a substance test soon.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.970
Josef leaves and Jerome plants several dead
skin particles from a container into his keyboard,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.620
and places a strand of hair on his comb.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.970
At the clinic, Jerome gives the doctor, Lamar,
his urine sample.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.020
Lamar tests the urine and the result shows
Jerome is a valid individual.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.770
Lamar mentions his son and tells Jerome to
remind him to mention him another time.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.170
Irene Cassini, a colleague, approaches Jerome
and congratulates him.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.060
The pair watch rockets launch into space,
and Irene comments that it’s only Jerome

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.060
who watches the launches daily.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.859
Jerome then walks back to his desk but notices
his colleagues gathering.

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:15.989
Jerome thinks about how his selection as flight
navigator had been guaranteed since his birth

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.249
but reveals, through thought, that he isn’t
Jerome Morrow.

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:27.749
In a flashback, Antonio and Marie Freeman,
conceive Vincent through a natural process.

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:31.829
Marie gives birth to a healthy baby boy, but
a nurse draws blood and runs it through a

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.340
machine that can predict the possibility of
future illnesses.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.370
Antonio listens as the nurse recites all the
possible illnesses and medical conditions

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.140
that the baby could suffer.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.750
This included myopia, heart disease, and a
life expectancy close to 30 years.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.569
Antonio names the baby Vincent, and Marie
cradles the infant in her arms.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.430
It’s revealed that this baby, Vincent, is
the one portraying Jerome.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.359
Determined to prevent the situation happening
a second time, the couple decides to have

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.930
a second baby but have its genes altered.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.069
A doctor explains that their next baby would
have no disposition to any inheritable disease.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.049
He also tells them that he took the liberty
to remove any potentially prejudicial conditions

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.980
such as baldness, alcoholism, myopia, and
obesity.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.099
Marie tells the doctor they only wanted the
diseases removed and nothing else, but the

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.469
doctor answers that they would want their
child to have the best possible start in life,

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.859
considering the amount of imperfection naturally
built into humans.

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.220
This is how Vincent’s brother, Anton, came
into the world.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.049
Even at their early years, the effect of gene
manipulation is immediately noticeable.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.099
Anton is growing faster and stronger than
Vincent even though he’s younger.

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.219
Vincent also notices his parents’ liking
for Anton.

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.079
Vincent develops a small distaste of his brother.

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.310
As a child, Vincent develops a liking for
outer space, space travel, and dreams of becoming

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.310
an astronaut.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.750
His parents try to discourage him, considering
his underlying medical conditions.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.279
Antonio tells him that Vincent would only
be allowed on a spaceship if he were to clean

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:01.279
it.

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:05.589
As a young man, Vincent realizes this soon
enough as he’s rejected at all of his screenings

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:07.629
and job applications.

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.819
The two boys, now older, compete with one
another to see who could swim the farthest.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.120
Anton always wins but this time, Vincent felt
something was going to change.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.359
Determined to beat his brother, Vincent overtakes
Anton and leads the race.

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.430
Finally, Anton becomes too exhausted and starts
sinking.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.080
Vincent quickly comes to his brother’s aid,
rescuing him, and leading him back to shore.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.759
This, Vincent believes, was the single moment
in their lives where Anton was not as strong

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.759
as he believed, and Vincent was not as weak.

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.840
Vincent then decides to leave his family once
and for all.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.580
He begins work at Gattaca as a janitor.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.370
Vincent fantasizes of working in Gattaca,
staring blankly at the workers coming in daily.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.780
He sits in one of the desks and pretends as
if he were working as a navigator.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.539
Vincent continues studying and training, but
he realizes he’ll never get the chance to

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.190
achieve his dreams because of his genes.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.150
Having no other choice, he gets in contact
with a gentleman who offers his services in

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.409
creating identities.

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.479
Vincent gets the opportunity to become a valid
individual.

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.960
He is introduced to Jerome Morrow, a genetically
superior man who suffered an accident and

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.630
is now a paraplegic.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.490
Jerome has a high IQ, perfect vision, superior
strength, and a long lifespan.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.450
Now being a paraplegic, Jerome would no longer
have use for his superior DNA; a paraplegic

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.379
weakling would no longer be accepted into
society.

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:32.680
Jerome is then reduced to selling his DNA
and identity to continue living comfortably.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.639
Vincent would pose as Jerome in Gattaca, and
he would give a portion of his salary to sustain

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:37.849
Jerome.

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.220
Vincent has to wear contact lenses both to
see and to match his eye color with Jerome’s.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.060
He then changes his hair cut and appearance,
making it look as close to Jerome as possible.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.380
Finally, he gets surgery to lengthen his legs.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.190
Time soon came for Vincent to apply for Gattaca.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.969
He brings a sample of Jerome’s urine and
blood.

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:59.449
As soon as it’s confirmed that his genes
are valid, he gets in.

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.090
Each day, Vincent would have to dispose of
loose skin, fingernails, and hair.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.199
He would then bring Jerome’s urine, blood,
and other DNA traces for the constant tests.

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:12.490
While Jerome supplied the DNA, Vincent provided
money.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.840
Snapping out of his flashback, he moves closer
to his crowding colleagues and sees that a

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.919
mission director has been beaten to death.

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.069
Investigators swarm Gattaca, retrieving as
much DNA trace as they could.

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.389
Vincent has unknowingly left one of his eyelashes,
and one of the investigators picks it up for

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:29.409
testing.

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.939
Vincent is worried he won’t be able to launch
for Titan because of the incident but Josef

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:36.159
assures him everything would still proceed
as scheduled.

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:40.129
Jerome is concerned that Vincent’s DNA might
get detected during the investigation but

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:42.129
Vincent tells him not to worry.

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:45.870
He speculates that he’d already be on his
way to Titan by the time they find out about

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.409
his fake identity.

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:49.740
The pair then head out to celebrate.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.949
Back in Gattaca, Irene is suspicious of Vincent
and looks through Vincent’s desk for hair

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:56.729
strands or dead skin that she can have tested.

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:01.020
She finds Jerome’s hair strand and takes
it to a DNA processing station.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.250
She is relieved to see that the person she
knows as Jerome, is valid.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.819
After a night out, Jerome and Vincent arrive
home, and Vincent puts Jerome to bed.

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:13.080
Jerome reveals that his accident was no accident
at all.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.199
He had willingly stepped in front of a moving
vehicle in an effort to end his life.

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:20.860
He then tells Vincent that he’s proud, and
Vincent tells Jerome that he’s drunk and

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.319
should go to sleep.

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:27.030
At a police laboratory, Vincent’s in-valid
DNA pops up, and the primary investigator

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.330
working on the case takes notice.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.819
The following day, the investigators are back
at Gattaca, placing the eyelash owner as their

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:35.500
primary suspect.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.919
They find out that the man, Vincent Freeman,
worked at Gattaca as a janitor.

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:43.830
The head investigator says that, according
to the invalid’s records, he should already

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.699
be dead by that time.

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:50.199
Not wanting to leave any stone unturned, he
proposes they sift through entry logs, believing

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:52.840
the killer could be working in Gattaca.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.260
Later on, Vincent meets with Irene.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:00.059
Irene then admits that she had procured his
hair strand and had him tested and apologizes.

00:08:00.059 --> 00:08:04.090
She reveals to Vincent that, though her genes
were engineered, she still had a high risk

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.620
of heart failure, preventing her from joining
any mission to space.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.699
She offers a hair strand in return but Vincent
dismisses it, saying he doesn’t need to

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:13.710
have her tested to fully trust her.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:18.710
At home, Vincent tells Jerome that the police
found his eyelash at the scene, and now, Vincent

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.990
is a suspect.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.419
He’s concerned that he’ll get recognized
and considers escaping.

00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:27.020
Jerome gets angry, telling Vincent he’s
being too paranoid.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.900
Jerome assures Vincent that he won’t get
recognized as they’ll think it an impossibility

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.229
that one of their own elites had been an invalid
all this time.

00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:37.849
Later that evening, Vincent heads out with
Irene on a date.

00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:41.750
In Gattaca, the head investigator orders the
cops to have a look at the trash as there

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.360
could be more evidence.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.610
He also orders checkpoints and routine checks
around the city to filter any invalids posing

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.280
as valids.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.730
After enjoying a lovely piano concert, Irene
and Vincent drive down a highway before running

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.180
into a checkpoint.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.940
The cops are checking the eyes, looking for
contact lenses.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.190
Vincent discreetly removes his contacts but
is rendered blind.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.459
They get through the checkpoint without arousing
suspicion.

00:09:05.459 --> 00:09:09.209
Down the road, Irene tells Vincent she wants
to show him something.

00:09:09.209 --> 00:09:12.560
She parks the car at the side of the road
and crosses the street through a gauntlet

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.860
of high-speed moving vehicles.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.360
Vincent follows but is having trouble seeing
without his contact lenses.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.570
His vision is reduced to a blurry mess of
lights and shapes, but with determination,

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.260
he makes it across.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.600
The couple arrives at a solar farm, watching
the sunrise.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.810
While romantically strolling down the farm,
Irene notices Vincent’s eyes looking different

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.050
but dismisses it immediately.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:38.300
At the crime lab, the investigators get another
confirmation of Vincent’s DNA from a paper

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.830
cup in the trash.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.589
They suspect that Vincent could be in disguise,
working in Gattaca.

00:09:43.589 --> 00:09:47.339
The head investigator finds this improbable,
because an invalid would fail to meet the

00:09:47.339 --> 00:09:51.370
mental capacity or the physical stamina required
to work at Gattaca.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.270
The cop suggests drawing blood from every
employee in Gattaca to better filter out the

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.600
imposter.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.310
The next day, Vincent lines up to get his
blood taken for testing.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.140
He enters a room and Lamar starts drawing
blood.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.920
Luckily, Vincent came prepared with a vial
of Jerome’s blood.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.850
As Lamar injects him, Jerome flinches, as
if in pain and gets up.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:15.200
He quickly swaps the vials and hands Lamar
the vial with Jerome’s blood.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.650
With the mass blood testing yielding no significant
information, the investigators want to request

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:24.000
another test but Josef refuses, stating they’ve
wasted too much time.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.600
With the launch in two days, he doesn’t
want more setbacks that could interfere with

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.460
the schedule.The investigators have no choice
but to leave.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.920
Irene and Vincent go on another date, this
time at a fine dining restaurant.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.259
Vincent asks Irene to dance, and the two share
an intimate moment.

00:10:39.259 --> 00:10:42.490
Vincent tells Irene that all he’s ever wanted
is to leave the planet.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:46.710
He finds it a comedic irony that, with the
launch so close, he finally finds a reason

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:47.860
to stay.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:52.230
In the middle of their moment, the police
burst in and ask everyone to stay inside.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:57.190
Caught completely off guard, Vincent drags
Irene outside, exiting through the back door.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:02.720
A cop tries to stop them but Vincent assaults
him, pummeling his face, rendering him unconscious.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.220
He takes Irene and the pair find a hiding
spot.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.090
The head investigator calls out to Vincent
in the alley, looking more concerned and worried

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.449
than determined.

00:11:10.449 --> 00:11:12.560
Irene asks who Vincent is.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.550
Vincent almost answers, but she tells him
to keep quiet.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.579
Irene chooses to stay ignorant.

00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:20.190
She leans in closer, and the two kiss.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:24.199
The two spend a night together, and Vincent
wakes up in Irene’s bed.

00:11:24.199 --> 00:11:28.180
Worried he’ll leave traces of DNA, Vincent
heads to the shore and desperately scrubs

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.130
himself clean with a rock.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:34.240
He goes back to Irene’s house, and she notices
his surgery scars.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.160
Vincent tells her that he got it from an accident,
and Irene plays along.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.880
At the police headquarters, the head investigator
examines a photo of Jerome and cross-references

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.930
it with a picture of Vincent.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:49.810
The next day, the head investigator is at
Vincent’s desk, examining it for DNA.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:54.480
Josef assures him that Vincent, he calls Jerome,
is one of their best employees and has nothing

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.020
to do with the murder.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.339
Irene sees this and warns Vincent.

00:11:58.339 --> 00:12:02.180
The detective catches up with Irene and brings
her to see Jerome at home.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:07.639
Meanwhile, the cop examines the murder victim
and retrieves saliva from the victim’s eye.

00:12:07.639 --> 00:12:12.040
Seeing Irene and the detective leave, VIncent
calls Jerome, telling him the investigator

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.259
is on his way.

00:12:13.259 --> 00:12:17.570
Jerome then drags himself up the stairs, pulling
himself up every step.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.019
As the doorbell rings, Jerome barely gets
to the intercom.

00:12:21.019 --> 00:12:25.200
He gets to a chair and sits himself as the
investigator and Irene enter.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.550
Irene sees the real Jerome, for the first
time, and is incredibly confused but keeps

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.690
her demeanor.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:34.639
Jerome and Irene act as if they’ve known
each other, and the investigator suspects

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:36.610
something is not what it seems.

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.839
He takes Jerome’s blood and runs it through
his DNA reader.

00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:43.730
He proceeds down the stairs but suddenly gets
a call from the cop that the suspect has been

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:44.970
apprehended.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.089
The investigator rushes back up and leaves.

00:12:48.089 --> 00:12:52.540
Vincent appears behind Jerome and Irene is
distraught to learn she’s been lied to.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.570
Vincent chases after her but Irene distrusts
him.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.959
Vincent finally admits to her that he’s
an invalid and tells her he has far exceeded

00:12:58.959 --> 00:13:01.610
his projected life expectancy.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.339
Vincent tells Irene that invalids are not
just a reflection of their predicted outcome,

00:13:05.339 --> 00:13:06.820
but are much more.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.630
Irene gives Vincent a confused and shocked
look, and leaves.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.740
At the precinct, the cop has apprehended Director
Josef.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.360
It’s revealed that the victim was a big
hindrance to the flight to Titan and wanted

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.639
to cancel it.

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:22.600
With the flight only happening once every
seventy years, the director felt like he needed

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.820
to do everything to ensure the flight stays
on schedule.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:30.720
The suspect is caught and the case is closed
but the investigator looks unsatisfied.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.199
That night, Vincent finds the investigator
at his desk.

00:13:34.199 --> 00:13:38.360
Vincent confronts him and the investigator
asks Vincent how he can’t recognize him.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.329
The investigator reveals himself as Anton,
Vincent's long lost brother.

00:13:42.329 --> 00:13:46.430
He tells Vincent their parent’s died not
knowing Vincent is still alive.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.500
Vincent becomes defensive, saying Anton is
only after him because he can’t accept that

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.509
an invalid can have such a prestigious position.

00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:57.850
Anton expresses his concern about the amount
of fraud Vincent has undergone.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:02.120
Anton asks Vincent to come with him, and to
stop his illegal activities.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.010
Vincent raises his voice, saying Anton only
wants to see him fail.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.459
Anton then challenges Vincent to another swimming
contest.

00:14:09.459 --> 00:14:13.759
The brothers head to the stormy shore, strip
down, and head into the water.

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:17.209
They start swimming, getting farther and farther
from land.

00:14:17.209 --> 00:14:20.569
Anton starts struggling and asks Vincent to
stop.

00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:22.769
Vincent taunts him, and they continue.

00:14:22.769 --> 00:14:26.170
Anton asks Vincent how he’s got so far with
his life.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.850
Vincent answers he got this far because he
never hesitated or doubted himself in whatever

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.160
he does.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.160
Anton tries to swim back but starts drowning.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.480
Vincent comes in for the rescue and they swim
back to shore.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.850
Vincent finds Irene and she guesses Vincent’s
eyesight was bad that night they tried to

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:45.009
cross the street, but he appreciates him still
crossing the street for her.

00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:48.350
Vincent gives her a strand of hair if she
still wants to have him tested, but Irene

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.399
lets it loose in the wind.

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:54.110
At their house, Jerome tells Vincent that
he’s left enough genetic material for him

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.810
when he returns.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.519
Vincent asks why he’d left so many and Jerome
says that he might also be going on a trip

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:00.680
of his own.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.720
Jerome thanks Vincent for sharing his life
with him.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.839
Vincent may have gotten Jerome’s body, but
Jerome achieved Vincent’s dream.

00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:11.600
Vincent gave Jerome a sense of fulfilment
he couldn’t attain before, and for that,

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.710
he thanks him.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.440
Jerome hands him an envelope and Vincent leaves
for the launch.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:21.600
At Gattaca, Lamar informs Vincent that a new
policy has been put in place, asking the passengers

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.389
to have their urine tested before the flight.

00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:27.740
Vincent didn’t bring a pack of Jerome’s
urine and is left with no choice but to fill

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.029
it with his own.

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:32.170
Lamar runs the test and Vincent comes out
as invalid.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:36.009
Lamar then tells Vincent about his son, who
idolizes Vincent.

00:15:36.009 --> 00:15:40.490
His son wanted to apply for work in Gattaca
but was rejected, deemed having an inferior

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:41.490
gene.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.970
It’s revealed that Lamar had known since
the beginning that Vincent had a fake identity

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:46.860
and kept it to himself.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.370
He sees Vincent as a living antithesis for
those thinking invalids would never amount

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.370
to anything.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:54.899
Lamar changes the result, marking Vincent
as valid.

00:15:54.899 --> 00:15:57.990
Vincent then boards the spacecraft and waits
for the launch procedure.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:02.550
Meanwhile, Jerome crawls into the incinerator
and waits for the fire to ignite.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:06.010
As flames engulf him, he lays peacefully motionless.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.920
The rocket launches, beginning its flight
to Titan.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:15.710
As the ship exits the atmosphere, Vincent
opens the envelope and sees a lock of Jerome’s

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.619
hair.
