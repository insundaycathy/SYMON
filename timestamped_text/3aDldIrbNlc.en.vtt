00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.600
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain an American horror film called “The boy”.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.640
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.720
A woman named Greta Evans, travels to&nbsp;
the United Kingdom after being hired as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.160
a nanny by a rich family. Upon her arrival, she&nbsp;
immediately takes off her shoes and looks around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.040
the mansion because the owner is away. She is&nbsp;
surprised by the arrival of a man named Malcolm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.880
Malcolm himself is a local&nbsp;
delivery man, who stops by often.
&nbsp;

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.360
Then Malcolm invites Greta for a tour. Not long&nbsp;
after, comes an elderly woman, Mrs Heelshire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.480
the house owner's wife. Mrs Heelshire asks&nbsp;
where Greta's shoes are. Greta shows where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.080
she had taken off her shoes, and she is surprised&nbsp;
as they are gone. Mrs Heelshire casually says,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.240
it is probably her son's doing. Then Mrs Heelshire&nbsp;
invites Greta to meet her husband, Mr Heelshire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.880
She also introduces her to the boy she is&nbsp;
supposed to babysit. But to her surprise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.560
this boy turns out to be a porcelain doll named&nbsp;
Brahms. She laughs, thinking it’s a joke. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.240
Mrs Heelshire and Mr Heelshire look serious.
Mrs Heelshire tells Greta, that many nannies had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.400
applied for the job, but Brahms turned them down&nbsp;
because they are neither young nor beautiful. 
&nbsp;

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.440
The Heelshires teach Greta on taking care of&nbsp;
Brahms; leaving her a list of strict rules&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.960
to follow. This includes reading to Brahms in a&nbsp;
loud and clear voice, playing loud music for him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.360
keeping the leftovers in the fridge, setting a&nbsp;
mousetrap , and giving Brahms a goodnight kiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.160
Mrs. Heelshire tells Greta that Brahms is&nbsp;
shy and only moves when no one is watching.
&nbsp;

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.440
Mr and Mrs Heelshire then ask Brahms his&nbsp;
opinion on Greta. Greta feels strange with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.880
what she sees. Mr Heelshire closes the&nbsp;
door for privacy. Before long, the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.200
of them come out and tell Greta that Brahms&nbsp;
like Greta and he wants her to babysit him.
&nbsp;

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.160
Greta calls her sister to tell her&nbsp;
about her experience in the house.
&nbsp;

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.520
The following day, Greta hears Mrs Heelshire,&nbsp;
who is angry because it turns out that Brahms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.960
ransacked his room. Then, Mr Heelshire comes,&nbsp;
saying that they are going on vacation, leaving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.840
Greta alone with Brahms. Mr Heelshire shows some&nbsp;
of Greta's schedules for the next few days.  
&nbsp;

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.200
After they leave, Greta begins to&nbsp;
ignore the rules, leaving Brahms alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.120
Greta wakes up hearing strange noises in the&nbsp;
middle of the night, and Greta immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.429
looks for the source of that strange noise.&nbsp;
While in front of a painting...

00:02:26.548 --> 00:02:27.440
suddenly a hand

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.640
is coming right out of a wall to choke&nbsp;
her. It turns out to be a nightmare.  
&nbsp;

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.800
Then Greta checks into Brahms' room&nbsp;
and sees tears welling up in his eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.720
When examined, it turns out that the ceiling is&nbsp;
leaking. That night, suddenly, Greta gets a call.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.160
But when she picks it up, no one speaks.  
In the morning, Malcolm comes to deliver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.040
groceries, and Greta asks a few questions about&nbsp;
Brahms. Malcolm tells her that Brahms was once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.880
a real boy and was the only child of Mr. and Mrs.&nbsp;
Heelshire. But then, one day, their house caught&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.800
fire and after not being able to escape on time,&nbsp;
Brahms died. The doll is simply a coping mechanism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.800
for the family to deal with their loss.
Malcolm then asks her out for a date that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.160
night. Greta agrees. Greta gets ready for&nbsp;
the date. While on the phone with her sister,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.560
Greta sees that Brahms is watching her,&nbsp;
and she closes the door. Greta continues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.920
to shower. However, she is surprised to find that&nbsp;
her hair has been cut, and her dress and necklace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.480
are missing. Greta then rushes to look for it;&nbsp;
she is lured to the attic by strange noises.
&nbsp;

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.720
She climbs the ladder, and suddenly, the attic&nbsp;
ladder closes by itself. Greta is locked inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.880
Malcolm comes to pick up Greta, and&nbsp;
Greta shouts for help, but Malcolm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.760
doesn't hear her .And he leaves instead.  
Greta then tries to find another way out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.360
Then suddenly, a huge shadow appears in front&nbsp;
of her face, shocking her. And she faints.
&nbsp;

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.840
In the morning, when Greta wakes up, she is&nbsp;
mysteriously let out. She explains to Malcolm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.840
what happened last night. It turns out that&nbsp;
the ladder can close and open on its own. 
&nbsp;

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.280
Greta asks Malcolm about Brahms once again, and he&nbsp;
states that there are two rumours about Brahms.
&nbsp;

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.520
There are some people in the town who feel&nbsp;
sorry for him as they remember him being a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.240
very good boy, but on the other hand, there&nbsp;
are others who claim that the boy was evil.
&nbsp;

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.880
Later that night, Greta calls her sister&nbsp;
again. Her sister tells her that her abusive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.760
ex-boyfriend named Cole, has been trying to find&nbsp;
out where she is. Greta hates Cole very much.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.880
Greta suffered a miscarriage&nbsp;
after being beaten by Cole.
&nbsp;

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.400
Greta then gets ready for bed and brushes her&nbsp;
teeth. Just as she finishes brushing her teeth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.200
she hears a strange noise from Brahms'&nbsp;
room. She approaches. And Brahms' room is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.840
seen very messy with a lot of papers scattered.
She straightened Brahms' head which is tilted,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.360
and suddenly the head moves by itself,&nbsp;
but it is just another nightmare.
&nbsp;

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.960
The next day, Greta goes to Brahms' room and&nbsp;
see that Brahms has changed his position.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.680
He sits with her schedule beside him as if he&nbsp;
is asking Greta to obey and do everything as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.720
scheduled. Greta, who is shocked, immediately&nbsp;
runs to her room and tries to call her sister.
&nbsp;

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.240
Suddenly the phone rings. As Greta answers the&nbsp;
phone, a child's voice is heard telling Greta&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.000
to follow the rules. Then a shadow appears under&nbsp;
the door, and a child's voice is heard. Greta now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.840
realises that the doll holds far more secrets than&nbsp;
she had initially imagined. The doll is alive!
&nbsp;

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.880
Greta then opens the door and sees a tray of food&nbsp;
filled with sandwiches that Brahms has given her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.840
At that time, Greta has mixed feelings. It&nbsp;
turns out that Brahms doesn't want to hurt her;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.160
he just wants her attention. She then&nbsp;
calls Malcolm and tells him about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.360
but Malcolm doesn't take her seriously. 
A scene later reveals Mrs and Mr Heelshire writing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.000
a letter to Brahms which states: “We cannot bear&nbsp;
to live with what you have become. The girl is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.280
yours now.” After writing this letter, both Mr.&nbsp;
and Mrs. Heelshire stuff their coats with rocks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.800
and commit suicide. 
Greta, who now realises that Brahms is only the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.880
spirit of an innocent young boy who wants to&nbsp;
be cared for, is then starting to be nice to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.680
Brahms and do the things entrusted to her. The&nbsp;
following day, Malcolm comes with a letter from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:06.080
Mrs Heelshire and Mr Heelshire. He also asks Greta&nbsp;
out for a walk that evening. However, Greta now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.560
feels responsible for Brahms and refuses Malcolm's&nbsp;
invitation. Disappointed, Malcolm leaves. Greta is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.800
then surprised by Brahms, who can move places&nbsp;by himself.
&nbsp;

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.280
The following day, Greta asks Malcolm to&nbsp;
come, to show that Brahms is actually alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.000
At first, she fails to prove it because the&nbsp;
doll only moves when no one is watching.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.280
So she then leaves the doll alone and it&nbsp;
moves. Eventually, Malcolm believes her.
&nbsp;

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.280
That night, Malcolm stays with Greta. The two are&nbsp;
spending their time together . But their activity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.000
is stopped by Brahms, who is possibly jealous.&nbsp;
Then the two of them have a conversation in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.200
kitchen. Malcolm realizes that Greta is getting&nbsp;
attached to him, he warns her by disclosing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.240
more detailed story surrounding Brahms’ death.&nbsp;
According to what he knows, when he was a child,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.280
Brahms used to play with another girl of his&nbsp;
age named Emily Cribbs. On Brahms’ 8th birthday,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.640
Emily went to play with Brahms in the&nbsp;
Heelshire mansion and never returned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.680
Her body was later discovered in the woods with&nbsp;
her skull crushed. When the cops arrived at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.160
mansion to question the young boy, it was already&nbsp;
burning down and Brahms was later found dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.840
With this, Malcolm concludes that Brahms’ spirit,&nbsp;
which resides in the doll, could possibly evil.
&nbsp;

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.920
In the morning, Greta’s abusive ex-boyfriend,&nbsp;
Cole, shows up at the mansion, intending to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.600
force Greta back home. For Greta's safety,&nbsp;
Malcolm stays nearby. At night, Greta asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.920
the doll for help. Cole wakes up and sees a&nbsp;
message written in blood telling him to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:38.000
Believing it was done by either Greta or Malcolm,&nbsp;
he becomes furious. Realizing that Brahms did it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.920
using rat blood, she tries explaining it&nbsp;
to him, but he refuses to believe her.
&nbsp;

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.960
Eventually, Malcolm ends up joining them and he&nbsp;
too tries to convince Cole that there’s a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.680
more to the doll than meets the eye. Cole gets a&nbsp;
fit of anger and he smashes the doll to pieces. 
&nbsp;

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.400
This is when the lights in the house start&nbsp;
to flicker. The house begins to shake and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.880
they hear noises behind the walls. Cole tries&nbsp;
to figure out where the noise is coming from.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.920
Then, suddenly, the mirror explodes. Cole falls&nbsp;
behind. From a hole behind it, emerges a man who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.880
turns out to be the real now-adult Brahms wearing&nbsp;
a porcelain mask identical to the doll's face.
&nbsp;

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.840
Brahms beats Cole and kills him. Malcolm&nbsp;
and Greta are frightened and run for safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:23.280
Greta and Malcolm discover Brahms' room. There,&nbsp;
they find a doll made from Greta's missing dress,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.640
hair, and jewelry sits in Brahms' bed. From that&nbsp;
room, Brahms has been watching Greta all this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.120
time. Greta also finds the goodbye letter&nbsp;
from the Heelshires, revealing their plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.800
of leaving Greta behind as a mate for Brahms.
Then Brahms finds them. Brahms knocks out Malcolm,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.600
threatening to kill him if Greta leaves. Greta&nbsp;
is able to escape the house but returns to save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:49.120
Malcolm. Arming herself with a screwdriver, she&nbsp;
invokes the rules and forces Brahms to bed. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.560
asks for a good night kiss; when he tries to kiss&nbsp;
her, she stabs him. Brahms tries to choke her but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.360
she pushes the weapon in deeper and he collapses.&nbsp;
Greta rescues Malcolm and they escape the house.
&nbsp;

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.560
In the closing scene of the film, Brahms can be&nbsp;
seen putting back pieces of the doll together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.280
suggesting that he is probably still alive.
From all of this, we can deduce that Brahms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.400
never died in the first place. He was always a&nbsp;
twisted little kid and he ended up murdering Emily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.120
Cribbs on his 8th birthday. To save him from&nbsp;
the world, his parents burned their own house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:24.160
and faked his death, and hid him in the walls of&nbsp;
their grand mansion. It also reflects on why Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.360
and Mrs. Heelshire committed suicide. Eventually,&nbsp;
their guilt outweighed their love for their child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.920
and they decided to end their own suffering.
Also, there are several hints dropped throughout&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.400
the runtime of the film, that lead up to its&nbsp;
big reveal. In the beginning of the movie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.480
when Mrs. Heelshire tells Greta about the&nbsp;
rules of the house, she makes it clear that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.360
Brahms likes his music loud. This suggests&nbsp;
that since Brahms lives in the walls, music&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.680
or anything that is being read out to him should&nbsp;
be loud enough to be audible through the walls.
&nbsp;

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.520
The Heelshires also seem to be very particular&nbsp;
about keeping their house vermin free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.760
They emphasize on how she’s expected to&nbsp;
keep the mouse traps clean so that none&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.400
of the mice enter the walls of the house. 
Mr. Heelshire also tells her that they save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.800
all of their uneaten food and it is pretty&nbsp;
obvious that all of this food goes to Brahms.
&nbsp;

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.720
Mrs. Heelshire tells Greta that Brahms&nbsp;
is shy and only moves when no one is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.332
watching. 

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.360
This shows that the doll was never actually&nbsp;
moving on its own but was being moved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.389
by the real Brahms who lives in the walls.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.760
That's my explanation for&nbsp;
the movie " The boy".
