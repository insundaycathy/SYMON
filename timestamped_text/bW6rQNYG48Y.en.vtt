00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.880
Welcome to Slash Forward. Hey, have you&nbsp;
ever had an unusual itch behind the ear?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.080
Or experienced infant allergies that eventually&nbsp;
just stopped one day? How about high-pitched&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.360
shrieking inside your brain, lost chunks of&nbsp;
time or total blackouts? It could be that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.400
unbeknownst to you, your body has become the&nbsp;
plaything for an advanced civilization that has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.600
decided to visit Earth and explore every aspect&nbsp;
of our bodies with their technology. Honestly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.040
I can’t blame them, your body is worth exploring.&nbsp;
This is the scenario presented by the subject of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.680
this video, the 2013 Blumhouse production Dark&nbsp;
Skies. In an attempt to forego the common tropes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.160
setting aside bright lights in the sky and&nbsp;
livestock mutilations, this film attempts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.600
to explore a more grounded accounting of alien&nbsp;
contact under the assumption that any sufficiently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.120
advanced technology would give the appearance&nbsp;
of being almost magical. With the only known&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.560
strategy for dealing with this being to learn&nbsp;
to live with their probings and interruptions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.960
and to put up as much as a fuss as possible in&nbsp;
the hope they won’t snatch one of your kids,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.920
what would you do to protect your family from&nbsp;
aliens who seem capable of phasing through solid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.360
matter? Be sure to leave a comment below, because&nbsp;
I’m keeping a log for my personal survival guide.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.840
Also, if you like the video, hitting the like&nbsp;
button would help me out a lot. Let’s get to it.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.880
We open on a quote questioning our&nbsp;
place in the universe, which is deep,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.480
before we open on a peaceful, picturesque and&nbsp;
very active suburban neighborhood. Literally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.960
everyone is engaged in an activity of some&nbsp;
type or another - including our protagonists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.680
the Barretts. Daniel’s got the meat going&nbsp;
while they await the arrival of their guests.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.680
Young Jesse is called home to fulfill&nbsp;
his familial responsibilities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.400
cutting short his bro time, which appeared&nbsp;
to be heading toward mutual masturbation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.880
He heads home after sundown where his family&nbsp;
is gobbling down their dinner. Through casual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.320
conversation we learn that Jesse longs to be taken&nbsp;
seriously and viewed as a mature young man. Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.360
as they all settle in for the evening, Daniel&nbsp;
learns he ranks out lower than real estate on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.960
Lacy’s totem pole, and Jesse reads spooky stories&nbsp;
to his brother Sammy over their walkie-talkies.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.160
Later on, Lacy goes to placate her restless&nbsp;
leg syndrome with some midnight wanderings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.280
and she comes across evidence that makes it&nbsp;
appear they have been ransacked by a rabid E.T.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.040
In the morning they find it curious&nbsp;
that the rambunctious critter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.160
ate the lettuce but left the bacon, but&nbsp;
they otherwise brush the whole thing off.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.800
We get some more general context as Daniel&nbsp;
heads off for a big interview where he,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.920
unfortunately, brings the small dick energy,&nbsp;
resulting in a likely instant rejection.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.440
Which is revealed to be hell in&nbsp;
regards to their financial sitch.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.000
Stressed to the max, he chooses to play things&nbsp;
cool in front of the wifey, a sound strategy.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.120
That night, we're reassured that the sliding door&nbsp;
is locked before mom ends storytime for the boys.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.200
She wakes up again and goes to check the&nbsp;
locks, only to discover the animals have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.240
really been popping off in terms of their creative&nbsp;
endeavors. After a quick check of the back door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.480
Sammy confides that he had a dream in&nbsp;
which the Sandman came to his room.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.000
The next day, with no evidence&nbsp;
of forced entry, Officer Powell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.600
suggests this would have had to have&nbsp;
been caused by someone with a key or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.160
perhaps a sleep-puzzler from inside the&nbsp;
home. He leaves them with no intention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.560
to investigate further and the suggestion&nbsp;
that they reactivate their alarm service.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.160
Lacy has a showing later for a young&nbsp;
couple looking at a fixer-upper. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.920
makes a strong connection with the mother,&nbsp;
having gone through the stress of Jesse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.200
being a sickly child. Unfortunately, this&nbsp;
genuine rapport removes her seller’s edge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.800
*you can probably do better*&nbsp;
Wouldn’t you be the one to show them?

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.440
That night, we see the system has been&nbsp;
reengaged. Then, while watching TV in bed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.240
Daniel hints at his poor job-interviewing&nbsp;
performance by casually suggesting they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.760
cut back on the cable. Unwilling to give up&nbsp;
her HGTV, they both get set off. This leaves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.520
the boys to try to reassure each other&nbsp;
through the comfort of short wave radio.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.240
Thankfully, the alarm does its job. But,&nbsp;
other than unnerving everyone, it provides&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.680
no other useful information as it declares&nbsp;
all sensors were tripped at the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.120
indicating a malfunction. He shares the&nbsp;
encouraging news, but then follows Lacy’s gaze.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.920
The Sergeant of Incredulity returns,&nbsp;
and again tries to guide them toward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.560
investigating their own kids as some&nbsp;
people do weird stuff in their sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.240
This message is reinforced when the&nbsp;
alarm guy doesn’t find anything wrong.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.240
So they all sit down for an old-fashioned&nbsp;
family jam sesh, just to chat it out and try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.960
to ascertain anyones’ motives or possible&nbsp;
involvement in the strange happenings.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.320
Jesse still insists he was sleeping, but Sammy&nbsp;
clams up when Lacy asks about the Sandman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.160
because he has been sworn to&nbsp;
secrecy *he told me not to tell*

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.880
This leads to a parental freakout, which is&nbsp;
aggravated by their trust issues. Despite the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.840
lack of photos in his room, they presume he is&nbsp;
having some psychological trouble. They agree to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.800
pursue this further with a professional as Daniel&nbsp;
scratches at a persistent itch behind his ear.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.640
The next day at the park Daniel finds&nbsp;
himself incapable of confiding in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.560
best bud due to a crippling fear&nbsp;
of being ostracized by his peers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.840
This is exacerbated when Sammy&nbsp;
goes ahead and pisses himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.120
Daniel tries to help him shake it off and move on,&nbsp;
but Sammy’s not having it, so back off dickweed.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.920
Then, back at home, a thematic classic - a&nbsp;
child’s picture containing an unnervingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.440
foreign character. Although,&nbsp;
on the grand scale of things,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.440
this discovery absolutely pales in comparison&nbsp;
to the hail of birds that then bomb their house.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.000
During clean up out back, dirty Kevin tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.600
pick up one of the birds and learns&nbsp;
about avian flu for the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.440
While out front Mr. Barrett requests they&nbsp;
do their best to try to figure this out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.600
because his family has been really stressed out&nbsp;
lately, and they don’t need this adding to it.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.000
Later on, Sammy intimates that the episode&nbsp;
he had at the park was caused by his psyche&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.840
phasing into another realm of&nbsp;
existence, which is troubling.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.120
Again, Lacy wakes up after twilight, since no&nbsp;
one’s yet thought about trying to just stay up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.160
As she walks the hall, she hears Sammy talking&nbsp;
to someone and finds a slender man in his room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.920
The lights reveal the room to be empty, but&nbsp;
it doesn’t take long for them to locate him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.800
slow streaking the yard. After they get settled&nbsp;
back in, they wonder about how he managed to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.920
out without setting off the alarm, and also&nbsp;
how to interpret Lacy’s visual hallucination.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.120
Daniel, of course, handles this&nbsp;
with aplomb *let’s not get crazy*

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.240
Some time later we see that Jesse has been using&nbsp;
his mom’s realtor code to get into vacant houses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.680
Seems innocent enough until&nbsp;
Kevin shows up with the girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.240
and the weed. In a private moment Jesse&nbsp;
engages in some repartee with Shelly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.280
but finds his one source of experience in these&nbsp;
matters has failed him miserably. Nevertheless,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.640
she takes some measure of pity on him. He rides&nbsp;
home as if on a cloud and as though nothing could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.560
ever bring him down...but is soon&nbsp;
sobered by an ominous foreboding.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.800
At home the Barrett’s have invested heavily&nbsp;
in beefing up their security measures. As&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.520
Daniel calibrates the boys try to stay calm&nbsp;
and wonder aloud why daddy is spying on them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.400
in their rooms. The hard drives spin as the&nbsp;
night wears on with everyone sleeping soundly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.880
in their respective beds. Daniel wakes up at his&nbsp;
station and begins scrubbing through the video,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.480
but the only thing he finds is a short&nbsp;
period of strange interference in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.800
feed that seems to work its way through&nbsp;
all the occupied rooms and back out again.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.920
Later on we see Lacy back on that grind, and&nbsp;
she’s got a fish on the hook - unfortunately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.640
her pitch is derailed when she suffers a&nbsp;
sudden episode that causes her to behave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.680
somewhat abnormally. Thankfully she wakes&nbsp;
up, feeling only mildly unsettled. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.760
dread begins to mount, however, when she&nbsp;
finds a nasty bruise on her forehead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.800
Then she gets a call from Pete asking what up&nbsp;
with freaking out her clients before putting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.960
her on an involuntary furlough. Right after&nbsp;
this she gets a call from the department of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.840
wildlife - there were no traces of bird flu,&nbsp;
and it was three different flocks of birds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.840
So, explanations are not forthcoming. Unsure&nbsp;
whether the agency has Alta Vista or not,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.480
Lacy decides to sit down to do some of her&nbsp;
own research. She soon finds herself squarely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.600
inside the rabbit hole, uncovering evidence that&nbsp;
suggests what’s happening to them is not unique.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.240
But it’s not all darkness as Daniel has a&nbsp;
cracking interview and scores a paying gig.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.680
This lightens the general mood and&nbsp;
brings some much needed relief,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.240
which is celebrated with a&nbsp;
babysitter and some hardcore boning.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.160
Lacy wakes up alone and goes looking for&nbsp;
Danny. She finds him outside staring at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.960
the stars with his O-face still locked in&nbsp;
place. Then he leaks a bit and walks back in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.840
tracking blood all over before snapping out of&nbsp;
it. As they watch this unfold on the monitor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.800
Lacy decides it’s a good time to share her&nbsp;
news of the day. She also shares her research,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.520
which points to a variety of governmental&nbsp;
and extra-terrestrial conspiracy theories.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.600
Despite the clear similarities and the&nbsp;
risk of one of their children vanishing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.560
Daniel can’t bring himself to consult with the&nbsp;
wacko subject matter expert who lives downtown.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.560
But the events of the next day promise to&nbsp;
force their hand as a trip to the local&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.680
pool reveals Sammy’s torso to be riddled with&nbsp;
mysterious bruises. Elsewhere, Jesse breaks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.720
the cardinal rule of venturing into the woods&nbsp;
with a psycho and finds himself running for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.840
cover. He emerges in a clearing where a strange&nbsp;
noise enters his brain and gives him the fits.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.600
With no physical trauma that would cause&nbsp;
a seizure, the doctor suggests the cause&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.480
was emotional trauma. Oh, but there is some&nbsp;
physical trauma, in the form of a complex,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:34.160
geometric branding that he found on Jesse’s skin.&nbsp;
While he admits that it is a bitching design, he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.680
is also a mandatory reporter so they should expect&nbsp;
a visit from CPS sometime in the near future.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.200
This is a lot to take in, but&nbsp;
Daniel finds a way to cope,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.280
which involves running down and assaulting&nbsp;
a minor. After he messes with the bull&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.200
and gets the horns, things begin to&nbsp;
settle back down for a moment...and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.720
then Sammy comes home. Fed up with all the&nbsp;
confusion and uncertainty, Lacy desires answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:05.760
Daniel vows to get them and deal with it, just&nbsp;
like he did today *Daniel the hero* Ow, my ego.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.320
Later that night Daniel wakes up to a familiar&nbsp;
disturbance and rushes to Sammy’s room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.520
and is relieved to find nothing - in Sammy’s&nbsp;
eye sockets. This one was a confirmed dream,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.840
and Daniel returns to his monitor with a little&nbsp;
brown and starts reviewing the footage again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:25.200
This time he takes it frame-by-frame until,&nbsp;
amid the distortion, he finds a shadowy figure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.760
He goes to wake Lacy up to let her know&nbsp;
that he’s now in a believing state of mind.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:35.120
The next day they meet up with Mr. Pollard for a&nbsp;
consultation. They discover him to have a sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.080
research display aesthetic going on. Pollard&nbsp;
confirms his scholarly specialty is in what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.360
he calls the Grays, and then begins a series&nbsp;
of qualifying questions. These questions were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:51.040
designed to weed out common tropes to uncover&nbsp;
the true symptoms of an alien visitation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.000
Upon passing the test, he explains basically&nbsp;
that the motivations of these beings are unknown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
other than they seem to be generally&nbsp;
curious about our biology. The result&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.240
of these studies and experiments seem to&nbsp;
be the ruination of their subjects’ lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.480
They control you through implants that most&nbsp;
affected people don’t even know they have,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.280
and that can’t be removed - see? If the testing&nbsp;
escalates and they begin revealing themselves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.000
that usually indicates they’re&nbsp;
ready to snatch their first contact.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.880
Concerned for Sammy’s safety, Pollard reveals&nbsp;
the only real possibility of repelling them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.960
is to just try to make the snatching&nbsp;
so difficult they decide to move on.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.520
With limited options due to the already&nbsp;
present risk of losing their kids to CPS,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.640
they forge ahead on their own. Daniel seeks out&nbsp;
some advice from the gunman while Lacy adopts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.520
the most aggressive rescue dog she can find.&nbsp;
Despite bringing home a new pet and a new gun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.760
Jesse is upset by all these changes.&nbsp;
He heads off to find comfort in Shelly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.720
who advises that, while his dad may be a weirdo,&nbsp;
he ain’t crazy. In consideration of this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.000
Jesse returns at dusk, ready&nbsp;
to fight to protect the family.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.240
That evening they cry their way through a&nbsp;
patriotic dinner. The mood is momentarily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.920
saved with the sharing of fond memories, but then&nbsp;
ruined again by an electromagnetic disturbance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.480
The kids are stashed away upstairs while&nbsp;
Daniel waits patiently. Luckily for the aliens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:13.200
Lacy can be distracted from her post by a mere&nbsp;
flashing light that results in her being shut in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.400
Everywhere else screws start popping out of wood,&nbsp;
and Daniel has trouble finding his target. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.840
kids door starts bulging inward and gives way&nbsp;
to Daniel, who regroups back at the bedroom.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.920
Despite being on high alert, it takes a moment&nbsp;
for the family to realize they’re surrounded and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.960
when Daniel fires, Jesse finds he and Sammy&nbsp;
alone. When Sammy runs off, Jesse follows.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.840
But his surroundings convert to the sale house&nbsp;
where he finds his parents in dire straits so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.320
he continues to try to catch up with Sammy. When&nbsp;
he eventually finds him crouching in a hallway,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.120
he is snapped out of his hallucination to discover&nbsp;
that he was the one they wanted, not Sammy.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:52.160
Three months later we find the family in the city,&nbsp;
tracking lost children and dealing with attorneys.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.440
Unpacking jars loose a few bits of information&nbsp;
for Lacy about Jesse’s infant allergies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.800
and she has the now pointless revelation that&nbsp;
first contact was made with Jesse as a baby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.680
not Sammy. Then Sammy hears Jesse say&nbsp;
his name through the walkie-talkie.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.960
I have a soft spot for alien movies. I&nbsp;
remember as a kid watching Alien Autopsy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.120
Unsolved Mysteries and other shows like&nbsp;
that and lying in bed terrified afterward.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.440
Dark Skies is a pretty good representation of&nbsp;
that, and I appreciate that they tried to move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.800
away from common tropes to establish their own&nbsp;
mythology. However, I’m left feeling somewhat let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.760
down by the twist on the main conflict being that&nbsp;
they were coming for Jesse rather than Sammy. That&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.160
just didn’t shock me or feel like a sufficient&nbsp;
payoff for the mounting dread. The fact that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.800
were coming for Jesse had no material impact on&nbsp;
how the ending unfolded. It would have been more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.680
effective to do something like have Jesse split&nbsp;
off for a strategic reason to help protect Sammy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.240
and then they discover after all that effort&nbsp;
that the Grays weren’t actually coming for Sammy.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.520
I also think they had a few too many&nbsp;
narrative threads running through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.960
film that they had to tie off, and could&nbsp;
have done more by focusing on the main&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.120
plot and deriving character development from&nbsp;
how the events were impacting them directly.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.120
As an example, maybe Jesse could have&nbsp;
lost faith in his father, but then rebuilt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.600
trust through the process of them dealing with&nbsp;
some strange or dangerous situation involving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.000
the aliens at their home. Rather than have him&nbsp;
ride off for a short meeting with Shelly to tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
him that his dad’s not crazy, and then having&nbsp;
him ride back. It’s a relatively small thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.240
but I think both of these critiques emerge&nbsp;
from the fact that there are so many small,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.000
individual things that happen in this&nbsp;
movie, it can get a bit distracting.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
But, the movie was still enjoyable and&nbsp;
offered up some fresh perspectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.360
I did recently manage to score&nbsp;
a copy of Fire in the Sky,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.600
so maybe we’ll have a strong point of comparison&nbsp;
sometime in the near future. I’ve heard that one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.360
is terrifying. If you’ve seen either movie,&nbsp;
let me know what you thought in the comments,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.840
and I’d love to hear about any other really&nbsp;
creepy alien abduction movies you’re aware of.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:57.840
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;
my donors, memorialized in the hall of headshots.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.760
I have a website set up where you can&nbsp;
support the channel through donations or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:10.720
merch. Any donation unlocks uncensored movie&nbsp;
reviews of Lifeforce and Under the Skin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.920
