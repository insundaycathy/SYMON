00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 align:start position:0%

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.069 align:start position:0%
after reading it
and<00:00:32.559><c> i</c><00:00:32.719><c> think</c><00:00:32.960><c> there's</c><00:00:33.280><c> a</c><00:00:33.440><c> lot</c><00:00:33.600><c> of</c><00:00:33.680><c> hints</c>

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
and i think there's a lot of hints
 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.670 align:start position:0%
and i think there's a lot of hints
towards<00:00:34.480><c> this</c><00:00:34.640><c> being</c><00:00:34.880><c> the</c><00:00:35.040><c> case</c>

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
towards this being the case
 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.430 align:start position:0%
towards this being the case
now<00:00:35.840><c> the</c><00:00:36.000><c> entire</c><00:00:36.399><c> theory</c><00:00:36.719><c> centers</c><00:00:37.040><c> around</c><00:00:37.280><c> the</c>

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
now the entire theory centers around the
 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.270 align:start position:0%
now the entire theory centers around the

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.990 align:start position:0%
their lives
they<00:00:58.399><c> would</c><00:00:58.559><c> allow</c><00:00:58.800><c> a</c><00:00:58.879><c> detonation</c><00:00:59.520><c> to</c><00:00:59.680><c> go</c><00:00:59.840><c> off</c>

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
they would allow a detonation to go off

they would allow a detonation to go off

so it would seem to the past version of

so it would seem to the past version of
