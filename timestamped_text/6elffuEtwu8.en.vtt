00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.160
Five years after escaping from the U.S.,&nbsp;
Dominic Toretto and his new crew, consisting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.720
of his girlfriend Letty, Tego, Rico, Cara and Han&nbsp;
Lue, are hijacking fuel tankers in the Dominican&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.080
Republic. Dom suspects that the police are&nbsp;
on their trail, forcing the crew to disband&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.680
and go their separate ways, with Han deciding&nbsp;
to go to Tokyo. Realizing that he must leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.200
Dom runs, leaving Letty behind&nbsp;
to protect herself from harm.&nbsp;

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.320
Three months later, Dom is now residing in Panama&nbsp;
City. He gets a call from his sister, Mia Toretto,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.280
who tells him that Letty has been murdered. Dom&nbsp;
heads back to Los Angeles to attend her funeral&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.040
and examine the crash and finds traces of&nbsp;
nitromethane on the ground. He visits the only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.800
car mechanic that sells nitromethane in LA and&nbsp;
forces him into giving him the name David Park,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.800
the man who ordered the fuel, and informs him that&nbsp;
the only car that uses nitromethane in the area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.000
is a green 1972 Ford Gran Torino Sport.
Meanwhile, FBI agent Brian O'Conner is trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.400
to track down a Mexican drug lord, Arturo Braga.&nbsp;
His search leads him to David Park, and he tracks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.080
him down using an illegal modification record on&nbsp;
his car. Dom arrives at Park's apartment first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.840
and hangs him out of the window by his ankles&nbsp;
before Brian arrives. Brian saves Park and Park&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.720
becomes the FBI's new informant. Park gets Brian&nbsp;
into a street race. Brian selects a modified 2002&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:47.440
Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 from the impound lot. Dom&nbsp;
races in his modified 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.080
Gisele Yashar, the liaison for Braga,&nbsp;
reveals that the winner will become the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.080
last driver on a team that traffics heroin&nbsp;
between the Mexico–United States border. Dom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.760
wins by bumping Brian's car while it is in&nbsp;
nitro, making him lose control. Brian uses his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.480
power as an FBI agent to arrest another driver,&nbsp;
Dwight Mueller, and takes his place on the team.&nbsp;

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.240
The team meets up with Braga's personal henchman,&nbsp;
Fenix, and Dom notices that Fenix drives the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.760
Torino the mechanic described. They drive across&nbsp;
the border using tunnels to avoid detection.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.720
Dom confronts Fenix and learns that he himself&nbsp;
killed Letty when she tried to escape him. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.960
stand-off ensues, though not before Dom&nbsp;
creates a diversion by loosening his car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.840
with nitrous—sparking a vehicle explosion&nbsp;
that destroys his car and several others,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.600
including Brian's. In the ensuing chaos, Dom and&nbsp;
Brian hijack a 1999 Hummer H1 with $60 million&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.360
worth of heroin in it. Dom and Brian drive back&nbsp;
to LA and hide the heroin in a police impound lot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.680
where Brian picks up a modified Subaru Impreza&nbsp;
WRX STI Hatchback; they subsequently drive back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.320
to Dom's house, where they reunite with Mia.
Dom finds out Brian was the last person to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.880
have contact with Letty, which results in Dom&nbsp;
attacking Brian until he explains that Letty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.760
was working undercover—she was tracking down&nbsp;
Braga in exchange for clearing Dominic's record.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.200
Brian tells his superiors that in exchange for&nbsp;
Dominic's pardon, he will lure Braga into a trap,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.520
forcing him to show up to exchange money for&nbsp;
the heroin. At the drop site, the man who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.520
claims to be "Braga" is revealed as a decoy, and&nbsp;
"Campos"—the real Braga—escapes with Fenix and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.520
pair flee to Mexico. In the ensuing chaos, Fenix&nbsp;
nearly runs over Gisele, before Dom saves her.&nbsp;

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.480
Brian and Dom travel to Mexico to&nbsp;
catch Braga, with the help of Gisele,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.760
who gives them directions as a favor in return&nbsp;
for Dom saving her life. Brian and Dom find him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.280
at a church and apprehend him. As Braga's henchmen&nbsp;
try to rescue him, Brian and Dom drive through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.640
tunnels back to the United States. Brian crashes&nbsp;
his car after taking fire from Braga's men.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.320
He is then injured after being T-boned by Fenix.&nbsp;
Before Fenix can kill Brian, Dom drives into,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.720
kills Fenix and avenging Letty's death. As police&nbsp;
and helicopters approach the crash site on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.240
American side of the border, Brian tells Dom to&nbsp;
leave, but Dom refuses—saying he is not running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.320
anymore. Despite Brian's request for clemency,&nbsp;
the judge sentences Dom to 25 years in prison.&nbsp;

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.520
Brian resigns from the FBI and Dom boards a bus&nbsp;
that will transport him to prison. As the bus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:24.480
drives down the road, Brian, Mia, and the rest of&nbsp;
the crew, arrive in their cars to intercept it.
