00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.880
This is the ultimate match. You're&nbsp;
trapped on an abandoned island,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.640
forced to fight against your friends, and&nbsp;
the only way you're escaping is eliminating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.120
everyone you meet. What do you do when you can&nbsp;
be blown at any time, and you must choose to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.040
either lie or get rid of all your friends?&nbsp;
I'm going to break down the mistakes made,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.960
explain what you should do, and how to beat&nbsp;
the government's Death Game in Battle Royale.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.240
This class of high school students are&nbsp;
living the last free moments of their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.160
None of them have any idea that they've&nbsp;
been selected for this year's Battle Royale,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.000
a government-sponsored programme, where&nbsp;
every year, a class of students is selected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.080
to fight to the death, but it's too&nbsp;
late for them to do anything about it.&nbsp;

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.880
Shuya here wakes up in a dark classroom&nbsp;
with a high-tech collar locked to his neck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.120
Okay, permission to freak out now. Groggy or&nbsp;
not, we need to realise something important.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.440
This took a lot of planning, deception, military&nbsp;
involvement, remote locations, in coordination&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.840
with the government. So the biggest mistake we&nbsp;
can make is to think we have any control over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.880
what happens next. These collars are enough for&nbsp;
me to realise that attempting to escape won't work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.600
and could just get us killed. So, if it's me, I'm&nbsp;
hiding in the back of the room until we know more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.160
about the situation. The more information&nbsp;
we have, the better decisions we can make.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.760
Their old teacher, Mr. Kitano, suddenly arrives in&nbsp;
the classroom with a fully-armed military escort,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.080
and he introduces them to the Battle Royale,&nbsp;
a death match designed for rebellious students&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.160
in Japan, and they watch a video that explains&nbsp;
the rules. They've been brought to an abandoned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.240
island, which has been divided into quadrants&nbsp;
and danger zones that change daily. And if there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.280
isn't a single winner by the end of three days,&nbsp;
everyone dies. Okay, this is life or death. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.920
have valuable information here, and if we memorise&nbsp;
this information to build a strategy before even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.400
leaving the classroom, we'll have a better chance&nbsp;
of surviving by far. This place has mountains,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.000
cliffs, valleys, and I would be analysing which&nbsp;
areas would give me the best geographic advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.520
Personally, I would start in a low-lying&nbsp;
valley that has good forest coverage to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.200
hide in or enough water from the mountain to&nbsp;
drink, and a flat terrain for easier travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.000
Suddenly, the teacher spots one of the students&nbsp;
whispering and kills her with a throwing knife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.200
If there was any doubt where this&nbsp;
was going, now there's no question.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.680
The students freak out and try to escape as the&nbsp;
soldiers block off the exit, but the teacher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.960
isn't finished. A soldier grabs one of the kids,&nbsp;
and remotely triggers his collar, causing it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.120
explode. It's absolutely terrifying. But this is&nbsp;
actually the best news so far tonight because this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.600
teacher has just revealed a huge flaw with the&nbsp;
collar. Since these could be exploded anywhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.480
on the island remotely, we can assume these&nbsp;
devices use either radio or microwave frequencies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.440
and the good news is, these frequencies can&nbsp;
be blocked. Radio and microwaves are extremely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.320
sensitive to interference of metal objects, and&nbsp;
if we find aluminum foil in any of these abandoned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.480
buildings on the island, we could wrap it around&nbsp;
the front of the collar to block the frequency and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.040
take it off. Each student is called up by their&nbsp;
number one by one, taking a rucksack of random&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.760
supplies before leaving the class. But there are&nbsp;
two students that stand out among the rest. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.400
bandana-wearing transfer student is very focused,&nbsp;
getting out of the room as quickly as possible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.800
while the other transfer student is way too&nbsp;
relaxed about this death match. These two simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.600
reactions tell me all I need to know, that I do&nbsp;
not wanna mess with them, but they both just made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.800
the same mistake as the rest. Everyone is running&nbsp;
through the door without even checking their bag.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.800
I just know, if I was the first to leave, I&nbsp;
would be waiting outside behind a wall or a bush&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.480
and killing every student before they even&nbsp;
have the time to reach for their weapons. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.120
if I'm not the first one out the door, I'm opening&nbsp;
my bag inside the room to get my weapon out before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.240
leaving. Finally, Shuya here is called up, running&nbsp;
out of the class and right into a bush to hide.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.840
Very brave. He immediately realises the games have&nbsp;
begun, as a student appears with a bolt lodged in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.160
her throat and her killer running towards them.&nbsp;
He sees his friend Noriko and runs away with her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.800
leaving the killer behind as he falls down the&nbsp;
hill. Escaping the madness, the two take shelter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.920
in some caves, where they check their rucksacks&nbsp;
to find they have no weapons, only a pot lid and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.760
a pair of binoculars. This is completely unfair.&nbsp;
It's important to safely assess what you have in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.480
your bag as soon as you can because it could&nbsp;
completely change your strategy for survival.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.400
If you're stuck with useless weapons, you need&nbsp;
to find something better. We could scavenge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.640
for weapons from dead students, but if you're&nbsp;
found carrying only a pot lid, you're screwed.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.960
At this point, nature is our best weapon. Take&nbsp;
a sock off and put rocks inside it, giving you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.240
a hard-hitting close range weapon, and&nbsp;
in the other hand, a loose rock to throw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.800
at any oncoming threats. Using these, I would go&nbsp;
scouting for a better weapon after the sun rises,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.120
once the students have had time to spread further&nbsp;
out, leaving the dead bodies behind to scavenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.600
In the northern end of the island, a gang has a&nbsp;
transfer student surrounded as he discovers his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.080
weapon is a paper fan, that's even worse than&nbsp;
a pot lid. They all think he's harmless until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.480
he distracts one of the students, steals&nbsp;
his gun, and kills them all in seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.240
He takes all their gear, including a revolver&nbsp;
and some hand grenades, before leaving.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.200
This is the most dangerous kid on the island.&nbsp;
Now, if it wasn't for his lightning-fast reflexes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.040
these guys could have easily taken him out.&nbsp;
Teaming up and outnumbering your classmates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.880
to kill might seem like a better strategy, but&nbsp;
it becomes a lot more risky in the long-term&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.880
because every member of the group is extremely&nbsp;
vulnerable to betrayal. It's a trade-off some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.280
might be willing to make, but there's more to&nbsp;
consider. Large groups are noisier, they're easier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.080
to track, and they require more food and water.&nbsp;
So any resources found must be shared or else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.880
there will be infighting. Ultimately, it's fool's&nbsp;
gold. Stay away from this idea and hunt alone.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.200
A girl is hiding in an abandoned shed,&nbsp;
looking at photos, when someone comes in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.680
If you see someone shine their flashlight like&nbsp;
this, don't trust them. Mitsuko here is one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.560
the meanest girls on the island, and she's going&nbsp;
to have one of the highest body counts of anyone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.960
starting with this girl here. Now, some are&nbsp;
cut out for this kind of scenario, and some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.320
are not. These four have offed themselves as soon&nbsp;
as the game start. This is a sad waste of life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.160
but I'm not crying because there's four&nbsp;
less people to kill and they've handed us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.800
an amazing opportunity, their collars, because&nbsp;
I can learn more about what's possible without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.920
risking my own life. I'd also test if any metal&nbsp;
I find will block the radio waves or not. If it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.120
works on theirs, it will work on mine too, and I&nbsp;
can break it off and hide until everyone is dead.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.880
Early the next morning, the teacher announces&nbsp;
who's been killed and where the danger zones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.720
are. These two are currently standing in one of&nbsp;
them, and they've got an hour to leave or else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.640
they're dead. They want to force us to move&nbsp;
so we don't hide and stagnate the Death Game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.240
but I would counter this by lining&nbsp;
myself up on the intersection of four&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.360
grids. So while everyone else is&nbsp;
scrambling to escape the zones,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.280
I barely have to move or venture far away&nbsp;
from a hidey-hole that I would set up nearby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.840
I can make better use of my time setting up&nbsp;
traps, alarms, or gathering more resources.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.000
They walk through the forest and get attacked by&nbsp;
a hatchet-wielding student. Shuya here wrestles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.320
with him and ends up in a fight, cleverly using&nbsp;
his pot lid as a shield, but in their scuffle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.360
the hatchet lodges itself in the other kid's&nbsp;
head and he dies. This guy has the right idea,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.920
but he made two mistakes right away. First, if&nbsp;
you're going to ambush someone, don't jump into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.400
their faces, it's just dumb. The whole point of an&nbsp;
ambush is to attack when they're in a bad position&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.880
to fight back or deflect. I would have waited&nbsp;
for them to pass and attack them from behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.320
The second thing he did wrong was hiding&nbsp;
in something that's noisy. These people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.240
are already on high alert and you're giving them&nbsp;
advance warning. Leaves rustle, so I would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.320
covered the hiding area with mud because it's&nbsp;
silent and still blends in with the environment.&nbsp;

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.840
That's when the class president comes out of&nbsp;
the woods and threatens them with his gun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.800
but their shade from the transfer student with&nbsp;
a bandana appears, shooting him full of buck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.720
shot. Surprisingly, he doesn't kill the other two,&nbsp;
instead taking the hatchet out of the other kid's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.360
head. Why did he spare their lives in a Death Game&nbsp;
where there can only be one winner? There is a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.280
more to this guy than meets the eye. That's when&nbsp;
they hear someone speaking over a megaphone and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.440
the girl finds two students calling for everyone&nbsp;
to stop fighting and talk it through, letting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.240
everyone know where they are, including the other&nbsp;
transfer student who shoots them in the back.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.800
Man, this guy is nasty, but these two girls were&nbsp;
asking for it. They broadcasted their location,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.440
but easy kills like this won't come often. There&nbsp;
are 26 students left to kill and many of them will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.680
be in hiding. Finding them all will be exhausting&nbsp;
unless you know where they're going to be,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.000
but a lack of vital resources will draw them out&nbsp;
of hiding. I would wait where there's either food,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.320
clean water, or shelter and stake it out. Now,&nbsp;
you can wait for them to come to you and conserve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.120
your energy for killing. Just like this girl does&nbsp;
when she catches her classmate Mitsuko unprepared.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.080
The girl is mad because Mitsuko here stole her&nbsp;
boyfriend, and now she wants revenge. She starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.400
beating her to the floor but gets tased and&nbsp;
drops her gun. They both rush in to grab it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.040
but she's faster and shoots the other girl in the&nbsp;
back. It's unfortunate, but we're not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.280
escape petty high school drama on this island.&nbsp;
Now, unless you're already a terrible person,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.920
the mind will be forced to justify the killing&nbsp;
as a coping mechanism for survival, and hatred&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.240
is always an incredible motivator to rationalise&nbsp;
murder. So, if someone has a grudge against you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.720
you better believe you're first on their list and&nbsp;
they'll be seeking you out.I would be paying close&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.040
attention every day to the announcement to check&nbsp;
if my high school enemies were still alive because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.280
it may change my planning if I knew someone&nbsp;
was coming specifically for me and me alone.&nbsp;

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.280
Trekking across the island, the girl falls&nbsp;
unconscious from a fever. The map says there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.360
a clinic nearby and Shuya here carries her all&nbsp;
the way to this building. He doesn't see anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.600
around, but accidentally trips an alarm. The&nbsp;
transfer student with a bandana comes out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.760
hiding and lets them inside, treating the girl&nbsp;
with the clinic's medicine. They got lucky.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.720
One of the toughest guys in the game is&nbsp;
also one of the nicest, or is he? Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.760
this is dangerous. I don't know anything about&nbsp;
this guy and just because he let us in for a rest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.800
doesn't mean he won't kill us or use us for his&nbsp;
own survival. If I saw someone with a sick girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.560
and a pot lid, I wouldn't consider them a&nbsp;
threat, and could be more useful alive by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.800
keeping watch for enemies or even as a human&nbsp;
shield in combat. That's why if I were them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.800
I would take advantage of his trust, make a&nbsp;
trade for better weapons, shoot him and run away.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.680
I'm not here to make more friends, I'm here to&nbsp;
kill them. Meanwhile, this student finds three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.760
others trying to carry this generator up the&nbsp;
stairs and these guys have a pretty high-tech&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.880
setup, linking cell phones to this laptop. The&nbsp;
kid reveals he was given a collar tracker as his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.640
weapon, which he is using to find other players.&nbsp;
These guys didn't know what they're doing, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:47.360
getting power from a generator is smart, but it's&nbsp;
also going to attract a lot of unwanted attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.960
We can expect students to gravitate towards&nbsp;
shelters like abandoned buildings, factories,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.040
and lighthouses, both to get out of the weather&nbsp;
and also to find students hiding there that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.200
can kill. If you're first to one of these, you'll&nbsp;
have to defend it and likely from more than one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.600
at a time, so it's not the best strategy. I would&nbsp;
stay outside and build my own shelter out of mud,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.240
leaves, and branches, so I'm covered from the&nbsp;
weather and camouflaged. The hacker learns there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.160
are microphones in the collars, and that's how&nbsp;
the Battle Royale's administrators know what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.040
they're up to. Using his laptop, he tells his&nbsp;
friends to find fertiliser, pesticide, charcoal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.360
sulphur, and kerosene before he starts&nbsp;
coding his hacking program. These sound&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.280
like a strange collection, but together, the&nbsp;
effects can make an explosive difference.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.400
Now, this is a great idea. Unfortunately,&nbsp;
you still need to find people to use it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.560
Bigger weapons are useful, but it's strategy&nbsp;
that wins this Death Game. I would be trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.640
to predict people's movements. Since we know they&nbsp;
have to leave the danger zones that are announced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.240
each morning, the geography and terrain will&nbsp;
tell me their likelihood of movement from one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.080
sector to another. They're less likely to climb up&nbsp;
mountains than down and they're more likely to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.400
pushed into low-lying terrain for water and flat&nbsp;
terrain for ease of travel. Predicting other's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.280
movements is a great way to hunt them. This is&nbsp;
death chess and we need to be one step ahead.&nbsp;

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.520
Meanwhile, this athletic girl gets back to her&nbsp;
shelter after a run and bumps into a student&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.440
with a crossbow. He wants to get freaky&nbsp;
with her, but she's not feeling it today.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.520
With the most brutal move of the game,&nbsp;
she stabs him straight in the dick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.400
That's a one hell of a cock block. But suddenly,&nbsp;
Mitsuko appears and shoots her dead. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.640
this brings up an important point. These are&nbsp;
young high school students, many of whom will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.960
die before they've had certain experiences that&nbsp;
nobody wants to die without. I'm not gonna lie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.200
if I were a girl, I would weaponise this desire&nbsp;
against the males for the sake of survival.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.880
If she dangled the carrot, that boy would&nbsp;
have had the motivation to defend her.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.440
That night, the transfer student reveals that,&nbsp;
three years ago, he had been the winner of a past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.520
Battle Royale. He also tells them that he knows a&nbsp;
way off the island, but he can only tell them when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.920
the time comes. He gives the other boy a gun and&nbsp;
some ammo to convince him he's telling the truth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.720
but all of a sudden, they hear gunfire outside.&nbsp;
Outside the clinic, the other transfer student&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.920
corners another kid and shoots him, except he's&nbsp;
wearing a bulletproof vest. But the guy comes back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.960
with a Samurai sword and finishes him off, and&nbsp;
that's not even the worst thing he does to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.960
The transfer student throws the kid's head through&nbsp;
the window with a grenade lodged in his mouth and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.280
they all run for cover. Shuya here leaps out of&nbsp;
the window and runs for it, leading the psycho&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.840
student on a foot chase to the coast. With nowhere&nbsp;
to run, he throws himself into the sea moments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.880
before the other student catches up and blasts&nbsp;
the water with gunfire. Okay, this seems like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.600
a terrible idea because you can't evade bullets&nbsp;
while in water, but it's actually the best move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.000
you can make. When a bullet hits the water, it&nbsp;
slows down due to drag and even veers off-target.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.480
In the case of heavy-calibre ammo, the bullet will&nbsp;
decelerate so fast in the water that it shatters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.960
into pieces. You could be as close as three&nbsp;
feet below the surface and you're totally safe.&nbsp;

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.720
It's the second day and he's woken up by a girl&nbsp;
who tells him four more students have died,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.720
and that his friend, the hacker, is waiting for&nbsp;
him in the west. The girls downstairs are getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.600
lunch ready, but one of them is very uncomfortable&nbsp;
with the boy's presence and decides to poison him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.480
and that's when things go wrong. Another girl eats&nbsp;
the poisoned spaghetti, shocking everyone when she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.640
suddenly dies. They freak out and start accusing&nbsp;
each other, grab their guns and start firing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.840
killing everyone in the room. The boy runs down&nbsp;
to find six more dead, and lunch is ruined.&nbsp;

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.760
Okay, this is a great example of how a&nbsp;
group collaboration can go all wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.480
Even if it's all smiles and rainbows, these girls&nbsp;
do not trust each other, and all it takes is one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.400
ounce of suspicion to throw everyone out of&nbsp;
control. If you're going to kill your homies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:21.280
kill them all at the same time in their sleep,&nbsp;
so no one can alert the others of your betrayal.&nbsp;

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.120
Shuya meets up with the other two, decide to&nbsp;
make the long journey west to met the hacker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.400
They're injured, exhausted, and need food and&nbsp;
water, but they press on. Okay, now students&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.720
aren't the only killers, nature can be a harsh&nbsp;
mistress too. They're exposed to heat stroke,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.920
dehydration, dysentery, hunger and blood&nbsp;
loss. These are all killers in the wilderness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.080
if not taken care of quickly. Food can be&nbsp;
found from fruit trees, berries and mushrooms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.440
but only if you know what to look for.&nbsp;
But that's not even your biggest problem.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.720
This is an island and it's hot&nbsp;
and mountainous. Trekking across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.240
this place will make you sweat profusely&nbsp;
and you'll need water very quickly. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.880
most of what makes water dangerous isn't visible.&nbsp;
Rain can create dirty runoff and eutrophication&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.280
and dead animals upstream can affect the water.&nbsp;
The best way to tell is to look for animal tracks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.400
bugs and green vegetation nearby. If other living&nbsp;
things are drinking from it, you probably can too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.640
The best place to look is in valleys and low&nbsp;
points, because water always runs downwards,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.520
then follow it upstream to get the cleanest water&nbsp;
possible. Another option is to make a solar still.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.280
By digging a hole in the ground, putting a clear&nbsp;
sheet over the hole, the sun will evaporate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.200
groundwater, causing condensation in the sheet,&nbsp;
and you can collect it from the centre, as it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.680
drips into your cup. You'll get less and it takes&nbsp;
longer, but it will be cleaner than running water.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.520
The kid with the GPS tracker arrives at an&nbsp;
abandoned warehouse, looking for his high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.480
school crush, but the girl empties her gun on him.&nbsp;
Regretfully, she only finds out afterwards that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.560
came to save her. She could have really used that&nbsp;
extra protection because Mitsuko here sneaks up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.200
and guns her down, and the death cycle continues&nbsp;
as she's suddenly attacked and killed by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.840
psycho transfer student. Across the island, the&nbsp;
hacker finalises the code to his hacking program,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.480
while his two friends mix the chemicals together&nbsp;
to create bombs. Impressively resourceful.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.720
They activate the software and sabotage the&nbsp;
computers of the Battle Royale administrators,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:06.320
and for a brief moment, there's no GPS tracking&nbsp;
and no collar activation for any student. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.680
only way for the administrators to&nbsp;
stop it is to pull the hard reset.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:15.600
Okay, this is a big deal. It proved that cheating&nbsp;
is actually a viable option at beating this game,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.240
and that there's a scenario here where our real&nbsp;
survival depends on defeating the teachers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:25.200
not our fellow students. It's time to start&nbsp;
strategising against the game itself. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.120
we know that the collars are triggered by wave&nbsp;
frequencies, and we're on an island that there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.440
must be a local antenna to transmit the signals&nbsp;
through. GPS tracking works by emitting microwave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.160
signals that go through these relays to reach the&nbsp;
satellites above. These waves pass through nearly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.400
everything, except for metal, which reflects the&nbsp;
signal. Destroying the antenna's receiver won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.720
just nullify your own collar, but everyone's&nbsp;
collar on the island. This gives us the chance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.880
to work together for our collective survival,&nbsp;
and totally eliminates the need to kill each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.280
other. And if that happens, we can focus on the&nbsp;
real enemy, the government. The students begin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.600
loading their gear into a truck, intent on ramming&nbsp;
the school with explosives, but just as they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.240
about to leave, they get attacked by the one and&nbsp;
only psycho transfer student. He kills them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.880
sets off the bombs in the truck. The last few&nbsp;
survivors arrive, they see the psycho student is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:14.320
still alive. Kawada here finishes him off with a&nbsp;
shot to the collar, blowing him into smithereens.&nbsp;

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.240
Okay, this is awkward, because now there's no bad&nbsp;
guy, and there can only be one winner. It's time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.640
to start planning your friends' deaths. There's&nbsp;
no doubt that all three have the same thought,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.160
but no one will openly admit it because&nbsp;
it will scatter them, making them harder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.960
to kill and you might not find them before the&nbsp;
time runs out and everyone is dead. If it's me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.960
I'm suggesting we make a temporary pact to&nbsp;
discard all weapons while we discuss what to do,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.360
but conceal a knife or a rope. The ploy forces&nbsp;
all three people to pretend to be friends for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.520
as long as possible, while you disarm them,&nbsp;
which makes them more vulnerable to kill.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.120
It's the final day. They head to the coast&nbsp;
of the transfer student's escape route,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.160
but he reveals it was all a lie. They are&nbsp;
his ticket out, and he shoots them both,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.280
making him this year's winner of the Battle&nbsp;
Royale. Cold-blooded. Later, he'll reunite to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.360
teacher back at the school, who discovers that&nbsp;
the kid's collar has somehow been deactivated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:08.320
and that he didn't shoot the other students. It&nbsp;
was a trick, and the boy shoots the teacher dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.960
It's finally over as the three students throw away&nbsp;
their explosive collars and relax. Their friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.720
Kawada dies on his way back to the mainland,&nbsp;
and the other two are declared wanted fugitives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.600
by the government. They might have beaten the&nbsp;
Battle Royale, but they can't escape the law.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.840

Royale? Let me know with a comment down below.&nbsp;&nbsp;
