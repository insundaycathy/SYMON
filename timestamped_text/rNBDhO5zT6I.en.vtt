jane so hard that she falls to the floor as&nbsp;
he stands over her richard starts calling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:23.120

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:30.400
chase and as soon as stan and dimitri see them&nbsp;
they quickly follow the three men chase jan to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:37.680

about jumping over he stops her and apologizes for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:45.360
slapping her richard tries to justify what he did&nbsp;
by saying he was just stressed out and when jin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:52.320
doesn't say anything he asks for stan's phone&nbsp;
promising that he will call the helicopter&nbsp;&nbsp;

informs her that the pilot will arrive in 30&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:06.320
minutes released she lets down her guard only&nbsp;
for richard to suddenly push her off the cliff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:14.880
jane is impaled on a tree and as the man look at&nbsp;
her body stan asks he did such a thing like a cold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:23.120
blocked killer richard tells them that jan could&nbsp;
put them in jail for 15 years he then orders a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:30.880
stand and dimitri to do everything he said saying&nbsp;
they will go hunting as planned and clean up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:37.200
the mess on the way then they will go home with&nbsp;
their trophies just like every year but they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:44.000
to make sure not to arrow suspicion once stan&nbsp;
and dimitry agree with richard's plan the three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.600
of them leave back at the rest house richard burns&nbsp;
jane's staff as he and his friends prepare their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.920
gears and weapons for their hunting trip&nbsp;
richard then calls his wife as if nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:03.600
happened and when stan apologizes to him&nbsp;
for what happened then richard quips that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:13.840
he's never heard of her meanwhile jen miraculously&nbsp;
regains consciousness while still being impaled on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:20.400
a tree branch with every ounce of strength left&nbsp;
in her body she reaches her lighter and sets the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:26.880
tree on fire causing it to break in hard to eat&nbsp;
the ground after a while jen suddenly hears the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:34.160
sound of moving vehicles signaling richard and his&nbsp;
friend's arrival with the branch still sticking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:42.400
out of her body jen forces herself to crawl away&nbsp;
from where she landed and hires on the other hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:49.920
richard and his friends are horrified when they&nbsp;
find no sign of jen's body completely panicking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:58.240
stan suggests they find jain and bring her to the&nbsp;
hospital he says with the help of their lawyers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:04.880
they can make what happened to jain hook like an&nbsp;
accident annoyed at his friends cowardice richard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:12.720
is adamant about not calling anyone reminding&nbsp;
stan that jan is alone and hurt and won't stand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:20.960
a chance against three armed men they then set out&nbsp;
to find jyn and once jen hears they are gone she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:28.400
starts moving to it's already dark when the man&nbsp;
reached the tree where jane landed went decisions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:36.080
ipod and traces of her blood around the vein city&nbsp;
they feel confident that it won't take them long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:43.200
to find her they then follow jane's blood trial&nbsp;
and once it stops by the river they agreed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:51.200
split up to find her faster stan decides to stay&nbsp;
behind in case jen returns there while richard and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:58.400
dimitri go in opposite directions meanwhile jane&nbsp;
continues wandering around going under the water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:05.120
when she hears someone coming as if by luck jen&nbsp;
finds dimitri urinating by the reaper with his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:13.040
rifle resting against a rock gin creeps up behind&nbsp;
him and takes his weapon and when dmitry turns to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:19.520
facehug then pulls the trigger unfortunately&nbsp;
the gun isn't loaded so dimitri just easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:26.400
grabbed the gun and pushes her back while on&nbsp;
the ground dimitri hits jane and mocks her for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:34.320
thinking he would leave his gun lying around for&nbsp;
anyone to touch he then informs his friends that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:40.160
he's got jen telling them he will meet them&nbsp;
at that jeep once he takes care of her stand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:47.040
breathes a sign of philip upon hearing the news&nbsp;
then casually plays some music using jen's ipod&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:55.840
as dmitry attempts to drawn jen he tells her that&nbsp;
he likes letting his prey come to home and make it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:02.320
thing it's attacking him when in fact he's the one&nbsp;
waiting for it jen tries to fight back but dmitry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:08.800
is too big and strong for her when she manages&nbsp;
to grab dimitri's knife she quickly stabs him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:15.920
in the eyes as soon as her head is out of the&nbsp;
water with the knife still stuck to his eyes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:23.360
dimitri stumbles around still trying to calm&nbsp;
and jen but eventually he collapses and dies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:31.440
while jen bravely pulls out the knife from his&nbsp;
eyes then watches him as he sinks into the river&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:38.480
after taking dimitri supplies jen travels through&nbsp;
the desert using his atv but is forced to walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:46.160
when he suddenly stops working she then goes into&nbsp;
a cave and builds a fire before drinking some beer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:52.800
she tries to remove the branch sticking out her&nbsp;
body but stops once it gets too painful while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:59.920
lying down jen suddenly remembers the peyote she&nbsp;
hides in her necklace and eats it she then starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:07.920
loading dimitri's rifle and as she stares into the&nbsp;
fire jen suddenly feels weird while starting to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:15.040
hear loud music numb and hallucinating jen opens&nbsp;
the beer can using the knife before making several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:22.000
incision around her own to easily remove the&nbsp;
branch sticking out of her abdomen upon removing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.440
the branch gen watches her blood push out of her&nbsp;
body she then gets the aluminium bear can to put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:36.880
it over the fire and once it's hot enough she uses&nbsp;
it to characterize her wound the next day's turn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:43.920
is started when richard throws a dead animal&nbsp;
on his windshield realizing that dimitri isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:50.080
back yet richard tries to radio him but there's&nbsp;
no answer as a stun peace and washes up by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:57.760
the river dimitri's decomposing body suddenly&nbsp;
floats scaring the delights out of him richer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:04.480
than checks to see what the commotion is about&nbsp;
while stan throws up and gets in his car where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:12.000
he throws a feet as richard stares at his dead&nbsp;
friend's body he realizes that dimitri has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:19.680
stabbed in the eyes he then drags him out of the&nbsp;
water while stan grudgingly watches from his car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:26.960
after richard asks for stan's help to get rid of&nbsp;
dmitry's body stan expresses bitterness about what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:34.720
happened he believes that dimitri would still be&nbsp;
alive if richard hadn't pushed jen off the cliff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:41.440
once they tossed dimitri to the deeper part of&nbsp;
the river richard suddenly pushes a stand in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:48.640
face breaking his nose the two then continue their&nbsp;
search for jan who is still sleeping in the cave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:54.560
when jen wakes up she realizes that the phonics&nbsp;
logo from the beer can has been transferred to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:01.920
her body finding it quite symbolic since she's&nbsp;
just escaped death when she gets up to leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:09.280
the cave richard suddenly shows up and blows her&nbsp;
head off jane then wakes up screaming and realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:17.120
it was just a dream she continues to have a series&nbsp;
of nightmares about the three men terrorizing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:24.080
hunting her and when she finally wakes up she&nbsp;
takes dimitri's weapons and sets out to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:30.880
her attackers meanwhile richard and stan are&nbsp;
determined to find her first using their map&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:39.280
richard and stan decide to split up again with&nbsp;
her binoculars jen manages to find where stan is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:48.080
and when he starts diving she prepares to make her&nbsp;
move stan's vehicle suddenly runs out of gas while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:57.840
jane is on his tail and as he refills his tank&nbsp;
gene tries aiming at him from offer however the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:04.400
pivot's affects haven't comply own of making jen&nbsp;
optionally hallucinate after taking a better aim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:12.640
jane shoots and his turn in the shoulder while&nbsp;
the impact of her rifle knocks her to the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:19.520
then quickly gathers herself and looks for stan&nbsp;
to shoot him once more but the man has left his&nbsp;&nbsp;
