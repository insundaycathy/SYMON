00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.700
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.450
Today, I’m going to explain a fantasy, horror,
and mystery film called, “Sleepy Hollow.”

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.900
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.650
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.099
One stormy night, Peter Van Garrett is riding
his carriage through the fields when a mysterious

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.749
galloping follows him.

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:22.220
He hears a thick cutting sound and looks outside
the window only to see his driver beheaded.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.069
He jumps out of the carriage and runs through
the field.

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:28.560
He stops and sees a scarecrow and hears something
approaching him.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.099
When he turns around, a scythe comes down
and cuts off his head.

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.739
In 1799, in New York City, police constable,
Ichabod Crane, finds a floating corpse in

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.090
the city river.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.899
They take the corpse to the prison to burn
despite Ichabod’s protest to properly rule

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.429
out the man’s death.

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.420
Ichabod’s strict belief in science and his
relentless pursuit of justice is strongly

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.100
resented among his peers and he is soon sent
to a small town called Sleepy Hollow to investigate

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.750
a series of murders.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.789
As he travels to his new assignment, he reflects
on his scarred hands and thinks about what

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.899
the town has in store for him.

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.619
When Ichabod arrives, he senses the town’s
fear and paranoia.

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.180
He walks up to a big house and ignores a couple
making out in the shadows outside.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.820
He accidentally interrupts a party game while
looking for the head of the house and receives

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.520
a kiss from the daughter, Katrina Van Tassel,
and meets her hostile suitor, Brom Van Brunt.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.100
Ichabod introduces himself to Katrina’s
father, the wealthy businessman, Baltus Van

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.140
Tassel, and meets his second wife, Mary Preston,
now known as Lady Van Tassel.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.780
The Van Tassels let Ichabod board with them
for the remainder of his stay in Sleepy Hollow.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.110
As he unpacks his luggage in his room, a maid
named Sarah tells him how thankful she is

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.100
that a constable has arrived.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.509
He is invited by Van Tassel to his private
study and meets the town elders, the local

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.649
doctor, Dr. Thomas Lancaster, the Reverend
Steenwyck, the magistrate, Samuel Philipse,

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.080
and notary, James Hardenbrook.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.960
Ichabod lays out the details of the case.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.360
Three people have been murdered, Peter Van
Garrett, his son, Dirk Van Garrett, and the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.590
Widow Winship.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.640
All three were found decapitated.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.760
The town elders inform Ichabod that the heads
of the corpses were never recovered.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.580
They believe that it’s been taken by the
Headless Horseman.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.580
The horseman was a Hessian mercenary from
the Revolutionary War who loved carnage and

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.250
rode a giant black steed named Daredevil.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.250
He sharpened his teeth to add ferocity to
his appearance and rode his horse hard into

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.250
battle, chopping off the heads of his enemies.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.840
The Hessian didn’t meet his end until one
winter in 1779 when his steed was shot near

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.640
Western Woods, just next to Sleepy Hollow.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.430
The soldiers chase him into the woods where
he meets two little girls gathering firewood.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.910
One of the girls makes a noise that alerts
the soldiers to his location.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.720
The girl looks on as her sister runs away,
watching the soldiers fight the Hessian and

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.510
eventually chop off his head with his own
sword.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.510
They buried him in an unmarked spot deep in
the woods and for 20 years, his spirits have

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.440
haunted the place ever since.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.660
The town elders believe that the horseman
is chopping off any head that he sees on sight.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.760
Ichabod is skeptical and they hand him a bible
to read.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.460
He notices that there’s a family tree of
the Van Garretts and Van Tassels inside the

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.460
book.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.121
Later that night, one of Van Garrett’s servants,
Jonathan Masbath, guards the edge of the town

00:03:11.121 --> 00:03:12.670
against the horseman.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.580
As he aims his gun at the fog, he sees something
sinister.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.610
A shot is fired, a horse neighs, and seconds
later, Jonathan is running through the woods

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.260
from the Headless Horseman.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.170
The Hessian soon catches up to him and his
sword cuts off Jonathan’s head in one clean

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.170
slice.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.590
The next morning, Ichabod sees Mr. Killian
who lends him a horse named Gunpowder.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.930
He also meets Mr. Killian’s family, his
wife who serves as a midwife, Beth, and their

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.620
son, Thomas.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.540
Just then, the locals fire a gun to alert
the townsfolk of another murder.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.290
Ichabod arrives at the crime scene and sees
that the town elders have already gathered

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.640
around the body.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.950
They inform the constable about the victim,
Jonathan Masbath.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.220
Ichabod reprimands them for moving the body
and raises the question as to why the Hessian

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.500
is taking the heads with him if the body is
easily identifiable.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.530
Usually, heads are taken so that the body
will not be identified.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.930
He continues to investigate the scene and
brings out his own scientific contraptions,

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.470
noting that the wound cauterized immediately,
which means the flame must have been burning

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.590
red hot.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.200
The town elders shiver at the grisly thought.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.100
Later that day, the town holds a funeral for
Jonathan.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.320
Ichabod takes the orphaned young Masbath under
his wing and service.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.520
As the others leave, the magistrate Philipse
approaches Ichabod and tells him that Jonathan

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.930
was the fifth victim and not the fourth.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.340
There are five victims buried in four graves.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.340
Suddenly, Ichabod has an idea and orders Masbath
to wake him before dawn.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.130
When the dawn comes, Ichabod, together with
Masbath, exhumes all four bodies.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.710
As he investigates Widow Winship’s corpse,
he notices an incision on her stomach.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.120
He takes the corpse to the town doctor’s
office and inspects it.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.710
He raises the question as to why the horseman
would cut off her head and stab the widow

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.039
in the stomach as well.

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.789
Ichabod ushers them out as he investigates
further.

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.530
Hours later, a bloody Ichabod emerges from
the room and announces to the town elders

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.069
that Widow Winship was with child by the time
she was murdered.

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:10.379
Evening comes and Ichabod crosses the town
bridge with his horse, Gunpowder.

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.990
He hears a sound and sees the Headless Horseman
at the end of the bridge.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.599
He runs away from the Hessian and into the
woods.

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.129
He stops and looks around and the horseman
throws at him a blazing pumpkin head.

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:25.030
Unbeknownst to him, the Hessian was fake for
it was only Brom dressed up as the horseman,

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.500
playing a cruel prank on him.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.449
At night, Ichabod dreams of his mother.

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.370
He remembers her drawing circles near the
hearth and tucking him in bed with his favorite

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.930
red cardinal paper toy.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.130
He also remembers a horrible man lurking in
the shadows.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.849
When Ichabod wakes up, he goes downstairs
to get a glass of water.

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:45.129
He hears a sound and catches Katrina reading
by the fire.

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:48.889
He learns from Katrina that her own mother
died two years ago and the lady who nursed

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.050
her is now her stepmother, Mary Preston, now
the Lady Van Tassel.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.650
He asks her why nobody brought up the fact
that the Van Tassels are related to the Van

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.759
Garretts.

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:01.570
Katrina says it’s because everyone in Sleepy
Hollow is related to each other either by

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.259
blood or marriage.

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.900
She then tells her how her father had come
to this place as a poor man.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.509
Van Garrett had set him up with a broken-down
cottage and an acre.

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:14.370
Her father worked hard, prospered, and gave
her the life she had today.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.909
Katrina then gives him a book of spells to
protect him before taking him down to the

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:20.279
old cottage where they used to live.

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:24.229
When they arrive, Katrina notices the scars
on Ichabod’s hands.

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:27.840
She takes him to the old fireplace and starts
drawing on the ashes.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.419
He gasps as he sees that it’s the same symbol
from the one his mother drew in his dreams.

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.360
She then shows him the carving of an archer
deep into the fireplace, saying that the carving

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.740
was already there before they even moved in.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.050
Ichabod then shows her his red cardinal paper
toy.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.610
Separate pictures that become one once you
spin them fast enough.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.830
Later that night, Ichabod eavesdrops as the
town elders hold a secret meeting.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.180
It seems like the magistrate Philipse has
packed his luggage and is to set out of town.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.930
He follows the magistrate and stops him by
the fields.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.499
Ichabod confronts him about the Widow Winship
and her child.

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:03.819
It turns out the widow had sought out his
help to protect the rights of her child and

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:06.409
so he was bound by oath to keep that secret.

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:09.879
Philipse knows who the father of the child
is and reassures him that it was the horseman

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:10.879
who killed her.

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:14.930
Feeling frustrated, Ichabod denies the existence
of the horseman.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.970
Suddenly, their conversation is cut short
by the bleating of goats.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.819
Philipse gasps as he sees the shadow of the
Hessian galloping towards them.

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:27.229
The magistrate tries to run away but the horseman
catches up to him and chops off his head.

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:30.999
Ichabod falls to the ground as Philipse’s
head rolls towards him.

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:35.499
The Hessian runs towards him and takes the
head with his sword just before Ichabod faints.

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:40.120
When Ichabod wakes up, Van Tassel, Katrina,
and young Masbath visit him.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.129
He is hysterical as he tells them that the
horseman really does exist before fainting

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:45.129
again.

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:49.400
He dreams of his mother again and this time
they are playing in the forest as it snows.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.620
The dream suddenly turns dark as a young Ichabod
witnesses her mother getting abused by the

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.939
horrible man.

00:07:54.939 --> 00:07:58.729
Ichabod wakes up and announces to the town
elders that he will go to the Western Woods

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:01.310
today and look for the horseman’s grave.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.870
He ends up going with only the young Masbath.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.490
He learns that Masbath’s father worked for
the Van Garretts and that one particular thing

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.249
happened a week before the Van Garretts’
deaths.

00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:13.940
An argument erupted between the father and
son and later Masbath’s father was sent

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.750
for by Mr. Van Garrett.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.169
They continue their journey into the woods
and stop near a trail leading into a cave.

00:08:20.169 --> 00:08:24.509
As they get nearer, they hear the voice of
a woman and Ichabod takes out his gun.

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:27.809
They slowly walk into the cave and see a veiled
woman living there.

00:08:27.809 --> 00:08:30.780
Ichabod quickly realizes that she is a witch.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.700
The witch takes Ichabod with her and orders
Masbath to go outside.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.880
She lets him sit at her table as she chains
herself up and prepares a ritual.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.990
He asks about the horseman and if there’s
any way to stop him.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.900
The witch tells him to shut up and the room
grows silent.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.110
Suddenly, the witch lunges at him with eyes
and tongue gouging out of her face.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:53.870
In a hoarse voice, she commands him to follow
the Indian trail right to where the sun dies,

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.170
where they will find the Tree of the Dead
and climb down to the horseman’s resting

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.170
place.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.710
Ichabod breaks free from the witch’s clutches
and flees with Masbath.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.640
They take their horses to search for the Tree
of the Dead.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.560
They soon stop on their trails and Ichabod
jumps off his horse with his gun to hunt a

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.560
shadow.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.010
He spots a white horse and its rider, Katrina,
who followed them into the woods.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.100
Their conversation is then cut short by Masbath
who leads them to a gigantic twisting tree

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.700
in the middle of the woods.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.690
They finally found the Tree of the Dead.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.220
Ichabod starts chopping the roots and finds
them full of blood.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.270
He continues chopping until the roots open
up and reveal a hiding place full of severed

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.270
heads.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.580
Ichabod concludes that the tree must be the
gateway between two worlds.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.360
He jumps up the tree and starts digging on
the hill.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.550
He uncovers the Hessian’s skeleton but the
skull is gone.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:43.050
He tells them that this must be why the horseman
keeps taking heads.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.270
He will not stop until his own head is returned
to him.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.600
All of a sudden, a rumbling comes from the
pile of severed heads.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.770
Ichabod, Katrina, and Masbath look on in terror
as the pile of heads open up, and out comes

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.140
the giant steed, Daredevil, and his rider,
the Headless Horseman.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.600
The Hessian gallops away in search of his
next victim and Ichabod quickly follows him.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.810
The horseman arrives at the Killians’ house
and quickly eliminates Mr. Killian.

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.640
Beth manages to hide Thomas under the basement
and hides in the corner of the room as the

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.260
murderer walks in with her husband’s head.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.310
She too is decapitated and the horseman leaves
no mercy even for little Thomas.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:23.090
Meanwhile, Brom, who’s on guard duty for
the night, hears the screams.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.600
He sees the horseman and fires at him, knocking
him off his horse.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.600
The headless body makes its way towards him
as he reloads his gun, but Brom manages to

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.880
fight back.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.260
The Hessian throws a knife at Brom’s knee,
hindering his abilities.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.110
Ichabod arrives and tries to help his friend.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:41.940
He stabs the horseman in the back as they
make a run for it across the bridge.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.820
As they turn around to look for their enemy,
the horseman surprises them from the back

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.100
and stabs Ichabod on the shoulder then tosses
him aside.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:53.120
He then lures Brom into the bridge and fights
him again, landing a few swings on him before

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.200
finally cutting his torso in half.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.000
Ichabod looks up as he sees the Headless Horseman
walking away before he faints again.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.330
Back at Van Tassel’s house, Dr. Lancaster
inspects Ichabod’s wounds.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:08.660
The doctor is surprised that the wound has
fared well and has bled very little.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:13.220
When Ichabod wakes up, he apologizes to Katrina
right away to defend Brom.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.500
He then tells them that the horseman doesn’t
kill at random.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.720
Someone who’s alive must have dug out the
Hessian’s skull and is using it to control

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.360
him to do their bidding.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.900
His theory is dismissed as Katrina makes him
drink a homebrewed potion.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.210
As Ichabod sleeps, he dreams of the horrible
man again, but this time it’s the headless

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.360
horseman.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.640
He goes inside a red door to a room full of
torture devices and accidentally stabs his

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.710
hands into one of the devices before finding
his mother dead with a thousand holes stabbed

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:39.730
into her.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.560
Ichabod wakes up and runs into Katrina’s
arm.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.610
He reveals to her that his mother was murdered
by this father in an attempt to save her damned

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:47.610
soul.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.930
He was only seven years old when he lost her
and he lost her faith in religion as well.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:56.330
As Ichabod and Katrina grow closer together,
they show their vulnerable side and express

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.290
their attraction to one another.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.440
They soon share an intimate embrace.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.600
By the time Ichabod wakes up, he lays out
the fact of the case with Masbath.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.050
He thinks that there must be a conspiracy
brewing amongst the town elders for they were

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.550
arguing on the night the magistrate was murdered.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:15.070
Ichabod then concludes to make a record of
every man and woman in Sleepy Hollow, starting

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.880
with the chief citizen, Lord Van Tassel.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.860
Masbath agrees that Van Tassel must be the
chief citizen now since the Van Garretts are

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.860
dead.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:27.330
Suddenly, Ichabod has an idea and takes Masbath
with him to see the notary.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.570
When they arrive at Hardenbrook’s office,
Masbath sees his father’s satchel.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.210
They learn from the notary that since all
of the Van Garretts is dead, the estate will

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.440
pass on to the next of kin which is the Van
Tassels.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.990
Just then, Masbath reveals a document from
his father’s satchel.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:45.621
It turns out that Peter Van Garrett created
a new will leaving his estate to the Widow

00:12:45.621 --> 00:12:46.760
Winship.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.400
The two secretly married and left everything
to their unborn child.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.480
Hardenbrook admits to being pulled in unwillingly
into the plot.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.340
Ichabod concludes that Reverend Steenwyck
knew about the marriage because he performed

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.280
the ceremony, Dr. Lancaster attended the pregnant
woman, Magistrate Philipse gave protection

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.930
of the law, and the notary Hardenbrook concealed
the documents.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:10.190
The four elders had conspired to have Van
Garretts and Widow Winship eliminated so that

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.170
there would be no more heirs to claim.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:16.390
Masbath’s father was drawn into the plot
as he was the one who bore witness to Van

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.190
Garrett’s new will, ultimately leading to
his death.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.830
This way the only one who will inherit Van
Garrett’s fortune is none other than Baltus

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.480
Van Tassel himself.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.230
Ichabod returns to his room and finds Katrina
who inquires about the investigation.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:33.480
He refuses to tell her anything of importance
and slips the will into his drawer.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.930
When she leaves, Masbath finds a symbol drawn
under Ichabod’s bed, telling him that it’s

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:41.100
the evil eye and someone is casting spells
against him.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.940
Later that night, Ichabod and Masbath follow
a hooded figure leaving the house and heading

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.260
for the woods.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.790
Masbath waits for him by a tree as he goes
further.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:53.540
Hidden amongst the trees, Ichabod finds Lady
Van Tassel making love with Reverend Steenwyck,

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.070
as she digs a dagger into her hand and wipes
it onto the man’s back.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:01.890
Ichabod and Masbath return to the house immediately
and find that the new will had been stolen.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:06.290
Ichabod rides to the old cottage and catches
up to Katrina as she burns the will to protect

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.400
her father.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.670
The two argue, conflicted about their feelings
for one another and his sense of justice,

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.360
and Katrina bids him goodbye.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.050
Ichabod talks to Lady Van Tassel but Katrina
still refuses to talk to him.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.580
She confronts him and tells him that she knows
that he saw her last night.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.230
She then asks him to keep it from her husband.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:29.100
Just then, Lord Van Tassel enters the kitchen
and tells them Hardenbrook has killed himself.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.630
Reverend Steenwyck has called a meeting at
the church where everyone will speak against

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:33.630
Ichabod.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:34.630
Van Tassel advises him to leave immediately.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.660
As the townsfolk gather at the church, Van
Tassel waits for his wife on his horse as

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.170
she picks out some herbs for her wound.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.470
Suddenly, the Headless Horseman appears from
behind the trees and chops off her head.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.240
Van Tassel arrives at the church and warns
Katrina about the Hessian who had just killed

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.650
her stepmother.

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.370
They run inside the church as the horseman
arrives.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.060
The headless murderer stops for he cannot
enter the inside of a church.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.750
The people start shooting at the Hessian through
the windows while an argument ensues amongst

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.130
the town elders.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:05.430
Van Tassel takes out his gun to defend himself
as Dr. Lacanster starts confessing that the

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:08.670
four of them were bewitched and were forced
to plot against him.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:13.330
But before he could finish confessing, Reverend
Steenwyck hits him on the head and kills him.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.070
Van Tassel then fires his gun at the reverend.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.970
He backs away and points out his gun, threatening
everyone to stay back.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:24.980
Suddenly, the window breaks, and Van Tassel
is harpooned out by the Headless Horseman.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.270
Katrina screams as his father is dragged out
of the church and has his head cut off.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.720
She faints and Ichabod sees the pink chalk
near her palm.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.660
It turns out that she was the one who drew
the symbol under his bed.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.950
Ichabod and Masbath take Katrina back to the
house but she hasn’t woken up yet.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.870
Ichabod suspects that she is the one who has
brought the horseman back to life.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.500
He calls for his carriage and prepares to
leave.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.550
As he’s passing through the village, he
sees the townsfolk carrying Lady Van Tassel’s

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.080
body into the morgue.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.000
He opens the spellbook that Katrina gifted
him and learns that the symbol she’s drawing

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.900
wasn’t the evil eye but a protection spell
for loved ones against evil spirits.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.620
Ichabod knows he has to make things right
and asks the carriage to turn back to the

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.620
town.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.100
Ichabod heads the morgue and inspects Lady
Van Tassel’s corpse.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.150
It’s just as he suspected.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:13.310
The cut on the hand was made when the body
was already dead.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.420
This body was not Lady Van Tassel.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:20.850
Meanwhile, back at the house, Katrina faints
after she sees her stepmother alive and well.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:26.040
Lady Van Tassel takes Katrina to an old windmill
and unbeknownst to her, Masbath follows them.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.650
She cuts a lock of her stepdaughter’s hair
and uses it in her spell.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.760
It turns out that it was Lady Van Tassel all
along.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.161
She stole the horseman’s head and had made
a pact with the devil to bring the Headless

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:38.630
Horseman back to life to do her bidding.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:42.720
She summons the Hessian from the Tree of the
Dead one last time to kill Katrina.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.610
When Katrina wakes up, Lady Van Tassel reveals
her true nature.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:51.270
She killed one of the maids, Sarah, and used
her body to disguise her own death.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.720
Her real name wasn’t Mary Preston, but it’s
Mary Archer.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.300
Her family lived in an old cottage and served
the Van Garretts for years.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.370
When her father died, they got evicted and
were outcasts living in the woods because

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:05.010
her mother was suspected of witchcraft.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:09.669
After a year, her mother died and she and
her sister were left to fend off for themselves.

00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:13.360
While gathering firewood, she witnessed the
horseman’s death and at that moment, she

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.610
offered her soul to the devil to help her
bring the Hessian back to life to avenge her.

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:21.919
She killed the town elders and anyone who
knew her plot, even her own sister, the witch

00:17:21.919 --> 00:17:23.639
who lived in the woods.

00:17:23.639 --> 00:17:27.000
She will kill the Van Garretts who starved
her family and take their estate and kill

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.510
the Van Tassels who stole their cottage.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:33.330
All that’s left to do is kill Katrina and
she will have everything she wanted.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:37.740
As Lady Van Tassel drones on, Masbath creeps
behind her with a hammer, but she turns to

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.760
him and makes him drop the weapon.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.120
Katrina and Masbath run out of the windmill
just in time to meet up with Ichabod.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.580
The horseman drives them back up to the mill
and they barred the doors.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.929
They climb up to the roof just as the Hessian
knocks down the door.

00:17:50.929 --> 00:17:54.929
He chops down the ladder but Ichabod and the
rest of the group make it to the roof.

00:17:54.929 --> 00:17:58.970
He drops a gaslight down to the mill, hoping
to burn the horseman alive.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.720
The three grab hold of the windmill and jump
as soon as they get near the ground.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.721
They run away just as the windmill erupts
in an enormous blast of fire, but the Headless

00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:08.309
Horseman survives.

00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:11.160
The three ride the carriage and the pursuit
continues.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.039
Katrina takes the reins as Ichabod shoots
at the horseman.

00:18:14.039 --> 00:18:18.070
He’s knocked down by a tree branch and is
left riding the devil’s steed.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:21.960
He jumps back to the carriage and pushes the
horseman back to his own horse.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.929
As they’re both dragged by their own horses,
Ichabod makes his way back to the carriage

00:18:25.929 --> 00:18:27.520
and faces the horseman.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.710
A struggle ensues and the other two jump to
the horses as the carriage breaks free.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:36.250
Ichabod grabs hold onto the reins as the carriage
strays away and jumps into a ditch together

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.250
with Hessian.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:41.880
Ichabod, Katrina, and Masbath arrive at the
Tree of the Dead and face Lady Van Tassel

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.999
who shoots Ichabod on the chest.

00:18:43.999 --> 00:18:47.289
She grabs Katrina and orders the Headless
Horseman to take her.

00:18:47.289 --> 00:18:51.970
Ichabod regains consciousness and realizes
that the book of spells saved his life.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:55.080
He jumps at Lady Van Tassel who lets go of
Katrina.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.070
The two stumble to the ground and struggle
to get ahold of the horseman’s skull.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.860
Meanwhile, Masbath grabs a branch and knocks
out Lady Van Tassel.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:07.059
The horseman grabs Katrina and is about to
chop her head off when Ichabod grabs the skull

00:19:07.059 --> 00:19:09.090
and tosses it back to the Hessian.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.470
The horseman regains his head and the contract
is broken, he is no longer under the wicked

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:14.710
stepmother’s bidding.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:18.980
Ichabod and Katrina embrace and he shows her
how her gift has protected her.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:23.570
The Hessian, now with his head, takes Lady
Van Tassel into his arms and gives her a bloody

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:24.630
kiss.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.460
Lady Van Tassel realizes that she has lost.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.860
She screams as the horseman takes her into
the Tree of the Dead and to the depths of

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:31.860
hell.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.610
The three look at the stepmother’s remaining
arm as they realize that it’s finally over

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.980
and Ichabod faints again.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:42.600
After a while, Ichabod marries Katrina and
brings her, as well as Masbath to New York
