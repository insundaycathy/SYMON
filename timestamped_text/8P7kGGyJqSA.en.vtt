have grown older not long after brendan finds&nbsp;
that the body of the woman he was with has now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.920
fully decomposed to nothing but bones within hours&nbsp;

her pain in distress the adults try to help her&nbsp;
with them feeling around for the tumor at first&nbsp;&nbsp;

the adults prepare themselves for the birth&nbsp;
which happens rather quickly but the baby dies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.400
after a minute due to lack of attention also&nbsp;
time is moving too fast for a baby to survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.000
the other adults start to show more visible signs&nbsp;
of aging but Chrystal takes the process much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.720
harder than the others charles starts to lose&nbsp;
his mind to schizophrenia leading him to stab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.440
brendan to death the others take his weapon away&nbsp;
while trying to come up with an alternate plan of&nbsp;&nbsp;

desperately tries to find a way out and starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.120
climbing up the rocks to try and make it to the&nbsp;
top but before she can make it high enough she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.400

left by a previous visitor with names and medical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.520

looks like people in the distance observing them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.360
guy and prisca talk about the other man in&nbsp;
prisca's life with guy admitting he knew about him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.920
and wished that he did more to keep their marriage&nbsp;
working but he also notes that the other guy is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:14.480
loser and that she deserves someone better later&nbsp;
charles then starts to attack guy and prisca&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.360
while trent and maddox are attacked by crystal&nbsp;
when they try to look at her she follows them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.560
into the cave and her body becomes twisted and&nbsp;
contorted to horrible angles before she dies there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.320
prisca then slashes charles with a rusty knife&nbsp;
causing an infection that rapidly spreads through&nbsp;&nbsp;

his body and kills him the kapas then gather&nbsp;
around the campfire and the beach guy is having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.120

essentially admits to prisca that he still loves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.360
her just before he dies prisca then stands up&nbsp;
for a moment but collapses and dies by guy's side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.440
while both kids mourn their parents in the morning&nbsp;
trent and maddox are now in their 50s playing with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:59.280
sands like kids trent brings up a code that idlib&nbsp;
gave him which he deciphered and figured out means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.800

reef nearby and realize that it must be their way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.800

beach reports to his bosses that all members of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.640

the resort is a front for a medical research team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.720
that lures people with medical conditions&nbsp;
to the beach in order to perform clinical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.480
trials for life-saving drugs given to them in the&nbsp;
cocktails served upon arriving they know that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.360
beach speeds up the aging process so they reduce&nbsp;
the trials to a whole day for better results&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.880
they believe they cured patricia's epilepsy since&nbsp;
she didn't have a seizure for eight hours which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.840
is equivalent to about 16 years on the beach the&nbsp;
resort manager and others attempt to poach their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.040
