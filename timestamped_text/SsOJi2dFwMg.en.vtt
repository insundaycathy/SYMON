00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.700
Hello there Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to another episode of Cinema Summary.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.560
Today we'll be looking at "Vanilla Sky" a 2001 science fiction psychological thriller.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.300
Written, co-produced and directed by Cameron Crowe,
it is an English-language adaptation

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.720
of the Spanish film "Abre Los Ojos"

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.100
(It only took the Americans 4 years to copy and reproduce)

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.100
It stars Tom Cruise as a rich businessowner, David Ames, and

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.540
Penelope Cruz as a bookish young dancer named Sofia Serrano.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.871
From a prison cell where he has been charged
with murder, David Aames (Tom Cruise), in

00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:37.760
a prosthetic mask, tells his life story to
court psychologist, Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.760
Russell).

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.200
In flashback, David is shown to be the wealthy
owner of a large publishing firm in New York

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.130
City which he inherited from his father, leaving
its regular duties to his father's trusted

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.190
associates.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.050
As David enjoys the bachelor lifestyle, he
is introduced to Sofia Serrano (Penélope

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.000
Cruz) by his best friend, author Brian Shelby
(Jason Lee) at a party.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.300
David and Sofia spend a night together talking
and fall in love.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.450
When David's former lover, Julianna "Julie"
Gianni (Cameron Diaz), hears of Sofia, she

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.430
attempts to kill herself and David in a car
crash.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.970
Julie dies but David survives, his face grotesquely
disfigured,[4]leading him to wear a mask to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.490
hide the injuries.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.680
With no hope of repairing the damage through
plastic surgery, David cannot come to grips

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.540
with the idea of wearing the mask for the
rest of his life.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.860
On a night out with Sofia and Brian, David
gets hopelessly drunk and Sofia and Brian

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.300
leave him to wallow in the street outside.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.290
At the start of the movie, when David wakes
up with Julie Gianni, her cell phone ringtone

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.750
is "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" but at the moment
she answers the call and the music stops,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.500
the next lyric would have been "Life is but
a dream".

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.260
A hint to the mind-boggling nature of the
film.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Music is used similarly throughout the film,
I wonder if you can spot them?

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.220
David is awakened the next day in the street
by Sofia, who apologises for deserting him

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.409
the night before, and takes him home.

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.370
The two continue to see each other, and David
has his face surgically repaired despite being

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.090
told it was impossible before.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.990
Though his life seems perfectly content, David
finds oddities, such as brief visions of his

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.220
distorted face, and a man at a bar (Noah Taylor)
that tells him David could control the world

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.360
and everyone in it, if he wanted to.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.920
One day, when he goes to Sofia's apartment,
he finds Julie there instead; all of the previous

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.779
mementos of Sofia now show Julie's face.

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:20.680
Angry and confused, David suffocates Julie,
and is later arrested and placed in a mental

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.040
institution, finding his face has reverted
to its previously disfigured state.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.670
David completes telling his story to Curtis,
who proceeds to then visit David further for

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.610
more sessions to try to help him recuperate.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.591
During one interview Curtis tells David the
staff reported him calling out "Ellie" in

00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:39.950
a bad dream and asks who she is.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.189
David later sees a nearby TV advertisement
for "Life Extension", a company that specializes

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:51.549
in cryonic suspension, and realises he'd actually
called out the letters "L" and "E".

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.459
Under Curtis' and a police officer's guard,
David is taken to the Life Extension offices,

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.779
where salesclerk Rebecca (Tilda Swinton) explains
they freeze people just after the point of

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:05.310
death until a cure for their ailment is available
in the future, keeping their brain active

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.109
by placing them in a lucid dream state.

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.150
David becomes anxious and breaks free of Curtis,
realizing he is in his own lucid dream that

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.230
has gone wrong, and calls for tech support.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.969
So there are at least 2 very ‘bog-standard’
interpretations: the explicit science fiction

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:24.091
premise of a wealthy, party-going youth who
goes through a tragic accident and signs away

00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:25.091
his real life for a fantasy one.

00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:26.091
Or, a common explanation for mysterious, mind-screwy
movies is the ‘coma-dream theory’.

00:03:26.091 --> 00:03:27.091
For those unfamiliar with this: its a plot
twist that says ‘Oh, no.

00:03:27.091 --> 00:03:28.091
All the events in this movie were made-up
by the main character in their head’.

00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:29.091
If you want to overAnalyze, it utilizes a
motif of disconnection, fourth wall breaks,

00:03:29.091 --> 00:03:30.091
pop culture references, and deception in order
to portray David Ames’s guilt over the death

00:03:30.091 --> 00:03:31.091
of Julie Gianni and his dissociation with
reality.

00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:32.091
We’re no Wisecrack, but I’d wager that
there is some Jungian archetypes employed

00:03:32.091 --> 00:03:33.091
in the film, especially in regards to David
Ames, wearing a literal mask throughout the

00:03:33.091 --> 00:03:34.091
film and the parallel ‘timelines’.

00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:35.091
The Mask or “Persona”, to my understanding
is the personality you display in social gatherings

00:03:35.091 --> 00:03:36.091
and is for-intents-and-purposes your ‘outside
person’.

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:37.091
Not to say that aspects are not true.

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.091
Simply that aspects of the Mask are there
to ensure your social survival.

00:03:38.091 --> 00:03:39.091
David Ames is depicted as a somewhat sleazy,
fun-loving maverick who enjoys a drink and

00:03:39.091 --> 00:03:40.091
parties.

00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:41.091
His literal face becomes dismantled after
the car accident, leading to him being given

00:03:41.091 --> 00:03:42.091
a ‘regenerative facial prosthesis’, a
mask, hiding the gruesome consequence.

00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:43.091
He lives up to this conception with his fancy
furnishings such as his elevating television,

00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:44.091
his absolutely gorgeous muscle car, and of
course his on-screen and implied debauchery.

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:45.091
A hedonist if you will.

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.091
Once his “Face” becomes disfigured, he
is left to fend for himself in a world that

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:47.091
has left him behind and sees nothing more
than a self-entitled, clingy, and emotionally

00:03:47.091 --> 00:03:48.091
unstable shell of a man.

00:03:48.091 --> 00:03:49.091
His true face beneath the mask, being ugly
and eventful is the reality of his life, no

00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:50.091
longer filled with joy, pleasure, and spectacle.

00:03:50.091 --> 00:03:51.091
Following his rejection by Sofia after the
club, he enters his delusionary world, where

00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:52.091
he sinks back into the delusion: his face
no longer disfigured, his life now filled

00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:53.091
with joy and young love with Sofia and no
more Julia Gianna.

00:03:53.091 --> 00:03:54.091
But his guilt lingers and grows
The Shadow is a concept are the things we

00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:55.091
hide due to dislike or discomfort.

00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:56.091
In the ‘picturesque timeline’ wherein
David has his beautiful cheekbones and toothy

00:03:56.091 --> 00:03:57.091
smile, he’s livin’ it up with Sofia, happy
and content.

00:03:57.091 --> 00:03:58.091
However his guilt begins weighing in on him.

00:03:58.091 --> 00:03:59.091
The distortions in sound and visuals throughout
the film are signs of this unconscious awareness.

00:03:59.091 --> 00:04:00.091
With this onslaught of unconscious guilt comes
the re-emergence of JULIA GIANNA.

00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:01.091
The woman he feels guilty for leading on and
inadvertantly killing her (or so he blames

00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:02.091
himself).

00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:03.091
This can be understood by his killing of “Julia-Sofia”
in the LucidDream, smothering her to death,

00:04:03.091 --> 00:04:04.091
seeing her face replace the visage of Sofia
in all her pictures.

00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:05.091
A grim reminder of his sins, and potentially
an unconscious fear that he will hurt Sofia

00:04:05.091 --> 00:04:06.091
similarly and penancing survivor’s guilt.

00:04:06.091 --> 00:04:07.091
David finds himself in the empty lobby of
the offices, and the man he saw earlier at

00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:08.091
the bar appears, claiming to be David's tech
support from Life Extension, which is now

00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:09.091
known as the Oasis Project.

00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:10.091
They ride up in an elevator to the top of
an impossibly tall building, the height triggering

00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:11.091
David's severe acrophobia.

00:04:11.091 --> 00:04:12.091
The man explains that David has been in cryonic
sleep for 150 years.

00:04:12.091 --> 00:04:13.091
David had opted for Life Extension's services
after struggling with his breakup with Sofia

00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:14.091
and his disfigurement, and after securing
the publishing company to its associates,

00:04:14.091 --> 00:04:15.091
proceeded to kill himself with a drug overdose;
Life Extension preserved his body and, as

00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:16.680
David directed, put him into his lucid dream
starting from the drunken night when Sofia

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.370
left him, under the "vanilla sky" from a Monet
painting.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.729
However, during his sleep, the dream went
horribly wrong and attempted to incorporate

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.970
elements from his subconscious, such as substituting
Julie for Sofia and creating a father-figure

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.160
in Curtis.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.949
As they arrive at the top of the building,
the man offers David a choice: either to be

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:40.340
reinserted into the corrected lucid dream,
or return to the real world by taking a literal

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.289
leap of faith off the roof that will wake
him from his sleep.

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.110
David decides to wake up, ignoring the vision
of Curtis that his subconscious has brought

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.069
to life to talk him out of it.

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:53.270
David envisions Sofia and Brian to say his
goodbyes.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.690
Conquering his final fear, David jumps off
the building, his life flashing before his

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.509
eyes, and whites out immediately before hitting
the ground.

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.330
A female voice commands him to "open your
eyes" (a recurring theme in the movie), and

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.330
the film ends with David opening his eyes.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.330
There are two interpretations of the film:
the explicit science fiction premise wherein

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.330
a rich guy who is miserable decides to sign
away his real life for a fake, ideal fantasy

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.330
in a simulated dream world.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.330
The other is that if the coma-dream: whether
dying in the car crash or being hospitalized

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.330
and in a coma, the events in the film are
a fiction made up by DAVID AMES.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.330
There is the motif of the face through the
film.: in particular DAVID AMES’S.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.330
His disfigurement after thecar accident years
tears down his lifestyle.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.330
The hedonist is gone and so too his confidence.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.330
Masks are common trope and a crucial aspect
of Jungian archetypes.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.330
With Jung, the mask is everything you display
in your community.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.330
In literature they are commonly used similarly
as a symbol of deception or a disguise, hiding

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.330
the truth.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.330
The truth of the matter is arguably survivors
Guilt.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.330
DAVID blames himself for the death of JULIA
GIANNA: his casual sexual relationship up-ended

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.330
by JULIA’S demand for something more, DAVID’S
distance, and his meeting with SOFIA and of

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.330
course the attempted murder-suicide.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.330
JULIA’S words resonate with DAVID, her face
appears and haunts DAVID to sub an extent

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.330
that ends up smothering her.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.330
Although it is revealed that it was in fact
SOFIA he killed, the murderous imagery affirms

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.830
DAVID’S guilt.
