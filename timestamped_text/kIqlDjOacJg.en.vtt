00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.040
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going&nbsp;
to explain an action-adventure fantasy film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:15.920
called “D-War,” Spoilers ahead!&nbsp;
Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.360
At the beginning of the movie, a voice narrates&nbsp;
that many people think the time of dragons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.760
is over, but in reality, it has only just begun.&nbsp;
Every five hundred years, a woman with a mystical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.680
spirit power is born. She has the ability to&nbsp;
turn a serpent into the mightiest dragon of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.200
all. The nature of the serpent will define the&nbsp;
fate of the world, as a good serpent will use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.240
its power to protect the universe, but an&nbsp;
evil one will use it to destroy the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.440
The voice concludes by saying that now is&nbsp;
the time for the spirit to be awakened. 
&nbsp;

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.200
The scene cuts to an accident site in Los Angeles.&nbsp;
A massive dent has been formed on the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.720
and the cause is unknown. A man being&nbsp;
escorted out yells that a beast has risen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.160
Several police officers investigate the place,&nbsp;
trying to collect evidence. A reporter named Ethan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.680
Kendrick arrives at the site and shoots a video&nbsp;
of a scale-like pattern on the ground. Ethan is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.200
now back in his office, but cannot stop looking at&nbsp;
the scale. It reminds him of a story his mentor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.760
Jack, told him fifteen years ago when he&nbsp;
was just a kid. Ethan’s father once took&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.440
Ethan to an antique shop that belonged to a man&nbsp;
named Jack. There, he had seen the same scale&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.040
and a strange light coming from inside a box.&nbsp;
Smoke from inside the box washes over Ethan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.520
and Jack realizes what is happening. 
He fakes a heart attack and sends Ethan’s father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.520
away to get medicines to talk to Ethan alone.&nbsp;
Jack then tells Ethan about the legend of Imoogi.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.720
Imoogi, which translates to dragon in English,&nbsp;
are mystical creatures who lived in heaven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.400
with their followers. Every five hundred years,&nbsp;
one Imoogi is rewarded for their good deeds with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.160
a chance to become a celestial dragon, a dragon&nbsp;
more powerful than all others. But for that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.840
the Imoogi will have to receive the gift of Yuh&nbsp;
Yi Joo from the heavens. Five hundred years ago, a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.360
similar opportunity was provided to the serpents.&nbsp;
But among them was an evil Imoogi named Buraki&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.120
who wanted to possess Yuh Yi Joo for himself so he&nbsp;
could spread his evil to the world. Heaven didn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.160
want to give Buraki such powers, so they sent&nbsp;
Yuh Yi Joo to the earth. Back in 1057, Yuh Yi Joo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.000
landed in a small village in Korea. Heaven then&nbsp;
sent its best warriors, Bochum and his student&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.080
Haram, to protect the Yuh Yi Joo from Buraki. 
However, the evil Buraki wouldn't back down until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.880
he got Yuh Yi Joo. A girl named Narin&nbsp;
was born with a tattoo on her shoulder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.560
which meant that she was chosen to withhold Yuh&nbsp;
Yi Joo. When Narin turned twenty, the Yuh Yi Joo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.840
inside her would be completely formed. From an&nbsp;
early age, the protector of Yuh Yi Joo, Bochum,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.800
trained Haram to protect Narin and taught him&nbsp;
everything he needed to know about Imoogi.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.080
He gave Haram a medallion that would protect him&nbsp;
as Narin’s savior. Eventually, Haram and Narin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.720
fell in love with each other. The day she turned&nbsp;
twenty, their village was attacked by an army&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.800
sent by Buraki to abduct Narin. They destroyed the&nbsp;
whole village and killed whoever got in their way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.760
The soldiers then checked every girls’ shoulder&nbsp;
to look for the mark and found Narin. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.880
abducted her, but Haram came to her rescue and&nbsp;
managed to take her away to a waterfall. 
&nbsp;

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.280
Bochum ran to the waterfall to find Haram’s&nbsp;
medallion on the ground. Narin and Haram had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.200
run away together. Enraged and desperate to get&nbsp;
the Yuh Yi Joo, the evil Buraki pursued them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.120
himself. The two reached a cliff and were about to&nbsp;
get caught. They jumped off the cliff, committing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.440
suicide, leaving Buraki to wait for another five&nbsp;
hundred years for Yuh Yi Joo to be born. 
&nbsp;

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.840
After telling the story, Jack shows Ethan a&nbsp;
mark on his arm, claiming that he is Bochum’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.240
reincarnation and Ethan is Haram’s reincarnation.&nbsp;
He then hands Ethan the same medallion and tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.440
him to always keep it near. The girl with Yuh&nbsp;
Yi Joo has already been sent to the earth and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.880
is named Sarah. They have to find and save&nbsp;
her from Buraki in this life as well. 
&nbsp;

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.360
Back in the present, Ethan is still in his&nbsp;
office. He asks his colleague named Bruce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.760
to look for a girl named Sarah, who was&nbsp;
born with a dragon tattoo on her shoulder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.960
Bruce laughs saying that there are thousands of&nbsp;
Sarah in LA. The scene cuts to Sarah exercising&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.120
in a gym. She and her friend watch the news&nbsp;
and see Ethan reporting about the scale&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.240
that was found that morning. The news unsettles&nbsp;
Sarah, so she quickly rushes out of the gym. 
&nbsp;

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.320
Meanwhile, Agent Frank Pinsky, who is&nbsp;
investigating the finding of the scale,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.120
goes to meet a scientist studying it. They have&nbsp;
found out that the scale is harder than diamond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.160
and seems to be of an ancient reptile. No one&nbsp;
has ever seen such a substance before, so they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.960
do not have much idea about its origin. 
Sarah has an unsettling feeling and feels like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.000
her life's in danger. Her friend Brandy assumes&nbsp;
the news from earlier just got into Sarah’s head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.280
and invites her to go out. At night,&nbsp;
three thugs harass Sarah on the streets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.280
Jack arrives there and knocks the thugs&nbsp;
out in mere seconds before leaving.
&nbsp;

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.040
Somewhere else in a zoo, a zookeeper comes across&nbsp;
the evil Imoogi Buraki throwing an elephant in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.200
air. A strange man in black clothing watches from&nbsp;
afar. The scared zookeeper is left speechless.
&nbsp;

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.960
Sarah is now at the police station, explaining how&nbsp;
the thugs were knocked out. A reporter clicks her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.040
picture to cover the story. The reporter&nbsp;
happens to be one of Ethan’s colleagues.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.440
Ethan gets a look at the picture of Sarah and&nbsp;
sees the tattoo on her shoulders. He has finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.480
found the girl who bears the Yuh Yi Joo. 
At night, Sarah dreams of someone trying to kill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.240
her. When she wakes up, she is troubled by a pain&nbsp;
in her chest, so she calls 911, paramedics escort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.360
her to a hospital. Her friend Brandy and her&nbsp;
boyfriend go to Sarah’s home to pack her clothes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.120
and bring them to the hospital, but they come&nbsp;
across the giant serpent, Buraki. He kills Brandy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.320
in one go and continues searching for Sarah. The&nbsp;
man from earlier who happens to be the general&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.760
of Buraki’s soldiers is there too. The following&nbsp;
day, Ethan and Bruce go to Sarah’s house, which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.400
being investigated for Brandy’s murder. They find&nbsp;
out about her being in a hospital and go to meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.600
her. Ethan finally meets Sarah and tells her he&nbsp;
is there to help. But as they talk, Buraki circles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.640
the hospital looking for Sarah. Ethan and Bruce&nbsp;
manage to drive her away from the hospital but are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.120
stopped by the general. However, a car driven by&nbsp;
Jack, who is disguised as a lady, saves them. 
&nbsp;

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.440
The FBI is investigating Buraki’s attack at&nbsp;
the hospital and finds out that the serpent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.240
is looking for Sarah. Agent Frank is ordered&nbsp;
by his boss to kill the girl once he finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.560
her because it is the only way to stop Buraki.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, the general summons the army of Buraki&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.560
called the atrox army. It consists of historic&nbsp;
creatures like flying dragons and dawlers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.240
Jack drops Ethan and Sarah to a beach, from where&nbsp;
they go to Ethan’s psychologist friend's house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.320
The doctor hypnotizes Sarah and asks her about her&nbsp;
past life. Sarah remembers her life as Narin and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.320
how she loved Haram. Suddenly a blue light shines&nbsp;
from within her, and she starts to float mid-air.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.760
Ethan calms her down, but Buraki finds them there&nbsp;
as well. They get into a car and drive away, while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.960
the massive serpent follows them. The two manage&nbsp;
to get away from it and call Bruce. They meet him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.400
at a restaurant, where Bruce prepares a helicopter&nbsp;
for them so they can fly away somewhere safe. Jack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.880
appears in front of Ethan and asks him to take&nbsp;
the girl to the waterfall where a good serpent can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.160
get hold of the Yuh Yi Joo. But that would still&nbsp;
mean that Sarah would die, so Ethan denies it. 
&nbsp;

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.600
Suddenly, Buraki approaches the restaurant,&nbsp;
making Ethan and Sarah run for their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.320
It follows them around the city, destroying&nbsp;
everything that comes in its way. The duo manages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.880
to get on the roof of a skyscraper, where they&nbsp;
board a helicopter. But before they can take off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.120
the massive serpent slithers up the building&nbsp;
and catches the helicopter in its mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.680
Ethan and Sarah jump back on the roof as&nbsp;
the helicopter goes flying on the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.960
and explodes. The officials have concluded the&nbsp;
situation as an emergency and sent several army&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.240
choppers to fight Buraki. As the choppers fire&nbsp;
at the creature, Ethan and Sarah run away. 
&nbsp;

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.360
The army choppers somehow get the beast off the&nbsp;
building but are then attacked by the atrox army.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.520
A fleet of dragons attacks the&nbsp;
soldiers and soon overpowers them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.720
Massive army tanks fight the crowd of dawdlers&nbsp;
but are no match to the creatures. Agent Frank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:20.240
and his associate Campbell finally find Sarah and&nbsp;
Ethan, and take them to a safe building. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.800
when they reach there, Frank points his gun&nbsp;
at Sarah. He has been ordered to kill her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.160
to stop the chaos. Campbell shoots Frank dead&nbsp;
before he can kill Sarah. He believes that only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.280
Sarah can stop the Buraki from coming back every&nbsp;
five hundred years. The duo then gets in a car and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.400
drives away from the city in hopes of escaping,&nbsp;
but the atrox army finds them. They are eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.600
abducted and brought to Buraki’s hiding. 
Ethan is tied to a pole while Sarah is laid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:51.120
for Buraki to consume the Yuh Yi Joo in her. They&nbsp;
are surrounded by the atrox army and have no way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:56.240
to escape now. The general summons Buraki,&nbsp;
who approaches Sarah to get the Yuh Yi Joo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.440
But suddenly, a light flashes upon Ethan’s&nbsp;
medallion. The medallion’s power is released,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.720
which lets out a strong force killing the whole&nbsp;
atrox army and burning them to dust. But the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:12.000
general and Buraki are left unharmed. The general&nbsp;
strikes at Ethan, and an electric force coming out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
of the medallion kills him too. Now, an angered&nbsp;
Buraki attacks the two but is restrained by a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.200
good Imoogi sent from heaven. The two serpents&nbsp;
get into an intense battle slithering around one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.560
another. They match in strength and abilities,&nbsp;
but Buraki manages to knock out the good Imoogi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.360
and approaches Sarah again. Seeing someone as&nbsp;
powerful as the good Imoogi being defeated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.960
Sarah has no hope left. She finally accepts&nbsp;
her fate and approaches Buraki. A bright&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:44.720
light shines from her tattoo and creates a magical&nbsp;
floating sphere. The sphere is the Yuh Yi Joo. 
&nbsp;

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.600
Before Buraki can consume the sphere, Sarah, who&nbsp;
can control it, throws it towards the good Imoogi.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.640
The good Imoogi consumes it and turns into&nbsp;
the mighty dragon that Buraki wished to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.880
Sarah falls unconscious to the ground.&nbsp;
After transforming into the dragon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:06.480
the good Imoogi is a thousand times more powerful&nbsp;
than Buraki. It strikes at Buraki and throws it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:12.240
to the ground easily. The dragon then tries to go&nbsp;
back to heaven, but Buraki latches onto its tail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.920
The dragon attacks it with fire and finally kills&nbsp;
the beast. It then approaches Ethan holding Sarah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:23.760
and throws out Yuh Yi Joo from its mouth. Sarah’s&nbsp;
body turns into a magical smoke and forms the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:29.200
shape of her eternal self. She tells Ethan that&nbsp;
they will meet again someday and gets sucked into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.640
Yuh Yi Joo. The mighty dragon consumes the&nbsp;
Yuh Yi Joo and flies away to heaven.
