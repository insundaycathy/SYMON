Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.040
Today, I'm going to explain an action, fantasy,
horror film called “Legion.”

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.330
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.050
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.990
It is early morning, two days before Christmas,
when a man, appearing bloodied, falls from

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.990
the sky.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.080
The man, Michael, takes off his clothes, and
wings emerge from his back.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.619
He takes a large knife, cutting into his flesh,
removing his wings.

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.230
He screams in agony as a halo appears above
his head, descending to a collar around his

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.230
neck.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.550
As the halo wraps around his collar, it falls
off.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.070
He breaks into a warehouse and starts mending
his wounds.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.850
He then heads to a room full of guns, gathering
large caliber firearms.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.139
A pair of police officers patrolling the neighborhood
run into an explosion, and Michael emerges

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:41.389
from the flames.

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:44.589
The cops aim their guns at Michael, telling
him to drop his bags.

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.219
Their radios start sounding off several emergency
calls, and Michael hears it.

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.780
He says it has begun, and there isn’t much
time.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.609
One of the cops approaches Michael, but Michael
overpowers him.

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.170
The other cop suddenly starts convulsing,
his head moving unnaturally fast before stopping.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.510
The cop’s eyes turn large and black; his
teeth sharpened to spikes.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.570
He begins speaking in a disembodied voice,
telling Michael he has disobeyed orders.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.490
Michael answers he’s following his own orders,
and the cop declares that Michael would die

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.780
with the child.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.250
The cop starts shooting, but Michael doges
out of the way, shooting back.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.990
The cop falls, and Michael drives away, the
lights shutting off as he goes by.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.170
A young man, Jeep, awakens early in the morning,
and a young pregnant lady, Charlie, calls

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.170
to him.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.380
They sit together, and Charlie asks Jeep if
he’s had another bad dream.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.109
Jeep says yes, and Charlie tells him he needs
to worry less about his father.

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.490
Jeep says the only thing he worries about
is her, and Charlie teases him, saying he’s

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.420
concerned about a pregnant woman with a baby
he isn’t the father of.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.251
Charlie says the baby would have a new family
in a month as she’s not prepared to be a

00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:42.439
mother yet.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.929
Jeep offers to help her raise the child together,
but Charlie tells him he needs to stop worrying

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.380
about her.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.229
Later in the day, Bob, Jeep’s father, opens
up his diner and messes with the television

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.650
to get better reception.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.990
A man with a hook hand, Percy, teases Bob.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.179
A rebellious young woman, Audrey, stands by
the jukebox machine, and her mother, Sandra,

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.929
expresses her distaste for the way Audrey
is dressed.

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.770
Sandra’s husband, Howard, annoyed by Sandra’s
rant, tells Audrey what Sandra thinks, and

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.620
Audrey snaps back with a sarcastic remark.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.239
Kyle, enjoying his drive, sees the nearest
car service is in fifty miles.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.090
He considers stopping at the diner.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.350
He sees a pregnant Charlie smoking, greeting
her a merry Christmas.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.450
He then asks for directions and realizes he’s
way off course.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.470
Charlie and Kyle then enter the diner, where
an impatient Sandra hounds Howard about leaving.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.310
Kyle asks to use Bob’s phone, and Howard
asks Bob when their car would get fixed, saying

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.930
they’ve waited too long.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.569
Bob checks on Jeep and sees he’s not working
on the car but is busy polishing a crib for

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.830
Charlie’s baby.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.110
Jeep walks out, and Bob goes after him, telling
him he needs to stop chasing after Charlie.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.560
Jeep answers, saying he’s been having terrible
nightmares about Charlie, with horrible things

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.420
happening to her over and over.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.360
He says he feels an overpowering sense to
take care of Charlie.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.530
Bob thinks Jeep is making a mistake chasing
after Charlie and thinks Jeep would be better

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.180
off leaving the diner in search of a better
life.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.870
Bob goes back into the diner and sees the
television had lost reception again.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.510
He tries fixing it up, but he only gets an
emergency broadcast signal.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.200
Percy checks his radio, and he hears the same
thing from all frequencies.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.440
Everyone listens worriedly as the monotonous
emergency broadcast ringing fills the diner.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.771
In Bob’s office, Kyle finally connects a
call with his ex-wife, saying he’d arrive

00:03:18.771 --> 00:03:20.730
the next day for their divorce signing.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.500
He demands to speak with his son, but the
call cuts off.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.280
He tries redialling, but the phone lines are
now dead.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.970
A frail older woman steps into the diner with
a big smile on her face.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.239
Charlie takes her order, and the woman starts
speaking with Sandra.

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.650
Charlie serves the woman her order, and the
woman asks Charlie about her baby.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.790
She asks about the father and asks Charlie
how she would manage to raise the baby independently.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.860
Charlie says she can take care of herself,
but the woman tells her the baby would burn.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.510
Charlie is taken aback, but the old woman
repeats what she said, now with more profanity.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.430
Everyone in the diner hears this, and they
all look at the old lady.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.950
Charlie storms away, and the woman happily
devours her meal, now being swarmed by flies.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.260
She then says all babies are going to burn.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.220
Sandra tries talking to the woman, but the
woman fires back, insulting Sandra.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.469
Howard gets up to speak to the old woman,
but she bites his neck, taking a big chunk

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:07.579
of flesh.

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.040
Percy throws a frying pan at the woman, her
neck cracking back, but she gets up as if

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.079
unaffected.

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.790
The woman then jumps up and starts crawling
on the ceiling.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.300
Bob gets a shotgun and starts shooting at
the woman.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.340
The woman slaps Bob away, and Jeeo gets the
shotgun but hesitates to pull the trigger.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.880
The woman flies towards him, her feet sliding
across the floor.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.550
The woman suddenly falls dead after Kyle shoots
her several times.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.520
Everyone in the diner rushes to take care
of Howard, who has now lost a considerable

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.520
amount of blood.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.720
Kyle and Percy get Howard and his family to
Kyle’s car, and they start driving to the

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.720
hospital.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.640
They run into what appears to be a cloud but
is a massive swarm of locusts.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.980
Kyle’s car returns and Bob meets them rushing
back in and sees a massive swarm of locusts

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.340
flying overhead, blocking out the sun.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.080
The men then take the old woman’s body to
throw it out and see a police car approaching.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.580
The police car stops, and Michael emerges.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.050
Bob aims the gun at Michael, telling him to
stay away.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.700
Bob then explains the rationale for his behavior.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.060
Michael seems unfazed by Bob’s story and
realizes Bob and the rest have no clue what

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.500
is happening to the world.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.580
Michael grabs the weapon from Bob, pointing
it at Bob’s head.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.570
Percy steps out, trying to resolve the confrontation.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.510
Michael considers the situation and tells
them more people similar to the old woman

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.030
would be arriving soon.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.070
He hands Bob back his shotgun and gives everyone
a firearm, even Charlie, but he tells her

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.150
to refrain from doing anything brave.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.930
They all head into the diner and barricade
the doors.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.070
Night falls, and Michael leads the men to
the roof to get a better vantage point of

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.070
their enemy.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.280
They hear an ice cream truck approaching,
and a tall, lanky man exits the ice cream

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.280
truck.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.610
When he sees the men, he lets out a guttural
screech before his limbs start stretching

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.610
out.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.350
It charges at the men, and they start shooting
until it dies.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.240
They see more cars approaching, and Michael
orders them to shoot.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.550
The vehicles then stop, and the drivers all
step out and start walking towards the diner.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.140
Michael orders them to keep firing, telling
them the targets are no longer people.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.390
One of the attackers bursts in through the
windows and starts dragging Howard away.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.950
Sandra, Audrey, and Charlie all dive in to
help, but another attacker grabs Charlie,

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.780
excited to see he’s found her.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.200
Michael steps in, slicing the man’s arm
off.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.490
He shoots at the windows, and the attackers
start backing away.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.530
Michael then grabs a frantic Sandra and tells
her Howard is dead.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.660
Michael is disappointed in Charlie and reminds
her not to do anything brave.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.750
The men head back down, and Bob demands an
explanation for what’s happening.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.920
Michael reveals to everyone that God has become
angry and has ordered the extermination of

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.120
the human race.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.110
He explains that the attackers they fought
off are mere vessels possessed by angels.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.500
Everyone is in disbelief, saying they’ve
never heard of angels doing such a thing.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.110
Jeep asks how Michael has such a vast knowledge
regarding their enemy, and Michael reveals

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.370
that he used to be on the angels’ side.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.650
Bob interjects, saying the whole thing is
preposterous and expressing his nonbelief

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.860
in God.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.420
Michael says God reciprocates Bob’s feelings,
also losing faith and belief in humans.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.110
Michael then says his sole purpose is to protect
Charlie and her baby as her child is humanity’s

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.490
only hope for survival.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.530
Michael says he doesn’t care what they believe
in, but the fact remains that the attackers

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.560
outside want them all dead, especially Charlie
and her unborn child.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.150
Jeep chats with Michael, asking him his origin.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.390
Michael says he was a general in God’s army
and decided to defy God when God gave him

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.290
an order he didn’t believe in.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.890
Michael says God had lost faith, but he had
not.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.390
Jeep asks Michael how he has maintained faith.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.240
Michael says that even though the world is
filled with hatred and darkness, he still

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.780
sees glimpses of hope in people who refuse
to give up and surrender, people who do not

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.720
bow in the face of loss, people like Jeep.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.460
Michael recalls his time back in the heavens,
the moment he was given the order he defied.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.800
Gabriel tells Michael that humans have brought
judgment on themselves.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.910
Michael says it an angel’s duty to guide
humans, but Gabriel says it is their higher

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.870
duty to obey the Almighty.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.120
Michael knows that he is right within his
heart, as God made his heart with all of God’s

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.470
love, but Gabriel says Michael is too late,
as the other to exterminate the humans had

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.740
been given.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.430
Michael watches as scores of angels fill the
skies.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.340
Sandra wakes up the following day hearing
a strange noise.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.340
She walks to the back of the diner, hearing
Howard’s sobs.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.210
She peeks through the backdoor and sees Howard
crucified upside down, full of boils, calling

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:49.260
for her help.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.080
Kyle and Audrey are unsuccessful at keeping
her inside and she runs out.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.270
Sandra nears Howard but Howard bursts, spewing
out acid.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.550
Percy gets to Sandra in the nick of time,
shielding her from the blast.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.450
Percy carries her back to the diner before
collapsing to the floor.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.050
Percy’s back had been scalded clean to the
bone.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.850
Sandra is tied to a chair while Audrey tries
to feed her.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:12.050
Sandra then blames Audrey for everything happening
to them, telling Audrey she has ruined everything.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.890
Later, Audrey switches through radio stations
until she hits a frequency with someone broadcasting.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.331
The broadcast speaks of several pockets of
survivors fighting back the possessed, but

00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:24.240
Michael says they can’t risk leaving as
it would only make Charlie an easier target.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.470
Charlie later chats with Jeep, remembering
when she almost had the baby aborted before

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.230
backing out at the last minute.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.270
She believed she could go back whenever she
wanted, but it got to a point where the doctor

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.190
could no longer perform the abortion, and
she ended up stuck with the baby.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.940
This then led to her hating the child.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.139
The lights turn back on, and a car arrives
at the diner, trying to get a gas refill.

00:08:42.139 --> 00:08:45.550
Kyle and Audrey prepare to shoot, but they
see it’s a father with his son.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.170
A gang of troublemakers then show up, running
the dad over and taking the kid.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.040
Kyle jumps down to help the kid, shooting
at the men.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.000
He gets to the kid and starts carrying him
back.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.589
Bob removes the barricade, eager to help,
but Michael aims the gun at him and threatens

00:08:57.589 --> 00:08:59.060
to shoot if he continues.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.930
Outside, the kid is revealed to be another
possessed person as it bites down Kyle’s

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:03.930
neck.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.160
Audrey then jumps down to help but runs out
of bullets and starts getting swarmed.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.899
Charlie decides to take matters into her own
hands when she sees Michael isn’t helping.

00:09:10.899 --> 00:09:14.399
Not wanting to bring harm to Charlie, Michael
agrees to retrieve Audrey.

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:17.540
Michael steps out and makes quick work of
the attackers, using the gasoline pump as

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.680
a flamethrower.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.279
He then takes Audrey, and they run back into
the diner, barely escaping the explosion.

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:26.100
Charlie runs to get water but sees the kid
has made in to the diner.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.680
The kid comes at her with a knife, but Charlie
manages to shield herself until the kid’s

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.799
knife slips and slices off his fingers.

00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:34.550
Charlie kicks the kid away, and the lights
go out again.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.930
The kid suddenly grabs Bob, but Michael pulls
him away, and Jeep shoots the possessed kid.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.480
Unfortunately, the stress has gotten to Charlie,
and she goes into labor.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.470
Charlie begins giving birth, and they hear
a loud continuous horn blasting from the skies.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.699
Jeep and Bob are on the roof and see the horde
of possessed awaiting them.

00:09:49.699 --> 00:09:53.060
Charlie keeps pushing until the cries of an
infant echo through the silence.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.810
Audrey shows the infant to Sandra, but Sandra
is trying to find a way to break free of her

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.810
restraints.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.629
Charlie asks if they are safe, and Michael
says no, but now, at least, the child would

00:10:01.629 --> 00:10:03.689
have a chance to live and lead humanity.

00:10:03.689 --> 00:10:06.470
The possessed hear the infant’s wails and
start crying too.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.629
The horn blasts again, and a winged creature
appears to be descending from the sky.

00:10:10.629 --> 00:10:13.660
Michael says God had sent down Gabriel to
finish the mission that had initially been

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.050
given to Michael.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:18.220
Jeep realizes that the order Michael disobeyed
must have been the order to prevent the child

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.540
from being born.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.939
Charlie demands an explanation, and Michael
admits that he was indeed tasked with eliminating

00:10:22.939 --> 00:10:23.990
the baby.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.860
But he also reveals that the baby was never
supposed to be born.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.370
The future has now been unwritten, and the
Will of God had changed.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.370
Charlie takes the baby from Audrey, but Sandra
snatches it away.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:37.069
Sandra intends to give the baby over to the
possessed so that they’d leave them alone.

00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:39.320
Gabriel nears, and the horns get louder.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.029
The doors burst open, and Michael shoots Sandra.

00:10:42.029 --> 00:10:45.080
Jeep dives to catch the baby but comes face-to-face
with Gabriel.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.209
Gabriel then smites Jeep with his mace, but
Jeep rolls away.

00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:52.319
Bob tries shooting Gabriel, but Gabriel is
too fast, using his wings as shields.

00:10:52.319 --> 00:10:54.730
Gabriel then slices through Bob’s stomach.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.670
Michael stops Jeep from helping, telling him
he must leave with Charlie to keep the baby

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.889
safe by following the instructions.

00:10:59.889 --> 00:11:03.889
Michael, Audrey, and Charlie slowly make their
way to the police car, and all the possessed

00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:05.170
stop and let them pass.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.730
Gabriel calls Michael God’s rebellious son,
and Michael points out how Gabriel had always

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.760
been the one eager to please their father.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.790
Gabriel is surprised to see Michael without
wings and tells him his disobedience will

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.050
be punished.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.760
Michael says what happens to him is irrelevant
as the child had already been born.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.800
Michael asks Gabriel for a truce, but Gabriel
rejects, saying there’s no other way.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.749
The two then prepare to fight as Jeeps drives
away, headed for the settlement they heard

00:11:25.749 --> 00:11:27.339
on the radio.

00:11:27.339 --> 00:11:31.300
Michael uses his guns, shooting at Gabriel,
and Gabriel begins thrashing and moving about,

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.569
trying to hit Michael.

00:11:32.569 --> 00:11:36.730
Gabriel wounds Michael using his wings, but
Michael gets behind Gabriel, choking him into

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:37.730
submission.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.660
Gabriel then takes his mace and stabs Michael.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.110
Michael falls to the ground, and Gabriel sheds
a tear as he watches his brother die.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.980
Micheal then illuminates before disintegrating.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.450
As Jeep drives, he notices markings appearing
on his forearm and understands these are the

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.649
instructions Michael was pertaining to.

00:11:51.649 --> 00:11:55.390
Gabriel finds Bob still alive, but Bob had
been releasing gas, letting it fill the room

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.269
before igniting it with his lighter.

00:11:57.269 --> 00:12:00.779
Gabriel flies away, but a massive fireball
engulfs the diner along with the possessed

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:01.779
outside.

00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:06.070
Jeep, Charlie, and Audrey think they’ve
escaped when Gabriel smashes into them.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.470
Gabriel grabs hold of their car, and he almost
gets a hold of the baby.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.100
Jeep accelerates, and Audrey grabs hold of
Gabriel.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.809
Audrey shouts for Jeep to step on the brakes,
and he does so, launching Audrey and Gabriel

00:12:15.809 --> 00:12:16.809
forward.

00:12:16.809 --> 00:12:18.910
The car then crashes into a ditch.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:22.709
The baby and Charlie miraculously survive,
and Jeep leads them up a mountain.

00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:26.689
Gabriel then appears, cornering Charlie, but
Jeep dives into Gabriel, pushing both of them

00:12:26.689 --> 00:12:27.829
off a cliff.

00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:31.680
Gabriel prepares to strike down Jeep, but
Michael appears, saving Jeep.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.999
Gabriel can't believe his eyes, as Michael
had openly disobeyed their creator but had

00:12:34.999 --> 00:12:36.999
once again been granted eternal life.

00:12:36.999 --> 00:12:40.720
Michael then boasts, as only Gabriel gave
God what he wanted, but Michael gave God what

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.749
he needed.

00:12:41.749 --> 00:12:45.370
Gabriel tries to strike Michael, but Michael
is too fast, slicing through Gabriel before

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:46.740
he notices.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.060
Michael then spares a defeated Gabriel.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.749
Michael departs, telling Jeep he is the true
protector.

00:12:51.749 --> 00:12:55.210
Jeep asks if they’ll meet again, and Michael
says to keep his faith alive.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.759
Jeep and Charlie then find the surviving settlement
and prepare themselves to raise humanity’s

00:12:58.759 --> 00:13:07.139
last hope for survival.
