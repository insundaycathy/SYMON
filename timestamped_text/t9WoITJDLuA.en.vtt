00:00:05.888 --> 00:00:07.360
hey what's going on guys

00:00:07.488 --> 00:00:14.400
today I'll show you a post-apocalyptic action film, "Attack on Titan" Part 2 end of the world

00:00:14.784 --> 00:00:17.024
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:18.368 --> 00:00:22.592
previously on Part 1, humanity lives inside the great walls 

00:00:22.784 --> 00:00:26.432
without any attacks from the Titans for almost a century

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.056
until someday, their peace comes to an end 

00:00:29.184 --> 00:00:32.000
as the coming Colossal Titan breaches the Outer Wall

00:00:32.192 --> 00:00:36.864
causing the numerous Titans to swarm inside and slaughter humans for food

00:00:37.568 --> 00:00:42.048
the survivors retreat into the Inner Wall, but due to the food shortage there

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:44.608
the commander assembles a scouting regiment 

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:47.040
attempting to claim their lost lands back 

00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:51.968
Eren, a human warrior who sacrifices himself in combatting those Titans 

00:00:52.096 --> 00:00:55.424
is found however, change into a Titan form himself

00:00:56.128 --> 00:01:01.952
it's revealed that years before, Eren's father conducted his secret experiments on Titans 

00:01:02.144 --> 00:01:04.832
hoping to find a serum to turn human into a Titan

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.672
he tested the experimental serum on his young son Eren 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.024
however, the military police learned of the father's secret experiment soon 

00:01:13.216 --> 00:01:14.624
and broke in their house

00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:19.104
taking Eren's parents right before Eren was hidden up in a secret passage

00:01:20.704 --> 00:01:23.392
in the present, Eren regains his consciousness 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.360
only to find that he's tied up before the commander and his soldiers

00:01:28.128 --> 00:01:30.944
the commander interrogates him for the secret in his body

00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:35.488
but Eren is unable to account for his power to transform into a Titan

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.648
the commander believes Eren is a potential threat to humanity 

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:41.568
and orders his men to kill Eren 

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:44.960
while considering that Eren's just saved their lives

00:01:45.088 --> 00:01:48.032
and can play his role in fighting against the Titans outside 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.296
Armin and some of the scouts stand up to defend Eren

00:01:51.552 --> 00:01:54.368
trying to persuade the commander to spare Eren's life

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.440
the commander insists on executing Eren 

00:01:57.568 --> 00:02:01.472
and kills a soldier who is about to unveil a secret about the army

00:02:02.368 --> 00:02:04.800
but right before the soldiers are about to execute Eren

00:02:04.928 --> 00:02:08.896
a Titan busts in from the top, killing the commander and his men

00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:12.416
the scouts find it's hard to deal with such a tough Titan

00:02:12.544 --> 00:02:16.320
for it's much more flexible and powerful than those ordinary Titans

00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:20.672
what's worse, it even knows how to protect its weakness on the back

00:02:21.312 --> 00:02:23.936
the Titan targets Eren only and takes him away 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.368
sparing Mikasa and her comrades

00:02:27.584 --> 00:02:31.104
with the plan to retrieve an undetonated bomb to seal the Outer Wall

00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:33.920
Armin sets out on his journey with the rest

00:02:34.944 --> 00:02:38.208
on the other side, Eren awakens in a mysterious bunker 

00:02:38.464 --> 00:02:40.768
while still confused by its surroundings 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.304
he sees Shiki Shima 

00:02:42.432 --> 00:02:47.168
who shows up and explains that he saves him out of the Titan and brings him here

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:52.544
Shiki Shima then reveals to Eren the origins of the Titans 100 years ago

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:55.808
when the military kept testing a new virus on human bodies

00:02:55.936 --> 00:02:57.792
trying to develop a super-soldier

00:02:58.368 --> 00:03:00.160
the experiment's gone wrong however 

00:03:00.288 --> 00:03:03.872
as human bodies became infected and turned into Titans

00:03:04.256 --> 00:03:06.752
leading to the collapse of almost the whole humanity

00:03:07.392 --> 00:03:11.424
the human survivors have to build the great walls as a defense for themselves

00:03:11.616 --> 00:03:16.352
as time passes, the long-in-peace humans forget the horrible Titan past

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.232
and turn to be rebellious of being confined inside 

00:03:19.808 --> 00:03:23.968
because of that, the military plans to oppress people with the fear of the Titans

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:28.064
learning of the truth, Eren decides to join Shiki Shima

00:03:28.192 --> 00:03:32.544
who plans to fight against the corrupted military and overthrow its ruling

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.104
with stockpiles of the pre-Titan War weapons

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.648
Eren and Shiki Shima later reunite with Armin and his group

00:03:39.776 --> 00:03:42.208
who have retrieved the undetonated bomb 

00:03:42.592 --> 00:03:45.216
with the hopes of using it to seal the breached Outer Wall

00:03:46.048 --> 00:03:49.376
Shiki Shima however, rather than seal the Outer Wall

00:03:49.568 --> 00:03:52.384
plans to use the dud bomb to blow up the Inner Wall instead 

00:03:52.768 --> 00:03:56.736
so as to let the Titans overtake the military and thus free humanity

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.496
realizing that such plan will cause more innocent civilians to die from the Titans' attack

00:04:02.688 --> 00:04:04.992
Eren stands against Shikishima in anger

00:04:05.824 --> 00:04:09.792
he can't take any upper hand but is overwhelmed by Shiki Shima

00:04:10.624 --> 00:04:14.208
right then, Mikasa stands up to confront him to protect Eren 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.216
but only gets humiliated by his smelly kiss

00:04:18.112 --> 00:04:20.608
to stop Shiki Shima and his crazy plan 

00:04:20.736 --> 00:04:24.064
Armin and a scout boy decides to destroy his weapons

00:04:24.256 --> 00:04:29.504
the scout boy then brings down a nearby tower that falls on the weapon stockpile

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.368
causing a subsequent huge explosion and the sacrifice of his own life as well

00:04:35.392 --> 00:04:38.912
the remaining scouts escape out in a truck with the undetonated bomb

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:41.728
however, Shiki Shima follow up soon 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.672
and wanna take the undetonated bomb for his plan

00:04:45.568 --> 00:04:50.304
to everyone's shock, he stabs himself in the heart and changes into a Titan suddenly

00:04:50.688 --> 00:04:54.208
which turns out to be the exact Titan that took Eren away earlier

00:04:55.168 --> 00:04:57.216
the bomb is later brought near the breached wall

00:04:57.344 --> 00:04:59.968
but they only find that it's all surrounded by the Titans 

00:05:00.928 --> 00:05:03.424
in order to gain more power for the dangerous task 

00:05:03.552 --> 00:05:06.560
Eren tries to stab his heart to make himself changed

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.912
but is stopped by others, for nobody is sure whether that also works for Eren

00:05:11.872 --> 00:05:15.456
without better choice, the group attack Shiki Shima in a joint effort

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:19.104
the scout girl blows one of its eye with an explosive arrow 

00:05:19.424 --> 00:05:22.304
Mikasa chops down some of its giant fingers

00:05:22.624 --> 00:05:24.736
while Eren cuts off its hamstrings 

00:05:24.864 --> 00:05:26.720
causing it to fall onto the ground 

00:05:27.296 --> 00:05:30.304
despite their joint effort, the Titan still takes the upper hand 

00:05:30.432 --> 00:05:33.888
and later smashes Eren into a wall with its deadly forces

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.960
which however, turns Eren into his Titan form

00:05:37.792 --> 00:05:39.840
he then confronts the Titan Shiki Shima 

00:05:39.968 --> 00:05:42.144
who wanna leave with the undetonated bomb

00:05:42.784 --> 00:05:46.496
the two Titans have a fierce dogfight on the ground and in the sky

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.232
Eren finally defeats Shiki Shima with a blade piercing his Titan body

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.792
and a K.O kick smashing the head

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.696
soon after that, the Titan Eren climbs the wall 

00:05:57.888 --> 00:06:00.640
and plants the bomb with the help of the remaining scouts

00:06:01.216 --> 00:06:04.992
Eren later reverts to his human form while Armin sets the fuse

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.000
as they begin to evacuate from this area

00:06:08.192 --> 00:06:11.008
the commander, who's survived the earlier attack however

00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:14.464
wants the group to give up Eren and return to the Inner Wall

00:06:14.976 --> 00:06:16.064
but they refuse

00:06:16.832 --> 00:06:21.440
the commander then injures Armin but is shot by arrows and falls from the top

00:06:21.888 --> 00:06:22.976
moments later however

00:06:23.104 --> 00:06:27.584
the group are frightened to see that the commander transforms into the Colossal Titan

00:06:27.712 --> 00:06:30.400
which actually breached the Outer Wall previously 

00:06:30.592 --> 00:06:34.240
purposely leading the Titans inside to attack the rebellious people

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.616
the group jump on the Colossal Titan's back in an attempt to attack its weakness

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.560
but lose one more member due to its deadly strike 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.312
while Eren and Mikasa are in great danger 

00:06:45.504 --> 00:06:49.472
the scout girl follows up and fires at the Colossal Titan with a missile 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.992
which blows off its face and brings it down to the wall

00:06:53.952 --> 00:06:57.280
the bomb however, doesn't go off that time as expected

00:06:57.472 --> 00:07:00.608
so Mikasa tries to get the bomb fuse working again

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.360
but is confronted by revived Shikishima 

00:07:03.488 --> 00:07:09.312
who mocks at their effort first but later decides to help them upon realizing his own destiny

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.896
Eren tries to break into the Colossal Titan's nape 

00:07:13.088 --> 00:07:16.544
but is knocked down badly before he can give it a fatal shot 

00:07:17.376 --> 00:07:22.048
fortunately, at that critical moment, the Titan Shiki Shima carries the bomb up to the top

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.608
and lodges it into the Colossal Titan's mouth

00:07:25.056 --> 00:07:28.896
blowing it up right away, but instead sacrificing himself as well

00:07:30.048 --> 00:07:32.800
the detonation successfully closes the hole in the wall 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.525
while Mikasa grabs Eren and takes him out of the falling debris to the top of the wall 

00:07:38.956 --> 00:07:43.244
where they see for the first time the magnificent ocean in the far distance

00:07:44.142 --> 00:07:46.894
they relieve at last and smile at each other 

00:07:47.022 --> 00:07:50.606
seemingly ready to embrace a new life outside the wall

00:07:51.886 --> 00:07:53.294
while unbeknownst to them 

00:07:53.358 --> 00:07:56.174
the military, with everything placed under surveillance however

00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:59.630
is working on a more evil plan to regain its control 

00:08:01.486 --> 00:08:03.662
