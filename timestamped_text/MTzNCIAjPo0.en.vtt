00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.780
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.930
Today I'm going to explain a drama, horror,
mystery, science fiction, and thriller film

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.900
called “Radius" Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.410
Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.390
&nbsp;
Awoken by a car crash, a man, Liam, finds

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.110
himself in the middle of nowhere.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.650
He makes his way to the road, where he tries
flagging down a passing car.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.730
Liam almost gets hit by the car before it
swerves off the road.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.070
He approaches the car door and sees the driver
lifeless with white eyes.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.260
Liam uses the woman’s phone to call for
help, and the officer asks for his name and

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.270
location.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.230
He realizes that he doesn’t know his name.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.569
Luckily, he still has his wallet and learns
his name and address.

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:39.030
A crow flies above him, and the bird dies
for unknown reasons, making Liam more confused.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.920
He makes his way back to town and stops at
a local diner; oddly, he finds everyone inside

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.469
dead with white eyes.

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.620
Just outside, a van crashes into the diner
because the driver suddenly died as well.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.440
Because of this weird phenomenon, Liam speculates
that a virus is responsible for it and covers

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.760
his mouth and nose with a cloth.&nbsp;

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.960
&nbsp;
He finds his way back to his house with a

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.269
map, where he watches news reports about the
mysterious occurrence.

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.829
Not long after, he spots a farmer just outside
the house who greets him.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.590
Liam warns the man to leave the area and go
back home, but he continues to come closer,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.880
causing him to die.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.950
This surprises Liam, wondering why he remains
unaffected.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.119
He tries writing down everything he remembers
to figure out the mystery.

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.479
He then asks himself if he could be the one
responsible for all the deaths.

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.540
To test his theory, he goes outside and approaches
a crow.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.979
As he comes closer, the crow drops dead, confirming
his theory.

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.310
He then measures how far something has to
be before getting affected.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.530
&nbsp;
Later that day, cops arrive at his house,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.409
informing him that they found his truck, but
he refuses to let them know that he is around.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.439
Because of the lack of response, an officer
decides to enter the house, and the other

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.149
checks the surrounding areas.

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.789
To spare their lives, Liam stays at a safe
distance from them and hides.

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.159
After birds start falling from the sky, the
officer notices that the animals’ eyes turn

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.759
white as well, just like the people in the
diner, so both of them retreat to the station.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.670
That night, Liam awakens from a dream of him
crashing the car.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.380
A woman, dubbed as Jane Doe, arrives at his
property, asking to talk to him.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.979
He warns her not to get any closer to the
shed, but the woman is unaffected, to his

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:01.979
surprise.

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.090
Jane reveals to Liam that they were together
during the crash, and she suffers from amnesia

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.140
like him.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.239
Neither of them knows why they were traveling
together nor the cause of the crash.

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.519
Liam welcomes Jane inside his home, where
she informs him that she tracked him down

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.099
because the cops informed her that the car
in the crash is registered to Liam.

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.390
When Liam looks at Jane, he gets random visions
of them being together before the accident

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.160
in a place called Smithburg-Oakdale Bridge,
so they check its location on the map.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.290
Curious to know what happened, they drive
to the last place they remember, but they

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.060
fail to remember anything.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.180
Despite forgetting everything about the past,
Liam tells Jane that he feels like he knows

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.190
her deeper.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.360
Jane gets a vision of her sitting by the bridge
with Liam comforting her, but that is the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.820
most she can extract from her memory, leaving
her frustrated.&nbsp;

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.320
&nbsp;
After some time, they decide to go to the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.019
crash site to investigate.

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.510
When they arrive, they find a charred circle
with its edges perfectly lined.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.870
Liam and Jane remember fragments of where
they last stood before ultimately losing their

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.540
memory of that rainy night.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.140
Liam is now heavily consumed by his troubled
mind, so he tells Jane all about the deaths

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.439
that he is unintentionally responsible for.

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.709
Jane gets scared and quickly distances herself
from Liam.

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.210
She gets mad at him for not informing her,
saying that she could have been harmed.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.830
When they reach the road, a cop stops by after
seeing them arguing and questions Liam as

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.569
Jane walks farther away.

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.660
Expectedly, the cop drops dead.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.490
Liam notices that the police officer only
died when Jane was at a distance and theorizes

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.890
that Jane’s proximity could have a connection
to the strange phenomenon.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.610
To prove to Jane that she nullifies his ability
to kill anyone within a certain radius, Liam

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.400
uses a goat to explain how it works.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.269
In an open field, Liam instructs Jane to take
a few steps farther from him, and they wait

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.600
for the goat to die.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.010
As long as Jane is within fifty feet of Liam,
Liam’s curse doesn’t affect any living

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.010
beings.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.530
Initially, Liam wants to inform the authorities
about it, but Jane convinces him that they

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.510
will not believe a single word he says.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.920
Instead, she suggests that he should be tested
at a hospital.&nbsp;

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.540
&nbsp;
While a doctor checks him up, he gets random

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.550
visions of himself in the past, but it does
not help explain his current situation.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.329
They run a scan for him, but the nurse says
that Jane could not be inside the room.

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.109
Both of them beg the nurse to let her stay,
and she agrees.

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.640
They then see a news report that discloses
Liam as the prime suspect of the mysterious

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.650
deaths, so they try to flee from the hospital.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.299
Unfortunately, the police are already there.

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.579
Liam finds the doctor, and the doctor tells
him the results of the scan.

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.230
Apparently, Liam is perfectly healthy.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.380
They run from the police, but personJane gets
a glimpse of a missing person board on the

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.969
way to the elevator, making her stop.

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:17.260
She gets a vision of standing at the bridge
while holding a poster of herself missing.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.190
When she snaps out of it, she realizes that
Liam already got into a packed elevator.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.940
Jane tries to catch up to Liam, but she doesn’t
make it.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.480
Jane uses the stairs to maintain the fifty-foot
distance to prevent the people inside the

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.980
elevator from dying.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.060
At the same time, Liam urges the people to
run as far as they can away from him once

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.770
the elevator doors open.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.310
The elevator stops, and the occupants get
out, but Jane and Liam are still apart from

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.310
each other.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.860
Jane misses him on every floor, making her
run down using the stairs.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.450
Finally, they land on the same floor and embrace
each other as the doors open.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.040
They leave the hospital relieved that nobody
got fatally harmed.&nbsp;

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.420
&nbsp;
They drive to a secluded property deep into

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.310
the woods as a safe space, away from the rest
of the town’s citizens, and more importantly,

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.680
from the police.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.040
While in the car, Jane tells Liam that she
is still considered missing, with authorities

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.920
still working on her disappearance.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.480
The next day, Liam notices Jane’s wedding
ring but disregards it and exits the car to

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.000
check if anyone is around.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.190
Meanwhile, Jane listens to the radio and hears
a news report revealing her real name: Rose

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.420
Daerwood.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.360
Surprised by this, she also learns that she
has a husband named Sam who appeals for her

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.660
to return home.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.890
Although doubts still run through her mind,
she thinks that contacting Sam for help will

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.010
be a great idea, and she relays this information
to Liam.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.620
Hesitant to leave, he tells Rose that he is
staying, but she refuses to let him be alone

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.720
without her.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.980
She finally convinces him after saying that
Sam may be the reason for her disappearance

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.360
and that she needs Liam to keep her safe.&nbsp;

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.580
&nbsp;
They track Sam down using an address directory,

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.880
and Sam enters the car after Rose’s plea.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.360
Liam tries explaining, but Sam does not buy
his story at first.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.810
Liam demonstrates how his deadly radiation
works by coming near a bird who dies mysteriously.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.900
Now convinced, Sam agrees to be an accomplice
and provides a hiding place for them.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.090
While he disposes of their car, Rose finds
the poster from her vision but with the name

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.390
Lily Grayson.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.750
She learns that Lily is her long-lost twin
sister and is also missing, which puts Rose

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.940
in a spiral of depressive episodes.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.290
She had spent her time looking for Lily, and
on the anniversary of her twin’s death,

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.180
she stormed off to the bridge, prepared to
take her own life.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.570
Rose then remembers becoming suicidal, and
Liam saved her that night.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.870
Liam convinced her to get off the ledge and
talk the situation out, beginning an unlikely

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.870
friendship.&nbsp;

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.440
&nbsp;
After her vision, Rose asks Sam for some food,

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.830
so he heads outside to pick up something for
her.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.180
Rose then tells Liam about how and where they
knew each other, and they fall asleep on the

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.180
couch.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.930
Sam sees this and gets jealous.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.230
Sam then warns Rose of Liam being a bad person,
but she defends Liam.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.480
Meanwhile, Liam gets a vision of the night
of the accident and remembers that they intended

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.240
to travel to a nearby lake.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.800
He proposes going to the secluded cabin with
Rose to Sam, but Sam does not allow the two

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.860
of them to go alone and walks out.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.390
Sam called the cops without their knowledge,
and Liam realizes it after Sam acts frantic

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.220
and insistent on leaving Liam behind.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.070
However, Sam instantly regrets his decision
and warns them at the last moment.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.430
Shortly after, the cops arrive at their home
and arrest Sam for thinking that he is an

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.660
accomplice.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.330
Police enter the house and handcuff Liam and
Rose.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.860
The two beg the police not to separate them.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.020
Disregarding their cries, the police split
them up, resulting in everyone around them

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.490
dying, including bystanders at the scene.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.970
Liam falls to the ground, overtaken by the
guilt of being responsible for it, but he

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.460
reunites with Sam and Rose to resume their
plan.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.430
Finally, Sam agrees to be left behind to explain
to authorities the truth behind the deaths.&nbsp;

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.020
&nbsp;
Liam and Rose start to drive away from town

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.830
and stop for some food.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.610
Inside the store, they learn about an unexplained
cosmic event on the news with released satellite

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.120
images of the anomaly.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.470
The report was released by NASA, which can
still not grasp what happened that could cause

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.230
such satellite disruptions.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.150
They go back to the car and continue to drive
when a vehicle starts following them.&nbsp;

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.030
Finally, Liam and Rose arrive at the secluded
cabin.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.580
Stressed out, Liam heads outside to take a
walk, leaving Rose scouring through the contents

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.740
of the cabin.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.300
While going through stuff, she finds a notebook
revealing that Liam is a serial killer and

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.330
is the one who abducted Lily.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.900
As she turns each page, she reads about Liam’s
victims, stating the details of the murders.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.610
To her surprise, she sees her name on a blank
page, revealing that Liam intended to kill

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.830
her when he stopped her from taking her own
life.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.630
Separately, Liam remembers disposing of Lily's
body in the lake and his attempt to kidnap

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.570
Rose, which troubles him deeply.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.820
He feels a sense of confusion because he doesn’t
remember being a killer.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.530
Both of them remember the reason behind the
accident: Rose tried to stop Liam from tranquilizing

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.890
her, causing the car to crash in their scuffle.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.800
She managed to crawl out of the car when lightning
hits them, and they both get electrocuted.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.220
It appears that the strange phenomenon reported
earlier in the news from NASA is the same

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.680
thing that affected them.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.260
Now that everything is clear, Rose holds Liam
at gunpoint while confronting him, but she

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.340
could not get herself to shoot him.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.920
While making their way back to the cabin,
they run into the man who was following them.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.290
The man and his two sons hold them captive,
dubbing them terrorists.

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:35.240
Liam manages to run away but is stopped by
gunfire.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.629
Intending to use his deadly radiation, Liam
takes a few steps back until the father and

00:08:38.629 --> 00:08:41.620
one of his sons die, while the other beside
Rose survives.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.860
He also dies after she runs away from him.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.889
Unfortunately, Rose gets shot and is fatally
wounded, so Liam takes her to the nearest

00:08:47.889 --> 00:08:48.889
hospital.

00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:52.310
While she is rolled into the emergency room,
she repeatedly calls out to Liam.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.449
As Liam disappears from view, Rose sees him
aim a gun at his head.

00:08:55.449 --> 00:08:57.279
She then hears a single gunshot.

00:08:57.279 --> 00:09:00.579
Despite him being her sister’s killer, she
feels a deep sense of sadness after hearing

00:09:00.579 --> 00:09:02.060
the gunshot and cries.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:13.860
Finally, Liam has paid the price for all the
crimes he has committed, but not the way he

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.040
expected.
