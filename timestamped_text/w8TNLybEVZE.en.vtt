00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.940
The Godfather is an American crime movie; an absolute classic in the history of Hollywood.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.600
Welcome to the Cosa Nostra.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.520
In 1945, at his 
daughter Connie's wedding, Vito Corleone hears

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.840
requests in his role as the Godfather, the
Don of a New York crime family.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.199
Vito's youngest son, Michael, who was a Marine
during World War II, introduces his girlfriend,

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.590
Kay Adams, to his family at the reception.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.200
Johnny Fontane, a famous singer and Vito's
godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.230
role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom
Hagen, to Los Angeles to persuade the obnoxious

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.730
studio head, Jack Woltz, to give Johnny the
part.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.429
Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with
the severed head of his prized stallion.

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:56.170
Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Virgil
"The Turk" Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.239
crime family, asks Vito for investment in
his narcotics business and protection through

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.090
his political connections.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.180
Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade
that risks alienating political insiders,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.260
Vito declines.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.830
Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, Luca
Brasi, to spy on them.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.700
However, a Tattaglia button man garrotes Brasi
during Brasi's first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.700
and Sollozzo.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.710
Later Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the
street, then kidnaps Hagen.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.130
With Corleone first-born Sonny in command,
Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.410
to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.360
The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's
bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca "sleeps

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.620
with the fishes."

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.840
Vito survives, and at the hospital Michael
thwarts another attempt on his father; Michael's

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.270
jaw is broken by NYPD Captain Marc McCluskey,
Sollozzo's bodyguard.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.610
Sonny retaliates with a hit on Bruno Tattaglia.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.271
Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey:
on the pretext of settling the dispute, Michael

00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:02.750
agrees to meet them in a Bronx restaurant.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.530
There, retrieving a planted handgun, he kills
both men.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.459
Despite a clampdown by the authorities, the
Five Families erupt in open warfare and Vito's

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.980
sons fear for their safety.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.889
Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo is
sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas.

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:23.170
Sonny attacks his brother-in-law Carlo on
the street for abusing his sister and threatens

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.859
to kill him if it happens again.

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:30.400
When it does, Sonny speeds to their home,
but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.749
riddled with submachine gun fire.

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:38.450
While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries
Apollonia Vitelli, but a car bomb intended

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.709
for him takes her life.

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.709
Devastated by Sonny's death, Vito moves to
end the feuds.

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.709
Realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled
by the now-dominant Don Emilio Barzini, Vito

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.969
assures the Five Families that he will withdraw
his opposition to their heroin business and

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:55.879
forgo avenging his son's murder.

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.800
His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home
to enter the family business and marry Kay,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800
promising her that the business will be legitimate
within five years.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.650
Kay gives birth to two children by the early
1950s, and with his father at the end of his

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.299
career and his brother too weak, Michael takes
the family reins.

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:18.720
He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and
relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.159
not a "wartime consigliere"; Vito agrees Tom
should "have no part in what will happen"

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.499
in the coming battles with rival families.

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:31.150
Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's
stake in the family's casinos.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.069
Michael is dismayed to see that Fredo has
fallen under Greene's sway.

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.409
In 1955, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack.

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:46.120
At the funeral, Tessio, a Corleone capo, asks
Michael to meet with Don Barzini, signalling

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.590
the betrayal that Vito had forewarned.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.439
The meeting is set for the same day as the
christening of Connie's baby.

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:57.670
While Michael stands at the altar as the child's
godfather, Corleone assassins murder the other

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.580
New York dons and Moe Greene.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.059
Tessio is executed for his treachery and Michael
extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:07.230
in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.109
A Corleone capo, Clemenza, garrotes Carlo
with a wire.

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.060
Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling
Kay that Michael ordered all the killings.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.239
Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies
it, but, when the capos arrive, they address

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.010
her husband as Don Corleone, and she watches
as they close the door on her.
