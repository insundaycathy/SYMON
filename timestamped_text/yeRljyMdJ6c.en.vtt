00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.800
Listen remember how you would use your fingers as placeholders when you were reading those choose your own adventure books looking like a Captain Underpants

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.740
Flip Oh Rama what netflix has joined the server and is serving up their 21st century concept of this and what better way to play

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.100
Test it then with black mirror a show

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.189
We've gotten mad requests for since most of us believe free will is a thing

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.249
I've divided this video into three main parts all time Sam so you can pretty much choose your own adventure with this or

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.880
Experience the whole thing

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.870
Let me explain so it's always been great about black mirrors how creepy and futuristic the episodes feel yet

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.610
It also seems like they can occur tomorrow

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.860
Like I'm pretty sure most of us have played a telltale game

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.399
Our IP telltale games heavy rain life is strange where you're able to choose certain things that alter the path your character follows

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.279
I personally love those games, even though some people consider the movies, but now we actually got one that is a movie

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.739
This is separate from the series tab for black mare on Netflix because it has to generate multiple windows while you're making decisions

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.058
But I think it's crazy to see how they shot this thing because if you don't pick up your remote at all

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.158
There's actually an auto-generated path that the movie will take that totals up to an hour and a half

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.489
But if you do spend the time figuring out where each different decision takes you then the movie totals up to five

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.330
Hours and twelve minutes even crazier than that was that this was a 170 page script which was shot in 37 days

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.229
But was shot linearly according to the director meaning that they didn't shoot every single option while they were on that one set

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.199
They would start from the beginning for each one. So it would flow better for the actor when they were making that decision

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.129
that's wild how Netflix has done cool things on the platform in the past like having to D from PO Jack horsemen go missing since

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.670
The D in the show was stolen and you end up finding it somewhere else on the app

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.170
They've also done interactive stuff before with the kit shows where they're a little bit more simpler

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.720
Not as bloody, but you were able to get posts in his boots

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.270
But what I'm excited for is to see if black mayor takes their previous craft ideas and puts them into season five

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.920
depending on the reception of Bandersnatch creators Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones wanted alternative endings for season two's white bear which is

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.078
Probably why it's referenced in the specific story

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.360
But the one that would have flipped people out was their scrapped idea for season three's playtests

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.379
You know the one where Wyatt Russell takes a job at a videogame company before things get really dry

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.730
Well, what if in Trippier is their idea of having a different ending play without notice if Yuri watched it a second time

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.540
Which would it cost people to probably start questioning their reality?

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.419
I love our Netflix created its own program to keep up with the different pathways that they were creating for this specific episode how they

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.960
tested the attention span of a viewer and you that they had to put in a choice every

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.130
Three to five minutes in order for the viewers where remote and I get stuck in the couch

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.970
But the scariest part is hearing the creator himself admit that even he has trouble finding some of the pathways in the episode

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.639
Almost building this creepy feeling of what if it starts creating its own what if the creators of the show?

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.110
Rewatch it back one day and they start saying things they didn't even shoot

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.340
Now according to Netflix themselves

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.799
there are five main endings and I suppose what you would consider and after credit scene a lot of people claim that they know the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.529
Definitive ending, but you know the credits pop up once you've watched all five and they can vary so the final final one

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.859
It's up to you. But this one is the best starting out from the beginning

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.639
we got our boy from Dunkirk having to make really serious decisions like

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.170
Reckless

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.828
Accelerating, what is cool? Is that even though these seem like minuscule decisions?

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.709
They do a good job at incorporating them throughout your paths

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.959
like if you played that game until dawn where the

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.509
Therapist would ask you if you were scared of one thing or another and you're like brah. I'm not gonna fall for this

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.870
So depending on what cereal you choose you'll end up seeing a commercial for it. Later

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.079
Whichever album or song you choose ends up being the score that plays in the background of your scenes. Yeah. We're in the future

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.459
The years 1984 hence the now to tape and our do Stephane is about to pitch his game

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.319
Bandersnatch to this video game company

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.179
He meets will Poulter who I've seen people confused with Jesse Plemons who was in season for a black mare

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.500
But Matt Fleming sends to play way creepier roles. Oh you two. Enjoy each other

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.280
It's often we don't appreciate

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.570
Colin here's a famous game creator who sits down to look at Stefan's new game Bandersnatch

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.960
and the meeting a Bandersnatch can vary to some people I suppose it originally comes from Lewis Carroll who I would say his reference a

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.430
Lot throughout this episode, you know, he did do Alice in Wonderland and Stefan goes on his own trip

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.329
He's looking for his white rabbit. Colin's wife. Looks like the Mad Hatter

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.490
He goes through his own looking-glass

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.430
it's also a nod to the real game named Bandersnatch that never came out because the company went bankrupt in 1984 and

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.949
1984 is exactly the time the story takes place

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.900
But for all I know broker seems to be a big video game nerd so it can really just be a final fantasy nut

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.849
He presents the game which is based on the book

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:05.849
He grew up reading within the show called Bandersnatch and where you have to make decisions that lead your character to certain points

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.199
And it's gonna get even more meta the big villain in the game is a steamie named pax

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.369
Which is known as being the thief of destiny and right away you get the first big choice to either

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.659
Work with the company or do it yourself. So come on. What's your answer?

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.470
Yes

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.970
So saying yes pretty much ends everything as the game is called sloppy and gets panned

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.130
You can then choose to end the movie right there or go back and pick a different path of actually working it on your own

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.089
Which is able to help Stefan concentrate more on the game and have enough time to go to therapy

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.480
Would you like to talk about what happened with your mother?

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.499
No, no, you really might learn something new

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.190
So I'll ask again

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.400
Would you like to talk about what happened with your MA

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.710
I said no the funding goes to the store where you pick up this album, but then he buys his book without your permission

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.339
we get to learn a little bit more about the dude who wrote the book Bandersnatch and

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.700
Turns out he was crazy

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.210
this man was so invested in keeping up with all the paths and decisions that he was creating for his book then he went so

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.210
crazy off of free will and

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:21.939
Predestination and actually seeing the packs monster that he thought nothing mattered and decided to just kill his wife

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.460
This man was also preaching about mind control

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.180
it's funny because I always think about

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.460
Ashton Kutcher and how he changed his ayat' to be more like Steve Jobs when he was filming the movie and that

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.570
Change of diet actually caused him to start getting pancreatic problems. It's crazy

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:40.210
You get the next major choice that appears a couple of times and that's deciding to either spill 30 and destroy the computer

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.929
Descending the story that also Stefan's hopes and dreams or yelling at your dad

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.750
Which some of us aren't as privileged to do if you yell at him the boovie continues and you make your next major choice

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.090
That's either following Colin or going to therapy

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.420
If you follow Colin you end up going to this place where you drop acid?

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.930
with the PEX demon on it and he starts spewing about alternate realities and how he's practically aware that he's a TV character that has

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:07.540
Different storylines and you kind of noticed that he starts recognizing stuff on the second time around we went before

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:14.559
No, my favorite part in the whole movie. Is this bit where he starts ranting about pac-man and how he actually stands for?

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:21.129
Programming control pulsing somatoform thinks he's got free will but really he's trapped in a maze in a system

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.300
All he can do is consume

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.229
He's pursued by demons probably just in his own and even if he does manage

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.299
Sending out one side of the maze what happens he comes right back in the other side

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.969
Well damn as drugs and black Mary usually do they get so worked up about everything that they start questioning

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.479
Reality and if they're in a simulation and they decided to jump off a balcony

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:45.569
Obviously if he makes the faun do it he dies in the movies over if Colin does it my mind just splats and you wake

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:49.438
Up in the car ready to go to therapy again. You feel like you're not making these decisions. I

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:55.499
Feel like I'm not good like someone else is I'm doing this for us Stefan

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.340
You don't have to decide to medicate yourself

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.799
But you know, I saw what happened the last time a Timothy sha'lame dude got addicted to drugs

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.669
So, nope

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:05.878
If you do take them, you got two stars in the game movie ends

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:11.669
But if you don't take them in you flush them you end up back in therapy where you finally decided to talk about Stefan's mama

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:15.239
And it's depressing. It turns out that his mom died when he was a kid

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:21.150
She was running late because the dad had hit Stefan's bunny because he thought it made him a sissy and that caused her to catch

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.759
The later train which ended up in a wreck killing her

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:29.759
You don't have another choice to smash her throat tea and this little hoe does not he was doing this to me. I

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.550
Know there's someone there

00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:37.109
I guess I'll explain the show

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:38.709
to the show

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:44.518
If you don't get the option to tell him you're watching him on Netflix and to explain it to him and boy

00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:46.260
Did you come to the right dude my man?

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:51.719
He decides to switch to the therapist that we're watching in my Netflix and she calls them both out because she believes that they're not

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.289
entertaining enough for someone to sit home and watch them on TV and

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.990
This turns into an action film now one if you choose to fight her you end up getting medicated and the movie is over

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.990
But if you try to jump out the window

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:09.000
You get what I consider to be the best ending of the mall where it becomes the super meta filming on set

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:16.079
For Black Mirror where he's being called by his actors name, but he still thinks he's the character of Stefan you're not

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.690
scripts, it's jump out saying like

00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:21.448
It's the fight scene now

00:09:26.019 --> 00:09:29.639
Easily the best if we ran a little bit back though, we make our way to the more

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.309
Depressing I would say scenes that

00:09:32.529 --> 00:09:37.169
You need to brace yourself for there's one where you go into a secret room that the dad's been hiding where you get a bunch

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.909
Of outcomes you put in the wrong password and you either eaten up or chopped up

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:44.029
But if you pick toy as the password you get his old toy

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:49.940
To sponsor reality where you get to choose to actually go with the mom and if you do you still end up on the late

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:55.159
train that ends up killing you both which is really checked up when you consider that a kid is making the decision to

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.970
Die with his mama

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.970
instead of living with his father

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.610
But boy, does it get worse and I've seen a lot of people complain about these last endings saying that they get too violent

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:09.950
But it just sounds to me like y'all didn't put in pack as the password if you end up opening this file

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:16.849
You see that the Dead has been Truman showing the boy. He's been drugging his child putting messages into his computer

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.960
Staging the mom's death with a sad bird boxing the boy

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.039
He's practically doing stuff that are more jacked up than three identical strangers

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:31.070
So considering that this Minister knew Trent of a dad seems to be a government pack agent who's been?

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.450
Manipulating Stefan worse than you have it makes this next part a little bit more bearable

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.579
you then get the option to kill the dad and they're nice enough to even let you choose how to dispose of the body if

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.030
You bury him you get the chance to go on a killing spree since you know

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:48.709
You're bound to get caught out of the way where Colin shows up and you can kill him these other two show up and you

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.259
Can kill them by the way, you're gonna end up in jail with this one

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.069
But if you decide to chop them up, you actually not only turn into Sweeney Todd

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.419
But it gives you enough time to finish the game release it and get a 5 out of 5

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.869
Before getting pulled faster than a Kevin Spacey project

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:08.450
Of course credits and play as Colin's daughter in the future takes up the mantle of creating DLC for this man who's in jail

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.799
But she's so obsessed with this game that while she's working on it. She unknowingly

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.979
Becomes a part of the game. She's trying to recreate

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:25.620
Now I love Easter eggs

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:30.930
If you guys want to make more blackmail videos that catch up on all the crazy connections and the crazy stories

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.409
But just focusing in this episode they take it to a complete other level

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.759
There's that secret post-credits type path that I mentioned where you end up back on the train

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:45.270
He pulls out a Bandersnatch tape this time around it makes these weird noises that people actually translated into a QR code

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:51.420
They then scan that QR code it took them to the tucker soft web site that's hosting all of their previous games

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.869
And it actually lets you download and play nosedive nosedive

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:58.110
Of course then starts calling back to all of the previous Blackmer episodes

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:03.059
Nosedive being season 3 episode 1 where the elegant Jessica Brice Chastain Howard was in

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.860
Metalhead was season 4 episodes 5 title which shares the same direction as Bandersnatch

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:14.039
We see a mention of hang to DJ software in this article a safer reunion of the USS Callister fleet

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.749
Here the start of 15 million merits they're a kosher shoutout to the prime minister

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:25.919
Here yet another call back to the most annoying episode was this thing a shout out to san Junipero with the hospital and of course

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:33.029
white bear with the symbol and the time-shifting one with play tests where you realize if you go back to season 3 that

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.530
Bandersnatch was alluded to

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:40.050
Years ago in this magazine safe to say I think this episode is a combo price

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.050
the whole series is I love how as

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:46.800
Dystopian as it gets as tech savvy as it gets the main themes always come back to human motives

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.359
the situations are put in and how they react how they have to look themselves in the mirror and face the

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:56.249
Reflections and how the scariest black mirror of the mall is already in your pocket

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.799
Thank you guys for checking out this video I'm curious know your thoughts down below in the comments section

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.359
I black mare is one of the best episodes on Netflix and I was a BBC show that then came over here

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:11.519
I don't think it suffered anything since I kept the same creators. It's just a different platform. I adore the show

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.829
I know some people think that this was repetitive and people complain because that's the point of it. Yeah, yada yada

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.540
I think it's really interesting be it

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.259
this is the first thing that does it and then others come about I don't think it's gonna be a

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:23.730
Pandemic if you want to call it

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:23.910
like

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:28.649
You know where everyone was doing werewolf and vampire movies because those are easy to make found-footage movies

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:35.699
Right those became the craze those were easy to do with a cheap budget may in a multi like pathway movie

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.310
We have to choose your own adventure and takes way too much work

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:43.139
And I think unless someone has a really good idea and the funding for it. We're not gonna see a bunch of them

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:47.129
Maybe some cheap ones, but it takes way too much work for it to be a gimmick in my opinion

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.690
So I really appreciated this episode

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:52.740
I thought it was pretty dope cuz you know your thoughts anything that I may have missed any other outcomes

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.040
I'm pretty sure that yours from now

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.990
I'm not saying my theory of it self generating is gonna be correct

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:02.909
But I'm sure that there's other little Easter eggs that they put in there things that we're gonna find out later on in season 5

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.720
But I'm curious to see where

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.509
Not only black mayor takes it but where Netflix takes it where all the craters take it and how would you think it can be?

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.790
Bring telltale back. If a telltale person is watching this or someone with a lot of money

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:19.920
Forget us on you to forget a paycheck go give it to telltale bring them back. I miss them

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.979
