00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.250
Welcome back to Movie Shortens.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.009
Follow us today to a movie titled: Planet
Terror.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.329
Be aware, there are spoilers.

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:09.080
Now, let’s begin!

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.389
Cherry Darling is a go-go dancer working in
a nightclub.

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.209
After the performance, she cries on the stage
in front of the crowd.

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.750
Later that night, she decides to quit from
her boring job, telling the manager that she

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.939
needs a real change in her life.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.640
On the way home, some of the military trucks
are rushing to a base nearby, throwing her

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.210
to a pile of trash.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.119
Cherry is injured on the thigh after the incident.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.180
In the military base, a chemical engineer
Abby and the team are in a business transaction

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.540
with Muldoon and his troops for mass quantities
of DC2, a poisonous chemical agent called

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.960
"Project Terror".

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.930
When Muldoon learns that Abby has more of
the DC2 than what he is offering, he captures

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.640
Abby as hostage, threatening the scientist
to submit all of them to the government.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.950
Abby holds a pistol and opens fire at the
machine, intentionally releasing the gas into

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:57.950
the air.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.510
This gas spreads and immediately mutants people
around, turning them into flesh-eating zombies.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.360
However, Muldoon and the soldiers walk into
the green gas and seemingly enjoy it.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.149
Abby escapes with a truck right after that.

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.570
Meanwhile at a restaurant, a lady named Tammy
asks the owner JT for some water as her car

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.649
is overheated.

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.549
Here, Cherry also arrives and walks straight
to the toilet, where she cleans her injured

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.549
leg.

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.179
She comes across her ex boyfriend Wray at
the restaurant after that.

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.829
Cherry then asks Wray for a lift home.

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.770
At the hospital, Dr William and Dakota arrive
at work early.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.899
The two don’t seem to get along.

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.939
William treats a patient with a strange wound
on his hand.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.960
He has a fever and the tongue is badly infected.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.889
Another doctor tells William that the symptoms
are very similar to the Iraq soldiers due

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:47.479
to a mutant gas.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.909
Elsewhere on the road, Tammy’s car breaks
down again.

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.600
She decides to leave the car and asks for
a lift.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.509
Suddenly, Tammy is attacked by two bloodthirsty
zombies.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.710
Seeing a car approaching, they drag her body
away.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.610
It is Wray and Cherry on the car, thinking
the figures are dead deers.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.480
All of a sudden, Wray turns the direction,
losing control when they see another shadow.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.080
When the two are stuck in the car, they are
attacked by some violent zombies.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.390
Wray can escape and shoot the sickos, but
they don't die and run away.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.340
Cherry is left with a ripped off leg.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.330
Wray instantly sends Cherry to the hospital.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.970
Just then, a sheriff arrives and requires
Wray to go with them to the police station

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.490
for the investigation about Cherry’s injury.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.230
During the night, there are more and more
corpses sent to the hospital with their bodies

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.770
torn to shreds.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.970
Cherry awakes and becomes shocked seeing her
right leg is amputated.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.960
Meanwhile, Dakota is called with William to
learn about Tammy’s body, who Willam calls

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.590
a “no-brainer”.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.740
Dakota gets distressed and cries after seeing
Tammy.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.200
William realizes something and sees Dakota
in a room.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.390
He takes one of Dakota’s syringes and makes
her hands numb.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.860
He knows that Tammy and Dakota have a lesbian
relationship.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.320
As William is about to hurt Dakota, another
doctor appears.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.130
He locks Dakota in the room and rushes to
the bodies.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.160
They find the corpses are gone mysteriously,
leaving the hallway in a pool of blood.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.100
At the police station, the officers encounter
a pack of zombies approaching.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.050
They open fire at the sickos but there are
so many of them around.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.250
Wray reveals to be a professional sniper in
the past, helping the sheriff to kill some

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.450
of the zombies.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.140
He tells the sheriff not to touch the sickos
to avoid being infected.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.850
The two then leave the chaos to the hospital
as Wray wants to check on Cherry.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.270
Back at the hospital, more and more people
are coming in with swellings and infections.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.940
The doctors are unable to handle what's happening.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.130
William gets back to Dakota, only to get contaminated
by a transformed guy.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.420
The town people also encounter the mutation
and become the deadly sickos.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.260
Meanwhile, Dakota manages to escape from the
hospital’s window.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.290
She tries to drive off with her numb hands.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.630
At this point, Wray and the Sheriff also arrive
at the hospital.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.720
As they enter inside, the infected corpses
and injured are chasing and attacking both

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.380
doctors and patients, ripping them apart and
eating them.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.770
Wray fights with the zombies with two knives
and makes his way to find Cherry.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.240
Cherry now is covered herself in a blanket.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.879
Wray tells her to go with him because the
hospital now is in a zombie outbreak.

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:21.719
Wray then breaks a table and makes Cherry
a leg.

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:25.550
The two flee away to the restaurant, thinking
it would be safer.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.040
At the same time, Dakota returns home and
brings her son out of the town.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.099
She lets her son hold the gun and tells him
that if anyone other than her comes to the

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:39.389
car, he must shoot them in the head like in
his video games even if it's dad.

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.569
She finds the way to reach her father’s
house and decides to go check inside.

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.599
However, the son accidentally pulls the trigger
and kills himself.

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:52.520
Her grief is interrupted by William showing
up, having turned into a sicko.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.770
Dakota immediately holds her son’s body
and calls her dad for taking her in before

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.699
the zombies can catch them.

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:04.949
At the moment, Wray, Cherry, the police officers
and other survivors gather at JT’s restaurant.

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.050
J.T. shows the group some of his escape vehicles.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.490
Later, Wray proposes to Cherry, saying that
he doesn’t want to lose her again.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.639
The two then have fun in JT’s bedroom.

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.530
The movie passes unclear to the scene where
JT’s diner is in flames.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.879
More survivors are coming to join the group.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.180
Wray helps the Sheriff to cover the wound.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.319
Everybody attempts to get away from the flesh
eaters.

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:32.449
The Sheriff hands Wray a gun so he can be
the leader of the fighting squad.

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.030
He then commands the team to get armed and
ready for the mission.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.819
Getting outside, they open fire to the zombies,
but more and more keep on coming.

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:45.450
They retreat back inside the burning building
and Wray says that someone needs to retrieve

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.729
his truck so that they can all leave at the
same time.

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.479
Cherry volunteers to go.

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.740
Wray has to snipe at the sickos, paving the
way for his fiance.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.779
Finally, the group can get on the vehicles
with their weapons.

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:03.479
After they break through the sickos, the survivors
stop at Dakota's car and pull out a Tony's

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.849
Pocket Bike out of the trunk.

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:10.289
Cherry rides on a motorcycle with Dakota and
Wray leads the way on the tiny Bike.

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.880
They shoot more sickos on the road while the
Sheriff runs them over with the truck.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.999
On a bridge, the group is blocked by a bunch
of the zombies.

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:22.509
Suddenly, the sickos are shot completely by
the soldiers coming from behind them.

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:25.680
It is revealed to be Muldoon and his troops.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.840
Wray realizes Muldoon, only to be knocked
out by the two soldiers.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.479
As Wray wakes up, he finds himself in the
same military prison with other survivors.

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:39.999
Here, the group meets with Abby again and
has him explain what has happened with the

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:41.150
virus DC2.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.479
They are infected, but can use the gas itself
to control the symptoms.

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:50.759
Two soldiers show up with masks on and grab
the girls Dakota and Cherry away.

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:56.120
Just then, Abby and Wray manage to beat the
remaining guys and rush to the gas base.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.080
The two confront Muldoon there.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.400
Muldoon explains that he and his soldiers
were in Afghanistan.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.259
They'd accidentally found and killed Osama
Bin Laden.

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:09.270
However, this was against the government's
interest, so instead of rewards they got gassed

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.039
with DC2, a chemical weapon designed to wipe
out entire cities.

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:18.830
The best way to find a cure is to gas a whole
town then take the survivors to extract a

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.189
cure from them.

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:25.470
While he talks he has not been wearing his
gas mask, so he swells and blisters, eventually

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.139
is shot and killed by Wray and Abby.

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:31.749
Meanwhile, Cherry is forced to dance on her
wooden leg.

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:36.099
While moving, she instantly hits the man on
the ground and stabs his eye with her sharp

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:37.099
leg.

00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:39.389
The man never stops harassing Cherry.

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:44.220
Dakota shoots a needle in his other eye, finally
getting feeling back into her hands.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.349
Abby and Wray break the door and kill the
other soldier.

00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:51.839
Wray designs a gun into Cherry’s leg, encouraging
her to believe in herself.

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:55.160
She steps out and blasts the door with her
gun leg.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.940
Next, they join other survivors again and
decide to get away by the helicopters in the

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:00.940
base.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.509
Wray drives Cherry in the back of the motorcycle,
helping her to shoot all the men and sickos

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:06.900
with the rifle.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.550
She even departs from the ground and blows
up a bunch of sickos.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.969
The survivors follow Cherry to head to the
helicopters.

00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:17.449
Unfortunately, Wray gets shot and dies on
the way.

00:08:17.449 --> 00:08:22.500
Cherry kisses him goodbye and grabs the rope
from the helicopter as it flies away.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.740
One year later, Cherry finally escapes to
Mexico with other survivors.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.070
There is a little girl on her back, revealing
her as Wray’s descendant.
