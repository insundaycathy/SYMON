00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.440
imagine you are shipped to an island with nine&nbsp;
other people each of you wears a foot strap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.760
containing a bomb you have 30 hours to be the&nbsp;
only survivor if you can't do that it's over in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.720
this movie an eccentric millionaire named ian&nbsp;
had this stupid idea to purchase prisoners and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.160
let them participate in his game the death game&nbsp;
happens on the island of new guinea the event&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.200
will be live streamed online and will cost&nbsp;
around 50 usd his goal is to beat the super&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.280
bowl quota of 40 million viewers the rules are&nbsp;
very simple the strap bomb explodes either when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.560
you pull out the red lace or when you try to&nbsp;
remove it after the red lace has been pulled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.240
10 seconds remain until boom now if you're quick&nbsp;
in picking stuff up then you have realized that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.600
that means you must get into close combat if you&nbsp;
want to survive because in order to win you must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.920
activate the bomb of your enemies because you have&nbsp;
to be the last man standing or woman in this case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.360
if not then the bombs will go up regardless but&nbsp;
what if you're physically inferior than your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.640
opponents well i will show you my strategy on how&nbsp;
to survive and beat each and every combatant on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.560
this island but before we get to that let me&nbsp;
introduce you to the beginning of this movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.000
ian's team sets up hidden cameras on the remote&nbsp;
island while they are finishing off their last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.840
preparations the prisoners who were chosen&nbsp;
are brought to a station on the island next by

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.720
we got two women and eight men pretty much&nbsp;
everyone is pretty jacked up physically i wouldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.160
stand a chance and if i'm being honest here this&nbsp;
moment is very important because it lets you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.920
a look on who you're going to face i would shut&nbsp;
up for once take a step back and observe each and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.360
every character in this room most of these people&nbsp;
would rip me apart in a one-on-one no question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.320
and that is good to know because now i know&nbsp;
what i gotta do be sneaky silent and run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.000
away if necessary those jacked up dudes aren't&nbsp;
very fast that much we can tell unless we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.480
talking about this japanese dude right here&nbsp;
but anyway for now let's begin with the game

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.800
first we are being flown over to the island that&nbsp;
shouldn't be neglected by the way you won't be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.040
getting a better view of the battlefield than&nbsp;
this if you have missed that then i don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.640
but it doesn't look good for you as we can see we&nbsp;
get coastlines a deep jungle and as we get to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.840
later mountains and cliffs each participant&nbsp;
is thrown out with the keys for their cuffs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.880
everyone will be located on the same strip of&nbsp;
coastline at first now what do you do once you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.400
have landed and the 30 hours have begun i want&nbsp;
you to think about your strategy for a moment and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.360
post your way down below and if you're at it and&nbsp;
want to support my work consider leaving a like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.960
i would appreciate that now first of all i would&nbsp;
find out what time it is this is only possible as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.160
long as the sun shines for that i would stretch&nbsp;
out my hand like this then count how many times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.240
four fingers have space in between the sun and the&nbsp;
horizon and then calculate the time until sunset&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.680
four fingers equal roughly one hour if we don't&nbsp;
do this we have no idea when this game will run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.520
out of time and that is a deal breaker you see i&nbsp;
wouldn't fight anyone i would let my enemies weed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.600
themselves out before engaging in combat myself&nbsp;
therefore i would hide myself before anything else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.040
the rules of thumbs are don't injure yourself&nbsp;
and avoid contact at all cost if we can achieve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.080
that plus figure out the hour of the day then we&nbsp;
will be able to strategically delay the time of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.080
our death and therefore multiply our chances&nbsp;
to survive this death game tenfold now every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.680
combatant is a murderer here and because of that&nbsp;
finding allies wouldn't even cross my mind it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.320
not possible to trust anyone here so why bother&nbsp;
the risk is way too high after i had figured out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.920
that time i would arm myself with whatever i&nbsp;
can find a sharp rock piece of wood or even my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.320
released cuffs or better as opposed to bare hands&nbsp;
then if i can i would find sturdy leaves like that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.840
of banana trees or palm trees weave them together&nbsp;
and wrap it around the strap bomb on my ankle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.760
safety first you don't want something to&nbsp;
rip it off while making your way through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.760
the jungle now do you this would be a fun death&nbsp;
to see but not very inviting way to die yourself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.200
after having taken all these measurements i would&nbsp;
continue with finding an elevated hideout either&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:32.640
on a tree or cliff but preferably an unobstructed&nbsp;
place that has a great view 360 degrees around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.640
that without exposing myself and then wait this&nbsp;
[ __ ] out now there is more to add here but what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.480
happens in the movie you might ask well in the&nbsp;
movie two of our enemies already die in the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.000
10 minutes one died by landing uncomfortably&nbsp;
and the other was killed by the woman he tried&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.360
to kill means seven enemies are left although&nbsp;
of course we wouldn't know since we two are in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.240
the game this is just for you to understand the&nbsp;
plot as well the main character is steve austin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.840
by the way the big bald dude that looks like he&nbsp;
was abandoned in a gym at six years old as of now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.440
all eight characters are on their journey to avoid&nbsp;
getting killed however two characters are special&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.080
these two right here they are a couple they&nbsp;
specifically look out for each other and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:24.000
would gain an advantage if they found themselves&nbsp;
before being killed that's what i'm talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.720
at this point it is important to note that there&nbsp;
are care packages flying in as well every now and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.320
then they bring in resources like food and weapons&nbsp;
however they come with a smoke signal every time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.840
so getting near them means entering a danger&nbsp;
zone this guy here is taking way too much time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.800
grab the bag and then run off is what he should&nbsp;
do we do get a quick showdown here but nobody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.400
is killed shortly after the japanese guy faces&nbsp;
off the english prisoner and they seem to team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.560
up for my taste way too risky but to each his&nbsp;
own it is definitely an advantage to hunt down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.200
other players in a team in terms of the care&nbsp;
package by the way here's what i would have done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.880
nothing you see being the physically unimpressive&nbsp;
guy that i am i would not voluntarily fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.120
over a sandwich with these dudes if i was&nbsp;
starving to death i would either find other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.280
resources or hide around a care package&nbsp;
at first and then prey on whoever gets it

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.520
hold on right there big man meanwhile steve is&nbsp;
also entering a fight the guy he's facing off is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.720
even bigger than him i don't know what these&nbsp;
dudes eat but it can't be anything healthy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.480
he first tried to talk it out fair play but it&nbsp;
didn't work however it gives me the impression&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.720
that our main character is actually a pretty nice&nbsp;
guy anyway they fight until one red lace is being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.880
pulled and at this point only seven are left i&nbsp;
think you would agree that fighting any of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:53.520
guys so far seems very pointless at this point we&nbsp;
cut to sarah a blonde woman coming home from work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.640
as she's preparing dinner she receives a call&nbsp;
from the fbi considering the circumstances it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.600
was probably chris voss they point out&nbsp;
that jack or steve austin her boyfriend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.440
seems to be in trouble she makes her&nbsp;
way back to check his former workplace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.920
locks into the live streaming website of the game&nbsp;
and tries to figure out what is actually happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.840
at the same time we cut back to the&nbsp;
game where the latino lovers reunite

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.680
that's all beautiful and stuff but have you seen&nbsp;
this guy that is exactly the reason why i've been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.920
opting for hiding okay however that doesn't stop&nbsp;
the english and japanese guys from attacking them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:40.960
but the latino's leg is broken and the woman sadly&nbsp;
has to bite the dust for good six people left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.080
you see predictably these convicts don't shy&nbsp;
away from killing each other and that's good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.320
it's even desirable in a way because in&nbsp;
the meantime we're having a great time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.920
wherever we are on this island until our time&nbsp;
has come if we're already at it once we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.800
found our hideout we would do well to stay hidden&nbsp;
until the next day arrives it would be stupid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:06.720
to engage in any sort of contact during night&nbsp;
time but if i had still hours left until sunset&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.080
i would start preparing weapons and traps i would&nbsp;
sharpen bamboo sticks with rocks weave ropes from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.520
big leaves and put them aside for the time being&nbsp;
ropes and melee weapons are handy in here in fact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.880
if we find the right resources here we could even&nbsp;
prepare mid and long range weapons like spears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.240
when the nighttime finally arrives three important&nbsp;
things happen first of all steve austin finds a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.760
latino guy with a broken leg they team up for the&nbsp;
time being he also finds out that attached to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.200
ankle strap there is also a gps device on it with&nbsp;
a foil he can take off of an abandoned military&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.320
equipment he is able to block the gps signal&nbsp;
causing the surveillance team to lose his location&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.760
that's a very smart move he additionally points&nbsp;
out that he has seen a radio tower on the hillside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.560
meaning if he can make it over he is able&nbsp;
to call for help at this point it becomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.080
clear that ian and his team are stationed on the&nbsp;
very island where this death game is being held&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.880
that's not very smart isn't it why would you be in&nbsp;
the same island where your captives are playing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:11.280
death game that seems a little bit dangerous to me&nbsp;
however for us this is a good thing because now we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.280
can figure out our game master's location and then&nbsp;
go and kill them instead and that is what steve is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.480
doing as well he's hunting down ian and his team&nbsp;
but before we get to that the second important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:28.320
thing that happens is this we find out that steve&nbsp;
here used to be a black ops member of the pentagon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.600
yep after his mission went down south a year&nbsp;
ago he was falsely imprisoned in guatemala and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:39.360
abandoned from his superiors but as of now the fbi&nbsp;
and secret service are on this case then about to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.720
intervene it goes without saying that this death&nbsp;
game isn't legal by any means and it sure as hell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.400
doesn't try to stay low-key either kind of dumb&nbsp;
the third important thing that happens is this

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.720
now since our main character is black ops guy&nbsp;
he has no issues with finding the amateurs that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.520
are controlling this game however he commits&nbsp;
a potentially fatal mistake when he takes out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.360
this guard he doesn't bother hiding the body&nbsp;
which is a no-go i give him a d-minus for that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.440
should have put more hours into assassin's&nbsp;
creed my dude there was so much high grass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.200
in the background he could have easily pulled&nbsp;
that corpse in there within a quick second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:25.040
however he makes it into the control room knocks&nbsp;
out the next guy and calls his girlfriend at home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.600
now at this point i have to give him props instead&nbsp;
of rushing her through and stressing her out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:36.080
he gives her exactly what she wants love if he&nbsp;
didn't we all know where this would have ended in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:42.080
an argument so an a-plus for that one he is able&nbsp;
to pass over the coordinates of the island to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:48.720
which he's unable to communicate to the fbi the&nbsp;
tables are turning meanwhile in new guinea the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.840
sun is rising that means we gotta move as well&nbsp;
by now the latino guy has been taken out as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.960
well by the way and the black dude was killed&nbsp;
by the black woman so we got four people left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:04.240
if we have survived this far good we&nbsp;
arrived around 4 pm on the island yesterday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.240
meaning we still have a generous amount&nbsp;
of time left to be the last one standing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.040
since we have been resting and preparing since&nbsp;
yesterday we have an edge over every other player&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.840
that has been fighting ever since i would&nbsp;
start moving 3 hours before the time runs out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.160
that leaves enough time to end unfinished&nbsp;
business but it isn't so much that there aren't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.920
any combatants left it's a sweet balance i would&nbsp;
pick up my bamboo spear tuck away my bamboo short&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.880
knives wrap the rope around my shoulder and then&nbsp;
move swift and low haven't played a good amount&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.320
of tomb raider and uncharted i know how this stuff&nbsp;
works okay i am not an amateur i would hunt down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.520
those people and take them out before they even&nbsp;
know what is happening however what happens in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.560
the movie is steve austin faces off the cocky&nbsp;
english japanese team both of them carry melee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:55.840
weapons as well as a bow our main character is&nbsp;
a bright guy though and what he does is this

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.720
he tapes on metal bars to evade the machetes&nbsp;
of his opponent which is a kind of sick move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.760
i keep this one in mind don't ask me where he got&nbsp;
the duct tape from though because i have no idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.800
but he enters a sick and flashy fight with the two&nbsp;
enemies eventually he gets almost taken out but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:22.560
the last remaining woman counters her attack and&nbsp;
escapes the explosion with a bit of luck involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.800
two dudes left he's facing off both at the same&nbsp;
time at this point i would do a 180 and run the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.280
japanese guy would probably catch up quicker&nbsp;
than the english guy and that is when i would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.800
turn around and slap that dude right to the&nbsp;
floor our main character does it similarly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.400
i actually don't want to talk around the bush&nbsp;
here so the thing is in the end steve is facing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.920
off the english guy in the last showdown it would&nbsp;
be a pretty even fight but ian the producer riggs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.280
the game by flying in a care package containing&nbsp;
a shotgun talking about fair play dude what the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.800
hell that's like watching shaquille o'neal in&nbsp;
a mosh pit it's fun but it's pointless we know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.880
the outcome anyway he seemingly kills off steve&nbsp;
gets to the streaming station has his footstrap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:12.880
released and then goes on a tarantino redemption&nbsp;
journey throughout the office i actually like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:18.400
part the most at the same time it is said that&nbsp;
the navy is flying in to take ian and his team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:24.880
this guy legit gave an interview about the death&nbsp;
game prior to live stream not sure that he thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.760
this stuff through but it doesn't look like it&nbsp;
in the end our main character gets the british&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.520
guy catches up to the fleeing ian shoots down&nbsp;
the helicopter he is in misses gets handed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:41.520
over the footstrap bomb from ian's girlfriend&nbsp;
what a great irony and then throws that stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:52.720
right before ian's feet now to wrap this stuff up&nbsp;
is it possible to beat this game yes if it wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:58.240
rigged i think trying to make it to the end of&nbsp;
this game is the safest bet whatsoever but what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.800
do you think let me know down in the comments&nbsp;
and if you have enjoyed this video leave a like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:09.360
to boost the algorithm i would appreciate that&nbsp;
and then binge another one how about that peace
