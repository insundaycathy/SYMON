00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.480
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going&nbsp;
to explain a fantasy romantic comedy film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.800
called “Penelope,” Spoilers ahead!&nbsp;
Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.080
The Wilherns are one of the wealthiest and&nbsp;
prestigious families of Nobles. They are respected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.160
by all in society. But not until the family’s son&nbsp;
named Ralph Wilhern gets into an affair with their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.680
housemaid Clara who turns out to be pregnant. He&nbsp;
wants to marry Clara, but his family laughs at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.440
thought. They want him to marry someone from their&nbsp;
own social class, and he obliges for the family’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.120
name. A heartbroken Clara commits suicide because&nbsp;
of the betrayal. Clara’s mother is the town’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.560
witch who is enraged by her daughter’s death. At&nbsp;
night, she shows up at the Wilhern’s property and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.320
spreads animal gut all over their lawn. Using her&nbsp;
powers, she binds them with a spell and curses the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.840
next Wilhern daughter to be born with the face of&nbsp;
a pig. She claims that only when “one of their own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.520
kind” will claim the girl as their own, the curse&nbsp;
will be broken, and her real face will be back.
&nbsp;

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.640
For the next five generations, all of&nbsp;
Wilherns’ brides give birth to sons. Finally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.240
in the sixth generation, a girl is born to Ella&nbsp;
and Leonard Wilherns, but she doesn’t have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.800
pig face. The family celebrates, thinking&nbsp;
that the witch’s curse mustn't have worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.920
But little do they know, Ella has been cheating&nbsp;
on Leonard, so the daughter is not a Wilhern. 
&nbsp;

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.080
So, the firstborn Wilhern girl is Penelope,&nbsp;
the daughter of Jessica and Franklin Wilhern.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.600
The witch’s curse has worked on Penelope, and&nbsp;
she is born with a pig’s nose and ears. Since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.720
the Wilherns are the talk of the town, the birth&nbsp;
of the girl is heavily anticipated by the media.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.680
Jessica doesn’t want anyone to see her daughter.&nbsp;
She even blinds one of a reporter’s eyes because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.800
he gets a glimpse of her. She fakes Penelope’s&nbsp;
death and then cremates her non-existent body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.120
so that no one will ever try to look at her&nbsp;
face. She then decides to never let the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.800
go out until the curse is broken. They even talk&nbsp;
to a doctor about surgically removing the nose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.360
and enhancing it. But it turns out that the&nbsp;
carotid artery runs directly through her nose,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.720
so if it is cut, Penelope will die. Jessica even&nbsp;
stops everyone in the house from ever eating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.480
bacon. No one was allowed to call Penelope a pig,&nbsp;
even if it was just a joke. Little Penelope would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.200
sometimes run out to their main gate but Jessica&nbsp;
didn’t even allow that. With no way to get her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.880
daughter a normal face, Jessica settles to finding&nbsp;
the solution in a traditional way. Since the witch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.520
said that the curse would end when one of their&nbsp;
own kind accepts the girl, Jessica believes it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.000
will go away, once Penelope gets married&nbsp;
to someone within their social status. 
&nbsp;

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.240
She has been trying to find a husband for her&nbsp;
with the help of a dating agent named Wanda&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.720
ever since Penelope’s eighteenth birthday. All&nbsp;
the men she has ever brought to meet Penelope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.200
have run away. Penelope has never been out of&nbsp;
her house, and since the news of her existence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.080
should be kept a secret, the men who come to see&nbsp;
her are made to sign a non-disclosure agreement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.880
after the meeting. The ones who run in fear after&nbsp;
seeing her face are brought back by the family’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.600
butler named Jake to sign the NDA.
It has been seven years, but she hasn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.360
found a suitable man. One day, Edward Humphrey&nbsp;
Vanderman III, the son of a wealthy businessman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.240
comes to meet Penelope in the hopes of dating her.&nbsp;
But when he gets a look at her face, he runs away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.600
horrified, like every other man. This time,&nbsp;
the butler Jake is unable to catch the man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.040
so Jessica is distressed. A horrified Edward&nbsp;
goes to the police station to report a demonic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.520
girl with fangs trying to kill him. But&nbsp;
the police don’t take him seriously. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.440
Wilherns know how to stop the rumours from&nbsp;
going around, so they publish an article&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.320
about Edward being a delusional maniac. 
The next day, Edward goes to the newspaper company&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.840
and demands the news be removed because it will&nbsp;
affect his father’s reputation. A journalist named&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.120
Lemon hears Edward shouting about the pig girl and&nbsp;
claims that he has also seen the girl. As it turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.160
out, Lemon is the reporter who Jessica had blinded&nbsp;
because he got a glimpse of Penelope. He wants to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.120
take revenge on the Wilherns, and Edward wants to&nbsp;
gain his reputation back, so they join hands to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.960
expose Penelope’s existence. They plan to send a&nbsp;
man as a suitor and secretly take pictures of her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.200
Their only problem is that Jessica only looks&nbsp;
for wealthy men, so they cannot bribe anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.400
with money. Lemon knows a formerly wealthy&nbsp;
and elite man named Max who spent all of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.920
father’s money on gambling. He can be disguised&nbsp;
as wealthy and sent to take the picture.
&nbsp;

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.040
The following day Lemon approaches Max, who&nbsp;
accepts to do it after receiving the money. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.320
they are in front of the Wilhers’ residence. Lemon&nbsp;
makes Max wear a jacket with a camera fixed on it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.720
which takes a picture when he raises his right&nbsp;
arm. Max and the other guys are made to sit in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.600
the house’s library that has a one-way mirror&nbsp;
and microphone so Penelope can see and talk to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.080
the boys without them seeing her. Max hides&nbsp;
behind the couch to adjust his camera when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.440
Penelope comes into the room. All the other guys&nbsp;
run away in fear after seeing her face, but Max,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.160
who hasn’t seen her face, stays. Penelope&nbsp;
knew this would happen, so she isn’t even sad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.920
anymore. Suddenly, she notices Max still sitting&nbsp;
on the couch through a camera. Penelope is beyond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.080
surprised and goes to talk to him through the&nbsp;
one-way mirror. She finds him taking a book from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.640
the shelf and putting it inside his jacket.
Max is startled when she calls him out and keeps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.000
the book on the table. She asks him if he&nbsp;
saw her face, but Max vaguely says he has.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.120
The two talk for a while and bond, but she&nbsp;
never shows him her face. Before Max leaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.680
Penelope asks him to come back tomorrow. Both&nbsp;
Wanda and Jessica, who have been listening to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.880
the conversation, cry tears of happiness. 
The following day, Max meets Lemon and Edward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.680
outside the Wilherns’ residence and changes into&nbsp;
the jacket again. Max goes inside and waits for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.120
Penelope in the library again. He gets bored and&nbsp;
starts whistling on a toy frog. Penelope suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.480
asks if he plays any instruments. He, in turn,&nbsp;
asks her to guess. The Wilherns set up a band with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.760
several instruments in the library and make Max&nbsp;
play them so Penelope can guess. They two laugh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.480
as Max plays the instruments horribly.
In the end, he is playing the piano while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.040
she instructs him from the other side of the&nbsp;
mirror. Suddenly, Max feels a hand over his and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.600
turns around. He is shocked to see Penelope’s&nbsp;
face for the first time. But he doesn’t seem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.840
disgusted or afraid. Rather, he lifts his arm to&nbsp;
touch her face but accidentally clicks a picture.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.720
He curses at the fact, but Penelope thinks it is&nbsp;
because of her face and runs away. Max tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.280
stop her, but when she doesn’t, he makes his way&nbsp;
outside. Instead of handing the camera to Lemon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.240
he respects Penelope’s privacy and breaks&nbsp;
it. Lemon and Edward are furious and ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.680
for their money back. Just then, Jessica and&nbsp;
Wanda come outside and see Max with Lemon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.520
Jessica figures that Max is a spy, but Max comes&nbsp;
inside anyway. While the two talk, Max realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.600
that Jessica is looking for someone of their&nbsp;
social status, because only he can break the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.280
curse. Penelope appears on the stairs and asks Max&nbsp;
if he will marry her and help her break the curse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.360
To her dismay, Max replies no. 
At night, Penelope decides to run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.560
away from the house and live her life on her own&nbsp;
accord. She covers half of her face with a scarf&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.760
and sneaks out through a window. When Jessica&nbsp;
finds out, it is too late. Edward and Lemon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.520
who had been keeping an eye on the house,&nbsp;
also find out about her running away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.560
Meanwhile, Penelope sees a crowd of people for&nbsp;
the first time. She takes a long walk in a park,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.200
as she had always wanted to, and calls her mother&nbsp;
for the last time to say she isn’t coming home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.160
anymore. She then enters a hotel to stay for&nbsp;
the night and pays using her mother’s card. 
&nbsp;

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.240
Meanwhile, Lemon and Edward put out an&nbsp;
advertisement in the newspaper with a sketch of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.800
a Penelope look-alike, claiming that whoever finds&nbsp;
a picture of such a girl will be rewarded five&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.280
thousand dollars. Penelope knows she can’t use&nbsp;
her mother’s card because it can be traced back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.480
to her, so she calls Lemon. Penelope wants to sell&nbsp;
her own picture for the money. Lemon and Edward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.440
are surprised but agree. She takes a picture of&nbsp;
herself in a photobooth and brings it to Lemon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.560
The following day, Penelope’s picture is published&nbsp;
in a newspaper for the whole world to see. 
&nbsp;

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.120
Penelope then goes to a pub where she meets&nbsp;
a girl named Annie and befriends her. Annie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.480
gives her a ride on her bike. Meanwhile, Max sees&nbsp;
Penelope’s picture in the newspaper and is furious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.120
at Lemon. When he goes to confront him, Lemon&nbsp;
tells him that Penelope sold the picture herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.840
and that she is declaring her own independence.&nbsp;
The news makes Max want to pursue his dream of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:13.040
being a pianist in a band again. He goes to his&nbsp;
old friend and re-starts playing the piano. 
&nbsp;

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.760
Cut to a few months later. Penelope has been&nbsp;
living her life to the fullest, going to circuses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.640
ice skating, bars, and whatnot. She sends&nbsp;
her parents a postcard every time she tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.920
something new. One day, her parents spot her while&nbsp;
walking through the city. She tries running away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.880
and ends up in the pub with Annie. An exhausted&nbsp;
Penelope faints, and the scarf from her face is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:39.360
removed. Everyone sees her face and is surprised.&nbsp;
When Penelope wakes up, she is in a hospital bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.520
Several reporters take her pictures, and&nbsp;
she becomes the talk of the town. 
&nbsp;

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.800
In contrast to what she had thought, Penelope is&nbsp;
loved by people and becomes a celebrity herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.440
For the next few months, she is all over the&nbsp;
newspaper. She no longer needs to conceal her face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.960
from anyone. Edward, however, still sees Penelope&nbsp;
as a hideous monster. He mistakenly expresses his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:04.080
feelings in front of the press and angers his&nbsp;
father. To redeem his and his father’s image,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:10.000
Edward proposes to Penelope. Penelope accepts the&nbsp;
proposal after being persuaded by her mother. 
&nbsp;

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.240
Meanwhile, Lemon finds out that Max has been&nbsp;
arrested for armed robbery and goes to meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.520
him in prison. However, he is surprised to see&nbsp;
Max’s friend, with whom he used to play poker.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.240
He soon realizes that he has mistaken Max to&nbsp;
be the son of a formerly wealthy man when he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.520
actually a normal guy with gambling problems. It&nbsp;
turns out that his real name is Johnny Martin, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.640
he had lied and taken the job for the money. 
It is now the day of the wedding. Lemon approaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.520
Jessica and Wanda to tell them that Edward that&nbsp;
he was the one who published Penelope’s picture.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.760
They finally find out that Johnny said no to&nbsp;
marrying Penelope because he knew he couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.280
break the curse as he isn’t “their kind”. Even&nbsp;
after knowing this, Jessica insists on letting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:54.560
Edward marry Penelope. At the altar, Penelope&nbsp;
is asked if she takes Edward as her husband. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:00.240
goes silent for a while and says she doesn’t. She&nbsp;
then rushes inside the house. Jessica follows her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.040
saying that this is her only chance to get rid of&nbsp;
her ugly face. Penelope retaliates and says she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.720
likes herself how she is. Suddenly, a force pushes&nbsp;
her, and she falls unconscious. When she wakes up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.600
her nose has gone back to normal. The curse&nbsp;
has been broken because “by their own kind”,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.040
the witch meant that she had to be accepted by a&nbsp;
wealthy aristocrat, including Penelope herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.880
If Jessica had taught Penelope that she is&nbsp;
beautiful just the way she is, the curse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.680
would have been broken a long time ago. 
The following day, Wilhern’s butler Jake walks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.320
out of the house with his luggage. As Jessica&nbsp;
yells at him to come back, she loses her voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.520
Then, it is revealed that Jake is the witch who&nbsp;
had cursed the family and had been watching them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.320
suffer all this time. Penelope also leaves&nbsp;
the Wilherns’ residence and starts working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.960
as an elementary school horticulture teacher. One&nbsp;
Halloween, she decides to meet Johnny again and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.760
goes to his house party with Annie. She knocks&nbsp;
on his door with a pig snout mask on her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.760
As they talk, Johnny figures out that it&nbsp;
is Penelope and the two finally kiss. 
&nbsp;

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.720
Sometime later, we see the two telling&nbsp;
Penelope’s horticulture class about their story.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.840
Lemon watches them from a rowboat in the nearby&nbsp;
lake. He tries snapping a picture of new Penelope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.560
to write about it in the newspaper but sees&nbsp;
how happy she is and cancels the plan. 
&nbsp;

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.800
The movie gives us a beautiful message that&nbsp;
a person’s real beauty is not what their face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:23.920
looks like but their kindness. Like Penelope,&nbsp;
many women are made to feel insecure about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.840
their unique features, but in reality, all&nbsp;
of them are beautiful in their own way.
