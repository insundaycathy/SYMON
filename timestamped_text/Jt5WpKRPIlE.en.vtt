00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.270
If a rat bug bit you, then later that night
you were attacked by a naked clone of yourself

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.700
that was trying to kill and replace you, what
would you do?

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.940
In this video on Nerd Explains, we’ll follow
the characters, see if we can make better

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.590
decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat
the body snatchers in, Assimilate.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.460
If you think I missed something, or you have
a better way to beat the aliens, let me know

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.500
in the comments!

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.990
We start out following two dudes giving us
a tour of their self-proclaimed podunk town

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.060
of Multon, Missouri.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.680
It’s all pretty boring, usual stuff.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.309
Sure, Mrs. Bissette points out some strange
insects in her garden, but she’s a good-looking

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.460
lady talking to high school boys, so we can
safely assume the insects aren’t grabbing

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.159
their attention.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.780
These insects would only be alarming if you
were an entomologist, otherwise you’d just

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.969
think they were some type of mini-ant.

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:51.969
Across the street, a kid’s screaming, “you’re
not my mommy,” while his mom is dragging

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:52.969
him down the sidewalk.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:53.969
Everyone in this small town knows each other,
so they know she is, in fact, his mommy.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:54.969
Guessing by the title of the movie, this mom’s
already been assimilated and is actually an

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:55.969
alien clone.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:56.969
The little kid is objectively correct, that
ain’t his mommy.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:57.969
But, the characters don’t know the title
of the movie they are in, so it’s justifiable

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:58.969
for them to assume he’s just being a little
jerk.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:59.969
(Look what ya did you little jerk).

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:00.969
Besides Mrs. Bissette, underage football players
getting booze and Randy’s parents being

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:01.969
abusive, there’s not much cam-worthy content
to record.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.390
Later that night, they’re walking around
throwing a frisbee, shooting the shit, until

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.759
they hear a woman letting out blood curdling
screams.

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.850
They rush to check it out.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.149
It’s Mrs. Bissette, their friendly neighborhood
MILF.

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.860
* I think we know what Zach and Randy need
to do.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.320
They need to hit record and yell worldstar
while Mrs. Bissette gets brutally assaulted

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.140
so they can post it online and get views for
their channel.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.140
(Worldstar)

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.850
The door is unlocked, so naturally they invite
themselves into the crime scene.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.829
* I wouldn’t go in there.

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.229
Unless you could visually see what was going
on, or somehow make contact with her, it would

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.289
be exceptionally dangerous to enter her home.

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.880
She could mistake you for an intruder and
shoot you, or whatever attacked her would

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.880
attack you.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.789
If it was a homicide, entering the home could
cause you to ruin evidence and mess up the

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.689
crime scene, hell, you could even end up as
a suspect by leaving your evidence at the

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:54.689
scene.

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.689
* Considering Mrs. Bissette stopped screaming,
this could mean the threat either killed her

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:56.689
or is no longer a threat.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.369
I’d just stay outside, peep the windows,
and call the cops while trying to make visual

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.439
or audible contact with her.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.520
* If she kept screaming, which means she’s
not dead and the threat is still present,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.709
I might try to find something I could use
as a weapon and try to find her.

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.900
It really depends on if you want to risk dying
for her, and how confident you are in your

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.959
ability to defend yourself.

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.060
* If Zach and Randy had taken our advice,
and hadn’t gone into her house, they wouldn’t

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.220
have known about the bite or Pastor Greg’s
rat bug, so it actually puts us in a worse

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.220
position.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.300
But they’d still most likely have realized
something was wrong when they called the cloned

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:40.980
sheriff and confronted the cloned Mrs Bissette
about the incident the next day.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.720
So we wouldn’t have completely screwed ourselves.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.909
They decide to go into her house anyway.

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:52.909
There’s a broken lamp and blood on the ground,
a sure sign that Mrs Bissette is in a pickle.

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.430
Randy calls the cops, but they just hang up
on him.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.879
* I know this is a shitty town and the cop
probably doesn’t give much of a fuck, but

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:00.879
come on.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.599
A loud thud and tapping noises start coming
from the attic.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:14.740
* How have they not already grabbed something
to use as a weapon, jesus.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.379
They continue to follow the blood trail, and
open the closet door.

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:19.650
It’s Mrs. Bissette.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.569
She’s bloody, crying, and claims something
bit her.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.599
* I gotta tell ya, as soon as I hear this,
I'm thinking zombies.

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.599
(Zombies!

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:29.599
Clip)

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.049
A huge bug thing blasts out the drywall and
flies out the window.

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.300
Okay, well it’s not zombies so that’s
good.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.860
Zach has the bright idea to chase the thing,
because as he stated, it might have rabies.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.030
* How is that a reason to chase this thing,
that’s actually a strong reason to run the

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.079
other way.

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:53.920
The CDC explicitly states to not pet, approach,
or engage any animal you suspect has rabies.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.000
This is because Rabies infections are nearly
100% fatal if left untreated until symptoms

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
appear.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.470
It literally has the highest mortality rate
of any disease on Earth.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.569
Mrs. Bissette just needs to go to a doctor,
run some tests, and get a rabies vaccine.

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.959
It’s pretty obvious that we shouldn’t
try to catch the rabid rat bug that’s biting

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.870
people and which we suspect has rabies.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.670
* We’d definitely want to take Mrs. Bissette
to the hospital to get some tests done to

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.570
determine if she was bitten by a rabid animal.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.960
Since they use blood tests for rabies diagnosis,
i’m pretty positive the alien spores and

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.240
DNA would be identified.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.600
They’d likely keep her at the hospital for
further testing and monitoring, as well as

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.540
try to make contact with higher up authorities
about the unidentified alien DNA in her bite

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.540
wound.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.860
Later that night, her alien clone would probably
arrive at the hospital to try to kill and

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.980
replace her, at which point it would be very
obvious that we, collectively, have a major

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.980
problem.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.490
* Later on in the movie, it seemed like the
clones showed up at night while their victims

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.791
were sleeping in order to kill and replace
them, though it’s not clear how the clone

00:04:58.791 --> 00:05:00.160
finds the original.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.360
* My guess is that the bug releases a toxic
pheromone that makes the victim sleepy, and

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.260
the bug leaves a pheromone trail which the
clone uses to find the original.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.540
The fully-formed existing clones might also
help direct the newly birthed mindless clones

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.690
and tell them when and where to attack.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.820
* This means that Mrs. Bissette’s clone
might not find and attack her at the hospital,

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.720
since she was bit at home.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.310
Either way though, finding alien DNA in her
wound would likely have sparked the chain

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.200
of events required for awareness of an alien
invasion to spread, and defenses to be orchestrated.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.870
* It’s possible that all the doctors were
already clones, and Mrs. Bissette would just

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.010
be restrained on a gurney so her clone could
Shang Tsung her.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:47.000
(Soul belongs to me)

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.300
* I think Randy and Zach would’ve helped
take her to the hospital considering the circumstances,

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.300
and if the doctors were clones, we’d know
something was up when they started acting

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.300
weird, just like when we went to confront
Pastor Greg.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.300
* It’s also possible that they aren’t
able to get any alien DNA off of her.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.300
I doubt it though.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.150
* Taking Mrs. Bissette to the hospital would
be the most reasonable decision that coincidentally

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.840
has the best chance for everyone to find out
what’s going on, which is incredibly crucial

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.050
when under siege by body snatching aliens.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.680
* Later on, I'll talk about our plans for
survival once we do realize the threat we’re

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.680
facing.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.150
For now, let's see what Zach and Randy should
do if they did stupidly chase the bug.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.990
Before they catch up to it, it scurries into,
what I guess is it’s owner’s cooler?

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.210
The man, with his pet bug, hop into a car
and leave.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.900
As the car drives away, they see that Pastor
Greg is the owner.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.580
* Uh, what the hell.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:38.070
So Pastor Greg has a pet insect rat thing
that he lets go into people’s homes and

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.070
bite them?

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.430
Like in the movie, we’re definitely going
to want to stalk him and get more information

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.870
and footage of what the hell he is up to,
as well as find out why the cop hung up on

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:47.870
us.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:58.520
The next day they take their video to the
douchebag from Never Back Down, but like all

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.990
horror movies, the cop thinks it’s photoshopped
nonsense.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.630
* To be honest, I don’t blame him.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.910
I think the kids should have known better
that in this day and age, video evidence isn’t

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.360
exactly hard evidence that you can convict
someone with.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.380
You need something physical, like the bite
wound and testimony from a victim like Mrs

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.380
Bissette.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.610
The night Mrs. Bissette was bitten and they
saw Pastor Greg, I'd have 100% shown Mrs.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.890
Bissette the footage of Pastor Greg with the
bug, and then taken her to the hospital as

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.590
well as to the cops.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.960
This may have prevented her death and clone
replacement that night, it’d be easier to

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.280
convince the cop something bad was happening,
and the hospital might be able to identify

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.001
the alien spores, triggering the awareness
we need to construct our defenses.

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:45.120
Again, it’s our best shot and figuring out
what’s going on and spreading awareness.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.570
On their way to interrogate Pastor Greg for
his rat shenanigans, they hear an eerie siren

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.750
noise in the distance.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:08:00.280
* There’s really nothing to make of it at
this point though.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.310
The doors mysteriously close behind them while
hallway lights flicker.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:09.610
Cool, maybe we should wait until Pastor Greg
comes outside before interrogating him instead.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:14.450
Nope, okay cool let’s just continue down
this creepy corridor to confront the Pastor

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.280
that siccs rabid rat bugs on people.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.490
What could go wrong.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.590
They eventually find Greg, and he’s not
his cheerful dorky self.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:36.479
He calls Randy’s mom a slut and Zach’s
dad a junkie.

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:39.860
To be fair, they did just accuse him of being
a rat whisperer though.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.269
The sheriff who hung up on us is there too.

00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:43.769
He doesn't seem normal either.

00:08:43.769 --> 00:08:45.920
Zach and Randy quickly bug out of there.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.920
Get it.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.019
They check the internet and cell service.

00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:51.040
Everything is down.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.750
Zach and Randy just now think to see if Mrs.
Bissette can help them prove to the cops that

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.730
they aren’t lying about the situation with
Pastor Greg.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:03.250
Unfortunately, Mrs. Bissette isn’t acting
like herself either.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:08.110
She denies that anything happened last night,
and pulls her skirt up to reveal her leg where

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.490
she was bit, except there’s no bite mark
anymore.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:19.810
That same thud and tapping sound starts coming
from her bedroom, which she suggestively invites

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:29.540
them into.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.470
As hard of a decision as it was, Randy and
Zach declined.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.990
They creep around the outside of the house
to peep into the window.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.949
Looks like a couple guys already took her
up on the offer.

00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:44.680
One of the male suitors jumpscares them, forcing
Zach and Randy to retreat to the barn and

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.529
reassess what is going on.

00:09:46.529 --> 00:09:50.750
What’s weird is that they recognize the
guy tied up on the bed, and it’s the same

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:55.000
guy that jumpscared them.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.519
Kayla shows up at their homebase to tell them
that her dad is acting strange.

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:03.560
Like there’s no feeling in him, like he’s
a different person all of the sudden.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.870
To make matters worse, her Mom and brother
are missing too.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.420
She thinks she’s going crazy.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:13.060
But it’s clear that this isn’t a case
of Capgras Syndrome, a psychiatric disorder

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.879
where you feel like a loved one has been replaced
by an imposter.

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:22.459
While the three are out looking for her family,
they notice that everyone is acting strange.

00:10:22.459 --> 00:10:25.910
People are blankly staring at them, and openly
burning their belongings.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:38.470
Kayla's dad has gone batshit crazy as well,
it’s obvious that he’s not going to be

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:39.470
any help.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.220
Zach fakes going to the bathroom so he can
search the house for Kayla’s brother and

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.220
mom.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.540
He finds Joey in the attic, hiding from his
Dad.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:51.029
Zach tells Joey to go downstairs to his room
and hide.

00:10:51.029 --> 00:10:57.920
* Dude, the attic is a better hiding spot
than his fucking room, what are you thinking.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.170
He also finds Kayla’s mom, in the towel
bin.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.170
Fuck.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:05.199
That’s gonna be a tough one to explain to
Kayla.

00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:06.920
* Shit just got real, people are getting murdered.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.920
(Bad Boys)

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.439
* The first priority is to get Joey out of
there.

00:11:10.439 --> 00:11:13.019
Leaving him with a murdering psychopath is
not an option.

00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:14.019
* I’m not exactly sure how i’d handle
this.

00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:17.680
To me, it seems like you have two options,
either stealth it or get violent.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.999
* The stealth option.

00:11:18.999 --> 00:11:22.269
Leave the house without Joey to avoid confrontation
with the dad.

00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:23.269
If we told Joey to stay in the attic, he should
be relatively safe for now.

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:27.749
Later in the movie, Joey was caught by his
dad, but that was probably because Zach originally

00:11:27.749 --> 00:11:33.759
told him to hide in his room.

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:38.329
By the time Zach left the bathroom, the dad
was very agitated and suspicious.

00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:41.370
I doubt the dad would let Joey leave with
them.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.120
Confronting him about the dead wife in the
towel bin will provoke him to attack.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.329
Same thing with the neighbors.

00:11:46.329 --> 00:11:51.309
Whatever is going on, it’s spreading insidiously,
most likely originating with bites from that

00:11:51.309 --> 00:11:53.910
insect thing, and turning people into psychos.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.769
If we are confrontational, it could provoke
them to attack us outright instead of slowly

00:11:58.769 --> 00:12:00.319
trying to decieve us.

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:03.410
Kayla’s mom may have confronted the dad
so he killed her.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.600
If they think they can deceive us, that gives
us time and the element of surprise.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.940
* How do we get Joey out secretly then?

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.639
Have Kayla lure the dad out of the house by
faking an emergency of some sort.

00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:19.290
Since the cell service and internet is down,
we won’t be able to do anything remotely.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:23.660
She could lure him outside by saying she thinks
she has a flat tire or something.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:28.209
When he leaves the house, Zach and Randy,
using Kayla’s keys, could run in and grab

00:12:28.209 --> 00:12:33.470
Joey, while Kayla distracts the dad and watches
the perimeter to ensure that he left and nobody

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.089
else comes to the house.

00:12:35.089 --> 00:12:36.779
* The violent option.

00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:41.139
Whop the dad over the head with a flower vase
before you leave, then grab Joey.

00:12:41.139 --> 00:12:42.420
It’s 3v1.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.749
I think they could take him.

00:12:43.749 --> 00:12:46.910
This approach is dangerous, because we could
get hurt in the altercation.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:52.139
But also, as we’d come to find out, if we
had confronted the dad clone, he’d likely

00:12:52.139 --> 00:12:55.329
have screeched and brought the neighbor clones
to attack us.

00:12:55.329 --> 00:12:58.160
They’d have to knock him out cold in one
blow.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.600
If they chose this method, Kayla’s dad wouldn’t
be able to move the mom’s body, and if they

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.410
brought the cop to the house, well, I think
he will be sufficiently convinced of a problem.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:12.720
* I think stealth is the better approach if
you can make it work, if not, then get yourself

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.970
a lamppost and go to work.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.970
Either way, get Joey out of there immediately.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:25.279
* Once they have Joey, they need to get Zach
and Randy’s family to safety too.

00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:34.149
Zach’s family first, as they just talked
to them and know they aren’t infected.

00:13:34.149 --> 00:13:43.740
Randy’s family could be compromised, so
let's save who we know we can first.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.370
They should stick together so they don’t
get isolated and overpowered.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.699
AKA, don’t split up like cliche teenagers
in horror movies.

00:13:47.699 --> 00:13:52.300
* They didn’t originally believe them, but
with Kayla, Joey and the video evidence, they

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.449
might be able to convince them.

00:13:54.449 --> 00:13:59.100
It’s not too late, it’s still the same
night, which means that we could save our

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:04.059
parents before they get replaced by attacking
clones, which we find out happened the next

00:14:04.059 --> 00:14:05.129
day in the movie.

00:14:05.129 --> 00:14:07.939
* Once we’ve secured our home, we need to
suit up.

00:14:07.939 --> 00:14:12.569
Since whatever is going on is probably spreading
by bite and bloodborne infection, it’s best

00:14:12.569 --> 00:14:15.240
that we wear things that prevent bites.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.649
Wearing layers of long pants and long sleeve
shirts and jackets.

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:19.829
Hiking boots, and some gloves when we're in
more dangerous situations.

00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:23.999
We’ll want to tuck our pants into our boots
as well, to prevent the creature from scurrying

00:14:23.999 --> 00:14:24.999
up our pants.

00:14:24.999 --> 00:14:29.080
We’ll look overdressed, but we won’t be
walking down the streets like Bill Williamson

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.549
(*), which would probably get us unwanted
attention.

00:14:31.549 --> 00:14:35.850
* With the tiny insects, the big insect, the
bites, it might be some form or parasite that’s

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.809
taking hold of hosts in order to help it spread.

00:14:38.809 --> 00:14:44.510
If so, the parasite only has a basic connection
with the host’s nervous system, as they’re

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:48.429
unable to blend in well and express appropriate
emotional responses.

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:51.959
* The good news is that whatever it is, it’s
not hard to spot.

00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:57.089
The Thing or the arachnid bug from Starship
troopers 2 were way better at keeping up appearances.

00:14:57.089 --> 00:15:02.660
All you have to do is say something that should
elicit an emotional response, or just whatever

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:07.139
horrible shit you normally filter out of conversations.

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:10.500
If they act like a doorknob, it’s probably
an infected person.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.339
* Getting weapons to defend ourselves should
also be a priority at this point as well.

00:15:14.339 --> 00:15:19.309
We don’t want to kill anyone unless we have
to, maybe this is a curable condition.

00:15:19.309 --> 00:15:23.149
But we also can’t let ourselves succumb
to whatever is infecting people.

00:15:23.149 --> 00:15:27.490
Again, you still want to blend in, so rolling
down the streets like Hot Fuzz (*) might not

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:28.809
be the best decision.

00:15:28.809 --> 00:15:32.079
I’m not saying don’t do it, because it
would be cool as fuck.

00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:34.749
* Whatever’s going on is way bigger than
just Kayla’s dad.

00:15:34.749 --> 00:15:35.749
The attacking bugs must be causing a parasitic
infestation, or some form of viral infection

00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:36.749
that’s affecting people’s brains.

00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:39.339
* Almost everyone in the town is turning into
murdering psychos.

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:44.220
Which is bad for obvious reasons, but also
because once a critical mass is attained,

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.769
they won’t really have to be sneaky anymore.

00:15:46.769 --> 00:15:50.939
Initially when it’s only a few people, they
can’t afford to get found out, but with

00:15:50.939 --> 00:15:55.449
numbers, they can be more aggressive and will
be more likely to outright attack you.

00:15:55.449 --> 00:15:59.610
* We need to get the word out to surrounding
towns in order to contain the spread.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:04.430
If this gets out, it will exponentially take
over the planet, unless it’s happening everywhere

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:05.430
already.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:10.000
We have to assume this is local and we can
contain it, or else we’re fucked anyways.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.170
* We still can’t exactly go to the police.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:20.009
The sheriff’s infected, and Ryan McCarthy
doesn’t want to hear from us, and that’s

00:16:20.009 --> 00:16:22.490
if he isn’t infected too.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:26.541
No doubt Kayla’s dad moved his wife’s
dead body as well, so we really don’t have

00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:28.279
any hard proof of anything right now.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:29.279
It’s just going to waste time.

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:30.620
* We need to obtain some hard evidence.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.819
The footage we have could just be dismissed
by other agencies and departments, like with

00:16:34.819 --> 00:16:36.129
our town’s cop.

00:16:36.129 --> 00:16:39.399
* Initially I thought of abducting someone,
but that’s risky.

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:44.119
I think a better way to get the word out would
simply be to securely box up some of the weird

00:16:44.119 --> 00:16:48.731
alien ants that are everywhere and take it
to the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, which

00:16:48.731 --> 00:16:50.399
is 10 hours away from Springfield, MO.

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:51.399
Or a CDC Quarantine Station in Chicago, IL,
which is 8 hours away.

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:55.800
Further studying and testing of the alien
ants, along with our footage and anecdotes

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.950
would reveal their assimilation and duplication
potential, which would trigger a quarantine,

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:04.190
a worldwide PSA, and the creation of defensive
strategies.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:09.390
I’m thinking a good slogan for the PSA would
be, “Know Your Neighbor”, and basically

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:14.320
you’d just want everyone to report any suspicious
behavior to the authorities for testing.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.730
As long as you contain the spread before it
hits critical mass, which is like 50% of the

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.930
population, you should be able to seek out
and destroy any alien clones.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:25.700
It’s going to be a rough year for sure,
but the alien spores would eventually stop

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.960
raining from the sky as there isn’t an infinite
amount of them.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.180
Sure, you could argue that you might not be
able to make the connection between the mini

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.560
ants and the alien bug, and it might not be
realistic to jump to abducting someone at

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.600
this point, so let’s continue with the movie.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.600
They leave the house without Joey and continue
to make more dumb decisions that waste precious

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.600
time.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.800
Their ingenious plan is to take it to the
police, and guess what, they burn their last

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.050
bridge with the cop on the naive assumption
that Kayla’s dad wouldn't have moved the

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:52.460
body after Zach suspiciously used the restroom.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.710
Things get really weird at the house when
the mom shows up alive.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.240
I’m not sure how that’s possible.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.880
Maybe some super-fast healing shit like we
saw with Mrs. Bissette.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.320
She was pretzeled into a towel bin for christ
sake.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.240
You can’t just unfold yourself.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.470
And they have Joey.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:12.290
It’s a standoff with the three friends,
a disbelieving cop, and the imposter family

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.200
over custody of Joey.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.390
They eventually leave without Joey, again.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.150
* This is a huge mistake.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:23.600
Unless Joey’s wearing some plot armor we
don’t know about yet, he’s 100% fucked.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.340
Whatever’s happening, it’s happening fast.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:31.170
A simple bite and it’s all over, and the
pastor is known for possessing the rat insect

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.170
thing.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.060
If he wasn’t already bit, he will be soon.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.060
There is no reason they had to leave the house
without him.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:42.310
Joey was literally screaming and crying to
get away from her and to leave with Zach,

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.010
Randy, and Kayla.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:49.180
No cop would just leave a kid in that situation,
at least I hope not.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.870
The cell service and internet is still completely
down at this point.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:56.360
They head back to the barn homebase, and find
Zach’s dad.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:02.010
His previously amputated legs are, well, restored
to their non-amputated state.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:06.630
And, they are surrounded by the other townsfolk,
yep, it’s confirmed, the bug people are

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.940
getting more aggressive now that they are
reaching critical mass.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:15.429
The assimilated lock Zach and Randy in the
barn with the insects, and Randy gets bit.

00:19:15.429 --> 00:19:18.240
* Dammit Randy, I told you to wear layers
and bring weapons.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.700
There’s some kind of alien black gestational
sac with something inside it.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.490
It gives birth to Zach’s naked mom.

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:29.710
* Definitely not an image you can forget easily.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:34.330
Zach’s naked mom runs over to, Zach’s
real mom i’m guessing.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:39.210
The ant bugs are crawling from the alien mom
to the real mom, seemingly sucking her soul

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:40.210
out.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:44.200
Randy with the slick wits grabs a shovel and
tries to bash the alien mom.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.850
The shovel breaks in half.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:49.670
Zach grabs the broken shovel and spears the
alien mom with it.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.600
It seemed like that did the trick.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.640
* It’s not super healing from a parasite
controlling the original.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.420
Instead, a clone is created using the DNA
obtained from the bug bite, then the clone

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:06.360
attacks and sucks the life force out of the
original, then replaces their identity.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.710
* War is declared at this point, there’s
no hiding now.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:14.770
It's guns free on any of these aliens now,
as they are just clones of the dead original.

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:19.330
By now, we have more than enough proof to
continue with our plan I laid out earlier.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.310
Hopefully Randy's mom fared better.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:25.780
Well, I guess they didn't care or assumed
she was dead, because they went to find Cam

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:26.780
Shigawnday..

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:31.940
* Damn, Jake Tyler (*) beat this dude so badly
he moved into a trailer in Shithole, Missouri.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:37.860
He’s not throwing any sick parties at his
new digs, that’s for sure.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.880
Turns out, he was bitten too.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.710
Except that he shot his double in the head
when it came after him.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:47.430
They have the idea to take the body to the
FBI and shut this alien operation down.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.190
This guy’s thinking what I'm thinking.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.840
Ironically, I'm pretty sure he’s going to
die.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.210
This also means Randy has a clone coming to
kill him in a bit, sweet.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:06.160
Right on cue, Randy’s double comes out of
the forest and attacks them.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.770
Along with a hundred other alien imposters.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.080
* It seems like they are pretty fucked.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.670
* Yep, Josh gets pulled into the crowd of
clones.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:11.670
Come on man, where are those MMA skills.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.380
Randy runs off, creating a diversion so Zach
and Kayla can get away.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.020
* The clones seem pretty dumb.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.700
They easily could have taken out all 4 of
them if they just split up instead of all

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.050
running after Randy.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:27.420
Zach and Kayla make a hasty plan to rescue
Joey, and grab a car to head to Springfield

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.640
so they can get cell service and upload their
video footage.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.360
They decide to head into town on foot to find
the car and Joey.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.380
* Being on foot and going into town is a horrible
idea.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.850
Joey is no doubt dead as fuck by now.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:44.830
I gotta believe there’s a truck in some
more remote farmhouse you can jack.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.470
Inevitably, while on foot in town they get
caught.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:54.360
But holy shit was that some amazingly well-coordinated
and lucky quick thinking by Zach and Kayla.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:58.910
* Apparently they can’t detect if you’re
assimilated or not, nor will they check if

00:21:58.910 --> 00:21:59.910
you are.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:03.460
This was an incredibly risky strategy that
just happened to work.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.880
This is not something I would have tried,
as you’d probably get killed.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.150
One wrong move and you’re bug food.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:09.150
(OG Body Snatchers Yell)

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:13.150
Holy shit, they’re burning the corpses of
the original people they cloned themselves

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:14.150
from.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:15.150
Damn.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.580
They continue their charade to try to get
the keys to the car.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:22.910
Kayla spots Joey from a distance, he’s obviously
a clone now, but Kayla turns into an idiot

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:23.940
and goes after him.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.330
* Oh shit, he’s not one of them, sorry Joey.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:31.270
If it were me instead of Kayla, you’d be
dead, hell I wouldn’t have even gone back

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.670
into the town to attempt to save you.

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:34.670
Oh well.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.310
Kayla and Joey lock eyes, and they both let
out a single tear.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:41.250
The other zombies catch the sense offenders
in the act (Equilibrium), and mark them for

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.120
processing (You mean execution).

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.760
Joey’s able to flee, but Kayla’s about
to get the bug bite.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.350
Zach crashes the party with the van and they
both make a hot extraction.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:58.140
* Damn, I was hoping Zach would go grand theft
auto and plow right through the alien rally.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.780
Kayla and Zach stop the car in the middle
of the road to have a heart to heart discussion

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:09.540
while Joey is still desperately trying to
evade the aliens on foot.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.890
Since Kaylas bit, she starts talking like
she’s already dead.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:16.210
Brah, chill, you got bit, but you can still
kill off the attacker.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:21.760
Zach keeps rambling instead of kissing her,
and the bugs find them and bite Zach too,

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.760
killing the mood.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.660
They run after the bug, this time it’s not
because it might have rabies, it’s because

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:31.460
if they catch it they can prevent the creation
of a DNA copy of Zach, and a clone of him

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.630
from attacking.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:36.710
* First off, couldn’t you guys have had
that discussion while driving, jesus.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:41.230
* Secondly, trying to run after the bug, on
foot, in the woods, is super dumb.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.550
You won’t catch it.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.420
* Being on foot in the woods is dangerous
because you can't really hide.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:51.190
The mini bugs are everywhere and they could
alert the aliens to your location.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.100
.
* Considering it’s running back to the clones,

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.740
you’re literally running towards the danger.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:24:00.580
* And what does it matter whether other clones
or your clone come to kill you, the end result

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.580
is the same.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.260
It’s over, you’re bit, just stay in the
car and keep driving.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.180
While sneaking through the forest, they run
into Randy.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:12.830
For a second, I thought it might be the OG
Randy acting like a clone just as they did

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:13.830
earlier.

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:15.450
But nope, it’s the clone.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:28.190
Kayla bashes it in the head with a stone and
Zach drowns his best friend's alien twin.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:38.560
A traumatizing event, no doubt.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:44.490
They finally make it to the internet building,
where they are attacked by the naked clones

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:45.490
of themselves.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:46.490
(Brain drain piping)

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:47.490
* Why did you drop the pipe, that’s the
best weapon you’ve found so far.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:50.480
At the main trunk terminal, they upload their
murder footage to Youtube, where it will be

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.740
immediately censored.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:58.410
At least create an appealing title, nobody’s
going to find or click on Video # 598435.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:02.370
But then again, it's a new Youtube channel
so good luck getting views anyways.

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:09.900
* Instead, I’d email the mp4 to the FBI,
CIA, CDC, WHO, National Guard, etc.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.290
As well as make a quick post on Twitter and
Facebook with a descriptive title so people

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:15.700
actually click it.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:20.660
Using the video noise, they bait the clones
into the room, and then use the c02 extinguishers

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.490
to suffocate them, which is pretty darn clever.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:29.050
They make their escape and go to rescue Joey
back at the cabin, if he’s still alive.

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:32.790
Once they get to the cabin, they walk right
up onto the porch to check it out.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:37.580
* Instead of walking in like they did, which
is super risky, I'd throw rocks at the windows

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.020
in a distinct pattern.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:43.770
It’s not something the clones would do,
so Joey could probably realize it was us.

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:48.640
Once he comes out, make bird noises or some
shit and assess his reaction and movements.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.600
They peek into the windows and see Joey watching
TV in the living room.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.710
* Why the fuck would you be watching cartoons
in the living room in clear view from the

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:57.710
windows.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:02.211
Earlier he was hiding in the attic because
his dad was acting strange, now he’s just

00:26:02.211 --> 00:26:06.240
chilling on the sofa when a full blown alien
apocalypse is occurring.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.240
Nope.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.240
This is a trap.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.790
I’m betting Pastor Greg is hanging out with
this little boy too.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:14.390
* I guess I was wrong, Joey was just being
an idiot.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:18.050
Man, if I was in the movie Joey would be super
dead by now.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:22.930
We find out that he wasn’t watching cartoons
either, he was watching a webcam broadcast

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:26.040
of the entire world being overrun by these
things.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:31.210
The stark realization sets in that they weren’t
the first town to get hit, their podunk shithole

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:35.360
was the last place to get hit, or more likely,
everywhere was hit at the same time via the

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.000
spores falling from the sky.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.680
* I don’t get how the entire world was taken
over without the people of Moulton realizing

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.680
it, but whatever.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.570
The last scene is of their youtube video,
it has zero views.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:50.630
Except a few comments from a handful of survivors
around the world.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.730
* Surviving at this point is looking pretty
bleak.

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:57.370
It’s down to Joey, Zach, and Kayla, and
some rando’s across the world who we can’t

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:58.370
communicate with.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:03.180
We could hide and evade the aliens for a while,
but hunger would set in and we’d need to

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.250
act like clones to make food runs.

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:08.770
This is super dangerous and we’re likely
to get caught eventually (Scream), so this

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.210
method is out.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:12.610
However, there is a way to not starve.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:15.810
If you’ve watched my other videos you might
know where i’m headed.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:20.960
The mini ant aliens seem to be everywhere,
forming into bugs that can bite us in order

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.280
to send clones to kill and replace us.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.820
There’s nowhere we can really hide from
them.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:30.590
Once the clone of you arrives, kill the clone,
then butcher, cook and eat it.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:34.810
It’s going to take a bit of mental effort
to get used to the idea, since you’re basically

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:36.900
cannibalizing your own body.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:41.230
You gotta look for the silver living here,
the aliens are basically delivering fresh

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.730
food to your door, same day delivery.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:48.640
* Say we managed to make the correct decisions
earlier on by taking Bissette to the hospital

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.660
and finding out what’s going on at the beginning,
and salvaged most of the town.

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:56.830
We’d know that bite’s are used to create
clones that attack and replace us.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:01.990
We could form defenses, use buddy systems
and weapons, implement testing procedures

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:04.170
to identify clones, etc.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:05.730
But we’re still fucked.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:10.670
The spores are constantly raining down all
over the place, creating ants, which create

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:14.640
the bugs, which bite us, which create clones
which attack us.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.040
The townsfolk would constantly be under siege
from attacking clones.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:23.610
* If nobody is producing food because we’re
constantly under attack, we’d all starve.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:28.810
I sure as shit wouldn’t want to be harvesting
cornfields with naked alien zombies attacking

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:29.810
me.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.960
Sure, we could eat the clones like we talked
about earlier, but that’s if everyone can

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.960
kill them.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.960
* The clones didn’t always attack at night,
when Randy and Zach were attacked, they were

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.960
in the barn during the day.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.960
This means the clone can be formed inside
the prey's home, in the attic, then the clone

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.960
can come down and kill them when they are
asleep.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.960
Eventually the survivors would be whittled
down.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:42.370
* In the TV broadcast, the clones seemed to
act like wwz zombies when no prey was around,

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:43.370
just dormant.

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:46.900
That said, we did see them packing up bugs
into trucks for transport.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:50.630
Like the ants, it’s reasonable to assume
they communicate with each other, and even

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:55.260
if we regained a survivor foothold in Moulton,
the aliens would signal to surrounding towns

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.280
to attack Moulton.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.260
We’d be outnumbered and killed.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.390
* I think the only way you could really survive
is by grabbing some horses and staying on

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:06.330
the move like one of the cannibalistic indian
tribes back in the day.

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:12.270
It’ll be hard for the aliens to hide a gestating
alien egg on the open plains or in our Teepees.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:16.650
You could keep the imposter hordes at a distance,
only allowing the bugs to bite you and your

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.310
clone to run after you.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:22.140
Or picking off stray clones that wander too
far from the group and bringing them back

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.310
to camp for a delicious feast (*Hannibel Lecter).

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:29.230
I don’t know how healthy it would be, but
they are DNA-matching clones, and meat is

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:30.230
meat, right.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:33.460
Or, you could hunt wild animals like a normal
person.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.260
Now that I think of it, I don’t know why
I suggested cannibalism first.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:40.490
Maybe it’s because it’s easier than hunting,
as they come to you.

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:46.200
* I think the chances of surviving and beating
the body snatchers in assimilation are slim,

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.960
considering the whole world is taken over
by the time we realize what’s going on.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.960
But...

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.960
How would you beat them?

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.960
Let me know in the comments.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.840
Thanks for watching.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:30:05.020
And remember, they’re here already, and
you’re next! (*)
