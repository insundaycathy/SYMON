00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.520
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.&nbsp;
Today I will show you an action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.960
adventure, fantasy film&nbsp;
from 2017, titled Cold Skin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.360
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.
The year is 1914. Our nameless protagonist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.320
a young Englishman, has been&nbsp;
on a boat for sixty-seven days,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.960
traveling to a remote island in the South Atlantic&nbsp;
where he'll work as weather observer for a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.800
On the last day of the trip, while having a smoke&nbsp;
by the railing, the Captain asks him what he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.720
running away from, because that's the first thing&nbsp;
they asked him when he decided to go to the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.640
But the Englishman doesn't reply.
They make it to the island, and the whole crew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.040
helps the Englishman take his things to the cabin&nbsp;
he'll be staying at. He notices there are no birds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.200
around, and the Captain points out there is no&nbsp;
weather official welcoming them either. They enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.200
the cabin, which looks as it's been abandoned a&nbsp;
long time ago, and that makes the Captain think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.240
it's not safe. He doesn't think the Englishman&nbsp;
should stay, but the man refuses. He is staying.&nbsp;

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.360
Even if it isn't part of his job, the Captain&nbsp;
helps the Englishman investigate the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.800
On their way to a lighthouse they've seen&nbsp;
from afar, they find a fountain and on it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.360
a message written on the rocks: "Gruner owns this&nbsp;
fountain". The captain sends his crew back to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.160
boat and continues with the Englishman alone.
A moment later, they make it to the lighthouse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.880
which is rudimentarily fortified. When nobody&nbsp;
answers their knocking and calls, they break in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.440
by forcing the door open and go upstairs, where&nbsp;
they find an old man sleeping - this is Gruner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.040
who whispers something about going back to&nbsp;
the water before getting off the bed. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.120
the Captain asks him about the previous weather&nbsp;
observer, Aldor Vigeland, who he should be taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.680
back with him, Gruner says he died of typhus, that&nbsp;
one day he just left and he never saw him again.&nbsp;

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.720
Since Gruner isn't helpful, the two men&nbsp;
leave. The Englishman still wants to stay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.200
so before returning to his boat, the Captain&nbsp;
tries to gift him his gun. The Englishman turns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.040
it down and after saying his goodbyes, he goes&nbsp;
to his cabin to start tidying it up and setting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.280
up his weather tools. In the desk drawer,&nbsp;
he finds a journal left by the predecessor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.000
so he decides to read it by the fire. The first&nbsp;
few pages are pretty normal, the usual notes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.320
about the plant and animal life on the island,&nbsp;
also a photograph of a woman in a wedding dress,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.280
the back says "Mrs. Vigeland" and "love, love,&nbsp;
love", which makes her his predecessor's wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.440
But soon things turn weird: there are notes and&nbsp;
drawings of strange sea creatures that attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.640
humans plus an ominous remark: "Darwin was wrong".
The next day, while doing his weather readings on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.240
the beach, the Englishman finds circles&nbsp;
of rocks filled with shells on the sand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.720
the shapes too exact to be the accidental work of&nbsp;
the elements. Later at night, while having dinner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.760
in the cabin, he hears some strange noises outside&nbsp;
the house, growls and hits to the wood wall. He's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.520
slowly approaching the door when suddenly, a&nbsp;
monster's paw appears under it - it matches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.280
the drawings he saw on the journals. Hearing&nbsp;
more of them climbing all over the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.520
he rushes into the basement and closes the door&nbsp;
behind him. He spies what's going on above through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.280
a hole in the wood and when he notices a creature&nbsp;
looking at him through the same means, he stabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.200
it with a knife he manages to stick through&nbsp;
the hole. They're still out there, though, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.040
the Englishman decides to tie the door handle to&nbsp;
the stairs and spends the night in the basement.&nbsp;

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.600
He comes out the next morning, noticing the blood&nbsp;
on the house floor and the strange footprints on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.320
the sand. He rushes to the lighthouse, but&nbsp;
is unable to open the door this time. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.800
calling for Gruner a couple of times, the old guy&nbsp;
finally opens a window and throws water at him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.640
refusing to allow the Englishman to enter when he&nbsp;
asks, tells him he should've stayed on the boat.&nbsp;

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.200
Moments later, the Englishman is getting&nbsp;
the house ready for the night. He seals all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.360
windows and surrounds the cabin with a circle&nbsp;
of wood and books that he covers with lamp oil.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.760
Once he goes inside, he also seals the door&nbsp;
and loads a rifle. The creatures arrive soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.360
after that and jump on the windows and door,&nbsp;
slowly destroying the reinforcements placed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.000
there earlier. The Englishman manages to shoot&nbsp;
a few at first, but there are too many of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.080
So he lights a torch with a lamp and throws it on&nbsp;
the wood and paper circle he put around the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.560
starting a fire that scares the monsters away&nbsp;
but he can't control. The cabin catches on fire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.720
as well, so the man has no choice to leave&nbsp;
the place, burning his hand in the process,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.320
and spends the night behind beachrocks and under&nbsp;
a rain that begins falling when he gets there.&nbsp;

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.840
He returns to the cabin the following&nbsp;
morning, finding it destroyed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.320
After grabbing a handkerchief to wrap his wounded&nbsp;
hand with, he takes the rifle and sneaks around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.720
to follow Gruner to the fountain. When he's about&nbsp;
to shoot him, he's jumped on by one of those sea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.960
creatures that happens to be a female wearing a&nbsp;
sweater. He pushes her off and points at her with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.600
his rifle, but Gruner finds them then and points&nbsp;
at the Englishman in return. He doesn't give up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.600
though, he makes Gruner put his weapon down by&nbsp;
threatening the creature. Gruner asks him what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.320
he wants, the Englishman says it's obvious. So&nbsp;
Gruner finally agrees to let him stay with him in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.240
the lighthouse after the Englishman tells him all&nbsp;
the kinds of supplies he has to share and explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.240
that the creature is harmless, he proves this&nbsp;
by calling her over as if she was a dog, and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.880
indeed does obey. Before leaving for the cabin,&nbsp;
Gruner decides to name the Englishman Friend.&nbsp;

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.840
When they teach their cabin, they proceed to&nbsp;
grab as many provisions as possible. Friend tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.600
Gruner that he thinks the previous weatherman&nbsp;
didn't die of typhus, he was left alone in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.680
house and the creatures took him. He thinks that&nbsp;
should count as a crime under Gruner's belt, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.160
Gruner doesn't confirm or deny it. He just tells&nbsp;
him they need to go - nighttime is approaching.&nbsp;

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.720
Some days later, we find Friend sleeping inside&nbsp;
the lighthouse, only to be woken up by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.280
creature licking his burned hand - her saliva has&nbsp;
healing properties. Gruner enters the lighthouse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.920
then and tells him he's been sleeping for around&nbsp;
two days, Friend even wetted his pants. They go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.840
upstairs and while counting the bullets under&nbsp;
their disposal, they talk about the creature.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.560
Gruner can't truly talk to her, just order her&nbsp;
around. She's like a dog that will always return&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.280
to her master no matter how cruel he is. Friend is&nbsp;
amazed by her and watches her while talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.600
the theory of isolated sea creatures that evolved&nbsp;
in their own way to survive. Gruner doesn't like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.360
this speech, so he interrupts him to take him to&nbsp;
the balcony and explain that the creatures hate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.440
light, be artificial or natural. Friend asks&nbsp;
him he didn't leave with the boat that brought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.320
him four days ago, and Gruner replies that if&nbsp;
civilization is so nice, why did Friend leave it?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.040
He prefers it here, where he's the master of his&nbsp;
own destiny. Friend replies that he can stay if he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.680
wants, but he'll shoot a sign for the first boat&nbsp;
that comes by. Gruner finds the idea laughable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.200
because they aren't on a commercial route:&nbsp;
the lighthouse was only built to divert funds.&nbsp;

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.760
Days pass as Friend tries to restart his&nbsp;
life for the second time. While checking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.600
out the lighthouse, he puts up a hammock for&nbsp;
himself and finds an old diving suit in a chest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.000
He even starts marking the days on the wall and&nbsp;
getting used to interacting in a friendly way with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.640
the creature. When night falls, Gruner tells him&nbsp;
to grab his rifle and takes him to the balcony,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.000
where torches have been lighted and the&nbsp;
lighthouse's lamp is shining brightly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Armed from head to toes, Gruner explains to&nbsp;
Friend the creatures are coming and how to attack:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.680
it is important to only shoot when they come&nbsp;
close, and taking down only a couple of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.760
is enough because then they'll eat each other.&nbsp;
Their own creature is on the balcony above them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.880
making loud sounds, and Friend wonders if&nbsp;
they aren't being attacked because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.360
want to rescue her. When the monsters finally&nbsp;
come, Gruner quickly starts attacking them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.720
but fear gets the best out of Friend and&nbsp;
he steps back inside before passing out.&nbsp;

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.600
The next morning, Friend is woken up by a very&nbsp;
angry Gruner, who tells him he won't accept any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.760
dead weight living with him no matter how much&nbsp;
food and alcohol he brings. He sends him out to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.560
fetch water, and Friend does exactly as asked. But&nbsp;
when he returns to the lighthouse, he discovers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.480
Gruner has been sleeping with the creature.&nbsp;
Later at night, Gruner gives Friend a last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.120
chance. He takes him out to the balcony again but&nbsp;
this time, when the creatures come, he is the one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.560
to step back inside. He closes the door and locks&nbsp;
Friend outside, leaving him to defend himself. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.280
next morning, he opens the door again and finds&nbsp;
Friend covered in blood but alive and victorious.&nbsp;

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.160
Both men settle on daily routine then. Each day,&nbsp;
Friend does menial tasks to earn his stay in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.560
lighthouse and at night, they defend themselves&nbsp;
against creature attacks. Friend remembers why he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.280
came to the island: to find peace in nothingness&nbsp;
- but instead, he's found hell. He wonders why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.920
the creatures don't attack every night - in fact,&nbsp;
two entire weeks pass without any sight of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.760
On his daily searches for wood, he's also&nbsp;
started to pick up whale bones for carving.&nbsp;

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.080
Friend can't understand how Gruner can attack&nbsp;
these creatures so often and sleep with one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.840
them at the same time, the touch of her&nbsp;
cold skin should be unsettling. But he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.160
also finds himself befriending the creature&nbsp;
and even naming her: he calls her Aneris.&nbsp;

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.400
One night, the two men get so engrossed in a&nbsp;
chess game that they forget to turn on the lights.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.760
They're almost overpowered by the creatures&nbsp;
when they attack, but they barely manage to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.840
survive by locking themselves in the lighthouse,&nbsp;
although Gruner's leg gets hurt in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.480
The next morning, while Aneris heals the wound,&nbsp;
Friend points out they won't be able to survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.080
for much longer since they're running out of&nbsp;
ammunition before he leaves for the beach.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.160
There he finds a necklace on the sand and right&nbsp;
afterward, he sees a boat in the distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.280
He runs inside the lighthouse and&nbsp;
comes back with a flare gun in hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.520
but Gruner doesn't allow him to shoot him, he says&nbsp;
he can protect himself, he has what he wants and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.000
he doesn't want more people on the island. Since&nbsp;
he's jumped on Friend to stop him, Aneris comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.040
and growls at him to make him leave Friend alone.
Some days later, Friend overhears how Gruner yells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.360
at and hits Aneris, who suddenly rushes out of&nbsp;
the lighthouse. Friend follows her outside and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.200
after leaving his rifle against a rock, gently&nbsp;
approaches her to show her the boat he's carved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.440
out of whale bone. Aneris recognizes the shape&nbsp;
and takes him to a hidden spot on the beach where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.760
an abandoned boat lays on the sand. He returns&nbsp;
to the lighthouse and tells Gruner about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.000
but he already knew: he didn't tell Friend because&nbsp;
it would be pointless. If he left on the boat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.320
he would die of starvation or to a creature&nbsp;
attack. When questioned about the boat's origins,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.160
Gruner says it had been used by a Portuguese man&nbsp;
that escaped a shipwreck and was killed by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.800
monsters. That ship was trafficking dynamite,&nbsp;
which Gruner believes to be water-logged.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.240
Friend takes him inside and shows him the&nbsp;
diving suit he had found, he thinks he can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.720
use it to find the sunk dynamite which could help&nbsp;
them exterminate the creatures. Gruner refuses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.440
believing it to be a mission with no return.
The following day, Friend decides to work on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.920
fixing the boat anyway, only getting distracted&nbsp;
when he hears Aneris sing in the fountain. Friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.760
takes off his shirt and joins her in the water,&nbsp;
and all this is seen by Gruner, who gets jealous.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.160
Later on, back in the lighthouse, Gruner&nbsp;
throws the diving suit at Friend and tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.080
him he's changed his mind, an obvious plan to&nbsp;
get rid of Friend and have Aneris for himself.&nbsp;

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.880
They get on the boat and reach the area of the&nbsp;
shipwreck. Friend puts on the diving suit and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.640
goes deep underwater, where he finds the boxes&nbsp;
of dynamite that he connects to a rope that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.960
Gruner pulls up onto the boat. While working&nbsp;
on this, two child creatures swim near him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.440
and knock him to the ground. Slowly running out&nbsp;
of air, Friend pulls at the cord three times,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.600
which is the sign that asks for help, but&nbsp;
Gruner ignores it on purpose. So Friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.000
has no other choice but to get out of the diving&nbsp;
suit and swim up back onto the boat. Once they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.320
back in the lighthouse, they open the dynamite&nbsp;
boxes: one has been water-logged as suspected,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.040
but the others are fine. They bury them in two&nbsp;
lines outside the house, one very near the walls.&nbsp;

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:55.600
Winter arrives, snow starts falling. A week passes&nbsp;
without creature attacks. One particular morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.600
Friend discovers Gruner had spent the night on the&nbsp;
balcony with his hand on the dynamite detonator,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.520
almost freezing himself to death. Friend&nbsp;
snaps him out of it and sends it inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.480
but before following him, he disconnects&nbsp;
the wires from the detonator.&nbsp;

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.800
Another three weeks pass without&nbsp;
monster attacks. Gruner hits Aneris,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.760
thinking she's warned her friends, and&nbsp;
decides they need to set up a trap.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.320
That night, Friend stays by the open door&nbsp;
surrounded by lamps and Gruner takes Aneris&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.320
up to the balcony to oblige her to sing. When&nbsp;
the wind accidentally blows out some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.480
lamps by the door, the creatures take the chance&nbsp;
to enter the lighthouse and attack. While Friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.280
makes his way upstairs, shooting them, Gruner&nbsp;
tries to detonate the dynamite to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.040
So he has to defend himself the best he can until&nbsp;
Friend gets there to reconnect the wires to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.680
detonator. When he's done, the lever is pulled&nbsp;
and the farthest line of dynamite explodes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.320
effectively destroying most of the creatures.&nbsp;
Excited by this, Gruner pulls the lever again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.480
going Friend's warnings, and sets the closest&nbsp;
line of dynamite off, knocking out both of them.&nbsp;

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.280
In the morning, they go out to see the damage.&nbsp;
Gruner is finishing off any creature that may&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.280
be left alive, but Friend can't bring himself to&nbsp;
do it when he discovers a bone necklace on one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.240
of the creatures, a sign of intelligence. Gruner&nbsp;
throws the necklace into the water. That night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.080
the creatures don't come, but the two men hear&nbsp;
the sad sounds Aneris is making somewhere down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.720
on the beach. Gruner explains that's how he found&nbsp;
her as a baby, crying while trapped in a net,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.640
he also says she always does the same thing:&nbsp;
cries a lot but ends up coming back anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.880
Friend thinks she's mourning.
The next day, while walking along the beach,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.120
Friend notices two child creatures on the sea.&nbsp;
Trying to be friendly, he prepares something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.040
for them: a circle of stones on the sand&nbsp;
and the bone boat he carved in the middle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.200
He returns to the lighthouse then, where Gruner&nbsp;
is reloading their rifles with fake bullets just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.120
so they can keep on inspiring fear. Friend&nbsp;
ignores him and goes to the balcony where he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.640
uses binoculars to check on his little bone&nbsp;
boat - it's still there where he left it.&nbsp;

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.440
The following morning, Friend finds that Gruner&nbsp;
has drunk himself to sleep and a deck of cards has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.160
fallen to the floor. Inside the card box, he finds&nbsp;
the same picture of the woman he had seen in his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.360
cabin, but here she isn't alone, her husband is&nbsp;
with her. The words "love, love, love" are also on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.000
the back of this picture. Friend has a realization&nbsp;
then: "Gruner" is a fake name and the previous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.880
weatherman hadn't died. Gruner IS the previous&nbsp;
weatherman, driven crazy by loss and isolation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.520
Upset by this discovery, Friend decides to erase&nbsp;
the day count he's been keeping on the wall.&nbsp;

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.400
Later that day, while walking along the beach,&nbsp;
Friend finds the circle of stones empty:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.400
the creatures took the little bone boat. When&nbsp;
noticing the child monster in the distance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.440
Friend leaves the torch he's carrying in&nbsp;
the stone circle before backing away with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.280
his hands up, showing he means no harm.&nbsp;
The young creature approaches him then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:28.080
and soon after, many others also appear, including&nbsp;
Aneris, who is looking much more confident.&nbsp;

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.840
The kid is about to give the bone boat&nbsp;
to Friend, but Gruner interrupts the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.840
sweet moment with a shot of his rifle. Friend&nbsp;
tells him to back away because they were wrong,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.560
the creatures are actually friendly. Ignoring&nbsp;
him, Gruner orders Aneris to go back to the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.360
but she doesn't obey. Gruner becomes very upset&nbsp;
when he realizes Aneris won't return to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.440
and he runs back to the lighthouse, mumbling&nbsp;
things like "nobody leaves Gruner, Gruner leaves".&nbsp;

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.920
Friend tries to befriend the creatures again,&nbsp;
but the kid falls when a shot from Gruner at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.920
the lighthouse balcony hits him in the chest.&nbsp;
All the creatures run back into the water,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.600
including Aneris, who only stays back one&nbsp;
more second to share a look with Friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.640
Enraged, Friend returns to the lighthouse and&nbsp;
attacks Gruner for he's done, but Gruner gains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.960
the upper hand. When he's about to hit him with&nbsp;
an axe, Friend uses his real name and tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:16.000
"Aldor Vigeland is not a murderer". Struck&nbsp;
by these words, Gruner repeats "love, love,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.480
love" before opening the door and leaving the&nbsp;
house, giving himself up to the creatures. Friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.200
see them attack him and closes the door, knowing&nbsp;
by the noises he's lost Gruner and he's now alone.&nbsp;

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.440
Time passes, and we see three officers inside&nbsp;
the lighthouse trying to awaken Friend, who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.600
is sleeping on Gruner's old bed. They're here to&nbsp;
replace Friend with the new weatherman, and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.320
think Friend is Gruner, but Friend doesn't correct&nbsp;
them. In fact, he tells them the weatherman died&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.560
of typhus. The officer in charge scolds him for&nbsp;
the state of the room and informs him that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.320
are at war while Friend goes out to the balcony,&nbsp;
where he sees a bunch of ships in the distance.&nbsp;

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.400
The movie ends with Aneris running along the&nbsp;
beach before jumping back into the water.
