00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.520
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain an action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.320
drama, sci-fi film called “Predestination.”&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.400
An agent in a coat and hat is walking in a&nbsp;
hallway. He carries with him two briefcases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.640
as he heads over to a staircase leading under&nbsp;
the building. There he finds a hidden time bomb,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.520
to which he immediately opens his&nbsp;
briefcase that turns out to be a gadget.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.360
The agent carefully disarms the bomb but&nbsp;
is interrupted by the presence of another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.360
person in the area. The agent pulls his&nbsp;
gun and looks for the enemy. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.600
the enemy takes him by surprise and lands a&nbsp;
shot at the agent. The agent retaliates, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.840
time bomb is about to explode, so he immediately&nbsp;
drops his guard and puts the bomb in the gadget.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.280
But just before he could conceal it, the&nbsp;
bomb explodes, burning the man's face and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.840
knocking him back. The burned agent screams in&nbsp;
agony and tries to reach for his other case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.520
The other person finally shows himself to&nbsp;
the burning man but, instead, he helps him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.000
reach the other case. The two briefly stare at&nbsp;
each other before the other person walks away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.880
The burning man then desperately inputs&nbsp;
something in the case and enters it.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.000
After the event, the agent finds himself covered&nbsp;
with bandages, recovering on a hospital bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.440
His superiors meet him and commend him for&nbsp;
his efforts. They tell him that he should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.040
forget about his failed mission and focus on&nbsp;
resting and preparing for his last mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.920
It turns out the person he was trying&nbsp;
to catch is a very elusive criminal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.000
known as the fizzle bomber. The fizzle bomber has&nbsp;
had many small attacks, but those were nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.400
compared to the bomber's grand plan: a massive&nbsp;
scale attack in New York somewhere in 1975,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.680
killing many people. Despite being&nbsp;
told to move on his failed mission,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.400
the agent is more determined to stop&nbsp;
the fizzle bomber one more time.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.280
After a couple of rest, the doctor finally removes&nbsp;
the agent's bandages, telling him that he will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.040
recover sufficiently for his next mission.&nbsp;
The doctor further instructs the agent that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.040
his recovered face and vocal cords will change&nbsp;
drastically due to the injuries he suffered.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.080
The agent takes a look at the mirror&nbsp;
to see his scarred but different face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.000
The agent acknowledges and accepts his changes.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.880
Seven years of rest later, the man's face&nbsp;
has finally fully healed. He takes his voice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.280
recorder and starts recording his experiences. He&nbsp;
explains that he is finally about to deploy for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.280
his next and final mission. He further explains&nbsp;
the importance of his mission and how it will get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.360
them closer to their final destination. While&nbsp;
the agent prepares, his superiors give him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.280
his weapons and remind him of the rules. They&nbsp;
tell him that if he diverts from his mission,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.200
it will result in death by lethal injection.&nbsp;
The agent agrees to all this, and they give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.520
him the case from earlier. After everything is&nbsp;
set and done, he departs for his final mission.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.040
In a city bar in the middle of the night,&nbsp;
the agent works undercover as a bartender,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.880
seemingly waiting for someone to arrive. A&nbsp;
person in a coat and hat then walks into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.480
bar and immediately orders a drink. The&nbsp;
bartender serves the person while subtly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.560
trying to make conversation. They talk about the&nbsp;
fizzle bomber for a short while but immediately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.320
escalates into a different conversation.&nbsp;
The person reveals himself as a writer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.080
the unmarried mother, and writes confession&nbsp;
stories for a living. The bartending man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.600
knows about the content he writes and shows&nbsp;
him one of the magazines he's been reading.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.040
The writer is surprised that a bartending man&nbsp;
reads his content because he doesn't fit the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.120
demographic. The writer further tells him that&nbsp;
the things he writes are not worth the read.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.800
The bartender tells him that he sometimes looks&nbsp;
to his magazines when he needs insights into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.640
woman's perspective and is curious how a man&nbsp;
would know a woman's perspective. The writer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.880
tells the bartender that he was once a girl, which&nbsp;
leaves the bartender surprised. But before the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.160
bartender could ask more about the matter, t
he writer starts telling his life story.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.760
It all started on September 13, 1945. He&nbsp;
was a newborn without parents taken and left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.120
at an orphanage doorstep. The orphanage&nbsp;
took her in and gave her the name Jane.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.360
As a kid, Jane was curious about outer space and&nbsp;
grew to love it. Jane envied kids who had parents,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.440
wondering how and what it feels. Jane never&nbsp;
understood why her parents abandoned her or what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.600
she did wrong to deserve such deprivation. But&nbsp;
as Jane got older, she felt something different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.320
about her. Jane was more self-aware than any other&nbsp;
girls in the orphanage and more curious than them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.640
Jane solemnly vowed that her children would have&nbsp;
a real family, unlike her. So she focused on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.400
other things like learning how to fight. Jane&nbsp;
was stronger than any of the other kids, even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.360
the boys. She was also the smartest in the class.&nbsp;
She loved mathematics and science, and everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.600
was easy for her. But all of the kids did not&nbsp;
like her, and they thought of her as weird.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.680
Later on, Jane grew to hate herself, realizing&nbsp;
that her being different made her very unlikely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.760
to be adopted. Jane accepted that no one would&nbsp;
take her as their daughter or even as their wife.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.840
Years later, Jane was finally about to&nbsp;
graduate when she met Mr. Robertson.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.040
Robertson was looking for young women like Jane&nbsp;
for a job in government service on an organization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.200
called Space Corp, possibly revolving around&nbsp;
space travel. Robertson elaborated that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.880
sought out ladies that show great potential in the&nbsp;
fields of Mathematics and Science and had strong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.680
physical abilities. Jane accepted the invitation&nbsp;
and applied for the company. During the interview,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.680
Jane expressed herself in front of the panel.&nbsp;
Upon being questioned by the panel about how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.120
she saw her role in the journey, she&nbsp;
told them her determination. She was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.840
serious about what the organization&nbsp;
wants from her, so she got accepted.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.640
Space Corp held special training sessions for the&nbsp;
volunteers to test if they were capable of space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.480
travel. They gave Jane and the volunteers&nbsp;
an advanced visual simulation of space.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.000
Jane felt alive and was brimming with&nbsp;
excitement at the sight of space travel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.400
but some of the volunteers couldn't take it.&nbsp;
Space Corp gave them endurance and written tests,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.000
which many of the volunteers struggled with,&nbsp;
but Jane quickly passed with flying colors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.240
Space Corp also held interviews with a heartbeat&nbsp;
sensing machine to tell if the interviewee was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.320
lying or not. There they find out that&nbsp;
Jane thought about love a lot. Jane also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.920
expressed that something feels wrong with her&nbsp;
and that the other volunteers don't like her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.080
Shortly after, Jane got herself into a fight with&nbsp;
one of the volunteers, but she beats the girl by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.480
constant parries and multiple strong punches&nbsp;
directly to the face, knocking her down. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.040
were immediately stopped by the staff and taken&nbsp;
to the clinic. Outside, a doctor hands a report&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.200
to Robertson about something particular in Jane's&nbsp;
body. The doctor then told Robertson that it would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.360
disqualify her, but Robertson told the doctor&nbsp;
not to tell Jane and that he'll take care of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.200
Jane got disqualified, but they didn't&nbsp;
tell her why. While packing her things,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.720
Robertson approached her, and Jane expressed&nbsp;
to him that she was merely defending herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.240
Robertson reassures Jane that he will do&nbsp;
everything to get her back in the program.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.040
Despite Robertson's promise, Jane couldn't rely&nbsp;
on him, so she had to find other ways to make a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.440
living. Jane worked as a house helper in the&nbsp;
day for a cheap family by doing their chores.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.800
It was there that Jane discovered confession&nbsp;
story magazines and began to love reading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.480
them for her past time. At night, Jane&nbsp;
went to school to work on her etiquette,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.400
but she had a hard time learning. That was when&nbsp;
Jane met the man who was going to change her life.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.920
One rainy night, Jane accidentally bumped into a&nbsp;
man and apologized. Jane then asked if the man was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.000
lost, to which the man replied that he was waiting&nbsp;
for someone. Jane replied with the quote, "good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.160
things happen to those who wait." The man replied&nbsp;
with the rest of the quote, saying, "but only the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.160
things left behind by those who hustle." Jane was&nbsp;
amazed that they were thinking the same thing.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.560
Jane further describes the man to the bartender,&nbsp;
how the man was handsome and rich enough to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.880
care of her. Jane was in love with how the man&nbsp;
treated her, and the bartender replies mockingly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.640
seemingly knowing how it ends. Jane asks the&nbsp;
bartender if he had ever done something stupid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.320
for love, to which the bartender replies&nbsp;
that he did, once, and he understands how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.400
Jane felt. Jane continues her story, telling&nbsp;
the bartender that being with that man was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.280
happiest time of her life. But it only lasted&nbsp;
there. The man told Jane to wait at the bench.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.960
The man promised Jane that he'd be&nbsp;
back. But the man never returned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.320
Jane tells the bartender that she acknowledges&nbsp;
the relationship as nothing more than a fling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.320
So she was able to move on quickly and&nbsp;
continued hoping to go back to Space Corp.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.680
Then one day, Robertson visited Jane. Robertson&nbsp;
told Jane the truth that the organization he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.280
was working for was not for space travel.&nbsp;
It was a confidential government agency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.200
that "reshapes wrongdoings" and only used&nbsp;
Space Corp to find extraordinary people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.680
People who had exceptional abilities, people who&nbsp;
had no families, no past and ties to the future,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.680
people like Jane. Jane tells the bartender&nbsp;
that she didn't understand what the job meant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.840
but she knew it would change&nbsp;
her life for the better.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.160
Until she realized she was pregnant and Robertson&nbsp;
never appeared to her again. It turns out that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.920
the mysterious man left Jane with more than just a&nbsp;
broken heart, and she thought her future was over.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.680
Jane went to a charity ward with other&nbsp;
pregnant women, though she felt alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.080
One night, Jane found herself in agony on&nbsp;
an operating table with nurses and doctors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.160
ready to finally let the baby out. In the&nbsp;
morning after the operation, Jane woke up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.640
and a doctor came to check in on her. The doctor&nbsp;
happily informs the excited Jane that the cesarean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.400
was successful and the baby was a healthy little&nbsp;
girl. But then everything took a turn when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.160
doctor started to ask Jane if any doctors&nbsp;
ever told her about the state of her body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.320
Confused, Jane told him that the doctors never&nbsp;
told her anything and that everything was fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.320
The doctor then explains to Jane that she&nbsp;
had two reproductive organs, female and male,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.960
inside of her. Despite being underdeveloped, the&nbsp;
female set was good enough to develop a baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.480
Then the doctor tells her that due to excessive&nbsp;
bleeding from birth, they were forced to perform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.800
a hysterectomy on her, removing her female&nbsp;
reproductive organs. However, they were able&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.560
to reconstruct her successfully, and she was&nbsp;
able to develop her male reproductive parts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.560
though she will have to take more surgeries.&nbsp;
Jane was shocked by the news, gets teary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.880
and unable to accept what happened. The doctor&nbsp;
continues to reassure her that she will be fine.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.240
Jane continues to care for her baby daughter,&nbsp;
telling her that she was the best thing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.080
ever happened to her. When asked by a nurse&nbsp;
about the baby's name, Jane wanted to name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.320
her baby after herself. Jane was now very&nbsp;
determined to raise the baby properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.200
However, the baby was kidnapped, taken away&nbsp;
from the hospital nursery by an older man. Jane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.360
desperately tried everything, but she never found&nbsp;
her baby, and they never found the kidnapper.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.440
Then there was her other problem. Jane had&nbsp;
to undergo three major operations and spend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.600
eleven months in the hospital to reshape her&nbsp;
into a man. Everything made her feel broken,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.880
as she was losing herself in the&nbsp;
process. Eleven months later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.840
Jane looked in the mirror and saw&nbsp;
her new self, finally accepting that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.360
the girl he once was, is truly gone.
Jane tells the bartender that every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.320
time he looked at the mirror, it reminded&nbsp;
him of the person that ruined his life.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.120
Jane desperately tries to re-enlist on&nbsp;
Space Corp once more but to no success.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.480
They knew about his story and marked him&nbsp;
unfit for space travel, nailing the coffin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.280
to her desired future. So Jane changed his name&nbsp;
and moved to New York to get on with his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.840
He started trying to make a living,&nbsp;
eventually leading to his current&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.960
career of being "the unmarried mother,"&nbsp;
writing confession stories for a living.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.400
Jane concludes the story with that. Strangely&nbsp;
enough, the bartender then asks Jane a question:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.720
that if she had the opportunity to kill the man,&nbsp;
would she do it. Jane answered that she would,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.720
in a heartbeat. So the bartender starts telling&nbsp;
Jane that he knows the person and he can make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.640
him do it. Jane doesn't trust him, so the&nbsp;
bartender uncovers Jane's current name that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.880
she did not even mention, which is John.&nbsp;
John is still reluctant, so the bartender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.240
reassures him that he works for Robertson,&nbsp;
which finally prompts John to follow him.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.240
The agent takes him down the cellar and shows&nbsp;
him his field kit, telling him that it is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.000
time machine, and they will both travel&nbsp;
back in time. John is still suspicious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.280
of the bartender until the agent stands&nbsp;
close to him and tells him to stay still,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.200
hold the case, and close her eyes, and&nbsp;
the two of them disappear from the cellar.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.400
John and the agent travel to Cleveland, Ohio,&nbsp;
in 1963. John is distorted from the travel but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.400
slowly recovers. The agent gives John some cash&nbsp;
and clothes for the mission while briefing him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.400
of where the man is. John is still perplexed,&nbsp;
but the agent tells him that the man who ruined&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.240
his life might be the fizzle bomber. The agent&nbsp;
then reassures him that if he kills the man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.520
he can finally get the job. The agent&nbsp;
then leaves John to do his mission.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.080
That rainy night, the disguised John makes his way&nbsp;
on the fateful hallway where the man was supposed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.720
to meet his past self. Suddenly, he bumps into&nbsp;
a girl and looks away from her. The girl asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.800
if she was lost, to which John replies that he&nbsp;
was waiting for someone. The girl then tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.040
the quote, "good things happen to those who wait."&nbsp;
John finally pieces the puzzle together, realizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.960
he was the man all along and replied with the&nbsp;
rest of the quote. John turns around to meet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.960
Jane and is astounded at the sight of her. John&nbsp;
wholeheartedly compliments Jane telling her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.960
she’s beautiful and someone should’ve told her&nbsp;
that. Jane replies with a smile that he just did.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.920
All while this is happening, the agent watches&nbsp;
them from a distance and shortly leaves. The agent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.160
deviates back to his failed mission. But this&nbsp;
time, he spots the fizzle bomber who just finished&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.120
setting up the bomb. The bomber notices the agent&nbsp;
and dodges his first shot. The two get in a short&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.520
gunfight, but the bomber makes a run for it. The&nbsp;
agent chases him but finds himself in a dark part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.760
of the basement. The agent slowly searches for the&nbsp;
bomber, but the bomber flanks him, and the two get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.600
in a short fistfight. The bomber beats him with&nbsp;
a solid punch to the face and knocks him down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.160
Shortly after, the agent hears familiar gunshots,&nbsp;
prompting him to get back on his feet and head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.880
over to the bomb. There he sees his past self the&nbsp;
moment he burned his face. The agent approaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.200
the agonizing former him and helps him reach his&nbsp;
field kit, and the two gaze at each other briefly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.440
The former agent time travels away from the&nbsp;
scene. The agent realizes the inevitability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.760
of his failure. He then picks up a part of the&nbsp;
bomb, takes it with him, and time travels away.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:39.840
The agent jumps to 1964 and takes out his anger.&nbsp;
He cleans, recollects, and reminds himself of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.480
the next part of his mission while recording&nbsp;
everything. Back in 1963, John and Jane go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.640
out for coffee. Jane starts the conversation by&nbsp;
telling John that she isn't a friendly person.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.520
John knows this very well, so he frankly&nbsp;
tells Jane the reason why. Jane is amazed at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.760
how similar they view other people, that they&nbsp;
feel more superior to others. Jane asks John&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.240
what makes him feel superior to other people. John&nbsp;
wittingly replies that he can read minds, and this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.720
prompts Jane to let him read hers. John begins to&nbsp;
tell her the truth about herself, her struggles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.440
and her thoughts about love. Jane denies this&nbsp;
at first but slowly starts falling for John.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.040
John then sympathizes with how Jane's life has&nbsp;
been and tells her how he relates a lot to how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.200
she feels. The two continue to enjoy conversing&nbsp;
with one another and eventually made out.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.840
The agent is now in a hospital hallway when&nbsp;
Robertson appears to meet him. The agent gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.760
Robertson the piece of the bomb, to which he&nbsp;
realizes that the agent made an illegal jump.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.680
Robertson, however, tolerates this saying that&nbsp;
agents without the regulations could save more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.280
lives. The agent expresses his hesitation&nbsp;
about the next task, saying that Jane will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.440
endure so much pain because of what he's about&nbsp;
to do. Robertson explains why the agent has to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.840
accomplish his mission: to preserve the existence&nbsp;
of an agent created by a predestination paradox,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.320
a person with no ancestry and history, like John.&nbsp;
Robertson reassures the agent that he's doing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.280
right thing and leaves. The nurse then exits the&nbsp;
ward, and the agent proceeds to take Jane's baby.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.280
The agent takes the baby to his place&nbsp;
and prepares the baby for time travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.600
The agent inputs the date, September 13,&nbsp;
1945, and carefully takes the baby with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.000
him and travels. The agent changes his clothes&nbsp;
and takes the baby to the orphanage doorstep,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.880
where it all started. The agent wishes the baby&nbsp;
well, calling her both of the names John and Jane.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.880
The agent then phones the orphanage to notify them&nbsp;
of the baby at the doorstep, completing the cycle.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.960
The agent returns to Cleveland, Ohio 1963, and&nbsp;
sees John and Jane at the bench from a distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.280
John notices the agent, so he tells Jane to wait&nbsp;
for him and makes his way to the agent. Feeling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.760
very deceived, John pulls out his gun towards the&nbsp;
agent. The agent understands his pain but still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.840
tells him that everything was inevitable. John&nbsp;
tells the agent that he genuinely loves Jane,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.240
which the agent acknowledges. The agent then&nbsp;
makes everything finally clear to John, who Jane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.880
is supposed to become, who she is now, and who the&nbsp;
agent is. John is speechless after finally making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.800
sense of everything, so the agent reassures&nbsp;
him that everything is proceeding correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.800
John looks at Jane one more time, not wanting to&nbsp;
leave her, but finally accepts what has to happen.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.480
The agent takes John to the headquarters&nbsp;
and tells him that he will finally lead a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.120
good life from there. John gets exhausted from&nbsp;
the jump, so the nurses take him for recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.360
The agent and Robertson speak outside. Robertson&nbsp;
explains that for John to become the person who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.680
will prevent crimes, he had to endure his entire&nbsp;
life first. The agent still worries about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.600
fizzle bomber running amok. To this, Robertson&nbsp;
tells him that the fizzle bomber helped the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.240
agency become stronger. The agent is surprised&nbsp;
at this remark. Robertson then hands him the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.000
timer and new leads against the fizzle bomber.&nbsp;
Robertson then instructs the agent that after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.080
he reaches his final destination, his field&nbsp;
kit will decommission as per regulation. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.680
agent acknowledges this, so Robertson pats&nbsp;
him, and the two bid each other farewell.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.840
The agent leaves his recorded messages&nbsp;
behind beside John and leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.320
The agent then jumps to his final destination&nbsp;
in New York 1975, few months before the grand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.440
explosion. The agent settles down, relaxing on a&nbsp;
chair, waiting for his kit to decommission. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.680
to his surprise, the kit fails to decommission.&nbsp;
The agent then checks the new lead Robertson left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.320
him and finds out that Robertson still&nbsp;
wants him to find the fizzle bomber.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.120
Meanwhile, the agent looks&nbsp;
for a typewriter and finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.760
it in an antique store. He buys the typewriter
and starts writing a novel. Upon finishing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.600
novel, the agent reveals himself to be John&nbsp;
all along, and the novel he wrote was about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.160
his own entire life. Shortly after, John begins&nbsp;
connecting the dots and clues about the fizzle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.920
bomber and comes to a horrible conclusion.&nbsp;
He then picks up his gun and makes his way.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.440
At the Laundromat, John barges in with his gun&nbsp;
to find an older version of himself as the fizzle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.720
bomber. John is heavily disappointed at what he&nbsp;
has become, but the bomber justifies that all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:21.520
he did was prevent deaths by killing some. John&nbsp;
tells the bomber about the lives he destroyed. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.680
then angrily tells the bomber that he will never&nbsp;
become him. However, the bomber tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.360
it is inevitable for John to become the fizzle&nbsp;
bomber, for it was already predestined like their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.000
entire lives. He further explains that if John&nbsp;
kills him, he will become the next bomber. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.080
bomber then finally tells him that the only way to&nbsp;
break the paradox is not to kill him but, instead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.560
love him again. But John, without hesitation,&nbsp;
shoots the bomber and kills him mercilessly.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:48.560
Everything finally fits in place. The paradox will&nbsp;
continue to happen in a repeating cycle. The baby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.640
the young Jane, the adult John, the&nbsp;
unmarried mother, the mysterious lover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.680
and the agent were all the same&nbsp;
person born out of predestination.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.840
And now, as the newly recruited agent John&nbsp;
turns to the next page of his predestined life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.560
so is the time for decommissioned John&nbsp;
to make his next predestined move.
