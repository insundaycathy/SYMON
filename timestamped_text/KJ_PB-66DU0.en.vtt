00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.710
Hi guys, K-Movie Recapped here.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.420
Before we start, WARNING!

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.520
Spoilers Ahead!

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.490
Today, I’m going to explain a movie called,
The Silenced.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.960
The movie tells the story of a Japanese girls
only boarding school in Korea.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.380
At that time, Korea was under Japanese occupation,
so many schools were controlled by the Japanese

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.080
government, and everyone must have a Japanese
name.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.000
This story begins with a girl named, Cha Joo
Ran, with Japanese name, Shizuko . Shizuko

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.710
is a girl with a disease inherited from her
biological mother.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.160
Fearing the disease, her stepmother sent her
to a girls boarding school located far from

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.370
the city.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.820
This girls' boarding school is called Gyeonsong
. When Shizuko first arrived in a luxury car,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.400
all the other girls were surprised by this
beautiful new student.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.140
In this school, all the girls have a disease.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.280
This school offers healing for them.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.729
On first arrival, Shizuko was greeted by the
principal . But a moment later, she got unpleasant

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.539
treatment from the counselor.

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.690
It is because she wants to keep her diary,
while the rules say students shall not keep

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.270
a diary.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.190
Shizuko's story while at the boarding school
continues.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.690
She was greeted by a woman named, Hong Yeon
Deok, with Japanese name, Kazue . She was

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.690
treated well by Kazue by helping her to adapt
to the boarding school.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.360
Afterwards, she also became friends with a
girl named, Kiraa . Kiraa tells Shizuko, if

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.080
she does well at the boarding school, she
will get more points and has a chance to be

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.420
sent to Tokyo.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.970
However, not all the girls here welcomed Shizuko.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.459
This is, Yuka . She doesn’t like Shizuko
and always bullies her.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:47.010
Due to her poor health, Shizuko often coughs
up blood.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.340
She is then prescribed an injection of medicine
by the principal.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.649
The principal says that if she is getting
better and is the most two outstanding student,

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.850
she will be sent to Tokyo.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.459
Shizuko then meets Kiraa.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.280
Kiraa told her that there was another girl
called Shizuko before.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.910
The previous Shizuko used to be best friends
with Kazue and Yuka, but her health got worse

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.369
and she went home.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.170
After that, Kazue brings Shizuko to a secret
basement.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.930
Kazue then gives her a secret diary, which
belonged to the previous Shizuko.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.090
The next day, the students attend PE class.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.380
They take turns doing the long jump.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.570
When it came to Shizuko’s turn, she couldn't
jump, and coughed instead.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.890
She was then given another injection.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.100
Apart from injection, they are also given
strange pills and foods.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.110
During lunch, Shizuko asks Kiraa about the
previous Shizuko.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.830
Unexpectedly, Kiraa behaves strangely and
attacks her.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.740
Kiraa almost choked her to death and then
convulsed.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.590
After that, Shizuko is taken to the infirmary
for treatment.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.460
But then Kira walks in and talks to Shizuko
like nothing happened.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.180
She doesn't seem to remember what happened
earlier.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.700
When drying clothes, Shizuko asks Kazue, what’s
behind the forest beside the boarding school.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.470
Kazue said that no one knows but she heard
there is an ocean.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.530
So they are sneaking out of the school together
into the forest to have a look.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.270
There they find a lake.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.630
Then Shizuko noticed that her cough wasn't
bleeding anymore.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.520
They are so happy and playing until they get
wet.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.030
Shizuko is glad as she thinks that the treatment
is working.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.380
In the PE class, Shizuko who previously couldn’t
jump was now able to jump well.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.300
All her friends give applause.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.500
She was very proud of her achievement.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.720
The next day, when they’re all getting dressed,
Shizuko finds a bloody bird in her locker.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.630
Turns out it was Yuka who did it.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.530
She didn’t like Shizuko who was too confident.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.270
During lunch, Shizuko retaliates against her
bullying by putting the bloody bird she found

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.819
in her locker on Yuka’s food.

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.270
Shizuko is now in the room alone, trying to
read Shizuko's previous diary.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.840
But something falls.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.270
When she tried to take it, a hand appeared
from under the bed.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.780
She looks under the bed.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.240
She is very surprised when she sees a girl
full of slime all over her body.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.390
Then Shizuko runs away.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.170
After that, they found that a girl disappeared
leaving all his belongings.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.540
But then the principal explains that girl
was picked up and went home in the morning

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.690
due to her health condition.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.570
Shizuko suspected that the slimy girl she
saw earlier was that girl.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.739
She then tells Kazue about it.

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.880
But Kazue gets angry and says that Shizuko
was just hallucinating.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.169
The next morning, Shizuko got another injection.

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.320
Kiraa then calls Shizuko and points out something.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.919
She sees something strange under the stairs.

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.880
It turns out that it is that girl she had
previously seen in the bedroom.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.450
She is very shocked and trying to run away.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.360
But behind her, Kiraa was choking herself.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.790
With fear, Shizuko seeks help and meets the
counselor.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.970
But she didn’t believe Shizuko.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.410
The principal says that she is just over-sensitive,
and told her that Kiraa just transferred to

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.240
another school this morning.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.320
During the day, she tries to long jump and
finds that she could pass the sandbox.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.810
Shizuko who originally couldn’t jump is
now greatly improved.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.260
Is it because of the medicine she received?

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.900
Kazue becomes worried about her health, and
tells her that the previous Shizuko also went

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.550
through the same things before disappearing.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.870
Next day, the principal tells the class that
Shizuko will be sent to Tokyo.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.940
Kazue, who really wants to go to Tokyo, becomes
sad and runs out of the classroom.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.180
Suddenly, Yuka attacks Shizuko, who wants
to chase Kazue.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.100
However, she attacks Yuka back and chokes
her almost to death.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.930
Kazue who sees that becomes angry and says
Shizuko had turned into a horrible person.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.920
After things calm down, Kazue meets Shizuko
and tells her a surprising fact.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.760
It turns out that she actually saw the previous
Shizuko turn into a scary creature.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.870
She then shows Shizuko a secret passage to
the principal’s office.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.210
While trying to search the room, the principal
comes with a Japanese soldier.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.050
From here, they overhears the fact that all
the girls in this boarding school were guinea

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.770
pigs of the Japanese army to turn humans into
superhumans.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.790
After that, they also found documents about
the experiments, including the unusual drugs

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.760
and injections given to them.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.520
Suddenly, they hear a scream from outside
the boarding school.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.340
Yuka is up in the tree trying to suicide.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.200
Everyone tries to get her down, but she jumps.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.290
Taking advantage of the situation, Shizuko
and Kazue then run away.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.050
After running far, they find a Japanese military
base.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.960
They try to hide, but a soldier finds them.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.770
He hits them straight away.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.479
They try to run away, but the soldier manages
to shoot Shizuko in the leg.

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.300
Kazue then whispers something to Shizuko,
and then runs away.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.540
The soldier brings Shizuko back to the boarding
school.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.650
The principal immediately takes her to the
laboratory.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.800
She is given a hazardous gas for further experiments.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.790
But unexpectedly Kazue has sneaked back in
and steals a gun from the principal’s office.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.000
She then tried to save Shizuko.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.639
Surprised, she found that all this time the
missing student was frozen in the tube.

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.720
While looking at them, she is suddenly attacked
by the Japanese soldier and beaten until she

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.720
faints.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.200
The scene moves to the principal’s office.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.580
The soldier is talking to the principal.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.889
He tells her that her job was done.

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:15.449
From now on, the Japanese army will take over
the school.

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.199
The principal doesn’t accept that and threatens
him.

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:21.610
But the Japanese soldiers immediately rushed
into the room.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.910
With the counselor who then slaps her.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.160
On the other hand, Kazue was in the tube asking
for help because the water will soon fill

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.280
the tube.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.550
After some time, Shizuko finally wakes up.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.009
But it is too late.

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:36.940
Kazue was already in a tube full of water.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:43.720
Seeing that, She then goes on a rampage and
attacks the Japanese soldiers and the principal.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.790
Shizuko immediately killed the entire Japanese
army.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.729
On the other side, the counselor is checking
up on the other students.

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:53.080
She sees all the girls are sewing.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.680
Sensing the danger, she tried to run away.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.170
But she is caught and ganged up by all the
students.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:03.300
The principal, who is trying to find help,
was caught by Shizuko.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:09.580
She asks why the principal did all of this.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.650
The principal then shoots her, but hits the
tube containing Kazue.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:18.479
Seeing Kazue who has died, she immediately
attacks the principal, and throws her until

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:22.020
she is stabbed right in her heart.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.220
This is how the tragic end of the girls boarding
school experimenting on humans.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:31.280
