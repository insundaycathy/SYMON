00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.240
Story Recapped here. Today I'm going to explain&nbsp;
a mystery and thriller film called “Run."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.240
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.960
A single mother named Diane Sherman gives&nbsp;
birth prematurely to a daughter named Chloe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.720
Due to Chloe’s condition, she is stuck temporarily&nbsp;
in an incubator. Diane cries as she helplessly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.680
watches her poor daughter. Several years later,&nbsp;
at the age of 17, Chloe suffers from arrhythmia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.120
hemochromatosis, diabetes, and paralysis. Because&nbsp;
of her state, she’s bound to a wheelchair and is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.440
forced to take medications every day. Despite her&nbsp;
daughter’s conditions, Diane does her best to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.080
their home comfortable for them. She monitors her&nbsp;
health strictly and is in charge of her education.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.920
She also grows their own vegetables that she&nbsp;
serves to her daughter. Chloe grows up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.600
a consistent routine and looks forward to&nbsp;
reading her university acceptance letters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.840
However, her mother insists on not handing the&nbsp;
mail to her. But despite her stuck condition,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.760
Chloe becomes highly skilled in technology&nbsp;
and engineering, her favorite being robotics.&nbsp;

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.320
&nbsp;
One day, after attempting to secure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.640
chocolates behind her mother’s back, Chloe sees a&nbsp;
pack of green capsules prescribed to her mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.960
She finds this suspicious because she knows that&nbsp;
the medicine is meant for her. That night, Diane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.200
gives her the pill. Chloe asks Diane why her name&nbsp;
is on it instead of hers, but she tells her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.440
it's part of the receipt. Chloe is unconvinced,&nbsp;
but she drinks the medicine anyway despite hints&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.320
of suspicions. The following day, she refuses to&nbsp;
take the medicine and checks for its contents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.680
Questions arise in her mind whether or not&nbsp;
the medication is helpful for her condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.840
She uses one of her inventions to reach for&nbsp;
the bottle in the medicine cabinet. When her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.080
mom leaves, she examines the bottle, which is&nbsp;
labeled as Trigoxin. She checks the bottle and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.320
finds a pharmacy label with her name covering&nbsp;
Diane’s. When Diane lets her drink the capsule,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.560
she spits it out after her mom leaves.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.480
Eager to know more about the capsule, she&nbsp;
sneaks out of her room to look up Trigoxin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.640
However, their internet connection is not&nbsp;
working, so she is left clueless. She feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.040
frustration and a sense of entrapment, but she is&nbsp;
left with no choice but to endure Diane’s rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.040
The following morning, Chloe finds a chance&nbsp;
to use the telephone in her mom’s bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.200
She dials a random number while her mom is busy&nbsp;
gardening, and a stranger answers the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.200
She asks the guy to look up the medication for&nbsp;
her after explaining that it is an emergency.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.400
At first, the guy refuses to help her, but after&nbsp;
some desperate convincing, he obliges her request.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.000
The guy googles Trigoxin and reads that it&nbsp;
is a medication for severe heart conditions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.160
but Chloe wants to know more. To ensure that it&nbsp;
is the green capsule, Chloe asks the guy to look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.640
at the google images and tell her the color of&nbsp;
Trigoxin capsules. To her surprise, the guy says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.200
that all Trigoxin capsules are red. Chloe’s doubts&nbsp;
grow more and more as she confirms that the green&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.440
capsule is not what her mom says it is.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.080
Chloe comes up with a plan to&nbsp;
know more about the green capsule;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.840
she knows that the plan is a gamble, so&nbsp;
she must find every opportunity she can.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.600
Chloe asks Diane if they could go and watch&nbsp;
a movie in the cinema, and her mom agrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.680
As part of her plan, she brings samples of the&nbsp;
medicine hidden in her piggy bank. In the middle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.680
of the movie, she tells Diane that she needs to&nbsp;
go to the bathroom; her mother offers assistance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.680
but she says that it will be fine. Finally,&nbsp;
answers about the medicine are within reach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.080
as she makes her way to the local pharmacy without&nbsp;
Diane knowing. She rushes inside and sees a long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.280
queue of customers. She uses her disability to&nbsp;
her advantage and skips the long line. Mrs. Bates,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.200
the pharmacist, is surprised to see Chloe without&nbsp;
Diane after years of strict supervision of Chloe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.960
She hands Mrs. Bates the green capsule and asks&nbsp;
her to look up its name under her mom’s recent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.920
purchases. However, Mrs. Bates refuses to disclose&nbsp;
any information because the buyer is her mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.320
and they follow a strict confidentiality protocol.&nbsp;
Chloe thinks of making Mrs. Bates give her the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.080
info and observes the counter, where she sees a&nbsp;
family picture with her family in a breakout room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.880
She lies and tells that she and Diane are playing&nbsp;
a game, and the next clue is about the medicine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.160
Mrs. Bates gets a bit giddy and eventually&nbsp;
reveals that the green medication is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.560
relaxant called Lidocaine for dogs. After&nbsp;
hearing this, Chloe starts to hyperventilate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.000
realizing that she has been tricked into&nbsp;
drinking medicine for dogs all these years.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.600
She shakingly asks the pharmacist what&nbsp;
would happen if a human took the medication.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.240
Mrs. Bates tells her that a person’s legs could go&nbsp;
numb. At that moment, Diane enters the store and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.320
rushes to Chloe, who is now having an asthma&nbsp;
attack after hearing about the side effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.080
She asks the other customers to step aside&nbsp;
from them, as her daughter needs more air.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.960
Diane sedates Chloe, which makes&nbsp;
her unconscious without being seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.600
&nbsp;
Back at home, Diane realizes that Chloe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.600
is beginning to doubt her, making her cope with&nbsp;
a way to make the situation better. To control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.240
the issue, she calls Mrs. Bates to apologize for&nbsp;
the commotion earlier. She informs the pharmacist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.560
that Chloe’s new medications caused her to act&nbsp;
and behave out of control. Diane brainstorms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.400
ways to cover the fact that she has been giving&nbsp;
her daughter medication for dogs. Running out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.280
of options, Diane looks up household neurotoxins&nbsp;
as an alternative. She is becoming more unstable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.200
and anxious by the fact that her daughter might&nbsp;
despise her. Chloe wakes up the following morning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.280
realizing that she has slept through the day. She&nbsp;
gets up and finds out that Diane has locked her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.080
inside her room. She calls for Diane, but she&nbsp;
does not answer as she runs an errand outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.760
Chloe tries to look for something in the room&nbsp;
that she could use to pick the lock. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.440
ineffective as the door is also locked with a&nbsp;
rake from the outside, which is behind Diane’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.440
obsession with keeping her daughter inside. Chloe&nbsp;
begins to worry about her safety and thinks of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.560
a way out. Odds are certainly not in her favor,&nbsp;
given that all her life, Diane has assisted her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.120
When she notices that Diane’s car isn’t parked in&nbsp;
the driveway, she comes up with a plan. She uses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.560
multiple extension wires to plug the soldering&nbsp;
iron as she stores some water in her mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.880
She makes her way to the window of her mom’s&nbsp;
bedroom through her window. Chloe struggles to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.360
drag herself across the roof because of immobility&nbsp;
in her legs, but she manages to reach the window.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.040
She uses the soldering iron to crack the window,&nbsp;
and she spits the water out so the window would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.360
break instantly. She safely gets inside but&nbsp;
starts to feel an asthma attack, so she rushes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.840
for her inhaler as she gasps for air. Once she&nbsp;
feels better, she tries to get on the ramp to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.200
downstairs, but Diane has cut the wires, again, to&nbsp;
keep her from going out. Without a choice, Chloe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.360
throws her wheelchair down the stairs, causing&nbsp;
her to fall accidentally. Lying on the floor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.200
she realizes that she can move her foot, which&nbsp;
results from skipping the green capsules.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.880
The sight of it gives her a sense of hope and&nbsp;
a stronger will to fight back. She is more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.480
determined than ever to get up and escape; she&nbsp;
steps outside the house and rolls her wheelchair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.960
along the road. She hears a vehicle approaching&nbsp;
and hides, thinking that it may be her mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.880
Luckily, she sees the mail truck and rushes to&nbsp;
stop it, almost hurting herself in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.960
Tom, the mailman, is relieved to find that he&nbsp;
did not run her over. Chloe tells him about her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.200
situation, and he decides to help her. As she&nbsp;
is about to enter the truck, both of them see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.680
Diane’s car approaching, so they step back. Diane&nbsp;
spots them and rushes to the mail truck as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.800
She asks Tom if her daughter is hurt, but he stops&nbsp;
her from going near Chloe. Diane gets more frantic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.200
and agitated towards Tom. She explains that the&nbsp;
medication is messing up Chloe’s way of thinking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.080
but Tom remains unconvinced. According to him,&nbsp;
Chloe looks “really bad.” Tom tells Diane he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.680
can't let her take Chloe. Both of them agree&nbsp;
that Tom will take Chloe to the hospital while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.240
she follows them in her car. Chloe tells him she&nbsp;
wants to go to the police instead of the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.000
However, while he is closing up the van to take&nbsp;
Chloe to the police station for assistance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.080
Diane stabs him with a sedative syringe.&nbsp;
Chloe’s sense of safety has faded once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.560
She is certain that this time, things are going to&nbsp;
get worse. She starts to panic again, as she knows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.640
that she will end up in Diane’s care.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.080
Back in the house, Chloe wakes up and finds&nbsp;
out that she is trapped inside the basement,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.640
with her wheelchair chained. Diane uses this room&nbsp;
to mix medications and other substances that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.040
gives Chloe. As Chloe observes the room, she&nbsp;
discovers all the mail that was meant for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.880
She unravels a document that shows her college&nbsp;
acceptance letter, making her feel more betrayed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.280
than ever. All she ever wanted was to make a&nbsp;
life of her own despite being limited physically.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.520
Her freedom and future are taken away from her&nbsp;
by the person she trusted the most. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.760
Diane drags Tom’s body across the house to get&nbsp;
rid of it and hide any signs of evidence. Back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.080
in the room, Chloe comes across a box of photos&nbsp;
of her as a child where she sees a picture of her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.720
perfectly healthy and able to walk. Chloe realizes&nbsp;
that her disability is orchestrated by Diane,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.880
who gave her insane amounts of medication that&nbsp;
messed with her health. Digging for more evidence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.280
she comes across a death certificate of a girl&nbsp;
named Chloe, who died two hours after her birth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.640
She then sees an article about a couple who&nbsp;
had their baby stolen in a hospital seventeen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.800
years ago.&nbsp; It is revealed that Diane’s real&nbsp;
daughter has died because of premature birth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.040
and she stole Chloe as a baby from her original&nbsp;
parents, then claimed her as her own since then.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.480
Chloe cries helplessly after knowing the truth&nbsp;
about her identity and how her life could have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.440
been.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.840
Diane enters the basement and sees&nbsp;
that Chloe has opened the box.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.400
She defends herself and insists that she&nbsp;
is Chloe’s real mom. According to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.400
she saved Chloe from her parents. Chloe then&nbsp;
questions Diane if she was ever really sick and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.200
accuses her of poisoning her. Diane's obsession&nbsp;
with having a child has taken her too far. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.040
tries to make a deal with Chloe to start all over&nbsp;
again and forget about everything that happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.720
Diane insists that everything she ever did was&nbsp;
protect Chloe while filling a syringe with paint&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.560
thinner to make her forget. Chloe crawls to&nbsp;
a small room and locks herself inside just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.280
before Diane could reach her. She sees a bottle&nbsp;
of organophosphate, which is a lethal substance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.680
Chloe realizes that Diane needs her more, so&nbsp;
she drinks it. Afraid that she might lose her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.760
“daughter," Diane rushes Chloe to the hospital&nbsp;
in hopes of saving her. Doctors try to save her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.200
and they are successful despite her being&nbsp;
on the brink of death. Chloe wakes up in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.000
hospital but is unable to move or even speak.&nbsp;
Her condition just became worse. The doctors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.320
inform Diane that she could not take Chloe home&nbsp;
unless she gets consultation from a psychiatrist.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.520
She is considered a high-risk patient&nbsp;
because of her attempt to take her own life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.440
Diane watches Chloe from the window, making Chloe&nbsp;
cry in fear that she might be trapped again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.520
She manages to press the button and signal&nbsp;
the nurse that she wants to write something.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.600
The nurse brings her a paper and a crayon so they&nbsp;
could communicate. Before the nurse could read her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.400
message, a code blue is called, making the nurse&nbsp;
rush out. Diane takes advantage of the situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.880
and sneaks to Chloe’s room to take her home. She&nbsp;
manages to bring her downstairs and apologizes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.400
Chloe for scaring her.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.480
The nurse returns to Chloe’s room and finds her&nbsp;
missing. She looks at the paper with “mom” written&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.200
on it. Security informs the whole hospital to&nbsp;
track Diane and Chloe. Diane rushes even more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.040
but realizes that there is no way for her to&nbsp;
run back to the car as the escalator is broken,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.600
and she cannot use the stairs. She tries to go to&nbsp;
another exit, but Chloe moves her feet to stop the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.160
wheelchair. When Diane confronts her, Chloe is&nbsp;
able to mutter the words “I do not need you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.400
The police show up and command Diane to put her&nbsp;
gun down. She refuses to do so and gets shot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:31.040
in the shoulder. It causes her to fall down the&nbsp;
stairs and gain serious injuries. Chloe looks at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.160
Diane from above, realizing that she is now safe.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.640
Seven years later, Chloe visits a correctional&nbsp;
facility. She still uses a wheelchair but has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.280
partial control of her legs, so she uses a cane to&nbsp;
go through the metal detector. She wheels into an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.680
infirmary and begins talking about her husband,&nbsp;
kids, and her job. A good life came after her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.920
unfortunate fate in the hands of Diane. The sick&nbsp;
and paralyzed Diane listens to her stories about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.960
how great her life is. She is immobile and unable&nbsp;
to react to anything. After some moments, Chloe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.640
spits the green capsules out of her mouth; she&nbsp;
tells Diane that she loves her before commanding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.280
her to open her mouth and take the capsules. This&nbsp;
is Chloe’s ultimate and bitter revenge. Now that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.040
she has control over her life, the situation&nbsp;
has turned upside down and in her favor.&nbsp;

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.640
&nbsp;
