00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.040
you've been invited to play a game of would&nbsp;
you rather that could solve all your problems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.240
but every choice you make is going to be brutal&nbsp;
you'll have to beat main torture and drown the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.480
other players if you want to win the ultimate&nbsp;
prize but do you have what it takes when you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.880
traveling a room with desperate people willing to&nbsp;
torture you for cash what do you do i'm going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.280
break down the mistakes made what you should do&nbsp;
in how to be the death game and would you rather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.960
this one iris desperately needs money for her&nbsp;
brother's bone marrow transplant and she do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.040
anything to make sure he gets it her brother's&nbsp;
doctor wants to help and introduce her to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.720
wealthy philanthropist who offers to cover&nbsp;
her brother's bone marrow transplant but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.120
there's one catch she'll have to kill and play&nbsp;
a game and will only get the money if she wins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.680
the doctor confirms this guy's legit as he was a&nbsp;
winner of the last game and got a lot of money out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.560
of it it's extremely generous and she asks to&nbsp;
think it over all right there's already enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.880
here to tell me this is a sketchy deal if he&nbsp;
wanted to donate his wealth to people in need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.440
make making a private game out of it is completely&nbsp;
unnecessary there must be an alternative motive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.760
here but this group doesn't have a lot of options&nbsp;
a bone marrow transplant can cost up to 675 000&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.080
which is insane if she worked three jobs like&nbsp;
the one she applies for at this restaurant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.920
and didn't spend a penny for eight years she&nbsp;
still wouldn't have enough money to afford the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.560
procedure if it's my brother i'd still join any&nbsp;
game short of an underground rush roulette ring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.480
to make sure he could live but not without&nbsp;
some basic questions answered first if we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.520
going to play a game we need more information&nbsp;
to prepare study it and devise a strategy to win&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.280
this girl didn't even ask what the&nbsp;
game was and that was her first mistake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.680
the best source of information is the doctor&nbsp;
here because he was the winner of the last game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.320
i wouldn't leave until he told me his advice&nbsp;
and strategies so i have a competitive advantage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.560
after returning home she finds out she's been&nbsp;
rejected from her recent job application and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.760
realizes her brother will die a slow and painful&nbsp;
death unless she decides to join the game the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.160
evening she heads over to the mansion where the&nbsp;
event is being held he meets seven other guests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.560
it's a real mixed bag of people there's a woman&nbsp;
in a wheelchair a professional gambler from vegas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.200
and even an iraq war veteran all of them are here&nbsp;
out of sheer desperation and looking for a chance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.040
to win big but none of them are prepared&nbsp;
for the horrors they'll be facing tonight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.080
okay they might all seem friendly right now but&nbsp;
this is a room full of desperate people which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.720
makes them dangerous and we should expect they're&nbsp;
all sizing up the competition so we should too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.560
we can actually tell a lot about these people&nbsp;
based on their positioning in the room body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.200
language and drink selection every single one&nbsp;
of them is drinking alcohol except this guy who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.760
just has water this seems irrelevant but it's&nbsp;
incredibly important if you're about to play a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.240
game you want to be sober it tells me this guy's&nbsp;
taking the competition more seriously than the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.600
others and is already strategizing if they offer&nbsp;
me drinks i'm refusing i can also tell that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.600
girl and this veteran have trust issues because&nbsp;
they've distanced themselves from everyone else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.680
in the room they're not here to make friends&nbsp;
they're here to win and i expect that neither&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.000
of them will easily cooperate with the group the&nbsp;
butler comes in and tells the guests to remove any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.760
of their personal belongings before they enter&nbsp;
the game as a way to make sure they don't cheat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.920
it makes them feel nervous but with money on the&nbsp;
line everyone has their phones and bags over and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.640
makes their way to the dining room okay we are&nbsp;
playing a game and phones might be an easy way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.200
to cheat so handing them over is actually a&nbsp;
reasonable request but this is exactly why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.440
i would do everything i could to take mine inside&nbsp;
if i'm already desperate enough to be here in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.600
first place why would i suddenly want to play&nbsp;
by the rules if my brother's life hangs in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.400
balance i need every advantage bear or not to gain&nbsp;
the upper hand they ask for my phone i would tuck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.640
it inside my waistband behind my belt and simply&nbsp;
say that i didn't bring it with me there's no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.000
metal detection no x-ray not even a pat pat-down&nbsp;
this is a flaw that we can and should exploit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.640
dinner starts and they serve the main course of&nbsp;
steak and vogue but iris here has some gripes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.040
she's a straight vegetarian who's sworn to never&nbsp;
eat meat and this is where the night starts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.760
get interesting the host offers her ten thousand&nbsp;
dollars to give up her lifelong commitment and eat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.280
the steak she refuses at first but everyone has a&nbsp;
price as she takes the deal and swallows her pride&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.160
he then notices the old man here is drinking only&nbsp;
water and finds out he's a recovery alcoholic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.360
offering him thousand dollars he ups the ante&nbsp;
and tells him to drink an entire scotch decanter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.040
after a lot of hesitation he finally gives up&nbsp;
16 years of hard-fought sobriety okay there's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.040
pattern building here the host wants to make us do&nbsp;
things that go against our principles and morals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.000
for cold hard cash fortunately this can be easily&nbsp;
manipulated because both of these challenges were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.600
based on information that they volunteered i&nbsp;
would create a lie that would make him give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.160
me easy challenges that i didn't morally object to&nbsp;
such as telling him i'm jewish and only eat kosher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.240
i might even say i'm celibate just to see what&nbsp;
happens now this is probably going to escalate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.480
quickly and if we stay too long he might be asking&nbsp;
us to do things that are downright evil with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.880
room of desperate people only god knows what some&nbsp;
of them might be capable of especially when things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.960
start getting competitive we should be taking this&nbsp;
opportunity to grab as much cash as possible in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.680
these simple isolated challenges and leave before&nbsp;
it gets out of hand the host then reveals the main&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.600
event of the evening they will all be playing&nbsp;
a game of would you rather with some important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.640
differences in each round every player will be&nbsp;
given two unpleasant choices with only 15 seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.520
to choose they're eliminated if they don't act in&nbsp;
time and the last remaining player wins the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.440
before they start he offers them a chance&nbsp;
to leave but no one gets up and the game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.640
begins the host reveals that his butler used&nbsp;
to be an interrogator for mi5 as he brings out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.600
one of his old tools for torture and they'll be&nbsp;
using it to electrocute their guests the alcoholic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.760
wants no part of this and tries to leave but the&nbsp;
butler makes it clear that's no longer an option&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.000
by shooting him in the head if they want out alive&nbsp;
they need to win all right this is messed up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.160
not just because they've skipped dessert if it's&nbsp;
me i'm paying close attention to the iraq war&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.000
veteran he would have the best instincts in&nbsp;
a life-threatening situation and if he's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.840
moving into striking distance of the gunman it's&nbsp;
fair to say we don't have a good chance to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.000
our way out of this we need to play the game&nbsp;
until we have a better opportunity to escape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.400
and now it's all about making the best choices&nbsp;
to keep everyone alive for as long as possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.880
now we have only 15 seconds to make difficult&nbsp;
decisions which gives us very little time to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.440
explore the consequences of each choice this thing&nbsp;
is a torture device so we'll likely have to choose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.200
between two different forms of pain which is&nbsp;
scaring the [ __ ] out of everyone at the table&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.120
in high pressure situations like this one&nbsp;
the brain is influenced by fear panic and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.680
cognitive bias we tend to compensate for these by&nbsp;
oversimplifying our options but there's actually a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.840
way to bypass all these mental blocks to allow&nbsp;
you to make better and more rational decisions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.760
professional chess players use a decision-making&nbsp;
tactic in their games that psychologists call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.160
combinatorial versus positional thinking where&nbsp;
a player makes a series of moves based on a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.800
specific final outcome in mind and lets them make&nbsp;
strategic sacrifices to achieve their final goal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.120
now most people in this situation would base&nbsp;
their decisions on avoiding pain but that's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.360
mistake because it limits your thinking and&nbsp;
strategy to only a momentary goal the final&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.240
outcome here is not to suffer less pain it's to&nbsp;
win and survive this type of strategic thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.040
helps bypass intuitive and emotional responses and&nbsp;
make better decisions to gain the advantage the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.680
brother puts a headband on this guy and he's asked&nbsp;
if he would rather electrocute himself or amy here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.000
the host starts to clock and just before&nbsp;
time runs out he decides to shock himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.280
and they say chivalry is dead but he's voluntarily&nbsp;
weakened himself without gaining anything in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.920
return if it's me i'm choosing to shock someone&nbsp;
else because it increases my chance of winning if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.480
others are too injured to continue the game he's&nbsp;
actually given everyone an advantage because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.360
now have more information to work with if we know&nbsp;
what we're in for we can plan for it better this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.440
guy is still conscious and doesn't have any burn&nbsp;
marks which means the electrical potential is too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.440
low to stop your heart and you can survive a&nbsp;
single shock now there are some things we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.960
do to lessen the pain here water is a conductor of&nbsp;
electricity so if i was next i would dry any sweat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.000
from my forehead because wet skin has 500 times&nbsp;
less resistance to electricity and will hurt much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.400
more we could also consider cheating if you were&nbsp;
brave enough and halfway decent at sleight of hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.000
you could try slipping a credit card between&nbsp;
your skin and the electrodes because plastic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.640
is an insulator and thin enough to hide the next&nbsp;
two players in line get strapped in but amy here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.840
wastes no time and instantly chucks the old woman&nbsp;
like it's nothing she's cold-blooded the old woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.000
is given the same choice and she chooses to shock&nbsp;
the gambler they go around the table and finish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.240
the first round with lucas and iris here the&nbsp;
only other players who decide to shock themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.640
okay there were actually two ways to play this&nbsp;
as a team and that was for everyone to either&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.200
unanimously decide to shock themselves or to&nbsp;
shock others only these two options will have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.240
a fair outcome because everyone gets shocked only&nbsp;
once but this strategy requires 100 trusts and no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.160
rogue decision makers and when the challenges&nbsp;
get more brutal we won't be able to rely on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.320
others and think about the group over themselves&nbsp;
and this tells me group decision making would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.120
a bad strategy the staff prepare for the second&nbsp;
round with their only chance the group secretly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.680
discussed taking down the guards stealing their&nbsp;
guns and taking their keys to escape the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.760
before they can come to any agreement the&nbsp;
host's son julian comes in to taunt them the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.640
veteran starts mouthing off and the son makes&nbsp;
it clear that he'll regret it later all right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.800
bad decisions are made when you let emotions get&nbsp;
the better of you now studies show fear drives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.960
people to make pessimistic decisions and angry&nbsp;
people will make optimistic ones deciding to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.200
curse this guy out optimistically assumes that&nbsp;
there will be no consequences and that's stupid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.440
we already know that the host will have us killed&nbsp;
without blinking an eye i'd want to stay quiet so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.040
i don't get any special attention now it's&nbsp;
cold-blooded but i'd also encourage others&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.520
to speak out and get emotionally triggered this&nbsp;
situation is scary as hell and i'd be pessimistic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.000
enough to think there's no way out of this without&nbsp;
winning meanwhile iris doctor has snuck onto the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.680
property he won the last game so he must know&nbsp;
what's going on and it looks like he's here to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.520
help them but he can't take out all the guards by&nbsp;
himself so they'll have to survive the next round&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.320
until he can figure out what to do okay there's&nbsp;
no reason for this doctor to be on the property&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.920
if he actually wanted to save lives and avoid&nbsp;
suspicion from the host he should have stayed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.680
home and called the police or the fire department&nbsp;
from a birder phone to avoid any trace of the call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.160
back to him if the authorities get involved it&nbsp;
gives the guests an opportunity to escape this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.640
guy doesn't consider any of this and if he is my&nbsp;
doctor i'd definitely be seeking a second opinion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.560
the next round has begun and this time they&nbsp;
will have 30 seconds to make their decision&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.360
but the choices will be a lot more sadistic the&nbsp;
first player to go is iris and she's asked if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.520
she would rather stab this guy's thigh with an ice&nbsp;
pick or won't be better with the staff three times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.640
okay things are getting really serious now we&nbsp;
have to be a lot more careful of our decisions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.400
because not only could they kill someone but&nbsp;
we should also be expecting retaliation if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.040
make the wrong choice i'd be very tempted to beat&nbsp;
someone as a lesser punishment but in this case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.720
choosing the ice pick is actually the safer&nbsp;
the two options this whipping stuff is called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.680
a jambock and it's a [ __ ] nightmare irish&nbsp;
decided to use the african whipping staff but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.240
bigger mistake here was letting him take off his&nbsp;
jacket because he's removing a layer of protection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.080
she tries to take it easy on him but the&nbsp;
host won't count them unless she uses full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.960
force now the back has a lot of weak ones there&nbsp;
are vital organs nerves and bones without a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.360
muscle or fat to protect them making it much more&nbsp;
dangerous this guy didn't specify where to hit him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.680
so if you had to use the staff you should aim for&nbsp;
the butt the thighs and the forearms dominatrix's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.520
target needs an impact plate because they have a&nbsp;
higher pain threshold than the rest of the body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.160
so getting a little kinky might actually save&nbsp;
your life the next guy is given the same choice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.400
he can either stab the woman or whip the veteran&nbsp;
three more times he knows there's a major artery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.320
in the thigh that could kill her but isn't sure&nbsp;
where it is so he chooses to beat the soldier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.960
again this guy's taken like a champ luckily it's&nbsp;
the veteran's turn next and he's given a choice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:58.080
to stab this guy or get whipped three times by&nbsp;
the butler surprisingly he chooses the whip this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.960
guy begs the veteran to stab him but the host says&nbsp;
he can't change his mind okay he's clearly being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.040
singled out because he's stood up to the host&nbsp;
son and it's hard to watch but it's also a direct&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.600
benefit to every other player in the game the&nbsp;
most practical decision here is to use this as an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.840
opportunity to take out a competitor and improve&nbsp;
your chances of winning so when it's our turn we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.440
should make our decision based not on what keeps&nbsp;
him in the game but on the most compassionate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.000
way to take him out of it the best solution for a&nbsp;
merciful exit from the game that defend the rules&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.320
is the samsung and the femoral artery because&nbsp;
it's a major supplier of blood to the lower body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.000
this artery is primarily centered around the&nbsp;
inner thigh to aim for somewhere around here and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
dealt with a matter of minutes if they don't get&nbsp;
help it's cool but there are two ways out of here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.960
you're either the winner or get sent out in a body&nbsp;
bag it's the gambler's turn now and he's given the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.960
choice of either whipping the veteran who could&nbsp;
die from his wounds or stab the paralyzed woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.200
next to him he rationalizes that she won't feel&nbsp;
the pain because she's paralyzed and he stabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.600
her in the thigh accidentally piercing an artery&nbsp;
he makes a tourniquet with his belt to stop the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.160
bleeding as the woman decides if she wants to whip&nbsp;
the soldier or stop amy here she gives her answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.160
and quickly jumps the goth girl with the ice pick&nbsp;
but wasn't expecting to get elbowed in the face&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.960
the gambler made the right move here the vet is&nbsp;
on his way out and the old woman came for their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.600
legs so if he aims for the femoral artery he could&nbsp;
eliminate her aimlessly that's true for the price&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.240
of one and it's a perfectly rational strategy to&nbsp;
cut down the pool of competitors his reaction here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.240
is a great way to garner empathy because even&nbsp;
though he stabs her he also decides to help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.720
her once he sees how severe her wound is acting&nbsp;
morally conflicted makes him appear less evil and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.360
the other players might be less likely to target&nbsp;
him as a result on the other hand if you act cold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.200
and calculating you make it easier for others to&nbsp;
see you as someone they should take out quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.680
emotions and instinct play a huge role in fast&nbsp;
decision making so if you dehumanize yourself and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.440
give them a justification to punish you they'll&nbsp;
have no problems hurting or eliminating someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.920
they think is a bad guy now it's this woman's&nbsp;
turn and the host decides to make things more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:51.040
interesting she can either whip the soldier or&nbsp;
stab anyone she chooses she makes it clear to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.440
everyone that this is a competition where teamwork&nbsp;
does not pay off and she's dead set on winning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.720
this she chooses iris as her target and asks the&nbsp;
host if she can stab her anywhere he tells her she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.200
can stab only below the shoulder and immediately&nbsp;
the girl jumps the ice pick into her side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.680
it didn't penetrate the lungs so she's going to be&nbsp;
okay but as she's recovering the veteran collapses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.720
from his injuries and isn't getting up okay&nbsp;
they've introduced a new choice into this game&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:19.440
and this is important to our strategy because we&nbsp;
can now selectively target who to injure with one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.200
person eliminated and two on their way out we&nbsp;
should consider who's most likely to survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.080
the longest out of all of them the old lady is the&nbsp;
weakest due to her age and fatal stab wound so i'd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.080
want to keep her around these two guys are healthy&nbsp;
enough to take quite a beating but they've also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.080
shown a willingness to sacrifice themselves for&nbsp;
the group so they might be easier to manipulate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.080
and are therefore less threatening amy is most&nbsp;
likely going to stab others in the back which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.400
makes her the first person you should take out&nbsp;
as she's too dangerous to be left alive iris here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.560
is in this for her brother so she do anything to&nbsp;
make sure he gets what he needs making her just as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.280
dangerous as for the gambler i expect he's better&nbsp;
at calculating probabilities and risk assessment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.840
and will eliminate any other competitors who get&nbsp;
in his way if they give us the freedom to choose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.880
the top three people we need to take out are amy&nbsp;
iris and the gambler and winning the game depends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.880
on making sure your last remaining competition&nbsp;
is weaker than you downstairs in the basement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.800
the doctor is breaking in and he's decided&nbsp;
he has to do something about this to rescue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:15.440
his friend iris before she dies in the game the&nbsp;
butler determines the soldiers unconscious but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:20.720
still able to play but they realize the old woman&nbsp;
has quietly died from a wound she gets eliminated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.440
it's not this guy's true to choose and he decides&nbsp;
to beat the veteran so hard that he can't continue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.760
leaving five people left to play but before&nbsp;
the weapons change hands the players make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.600
signals to each other and they wait until the&nbsp;
host starts speaking with his butler to seize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.160
their opportunity the three men attack the guards&nbsp;
distracting them as iris here runs out of the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.320
the host shoots one of the players dead and ushers&nbsp;
the remaining guests to the table but when he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.160
realizes that someone is missing he commands&nbsp;
his butler to find the woman and lets his son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.040
join the search okay this was their best chance&nbsp;
at escaping and they took it we have two weapons&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.320
that we didn't have in the first round and they&nbsp;
would have been taken away once the next one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.800
starts so it was a perfect time to strike and they&nbsp;
nearly got away but they made a few mistakes here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.680
the first was assuming the hosts don't carry guns&nbsp;
there's no way i'm thinking they aren't armed for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.440
any number of unexpected outcomes and if they've&nbsp;
been doing this for years they would know better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.040
this guy should have left as soon as he had&nbsp;
the chance instead of walking up to the host&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.120
secondly splitting up will divide the outnumbered&nbsp;
guards giving someone the opportunity to look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.200
for confiscated cell phones to call the police&nbsp;
the windows aren't barred so i would look for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.360
a room in the first floor of a window and lock&nbsp;
myself in meanwhile you should grab a knife in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.200
case you need to force open any locked doors in&nbsp;
the escape this is actually not that hard to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.800
as long as the slanted part of the latch bolt&nbsp;
is facing you the knife can slip into the small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.960
crack of the lock to force it open and you can&nbsp;
run away iris here tries to break out through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.360
the basement window where the whole sun finds&nbsp;
her and tries to take advantage she fights back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.920
and stabs him in the leg her doctor slowly shows&nbsp;
up and tries to rescue her but seconds later he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:49.040
gets shot by the butler who takes iris back to&nbsp;
the game okay this encounter here has made a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.640
of noise and when you're running from the guards&nbsp;
you have to expect they'll be drawn to the sound&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:56.560
the doctor should have considered hiding the dark&nbsp;
to wait for a guard to show up so he could easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:01.280
ambush him and save iris even still wandering&nbsp;
into the house got him killed and all he had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:06.160
to do was make an anonymous phone call to the&nbsp;
police and mention gunshots as for iris this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:11.120
is a difficult situation she stabbed the skyline&nbsp;
lake we saw who eventually was to the soldier if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.360
we get caught and dragged back to the game we'll&nbsp;
die for sure so with this in mind i'm deciding to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.680
stab on the neck for the kill and run out of the&nbsp;
hallway so i'm not caught standing over the body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.760
returning to the game the guards bring out a&nbsp;
barrel of water in this round each player will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.480
given a sealed envelope and inside is a card with&nbsp;
a punishment written on it they have 30 seconds to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.720
choose between being held down under water for two&nbsp;
minutes or take their chances with the envelope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.920
okay as soon as i see the tub full of water i know&nbsp;
where this is going so before even being presented&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.960
a choice i'm going to start breathing exercises&nbsp;
to prepare in advance also opening the envelope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.120
takes away your ability to make an informed choice&nbsp;
now with that said two minutes held under water is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:52.000
totally possible to survive the magician david&nbsp;
blaine once out his breath for 17 minutes using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.320
the technique that pro divers use known as oxygen&nbsp;
assisted static asteroid david blaine's method is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.240
to take a minute to breathe in and out deeply&nbsp;
then purge your body from excess carbon dioxide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.960
inhaling quickly and exhaling strongly if you do&nbsp;
this a normal person with no prior experience can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.560
hold their breath twice as long as they would&nbsp;
normally the trick here is to keep as still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.400
as possible the water slowing down your heart&nbsp;
rate and not the panic and thrash because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.400
body will send oxygen to the muscles creating more&nbsp;
carbon dioxide buildup and making it much harder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.960
to hold your breath thankfully we as humans have&nbsp;
the mammalian dive reflex which naturally occurs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.120
once your faces are submerged this will cause your&nbsp;
heart rate to decrease narrowing the blood vessels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.200
to ensure that organs like the brain of the heart&nbsp;
have a continued supply of oxygen the gambler&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.120
goes first and decides to make a gamble on the&nbsp;
envelope finding out he must light a firecracker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.240
in his hand it seems like he got lucky but instead&nbsp;
he's handed something much bigger the host assures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.320
that if it's a dud he'll get a free pass but to&nbsp;
make sure he doesn't drop it they tape it to his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.040
hand and force him like the fuse at gunpoint the&nbsp;
explosion turns his hand into bloody chunks and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:52.400
he dies from a heart attack leaving three players&nbsp;
left to play okay this guy mentions it's a quarter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.240
stick but based on its size and the description&nbsp;
provided by the bureau of alcohol tobacco and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:01.120
firearms it looks more like an m80 because an&nbsp;
actual m1000 quarter stick is six inches long that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:06.000
ain't no six inches trust me these explosives are&nbsp;
illegal to own without a license because they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.800
so dangerous there's no way out of this situation&nbsp;
other than to cheat he had more than 30 seconds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.640
before the explosive went off so i would have&nbsp;
tried using my fingers to slowly pull the wick out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.720
of the explosive container and rip it out of the&nbsp;
socket it's glued into this might convince them as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.200
a dud and i'll get to keep both my hands lucas&nbsp;
here decides he'll open up the envelope and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:28.560
discovers his punishment is to slit his eye open&nbsp;
he's given a razor blade in 30 seconds to do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.960
but he doesn't think he can it's too scary still&nbsp;
he holds the blade to his eye and when there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.840
only three seconds left he slices it open all&nbsp;
right this is where you'd lose me i can't even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.080
watch people put their contacts in so slitting my&nbsp;
own eye is just too damn hard but there might be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.920
way to do this properly without losing your sight&nbsp;
the eye is one of the fastest healing parts of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.000
body so you should look a way to avoid the pupil&nbsp;
and slice the whites of your eye only in order&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.680
to avoid further damage you should keep your eyes&nbsp;
closed if you look around with one eye the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.960
eye follows because they're paired together&nbsp;
i won't be able to see but i probably won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.520
need to in order to win and it will protect my eye&nbsp;
for further damage the next player irish bravely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.280
decides to take the water barrel instead and&nbsp;
it's not easy but she manages to last the whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:10.160
two minutes much the host surprise it's a good&nbsp;
thing too because if she had chosen the envelope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.480
all her teeth would have been extracted this&nbsp;
leaves amy here to go next and she chooses the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:19.120
envelope rather than the water barrel but as she&nbsp;
discovers her punishment is being held under water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.400
for four minutes instead of two and unlike iris&nbsp;
she does not make it this leaves only two players&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.960
left and the host reveals for this final round&nbsp;
things will be very different the buzzer flips&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.520
a coin and iris gets to go first where choice is&nbsp;
simple would you rather end this game now with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.880
both players leaving empty-handed but would&nbsp;
you rather kill lucas here with this pistol&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.600
okay she's been headed the keys to freedom but&nbsp;
there's more actual decision making here than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.800
meets the eye if she walks away they both live&nbsp;
there's no reward and her brother inevitably dies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.840
if she shoots him this man dies but her brother&nbsp;
lives so ultimately this decision is actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.600
between the life of this man or the life of her&nbsp;
brother if we were thinking about the greater&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.520
good we would take into consideration how many&nbsp;
people this man cares for and how many people his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.320
death negatively affects it has a ripple effect to&nbsp;
everyone in his life he is responsible for so if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.560
we were being altruistic this would be the right&nbsp;
course of action but at the same time how could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.720
i tell my brother i chose a stranger's life over&nbsp;
his with my brother's life on the line and only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.120
30 seconds to decide i'd be heavily influenced&nbsp;
by emotional and instinctive decision making and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.440
probably would shoot him in the end mexico choose&nbsp;
the first option and tries to convince her to walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.480
away but she shoots him and everyone applauds as&nbsp;
the sole winner of the game she's given her prize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.960
a bag full of money a bone marrow donor for her&nbsp;
brother and a chance to finally go home she gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.680
back to tell her brother the good news but tragedy&nbsp;
finds out he's killed himself all that torment was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:47.840
for nothing after such an awful night i take that&nbsp;
money and use it to get some much-needed therapy

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:50.240
you
