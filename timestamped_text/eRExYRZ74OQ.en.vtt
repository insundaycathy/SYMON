00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.430
If a scientist created a virus that killed
and mutated everyone into Darkseekers except

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.620
you, the last surviving virologist, what would
you do?

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.540
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
Dr. Neville, see if we can make better decisions,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.359
and ultimately attempt to beat the Darkseekers
in, I Am Legend.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.640
If you think you have a better way, let me
know in the comments!

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.789

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.230
We start out following the news, with Dr.
Alice Krippin giving us the skinny on her

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:38.900
new bio-weapon against diseases.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:52.440
Dr. Krippin mentions that her cancer-killing
virus was created by re-engineering the measles

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.990
virus, and that there have been 10,009 clinical
trials in humans so far, all of whom are cancer-free

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.990
now.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.880
It seems crazy and reckless, but it’s not.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.110
This is called oncolytic virotherapy, and,
get ready for it, clinical trials testing

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.220
a re-engineered measles virus as an experimental
cancer therapy is currently underway.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.420
It’s not as dangerous as you might think
though.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.250
The virus is attenuated to only be able to
replicate inside of cancer cells.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.909
Once the cancer is gone, the virus dies off.

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.030
The measles virus is a good oncolytic platform
because it’s inherently more selective and

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.420
potent against cancer cells, the vast majority
of the world’s population has been vaccinated

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.590
for it’s dangerous effects, and it’s airborne
and bodily fluids transmission methods can

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.750
be restricted.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.159
It isn’t without risks though, and one of
the main goals of OV creation is limiting

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.090
the spread and transmission of them.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.170
They usually have containment measures, monitoring,
and contingency plans implemented.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.280
But for viruses like measles where there’s
already a widespread population immunity,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.520
it can be considered unnecessary.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.780
While OV’s are generally repurposed from
genetically stable viruses, like measles,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.281
mutations that cause viruses to gain new cell
tropisms or lose restriction factors is a

00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:10.880
significant concern.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.360
Due to this evolutionary capacity present
in OV’s, safety kill-switches that are engineered

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.069
into the virus’s genome are being developed.

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.310
These kill-switches aren’t reliable for
the same reason that caused us to create them

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.590
in the first place, mutations.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.340
According to the FDA’s clinical trial phases,
this virus is in Phase 4, so it has completed

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.870
years of testing in humans.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.980
They should know about any dangerous effects
of this OV by now, so how did everything go

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.980
wrong?

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.760
My best guess is that a black swan mutation
occurred, re-activating previously terminated

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.650
pathology and inactivating kill-switches.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.380
A pre-existing viral immunity can seriously
hinder efficacy of the OV, which is the case

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.600
with measles vaccinations, so it’s possible
that Dr. Krippin and her team chose to alter

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.849
the OV to bypass this immunity, increasing
the risk of an epidemic spread.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.690
This mutated virus could easily jump containment
because measle’s is one of the most infectious

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.490
diseases in the world.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.690
The Krippin Virus outbreak wasn’t caused
by sheer recklessness, it was just insanely

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.690
unlucky.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.900
Three years later, we see that the world was
ravaged by the virus, and nature is starting

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.050
to consume human civilization.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.550
It would appear that containment and contingency
plans had failed, but hey, at least they cured

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.550
cancer.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.580
Unless you were a part of a tribe living in
the Amazon rainforest, this virus would be

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.750
inescapable.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.660
Since this is 3 years post outbreak, you,
or I should say, your corpse, would be decomposed

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.520
into a pile of bones by now, with maggots
having picked off the last remaining pieces

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.110
of flesh attached to your skeleton.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:56.200
NYC is really peaceful now, and to think,
all we had to do was get rid of 8 million

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.200
people.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.690
Speaking of, where are all the 8 million skeletons?

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.550
Oh right, the PG-13 god lifted them all to
Heaven.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.910
I’d like to see an R-rated version where
Will Smith is trudging through thousands and

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.770
thousands of bones littered all throughout
the streets and buildings.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.769
We start out following Dr. Robert Neville,
a military virologist who is tearing up the

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.430
streets in a Shelby Mustang with an AR15 in
his lap and German Shepherd in the side seat.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.150
Yep, this is how I would envision myself in
the apocalypse if I ever made it that far.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.430
If you watched my other I Am Legend video
where I talk about How to Beat Dr. Neville

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.970
as the Darkseekers, you’ll see why Neville
surviving this long is highly unlikely.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.880
As we’ll later see, the Darkseekers, which
are the infected that turned rabid instead

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.330
of dead, well, surprisingly they like the
dark.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.800
Knowing this, I'd try to swipe some NVG’s,
or better yet, Thermal goggles off the military.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.000
The virus doesn’t seem to have infected
animals, which makes sense because measles

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.070
is not spread by animals.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.660
Hunting wild animals drive-by style with a
supercharged v8 muscle car seems impractical,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.720
but this is 3 years into surviving alone and
looks fun as hell.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.300
Neville failed to bag a deer in his car, so
he tries the stealth approach.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.100
I’m not a hunter, but from what I've read,
I highly doubt you could sneak up within rock

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.100
throwing distance off a wild deer like that,
especially with his rifle parts clacking,

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.500
footsteps, smell, and his dog.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.220
At least he’s not directly downwind.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.710
Deer traps or just waiting for a deer to cross
your path would be more effective than chasing

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.070
it through the city.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.020
Without humans around, the animal population
would explode so it shouldn’t be too hard

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.090
to catch one.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.430
Looks like the lioness was the more effective
hunter this time.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.060
Maybe this was his first encounter with the
lions, but knowing they are out here now,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.669
I’d be more cautious roaming the streets
now.

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.930
Neville did decently well here, as you are
supposed to slowly back away with your front

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.130
toward the lion.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.910
If you’re wondering where all the deer and
wild animals came from, New York City has

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.130
three major zoos that they could have come
from.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.270
The zoo’s also house grizzly bears and snow
leopards, might be a good idea to stop by

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.630
the zoo and see what animals escaped or died.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.240
His watch beeps, indicating sun-down is approaching.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.120
And he knows they mostly come out at night,
mostly.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.960
His alarm is set for 5:23, why not a nicer
number like 5:25, he’s clearly losing it

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.960
mentally.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.860
Since the sun goes down at around 8pm in NYC,
he’s got 2.5 hours to get home before he

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.220
becomes the hunted.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.759
2.5 hours is good, because if he hit a deer
or his car broke down, he could walk the entire

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:34.050
length of Manhattan before sun-down.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.050
Neville returns to his home, which has IED’s
surrounding it for defense.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.470
He uses vinegar to block his scent so that
the Dark Seekers can't track him down, which

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.880
is good because our human scent can linger
on the ground or things we touch for many

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.880
days.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.670
What I'm confused about is how do the darkseekers
have that good of smell, and how did Neville

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:52.670
know about it.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.530
He must've been lucky enough to witness their
capabilities early on, or else they’d have

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:57.630
found and killed him.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.380
Neville’s got an excellent stock of food
and the canned food can pretty much last his

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.449
lifetime if stocked correctly.

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:08.720
In addition to bagging the occasional deer,
he won’t be in danger of starving.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.990
According to the fridge poster, Neville was
a top military virologist working on the KV,

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.200
which could explain how he knew about a mutation
causing a heightened sense of smell.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.910
During Sam’s bath, the second beep on his
watch happens, signaling lockdown.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:30.170
How are you not going to get a neck crook
sleeping like that.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.590
Sleeping in the bathtub right next to the
window isn’t a good idea.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.569
Sound transmits through windows much more
than walls.

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:41.419
Brick wall has a sound transmission class
rating of around 50, which blocks most loud

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:46.830
noises, whereas single pane windows are around
20 which won’t even block a normal voice.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.990
If Sam gets spooked and starts barking when
a darkseeker wanders close by, it’s over.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.599
His primary defense is not being found.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:59.080
Once they know his location, the Darkseekers
or any determined attacker could make entry

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.500
to his home with enough time, energy, and
some primitive tools.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.960
Neville’s setup is basically a brick house,
armored windows, some traps outside, and various

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.670
guns placed around the house.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.870
With his military knowledge, all the time
in the world, endless amounts of supplies,

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.620
I think he can do better.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.419
Armored windows are good, but you’d also
want to armor the interior walls that joined

00:08:19.419 --> 00:08:24.310
your house with the adjacent house, as well
as soundproof the house with acoustic sound

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.310
barriers.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.650
What he’s missing is a dedicated safe room
if shit gets real.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:33.379
He could repurpose one of his rooms and build
a reinforced concrete bunker with a door that

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:38.499
leads directly outside into the sunlight,
so if he is caught, he can safely exit at

00:08:38.499 --> 00:08:39.499
sunrise.

00:08:39.499 --> 00:08:44.110
With sunlight coming within 8 hours max, you
don’t really need much in the way of food,

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.190
water, supplies, plumbing, or power.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:50.220
Neville has a PTSD flashback to the start
of the outbreak, where he is trying to get

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.149
his family out of NYC before the military
quarantine.

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:58.959
He remarks that the virus went airborne, suggesting
that they did originally restrict this transmission

00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:05.389
method, but that the virus had mutated.

00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:14.899
Yah, finding a cure, mass producing and distributing
it ain’t gonna happen in two weeks.

00:09:14.899 --> 00:09:19.050
Staying in Manhattan because it’s ground
zero for the virus makes no sense either.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.420
Finding the primary case, or patient zero,
is irrelevant.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:27.009
You already know the cause of the disease,
how it came into existence, and how it broke

00:09:27.009 --> 00:09:28.009
containment.

00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:31.689
It won’t help you find a cure at all, but
even if it did, it’s going to be tough to

00:09:31.689 --> 00:09:36.269
continue your research with most of the Manhattan
residents turning into zombies.

00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:40.800
With the severity of the pandemic, he should
have been evacuated to a nearby Navy ship,

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.140
like the Arleigh-Burke class destroyer which
is stationed in Norfolk, Virginia where he

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.480
could meet up with Doctor Rachel Scott.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.519
There they can either set up a makeshift lab
to continue research, or just get the hell

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:53.660
out of there and start a new society.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.369
Damn Will Smith was jacked.

00:09:55.369 --> 00:09:57.940
Treadmills indoors are actually smart.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.680
You don't want to be at the last round of
your sprints when shit hits the fan.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.819
You need all the energy, alertness, and prowess
possible, especially with fucking lions using

00:10:06.819 --> 00:10:09.470
Manhattan as a hunting ground during the day.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.569
Normally I'd say get out into the countryside
and only make occasional trips into the city

00:10:13.569 --> 00:10:19.350
for supplies, but he's trying to use his own
innate immunity to find a cure in his basement

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.519
virology lab.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:26.619
I think it’s important to make the distinction
of prophylactic vs therapeutic vaccines.

00:10:26.619 --> 00:10:30.889
Prophylactic is used to bolster the immune
system with antibodies ready to fight a potential

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:32.209
threat.

00:10:32.209 --> 00:10:36.439
Therapeutic is more synonymous with cure,
as they are used to treat those already infected

00:10:36.439 --> 00:10:40.209
with a virus by enhancing the immune system’s
targeting or response abilities.

00:10:40.209 --> 00:10:44.790
He is not working on a prophylactic vaccine
because it’s impossible.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:49.040
To produce a vaccine from someone’s blood
a person needs to have the correct antibodies

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.009
in their system, which know how to fight the
infection.

00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:56.549
Because Neville has innate genetic immunity,
he will never have had an adaptive immune

00:10:56.549 --> 00:11:01.439
response to the virus which would’ve produced
Krippin antibodies in his blood.

00:11:01.439 --> 00:11:05.129
Also there’s no point - As Neville points
out later, you could count with your fingers

00:11:05.129 --> 00:11:08.189
the amount of uninfected people without an
innate immunity.

00:11:08.189 --> 00:11:12.860
Even if you could create a vaccine, a highly
mutable disease like KV will have a very low

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.230
efficacy rate.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:18.009
If that wasn’t a problem, how would you
even get the vaccine to these people?

00:11:18.009 --> 00:11:22.730
If for some reason if he stumbled into a large
group of survivors that didn’t have a genetic

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:27.899
immunity, he should start with studying Darkseeker
blood and work to find or develop a weakened

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:32.439
form of the virus that could be used as an
immunological trigger, which coincidentally

00:11:32.439 --> 00:11:35.179
is how the measles vaccine was created.

00:11:35.179 --> 00:11:40.459
Neville is instead trying to reverse the Darkseekers
condition by creating a therapeutic vaccine

00:11:40.459 --> 00:11:42.410
based on his own innate immunity.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.670
This is also impossible, as the immunity is
based on his genetics.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:51.509
You could theoretically create a cure by enhancing
everyone’s innate immune system, but that’s

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:53.300
not what Neville is talking about.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:58.379
Funnily enough, oncolytic viruses fall under
the therapeutic vaccine umbrella, so he could

00:11:58.379 --> 00:12:03.899
create another Neville OV which would destroy
the existing Krippin OV everyone’s infected

00:12:03.899 --> 00:12:04.899
with.

00:12:04.899 --> 00:12:06.509
Like fighting fire with fire.

00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:11.059
Why not give it a shot, it’s not like you
can mess up and kill 7 billion people again.

00:12:11.059 --> 00:12:15.100
Neville is not using the proper methods to
create a cure, but it doesn’t matter if

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.100
he was.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.949
The proper methods for creating a cure for
this disease would be in the realm of bleeding

00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:21.639
edge research.

00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:25.769
Considering this movie was in 2007 as well,
I don’t think Neville will be making any

00:12:25.769 --> 00:12:30.839
breakthroughs by himself in a basement lab
with no internet to research from or colleagues

00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:31.920
to work with.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.959
Even if he did develop a magical cure that
worked, there’s the massive problem of mass

00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:40.760
manufacturing it and forcibly distributing
it to the darkseekers who want to murder and

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.760
eat you.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.040
These aren’t your sickly people on hospital
beds.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.079
You can’t just dart them with the cure either,
because the other darkseekers will just brutally

00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:49.079
murder them.

00:12:49.079 --> 00:12:53.459
You need to bring them back to a hospital
to restrain, monitor, and keep them safe from

00:12:53.459 --> 00:12:54.899
other darkseekers.

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:58.569
As impossible as it is, working to find a
cure may be the only thing keeping Neville

00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:01.220
sane in this post-apocalyptic world.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.959
Since the cure idea is ludicrous, it’s probably
time to load the truck with supplies and head

00:13:05.959 --> 00:13:07.019
out into the countryside.

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:12.329
With how easy it is to find Neville as a Darkseeker,
even without making a mistake it's just a

00:13:12.329 --> 00:13:14.239
matter of time before they find him.

00:13:14.239 --> 00:13:16.869
Neville is too stubborn and determined though.

00:13:16.869 --> 00:13:22.029
Locking the door makes sense, it would ensure
that no darkseekers were hiding or sleeping

00:13:22.029 --> 00:13:25.920
in the store somewhere, because they'd have
had to break down the windows or door.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.209
I've always thought that the most underestimated
thing in the apocalypse was entertainment

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:31.649
so you don't go crazy.

00:13:31.649 --> 00:13:37.079
He's lucky these physical stores still exist,
in the future when it's all Netflix and digital,

00:13:37.079 --> 00:13:40.119
there won't be much physical movies, music,
or games available.

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:44.230
If you’re planning on making a doomsday
shelter, you might want to get a 100 terabyte

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.730
storage device and load up movies, games,
and music.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.980
You could put enough movies on it to last
you a literal lifetime, or you might be able

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.199
to fit call of duty modern warfare on it.

00:13:54.199 --> 00:13:57.299
He’s got his map, crossing off locations
he’s looted already.

00:13:57.299 --> 00:13:59.680
I don’t see any pie slicing.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.379
Ideally you’d want to clear the entire house
before letting your guard down.

00:14:03.379 --> 00:14:07.350
I also think he should’ve rigged a UV light
attachment for his weapon.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:11.449
Having a gun is still necessary for putting
them down fast, from a distance, or through

00:14:11.449 --> 00:14:15.019
barriers, but the lamps would be a good close
range mob deterrent.

00:14:15.019 --> 00:14:19.639
There’s another newspaper saying that infected
dogs can come out at dusk, probably because

00:14:19.639 --> 00:14:22.759
their fur gives them some protection against
UV rays.

00:14:22.759 --> 00:14:26.209
I guess KV can be transmitted to animals.

00:14:26.209 --> 00:14:30.410
Neville is broadcasting a sos message on all
am frequencies.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:31.449
This is a good call.

00:14:31.449 --> 00:14:36.290
AM is used instead of FM because the lower
frequency band means the signal can travel

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.970
longer distances and penetrate better through
barriers like buildings.

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:44.660
He’s broadcasting at midday everyday, but
he should also try to have the radio automatically

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.589
broadcast a message at night.

00:14:46.589 --> 00:14:51.439
In daytime, the AM signal can travel maybe
100 miles, but at nighttime the signal can

00:14:51.439 --> 00:14:57.079
travel hundreds of miles by reflection from
the ionosphere, a phenomenon called "skywave"

00:14:57.079 --> 00:14:58.079
propagation.

00:14:58.079 --> 00:15:02.259
This would at least triple or quadruple the
radius of his SOS message.

00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:06.379
Like we saw earlier, there’s no need to
chase down a deer, nor would you even be able

00:15:06.379 --> 00:15:07.379
to physically.

00:15:07.379 --> 00:15:12.230
Neville’s dog, Sam, chases the buck into
a dark building that likely has darkseekers

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.569
napping inside.

00:15:13.569 --> 00:15:18.290
Honestly, if he didn’t go after Sam and
Sam got killed, Neville would lose it mentally

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.290
and die.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:24.350
Chronic loneliness can lead to a 15 year shorter
lifespan on average, and this is based on

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:28.480
a study where human civilization hasn’t
been wiped out with you being the last man

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.480
on Earth.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.419
It’s safe to say that his dog is the only
thing holding him together, and his survival

00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:36.019
literally depends on Sam’s survival.

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:39.979
This would be a good time to have the Thermal
goggles with UV lights on your weapon.

00:15:39.979 --> 00:15:44.569
Or if you could rig something together like
in Riddick Pitch Black but with UV light tubs.

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:49.199
In some cases, you can see recent footprints
with thermal goggles, which could indicate

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:58.309
where darkseekers are or where your dog went.

00:15:58.309 --> 00:16:01.139
Hopefully that was the deer, and not Sam.

00:16:01.139 --> 00:16:06.679
The hand over the light seems to add some
suspense I guess, but the Pentagon MD3R laser

00:16:06.679 --> 00:16:10.370
light he has can be activated with a pressure
pad on the foregrip.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.999
He’s using a 4x sight called an ACOG, which
isn’t ideal for urban environments where

00:16:14.999 --> 00:16:17.119
you’re room clearing most of the time.

00:16:17.119 --> 00:16:22.290
Adding a canted red dot or swapping it for
an eotech with 3x magnifier would be a better

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.759
option, and should've been accessible to him.

00:16:24.759 --> 00:16:26.799
Fuck that tension when he see’s the deer.

00:16:26.799 --> 00:16:31.639
In his pursuit of Sam, he runs into a group
of darkseekers in a huddle, sleeping while

00:16:31.639 --> 00:16:34.300
standing to hibernate supposedly.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.839
Like with the zombies in Cargo, why not lie
down instead?

00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:42.899
He finds Sam and manages to not run into a
dead end in this dark maze of a building.

00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:47.160
Neville jumps from the second or third story
with a darkseeker jumping out after him.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.079
The darkseeker’s body breaks his fall and
burns to death within seconds.

00:16:51.079 --> 00:16:55.160
Neville lays a trap to get another specimen
for his clinical trials, and one takes the

00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:11.600
bait.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:24.240
Seems like snaring a darkseeker pissed off
the other members of the hive.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.569
Well that’s fucking terrifying.

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:28.140
I’d have blasted that dude right there.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.190
The Alpha retreats back into the shadows and
Neville transports the subject back to his

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.190
lab.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:37.290
He injects her with his breakthrough therapeutic
vaccine, which fails, like the many cure’s

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.730
he’s tried in the past.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:43.169
Neville remarks in his logs that recent blood
tests confirm he’s still immune to the Krippin

00:17:43.169 --> 00:17:46.660
Virus, while canines are immune to the airborne
strain only.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:51.200
That’s a good move, with how mutable KV
is it’s important to continuously test your

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.789
immunity to it, but you might also want to
be wearing better PPE in case the airborne

00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:57.760
virus becomes infectious to you.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.320
It also doesn’t seem like a good idea to
have been petting your dog after your close

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.769
encounter earlier though.

00:18:02.769 --> 00:18:08.350
He also says that behaviorally he thinks the
darkseekers are ignoring basic survival instincts

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:11.330
due to declining brain function and food scarcity.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:16.130
Or maybe they have a social structure, and
got pissed when you snared one of their people.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.440
Sounds human-ish to me.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.620
Neville has another flashback to their escape
in the initial outbreak.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.809
I’ve said it before and i’ll say it again.

00:18:22.809 --> 00:18:26.159
If you live in NYC and something like this
happens, you’re dead.

00:18:26.159 --> 00:18:28.990
If I was living in NYC, I'd get a paramotor.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.980
If shit goes down, you can go to the roof
and fly off it and out of the city.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.860
It's a pro survivor move you’ll only hear
about here.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.840
Going for the bridge gates like the other
8 million infected and panicking people isn’t

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.110
a good idea, but Neville has a military escort.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.500
At the evacuation points they are using eye
scanners to detect capillary damage in the

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:56.870
eye’s.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:08.210
Wow, what an effective testing tool.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:12.030
By now the virus is spreading like wildfire,
people are turning into darkseekers, and the

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.789
military is blowing up bridges with missiles.

00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:19.350
If the threat is that severe, you wouldn’t
be using a low accuracy testing tool which

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.720
is letting the infected slip out of the city,
you would quarantine it immediately.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.720
Nobody out.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.049
For VIP’s like Neville who’s a top military
virologist, you don’t have them run for

00:19:29.049 --> 00:19:33.350
the border like everyone else, you evacuate
them immediately and then quarantine them

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:37.000
at the secure destination, like the Navy ship
I mentioned earlier.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.610
Neville’s driving home at sundown per usual,
but he sees Fred in a place he’s not supposed

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:42.660
to be at.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.810
Fred's head turning is just Neville’s hallucination
from personifying them so much.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:51.460
A sane mind would recognize this as a trap,
but Neville not only is underestimating their

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.269
intelligence, but has clearly lost it mentally.

00:19:54.269 --> 00:19:58.480
Getting snared, banging his head knocking
him unconscious, the fall, getting shived

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.390
by his own knife, this evening isn’t going
well.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.450
He needs to get his ass moving though.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:07.240
He tries to pull the knife out, but actually
it's better to leave the knife in because

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.330
pulling it out could allow cut blood vessels
that are being squeezed or blocked by the

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:17.909
knife to begin bleeding profusely.

00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:22.810
With this Darkseeker utilizing dogs to get
him, it’s clear Neville seriously underestimated

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.480
them in his behavioral assessments.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.080
He almost gets his throat ripped out but Sam
fights off another dog and tackles the one

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.550
attacking Neville.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.539
Unfortunately, Sam got bit.

00:20:32.539 --> 00:20:33.990
God damn this is hard to watch.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:37.559
Neville quickly brings Sam back to his home
and injects her with the potential cure that

00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:43.190
appeared successful on a test rat, but the
compound is unsurprisingly ineffective.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:47.090
Seconds later, Sam becomes fiercely aggressive
and attempts to bite Neville.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:52.120
To save himself and spare Sam the pain and
suffering of being a canine darkseeker, Neville

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.910
is forced to strangle her.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:21:00.049
I’m gonna go hug my dog now.

00:21:00.049 --> 00:21:04.419
Sure, Neville could have restrained Sam until
he found his fictional cure, but I think he

00:21:04.419 --> 00:21:06.679
wanted to spare his dog the agony.

00:21:06.679 --> 00:21:10.299
The emptiness, loneliness, the irreversibility,
is just crushing.

00:21:10.299 --> 00:21:14.220
I don’t know how much willpower he has left
to survive at this point.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:18.919
Neville goes full suicidal rage mode trying
to take as many down with him as possible,

00:21:18.919 --> 00:21:22.570
before he’s killed by the Alpha, he’s
rescued by another survivor who heard his

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:23.950
call on the radio.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.549
If only she came a day earlier.

00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:30.820
Before slipping into unconsciousness, he manages
to tell her his house address and that she

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:35.320
needs to keep driving until dawn so the darkseekers
can’t track them home.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.980
Flashback and his wife and son are killed
in a helicopter crash because another heli

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.980
flew into them.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.230
Thanks brain, for that lovely dream.

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:47.350
He wakes up, and his rescuer had patched up
his knife wound, given him some antibiotics,

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.350
and fixed him breakfast.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.889
This woman is a god damn angel.

00:21:50.889 --> 00:21:55.120
Neville gets pissed when Anna gives him what
he thinks is false hope, that there’s a

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.370
survivor colony in Vermont.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:01.309
Anna says that the virus can’t survive the
cold up there, which is misguided.

00:22:01.309 --> 00:22:06.509
Cold temperatures can decrease the viral activity,
but inversely can increase the survivability

00:22:06.509 --> 00:22:11.360
of measle’s like viruses, but the virus
will persist if it’s inside a host regardless

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.360
of weather.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.879
The incidence of the KV disease is more likely
to be affected by the amount of sunlight exposure

00:22:16.879 --> 00:22:20.029
in an area, as well as human behavior and
density.

00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:23.289
Anna is really quick on the draw, that was
actually impressive.

00:22:23.289 --> 00:22:28.129
Ethan was quick to draw a knife too, good
to see he’s not a typical useless or rebellious

00:22:28.129 --> 00:22:29.129
child.

00:22:29.129 --> 00:22:32.629
Neville starts the nightly lockdown procedure,
and Anna tells him that the next morning they

00:22:32.629 --> 00:22:36.279
are heading to the survivor colony.

00:22:36.279 --> 00:22:48.420
Yah the 
numbers don’t look good, but there could

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.630
be a survivor colony.

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:53.600
It’s only a 4 hour drive to Vermont - at
least check it out.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:58.960
Even if you stupidly wanted to continue research
at your ground zero, you could cooperate with

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.830
them, and cure your loneliness.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:04.870
Going to Vermont is off the table anyways,
because the darkseekers managed to track them

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:05.990
back home.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:09.789
Based on the numbers, you’re potentially
dealing with thousands of darkseekers.

00:23:09.789 --> 00:23:14.180
Those window barriers are probably meant to
prevent darkseekers from randomly breaking

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.700
in, not for stopping a determined attack.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.519
His setup was bound to fail.

00:23:18.519 --> 00:23:23.590
If you did want to do exterior light setups,
you’d want the light to have 360 degrees

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:27.159
of coverage so they couldn’t just walk up
behind the pole and take it down.

00:23:27.159 --> 00:23:30.490
His IED looked like C4 attached to fuel drums.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:34.090
It would have been much more effective to
tape ball bearings or nails on the outside

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.700
of the container to increase fragmentation.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:41.130
The blast killed a lot of them, but the Alpha
survived and tackles him to the ground.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:44.850
Instead of immediately snapping Neville’s
neck with his superhuman strength, he just

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:48.690
throws him around which gives Neville an opportunity
to fight back.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:53.100
Neville finds Anna hiding under the bed from
a darkseeker, grabs a pistol and pumps it

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.100
full of lead.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:58.580
A normal person can shrug off 9mm rounds in
the heat of battle through adrenaline if they

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.899
aren’t hit in critical locations.

00:24:00.899 --> 00:24:04.680
So these darkseekers aren’t going to be
phased until you hit something like the heart,

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.269
brain, or spine which will stop them instantly.

00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:10.960
This is when a dedicated safe room would come
in handy, just sayin.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.280
They just now realize the cure was working,
but they’re cornered in the basement so

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.999
production and distribution is going to be
tough.

00:24:18.999 --> 00:24:31.740
I don’t blame the darkseekers with not wanting
to be injected with another oncolytic virus.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.620
All hope is shattered with the plexiglass
barrier between them and the darkseekers being

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:36.620
broken down.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:41.190
It looks like he used an acrylic plexiglass
sheet for this containment room with how easily

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.389
it broke and how it shattered.

00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:47.650
Using this for containment of his darkseeker
patients was dumb considering how easily it

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:49.450
was broken by a few headbutts.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:54.150
He should’ve used 12mm thick polycarbonate
sheets instead, which are hundreds of times

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:56.759
stronger than glass and thin acrylic panes.

00:24:56.759 --> 00:25:00.690
The polycarbonate sheets flex, rebound, and
pretty much can’t be broken or shattered

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:02.020
with blunt objects.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:06.179
The darkseekers dropping their shoulder into
it, head butting it, punching it, or throwing

00:25:06.179 --> 00:25:08.169
shit at it will have zero effect.

00:25:08.169 --> 00:25:12.309
Neville, Anna, and Ethan would still be trapped
in there, but at least they wouldn’t be

00:25:12.309 --> 00:25:13.309
dead.

00:25:13.309 --> 00:25:16.960
Since he’s unable to reach the cure compound,
he pulls the blood of the cured darkseeker

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:21.960
which contains the antibodies, and tucks Anna
and Ethan into a coal chute.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:26.111
At dawn, they can crawl to the other end of
the chute which leads outside, and escape

00:25:26.111 --> 00:25:27.740
to Vermont with the cure.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.690
There’s room for Neville, but he knows that
the darkseekers won’t stop unless he kills

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:32.690
them.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.740
Apparently he keeps a grenade stashed in a
medical drawer next to a picture of his family.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:41.870
He says his goodbyes, pulls the pin, releases
the lever, and bombs the darkseekers.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:47.269
An M67 grenade wouldn’t create that fireball,
and with a kill radius of 5 meters it wouldn’t

00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:49.629
kill all of the darkseekers in that room either.

00:25:49.629 --> 00:25:51.480
Killing the alpha may be enough though.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.529
I really think he could’ve tossed the grenade
through a broken area of the barrier and then

00:25:55.529 --> 00:25:59.710
gotten into the coal chute in the 4-5 seconds
before the grenade went off.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:03.960
Anna and Ethan make it to the survivor colony
the next day, and hand off the cure.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.730
I looked up whether or not antibodies in a
blood sample would survive Anna and Ethan’s

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.110
journey, and it does seem like it would.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:14.970
Letting her in without running any tests is
dangerous, how do they know she’s not infected

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.999
or a carrier for the disease.

00:26:16.999 --> 00:26:20.440
The cure hand off seems like an achievement,
but it’s not.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.970
With the only living virologist and functioning
virology lab getting blown up, they don’t

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:28.519
have the means to store, study, or replicate
the cure.

00:26:28.519 --> 00:26:33.440
Let alone mass produce, distribute, and sustainably
incorporate the cured into your society.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.380
Also, that wall is ridiculous.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:39.490
There’s no way they got enough concrete
for it, or erected the walls without huge

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:40.990
cranes and trucks.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:42.110
The movie ends.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:45.090
Let’s recap how things could have gone down
differently.

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:49.940
The cure for cancer that Dr. Alice Krippin
created wasn’t reckless or crazy, they just

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.070
got extremely unlucky the virus mutated enough.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:57.419
The Navy should’ve secured a ship for Neville
to safely continue his research on, but with

00:26:57.419 --> 00:27:00.150
how fast the outbreak spread, maybe they couldn’t.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:03.419
Neville’s family’s death wasn’t really
preventable.

00:27:03.419 --> 00:27:07.740
With how impossible it was for Neville to
create a cure, it’d be entirely reasonable

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:12.799
to head into the countryside to start a new
life, and who knows, he might run into the

00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:13.799
survivor colony.

00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:18.460
Doing so would’ve prevented Sam and Neville’s
death, and all the darkseekers, not that we

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.659
care about them though.

00:27:19.659 --> 00:27:24.309
If he did want to continue pursuing a cure,
building a dedicated safe house would’ve

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:27.620
prevented the situation where Neville was
forced to frag himself.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:31.409
This means Neville would’ve survived, though
Sam still would’ve died.

00:27:31.409 --> 00:27:35.210
With Neville alive, the cure would have a
much better chance at being replicated and

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:38.409
distributed than in the hands of the common
folk at the colony.

00:27:38.409 --> 00:27:41.360
I still doubt that the cure could be effectively
utilized.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:46.440
It’s more likely that the immune human population
will grow, and the darkseekers, like other

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.840
less intelligent species, will be rolled packed
into a parking lot for the humans.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.400
I’d say that the tragic events that unfolded
in this movie could have been prevented, so

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.740
this movie is beaten.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:01.440
Thanks for watching, and remember, there is
no greater danger than underestimating your

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.179
opponent.
