00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.580
Welcome to Cinema Summary, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.600
Today’s movie
is a ghost story that’s unlike any other.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.620
Close the curtains, and turn off the lights.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.900
This is The Others.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.210
The movie takes place in a lovely home in Jersey, Britain (not New Jersey)

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.180
In it a woman, Grace Stewart, screams herself awake

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.580
and is then relieved to find that her  nightmare is over.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.820
The real nightmare is how messy the whole
place is

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.940
and sure enough 3 people apply to work as servants

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.000
Bertha Mills (right), Edmund Tuttle the Gardener (left), and Lydia who can't talk (middle)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.300
They’re replacements for her old servants
who mysteriously left

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.000
without even taking their pay.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.500
After that she lays down some rules

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.200
Doors need to be locked if new doors are going to be opened

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.590
Noise should be kept at minimum, no radios,
tellies, or piano playing since Grace gets migraines

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.380
and there is no electricity, just kerosene
lamps.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.840
As Grace leads them to her children's room

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.500
she has her new hired helpers close curtains
throughout the house.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.860
The atmosphere is spooky, dark, and eerie.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.060
when she introduces them to her children: Nicholas and Anne

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.200
While Lydia prepares the kids breakfast, Grace
takes Bertha aside and explains to her that

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.000
the children are extremely sensitive to light so much that

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.660
they could have a deadly reaction if exposed to sunlight.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.140
During breakfast the two kids bicker and argue with each other:

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.140
how the toast is terrible, how they miss their old nannies

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.260
and Nicholas wonders if their dad is coming back

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.560
Before it gets out of hand, Bertha gets them
to stop talking about it but Anne hints

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.080
at something bad that happened, when their
old servants left.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.340
Mom went a bit mad.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.210
An angry Nicolas is quick to deny this but
they shut up as Grace enters, having another

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.700
private talk with Betha.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.280
The Postman should have delivered the mail.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.180
But he didn’t.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.500
He hadn’t even picked up the letters she sent

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.300
so how did Bertha and her colleagues find out

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.470
about this place?

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.370
Bertha confesses that they were just stopping
by, big houses need lots of maids after all

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.640
and they also used to work at the house.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Before Bertha leaves

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.370
Grace tells Bertha that she shouldn’t believe everything

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.100
the kids say

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.880
when she returns to her kitchens she
ominously hears Anne say “It did happen”.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.000
for Grace, Christianity is a big thing as is telling the truth

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.760
since according to Grace, liars go to limbo

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.040
something that scares Nicholas but not Anne

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.520
when ordered to study alone, Nicholas tells Grace that he's scared of ghosts

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.000
Grace brushes off Nicolas’s concerns, sending
Anne off to study in the piano room.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.420
while he stays

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.640
The two kids study while Grace talks with
Bertha.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.450
She asks if Lydia was born mute.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.270
to which Bertha tells Grace that Lydia wasn’t born
mute and leaves.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.830
before Grace  hears Nicolas crying.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.200
She rushes into the room only to find Nicolas
reading he wasn’t crying, and if he wasn’t

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.800
crying then.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.180
*Gasp*  Anne!

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.380
She rushes to Anne as she studies in the music
room.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.150
Anne says she wasn’t crying either, it was
that boy Victor.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.480
Anne tried to get him to leave her alone,
but he wouldn’t stop crying.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.460
She doesn’t really like Victor,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.000
telling Grace that Victor doesn’t like the house,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.980
and that his dad is a pianist.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.320
Anne claims that Victor's father is having a showing
of the house and Victor left through that

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.740
door, a door that should be locked.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.060
Grace chews out Bertha and Lydia, asking them
if they left the door unlocked.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.380
Bertha tells Grace that Lydia doesn’t have
a key and that Grace had already seen Bertha

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.000
in the hall

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.840
Grace bites back in defense, she’d never
leave it unlocked!

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.400
She cares too much for her kids.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.095
Not that anyone said that she didn’t

00:02:51.095 --> 00:02:51.760
in the middle of the night

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.670
Anne wakes up Nicolas.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.400
The curtain is open!

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.100
Anne insist that Victor did it

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.000
and tries to prove that Victor is real

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.600
by telling him to stop hiding.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.390
Nicolas is too spooked to look, so Anne takes
matters into her own hands.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.540
We don't see anyone else, and it looks like
Anne is pranking Nicolas until she tells Victor

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.050
to touch Nicolas’s cheek.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.660
suddenly a hand comes down

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.620
Nicolas’s scream wakes up Grace, who rushes
in to their room.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.130
Lashing out at Anne who is quick to say it
wasn’t her fault.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.170
So, Anne is punished for lying and tricking
Nicolas, setting up an argument between mother

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.190
and daughter.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.640
Grace doesn’t believe Anne’s story about
Victor so Grace talks about Limbo

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.760
and how children who lie are sent there.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.080
Anne firmly rejects this: since Anne was baptized,
she can’t go to Limbo.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.050
Even Grace is impressed by this.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.760
so Anne is punished again to recite the Bible.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.580
for talking back and lying

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.820
Grace complains to Bertha about Lydia

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.280
and her running around

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.380
Lydia doesn’t need to do that, and

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.400
it’s beginning to sound like 3 people are
up there.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.070
Bertha takes that as her cue to leave.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.000
Left by herself, Grace hears a noise again, it sounds
like running feet

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.600
and something heavy moved around.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.860
Cross at Lydia for being obnoxiously loud,
she leaves but is surprised when she sees

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.180
Bertha and Lydia are outside

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.020
Then who is up there?

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.140
Grace asks Anne if she heard the noise, who
says she didn’t, but Grace hears it again.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.380
Asking Anne one more time, the girl reluctantly
points to a room.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.430
A room that should have no lights on, Grace
checks out the room: full of covered belongings

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.430
and junk, the only thing she can hear are
her footsteps until she hears whispers.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.700
Voices are audibly heard.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.680
Freaking out she tears off the sheets until
she spots a door closing in the reflection.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.430
Rushing out she only finds Anne, who tells
her that 3 people left.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.660
They claim that they now owned the house and
that they would tear down the curtains.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.300
Grace has a frantic conversation with Bertha,
telling her how she heard a boy and 2 women

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.060
talking together who she couldn’t even
see.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.909
Anne shows her a drawing of the people she
saw: a dad, a mom, Victor, and a old woman.

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.840
She numbers them by how many times she’s seen them.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.820
and she’s seen the old woman the most, an old
woman that Victor believes is a witch.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.040
Grace brings out the shotgun, going around
the house along with the others to find the

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.700
intruders to no avail.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.960
In the junk room, Grace finds a 19th-century
so-called "book of the dead", a photo album

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.780
of mourning portrait photos of deceased family
members, with some missing pages.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.960
The reason for the book according to Bertha,
is that the spirits of the dead would be restful

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.270
and sent off if they had their death photo
taken.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.540
Much to Grace’s skepticism.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.700
That quiet night, Grace and Bertha talk, when
the conversation turns to Bertha’s work

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.880
experience in the house.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.139
Bertha explains that she quit, much like many
others due to an outbreak of tuberculosis.

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.250
A time that may or may not have made Lydia
mute.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.800
Their conversation done, Grace enters the
children’s room, asking Anne for forgiveness.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.640
and before she leaves, Nicolas asks when Dad will
be back to which she can only reassure him

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.719
that one day he will be back.

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:32.439
That night, Grace witnesses a piano playing
itself and becomes convinced that the house

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.600
may be haunted.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.340
The next day, Grace runs outside in search of the local priest to bless the house.

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.901
Before leaving, Grace instructs Tuttle to
check a small nearby cemetery to see if there

00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:43.600
was a family buried there who had a little
boy named Victor.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.960
At Bertha’s behest, Tuttle covers the gravestones
with autumn leaves, who comments that Grace

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.610
thinks the house is haunted and the two seem
to know more than they’re letting on.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.919
While going to see the priest, Grace runs
into her husband Charles, who she thought

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.040
had been killed in the war.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.360
She takes him back home where Charles greets
his children, but he doesn’t come down for

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:00.369
dinner.

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:03.369
There an argument breaks out between Anna
and Grace over the mysterious intruders.

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:08.979
Anne tears up, going to the kitchen, where
Bertha tells Anne that Bertha also sees the intruders.

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:11.439
Hinting that there are going to be changes
around the house.

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:14.180
That night in the garden shed where Tuttle
lives, the servants speak vaguely about knowing

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.060
who the intruders are, and how Grace forgot something
about her own family

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.919
Later on, Anne tries on a white gown with
help from her mother, who goes back to check on

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:22.919
Charles.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.980
The man is silent, so Grace returns to find
Anne playing with a puppet except it isn’t

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.060
Anne.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.060
Grace is shocked to see an old women wearing
the dress.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.340
What have you done with my daughter!?

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.279
The woman speaks with her daughters voice.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.040
Insisting that Grace is confused.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.060
mad even.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.539
Grace attacks her, furiously asking what happened
to Anne.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.380
When the veil is torn, Grace sees that it
was Anne beneath it.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.540
Much to her shock.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.800
Anne runs away to Charles

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.750
who later asks Grace what happened 'That
Day'.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.129
Grace claims that she does not know exactly
what he’s talking about but recalls that

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:52.800
the servants left without giving notice and
without her husband there, she could not leave

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.720
the house.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.559
Meanwhile, Anne tells Nicholas that Grace
went mad in the same way that she did 'That

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.160
Day' but Nicholas still denies that ever happening.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.100
Back with Grace, she claims she would never
hurt her children.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.020
When Charles interjects that he must leave
for the front, even though Grace claims that

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:07.029
the war is over.

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:09.520
Charles cries when Grace tells him that she thinks that

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.520
he wanted to leave her, and the two embrace, laying motionless together in bed.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.800
The next morning he is gone again.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.680
The children wake up screaming as all the
curtains have disappeared.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.260
Grace moves the children into a room and blocks
out the light.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.640
She accuses the servants of removing the curtains
and banishes them at gunpoint.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.340
After leaving, an annoyed Bertha asks Tuttle
to uncover the gravestones.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.559
That night, as Grace searches for the curtains,
the children sneak outside and Anne discovers

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:38.509
a graveyard and realizes that these are the
servants' graves from years past.

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:42.550
At the same time, Grace finds a torn out photograph
from the photo album of portraits of the dead,

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.939
and is horrified to see her 3 servants there.

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:48.149
The servants appear and try to speak to the
children, who retreat.

00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:51.069
Grace rescues the children and tries to stop
the servants with the shotgun, but it

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:52.259
does nothing..

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:55.569
After rushing inside, Grace locks out the
servants and tells the children to hide upstairs

00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:56.569
in the bedroom.

00:07:56.569 --> 00:08:00.680
From outside, Bertha reveals that the three
servants died of tuberculosis more than 50

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.540
years ago and that the living and the dead
should learn to live together.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.820
Upstairs the old woman finds the children, who scream in terror

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.620
and leads Grace to rush upstairs

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.140
Guys.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:10.900
Stick with me,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.560
because things are going to get weird, really fast

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.060
starting with the fact that the old woman that found Nicholas and Anne

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.260
is the same woman that Anne drew a picture of

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.660
and that Victor thought was a witch

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:25.990
Grace discovers that the old woman, described
by Anne as an intruder, is in fact acting

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.430
as a medium in a séance with Victor's parents.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.909
The medium asks what happened to Anne and
Nicholas.

00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:34.240
The children's answers are written down by
the medium and read out by a man.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.220
It is revealed that Grace smothered the children
to death with a pillow on the day she "went

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:38.880
mad".

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.040
Get it? The kids are dead, they've been ghosts this whole time

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.080
and they were killed by their own mom and this

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.420
isn't even the weirdest thing

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.380
The children scream that they are not dead

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.140
and Grace, in denial, shakes the séance table

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.760
and rips the medium's papers.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:57.280
but Victor's family sees only the table shaking
and the papers being ripped

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.410
The cherry on top is that

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.930
Grace is also a ghost.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.440
This isn’t a ghost story

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.520
about the living being haunted
by the ghosts,

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.020
This

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.360
is a ghost story

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.080
where the ghosts

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.000
are being haunted

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.460
by the living!

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.920
Grace, now realizing herself as being the

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.860
spirit which the séance tried to contact,

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.920
remembers what happened "That Day"

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.060
after her husband went off to fight in the war and

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.960
never came back, she was left alone with

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.370
the kids, and lost her mind.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.480
She killed them and after that she shot herself with the shotgun.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:30.100
Later, when she "awoke" after killing her
kids, who were ‘alive’ (actually ghosts),

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.300
she assumed God had given her family a second
chance at life.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.000
The children, no longer photosensitive , can enjoy

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.860
now
that they know they’re ghosts

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.360
can enjoy playing in the sunlight.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.880
and although the property is again put up for sale,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.080
Grace and the children continue to inhabit the house.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.000
Waiting until the next family comes to live
with them.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.920
Thank you so much for watching, ladies and gentlemen!

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.020
I got to get out of here because it's feeling a little bit spooky here!
