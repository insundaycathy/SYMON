00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.200
have you ever been to an escape room it's&nbsp;
actually quite fun unless it's about life or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.440
death in this video we follow their&nbsp;
characters highlight their weaknesses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.920
and decide on better tactics to survive&nbsp;
and ultimately beat the game masters in

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.840
now the goal is to have everyone survive&nbsp;
which by the way is entirely possible now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.480
at the beginning of the movie we witnessed three&nbsp;
of the participants receiving a package containing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.080
a black cube which turns out to be a puzzle once&nbsp;
they solve it possible through multiple ways they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.360
find a ticket in it i find it quite interesting&nbsp;
to see the differences in temperament of each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.920
character while zoe is utterly intrigued by&nbsp;
solving it jason is just annoyed and wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.080
to get what's inside and ben well ben does it his&nbsp;
way i guess all the packages were sent from people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.280
they know and respect in one way or another&nbsp;
Zoey's for instance was sent by her professor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.160
and jason's by one of his clients this is&nbsp;
a small but crucial aspect as it evokes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.280
our protagonist's trust and therefore anything&nbsp;
that might be weird about receiving such package&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.280
is completely justified once the box opens each&nbsp;
one receives an invitation in form of a ticket&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.640
minos escape room is the sender and they have just&nbsp;
been invited to participate in an escape room to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.320
win 10 000 dollar now as everyone assembles in the&nbsp;
waiting room we get to meet the other protagonists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.800
after everyone introduces themselves it is safe&nbsp;
to say that all the characters have different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.320
motivations to participate while amanda mike&nbsp;
and ben are in it for the money zoey seems to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.360
participate for the sake of solving tricky&nbsp;
questions who would have thought and while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.120
jason seems to be in it for the sake of winning&nbsp;
danny well danny is just being danny i guess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.520
got to love this character though since the&nbsp;
game hasn't started and everyone is waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.480
ben tries to leave the room for a cigarette&nbsp;
just to realize the game has already begun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.680
now as a quick side note and something many&nbsp;
explained videos have actually missed the room was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.640
designed in a way that triggers the start of the&nbsp;
game by leaving the room itself implying nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.520
would have happened as long as no one tries to&nbsp;
leave but everyone would leave at some point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.720
if nothing happens pretty clever design now&nbsp;
as everyone starts looking around for clues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.480
the room starts to heat up they eventually&nbsp;
find the last piece of the puzzle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.440
and manage to escape to the next room before the&nbsp;
last one gets covered in flames i don't want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.160
go into full detail here as everyone survives&nbsp;
and there is not much else to figure out here

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.440
as they barely make it to the second room amanda&nbsp;
attempts to send out a message with danny's phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.920
but fails as there is no available&nbsp;
connection jason finds a key and ben&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.960
figures out the seven digit code needed to&nbsp;
unlock the cabin while they step outside and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.400
search for clues when he unknowingly activates an&nbsp;
ac system that chills the cold room even further&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.440
which is less than ideal in a room where the&nbsp;
temperature is already below the freezing point&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.520
to be precise here hypothermia is no joke and can&nbsp;
be deadly it hits when the body loses heat faster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.840
than it can produce and the body temperature falls&nbsp;
below 35 degrees celsius or 95 degree fahrenheit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.720
in a sub-zero environment with chill winds this&nbsp;
can happen within minutes our protagonists do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.720
not have much time left until death arrives while&nbsp;
looking for hints they find the following items&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.440
one winter jacket a fishing rod a magnet and&nbsp;
an ice fishing hole i think there is no need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.920
elaborate on the use of those items as it's very&nbsp;
obvious while they go fishing danny breaks through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.480
the ice and dies with him goes the phone and&nbsp;
the lighter which is just the tip of the iceberg&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.600
no pun intended here anyway they use the given&nbsp;
tools and find a solid block of ice with a key&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.480
in the middle of it the attempt to melt the block&nbsp;
of ice with their bare hands wouldn't even come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.680
to my mind it seemed a little odd especially&nbsp;
considering their circumstances and serious lack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.080
of time so before we save danny let's sum it up&nbsp;
real quick the temperature is sub-zero and falling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.120
plus there is chilly wind they lack warm clothing&nbsp;
and have to somehow get the key in a massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.040
block of ice plus they face serious threats of&nbsp;
hypothermia let's see how we save danny when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.320
danny broke through the ice amanda volunteered&nbsp;
to save him as a veteran it's safe to assume she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.400
knows how to evaluate dangerous situations and how&nbsp;
to rescue other people however jason's concerns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.600
were also appropriate diving into a frozen lake&nbsp;
without proper safety measurements could easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.840
result in her death so how can we save danny while&nbsp;
not risking to sacrifice amanda well why not use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.480
the fishing rod tieing around the torso or leg&nbsp;
of amanda while she goes diving for dany would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.840
have minimized her risk to die furthermore the&nbsp;
trace of the road appeared to be made out of metal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.720
which ensures durability an important aspect for&nbsp;
a task like this if they could come up with this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.400
idea in time and quickly act on it i think we can&nbsp;
assume danny would have survived all the tools&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.240
necessary for this rescue were available but let's&nbsp;
go back to the ice block even if then he survives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.560
the lighter would have been no help after&nbsp;
taking a dip in the lake surely we do have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.600
another pair of hands available to melt the ice&nbsp;
block but this solution is just not my cup of tea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.840
melting a block of ice of this size would take the&nbsp;
better half of an hour at this point in the movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.920
the thermometer showed zero fahrenheit or below&nbsp;
17 degrees celsius which goes without saying is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.280
pretty cold it's simply not a sustainable idea&nbsp;
to get the key that way the first idea to smash&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.680
the block against a tree which didn't work was&nbsp;
nevertheless a good try but let's assume all those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.080
were fake and they can't use them to break through&nbsp;
the ice is there still a chance to get the key&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.840
faster well i think so remember the wire fishing&nbsp;
trace let's use that one to saw through the ice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.520
surely we do need to overcome the metal frame&nbsp;
first but once there nothing stays in between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.960
anymore the solution in an ideal world of course&nbsp;
would have been that everyone stays in the cabin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.160
while only one looks for clues with one available&nbsp;
winter jacket time would have been no problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.560
amanda again as a war veteran would have&nbsp;
been a perfect candidate for such tasks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.800
if by any chance she would have activated the ac&nbsp;
the same way as danny did and all the doors and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.440
windows of the cabin would close down then there&nbsp;
wouldn't be no problem at all everyone who stayed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.320
in the cabin can just break the windows from the&nbsp;
inside and let her in once she would have returned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.320
with the icebox they could have just melted it&nbsp;
cozy next to the fireplace also in an ideal world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.560
they would have realised that even though they&nbsp;
didn't have mobile connection in the beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.840
of this chapter they did have slight 4g connection&nbsp;
giving rise to the chance of reaching out through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.240
internet-based chat services perhaps they could&nbsp;
have beat the game masses already at this point!

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.640
but off to the next chapter danny is safe and&nbsp;
we are excited for him to see the next room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.040
he'll be geeking out for sure this room was&nbsp;
one of my favorites even though amanda's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.320
death was completely unnecessary and i'll&nbsp;
get to that but i just love the retro vibes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.400
as a quick reference point many of you&nbsp;
perhaps remember that in earlier days you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.440
couldn't receive or make a call with the same&nbsp;
telephone line your internet was connected to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.000
meaning every time someone tried to call you while&nbsp;
you were browsing the internet they would hear the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.440
infamous dial-up signal instead on the contrary&nbsp;
if you made a phone call your internet connection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.600
would disconnect which could be very frustrating&nbsp;
at times but anyway the movie seems to make a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.600
cross-reference in that regard every time the&nbsp;
signal appears the floor would lose another part a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.800
connection to get across while i'm sure the props&nbsp;
team of the movie had mad fun designing this set&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.240
the script writers could have implemented their&nbsp;
ideas a little bit more in depth now the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.040
design is pretty straight forward everything is&nbsp;
upside down the floor falls off every time the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.320
signal appears so in order to escape our&nbsp;
protagonists must get a hold on the bars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:59.040
fixated on the walls which look like they weren't&nbsp;
intended for this use they seem to go around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.240
whole room and there are multiple other properties&nbsp;
that seem to be intended for similar use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.280
if things were to get intense as everyone saves&nbsp;
themselves by grabbing the bars on the walls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:15.040
amanda makes her way up to the upside down bar&nbsp;
and finds a safe they require a four digit code&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.080
which they figure out quickly by solving a giant&nbsp;
sliding puzzle on the wall amanda secures an eight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.360
ball from the safe which appears to be the key to&nbsp;
enter the next room while all of our protagonists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.400
are already in the corner where the door is&nbsp;
located amanda has yet to get over there well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:36.400
i admire your strength amanda but i think it's the&nbsp;
wrong timing for a workout why not take the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.920
way jason used before there was absolutely&nbsp;
no need to risk your life so unnecessary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.480
and instead of encouraging her to jump one should&nbsp;
have just told her to take the freaking way along&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:53.840
the side jesus christ and boom amanda survives&nbsp;
and there you go friends that's how you do it

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:03.200
our protagonists enter the next room but i at this&nbsp;
point just wonder how big is this place really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.160
i mean originally amanda fell for about four&nbsp;
seconds into darkness that's four seconds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:15.520
free fall if we use our brains efficiently we must&nbsp;
conclude that they are in a 76 meter tall building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.640
so they have started in a waiting room which&nbsp;
led to a cabin in narnia and then entered what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.520
seemed to be a high-rise building seems like&nbsp;
those game masters have some serious funding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:31.760
what's coming next this room is a hospital ward&nbsp;
with a bed for each character they quickly realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.960
that each one of them has a similar backstory&nbsp;
everyone has solely survived a tragic event in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.720
the past all the previous hints and flashbacks are&nbsp;
explained and they understand that each room was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:49.440
designed in relation to their individual pasts&nbsp;
as they realized this in pure saw fashion a tv&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:55.280
turns on displaying a timer running down from five&nbsp;
minutes to zero at zero the room will be flooded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:01.200
with carbon monoxide there really are three&nbsp;
things that make carbon monoxide so dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:07.520
first the molecules of the gas are so small they&nbsp;
can easily travel through objects like dry walls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.160
secondly carbon monoxide mixes with&nbsp;
air causing it to neither rise nor fall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.440
making an escape virtually impossible lastly&nbsp;
it's undetectable unless you use technology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:23.280
it's a really sneaky gas according to a study done&nbsp;
by dr thomas steiner from the university of iowa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.720
if the concentration is exceptionally high a fatal&nbsp;
carbon monoxide poisoning can happen in as little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:35.040
as 5 minutes so zoeys attempt to break the windows&nbsp;
is actually completely justifiable as it would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.640
give them the opportunity to breathe oxygen-rich&nbsp;
air and delay the concentration of the gas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.360
but why does she try to break all the cameras&nbsp;
well this is a genius idea and we'll come back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.760
to this later since this is the only room&nbsp;
with a chance of surviving the escape room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.080
while Zoey goes seemingly mad&nbsp;
jason manipulates mike into death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.080 --> 00:11:00.000
which too was completely avoidable especially&nbsp;
if zoe had elaborated her plan clearer but i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.920
guess she couldn't and i'll explain later why&nbsp;
as the clock strikes zero everyone gets poisoned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:13.840
ben and jason just barely make it to the next&nbsp;
room while zoey stays and loses consciousness

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.000
now while i still refuse to believe that this&nbsp;
was actual dmt it was still pretty amusing now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.680
the fight that broke out over who gets to use the&nbsp;
only anti-dote available however was not necessary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.840
the effects of the drugs would have not lasted&nbsp;
for more than a few hours and they could have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.360
just shared the antidote so both could at least&nbsp;
reduce the effects of the hallucinogen even if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:41.120
we assumed that everyone would survive this and&nbsp;
the last room where ben only saves himself by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.080
hiding in the fireplace it is still highly likely&nbsp;
that the game masters wouldn't keep them alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:51.840
so there is really only one chance for each&nbsp;
character to survive and this chance lies in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:57.680
room number four in room four zoe realizes that&nbsp;
even if they should make it to the finish line&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:03.440
they will get killed nevertheless and it makes&nbsp;
total sense it's a logical assessment because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:08.240
it simply would not be possible for the game&nbsp;
master to sustain his business if he lets any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:13.760
participants escape imagine the difficulties&nbsp;
containing the spread of such news after every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.360
escape room it's just not possible but let's&nbsp;
talk about zoe's plan first why it failed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.960
how we could have done better and save everyone&nbsp;
her idea was to exploit the heavy reliance of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.960
the game master under surveillance cameras since&nbsp;
room 4 was bound to get flooded by poisonous gas&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.920
everyone in it would die if the cameras are&nbsp;
destroyed however there would be no way to tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:41.520
if the people in it are dead or alive but if you&nbsp;
can't observe anyone escaping the poisonous room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.160
by looking at the cameras of the last and next&nbsp;
room you must conclude that the characters must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.200
be dead naturally at some point someone must&nbsp;
enter the room to get rid of the dead bodies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.920
therefore the plan is to fake your death&nbsp;
and overpower those who eventually enter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:02.160
just like zoe did in the movie but could she&nbsp;
have done better i think yes you see zoe fails&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.920
to communicate her plan to the other characters i&nbsp;
guess she was afraid that if she told everyone the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:13.520
game master would have overheard it and therefore&nbsp;
intervened so the only possibility here is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.800
she needs to get her point across without being&nbsp;
too verbal about it and this is absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:25.120
possible especially in a huge room like this so if&nbsp;
everyone is on board and the cameras are destroyed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.240
how do you manage to stay alive while being&nbsp;
locked in a carbon monoxide filled room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.920
well the answer to that is you share the available&nbsp;
oxygen mask just like divers share their oxygen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:41.600
tank underwater when necessary now i get it&nbsp;
sharing oxygen with five other people is dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:47.360
and even just a few minutes could feel like hours&nbsp;
so destroying some of the windows would be a great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.800
solution to survive the glass looks thin enough&nbsp;
to break and it looks like direct sunlight hits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.160
the glass from the other side promising fresh air&nbsp;
if the glass is overcome with heavy objects like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.960
the computer monitors there is no doubt that it&nbsp;
is possible to break the windows especially when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:08.640
you're six people of which four are men and the&nbsp;
others are too badass women now what happens next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:14.880
obviously is they overpower the game masters all&nbsp;
together just like zoey did solo in the movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:20.720
then they meet the last boss of the game the&nbsp;
head game master overpower him too and celebrate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.520
complete victory the police has no chance in&nbsp;
denying the story and our heroes would enjoy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:30.320
coffee together other than just two of them&nbsp;
and there you have it survival would have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.640
possible for each member of the group if you think&nbsp;
you could have outsmarted the game master better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:39.360
than i did consider leaving a comment with&nbsp;
