00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.520
Hi guys, K-Movie Recapped here. Before&nbsp;
we start, WARNING! Spoilers Ahead! Today,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.840
I’m going to explain a 2016 Korean&nbsp;
Horror-Thriller movie called The Wailing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.080
Within a seemingly peaceful village, a&nbsp;
plague of mysterious and violent deaths&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.080
suddenly takes place. Will they find&nbsp;
the truth behind the mysterious plague?

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.480
The story starts with Jong-Goo, a police officer,&nbsp;
going to the scene of a mass murder. They have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.840
arrested a guy who’s apparently stabbed and killed&nbsp;
everyone. This guy seems infected with an unknown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.880
disease, his body is covered in rashes. They&nbsp;
think it’s because he ate some bad mushrooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.080
They then follow the trail into another home&nbsp;
where Jong-goo sees dried flowers at the entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.480
Inside, they find a filthy nest-like room&nbsp;
where they think is the murder scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.040
At the police station, Jong-Goo and&nbsp;
his partner are talking about a rumor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.240
a hunter saw a Stranger eating an animal carcass&nbsp;
in the woods. Since the arrival of a mysterious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.680
Stranger from Japan at their village, a series of&nbsp;
mysterious and violent deaths have been happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.720
But Jong-Goo just thinks that as an ignorant&nbsp;
thought. Suddenly, they face a power outage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.800
Just then, they see a naked woman staring&nbsp;
inside. By the time they go out, she has gone.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.400
On the next day, Jong-Goo is banging his wife in&nbsp;
a car, and his daughter witnesses this. He then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.760
buys his daughter a ton of things so she’d remain&nbsp;
quiet about it. At night, a house is burned down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.880
by a woman who also has killed her family. She&nbsp;
was also affected by the rashes as confirmed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.240
by other witnesses. Jong-goo sees the Stranger&nbsp;
for the first time on the scene. He connects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.720
that it was the naked woman from the previous&nbsp;
night who had burned down her house. One of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.360
friends tells him that the woman was raped by the&nbsp;
Stranger, making her go crazy and run around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.320
village naked at night. Jong-Goo still considers&nbsp;
this as a rumor since there is no evidence.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.520
When Jong-Goo is guarding the burned-down house,&nbsp;
a strange young lady bothers him by throwing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.640
rocks at him. She then tells him the details of&nbsp;
the murder, as if she saw it with her own eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.120
She warns him saying that if he’s been&nbsp;
seeing the Stranger more often than before,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.320
it means he’s being hunted.&nbsp;
When he calls his partner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.600
that young lady is gone. But, as she mentions,&nbsp;
Jong-goo’s daughter suddenly falls sick.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.720
On the next day, Jong-Goo meets the hunter who&nbsp;
claims to be a witness to the Stranger eating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.600
animal carcasses in the woods. So they go to the&nbsp;
woods to find out more and see a lot of animal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.600
bone remains on the ground. It starts to rain.&nbsp;
The witness gets scared and decides to go back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.560
but he gets struck by lightning&nbsp;
and is admitted to the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.000
At the hospital, Jong-Goo sees another patient&nbsp;
having a seizure before he pukes blood and dies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.200
That patient is the suspect&nbsp;
from the first murder case.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.000
At home, Jong-Goo’s daughter keeps having&nbsp;
a nightmare where a strange man is banging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.760
on the door. In the morning, she&nbsp;
looks better and eats a lot of fish.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.120
Which they find strange because&nbsp;
she didn't like fish before.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.160
Jong-Goo’s mother-in-law suggests that they&nbsp;
should bring in a shaman to perform an exorcism.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.160
Jong-Goo meets with his partner’s nephew who is&nbsp;
a pastor who also happens to understand Japanese.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.280
They go to the Stranger’s house to find more&nbsp;
clues. Jong-Goo finds a room with a bizarre altar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.840
in it, while his partner finds a room full of&nbsp;
photos of all the people who had been infected and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.600
after they had died. Jong-goo’s daughter’s shoe is&nbsp;
also found amongst other items. When the Stranger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.960
comes, they go back home. Jong-Goo questions&nbsp;
his daughter about meeting the Stranger. His&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.080
daughter lashes out at him all crazy. He leaves&nbsp;
and comes back later at night and finds strange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.120
scribbles in her book and rashes on her body. She&nbsp;
wakes up and lashes out at him more till they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.280
to restrain her. His mother-in-law tells him that&nbsp;
she already contacted Il-Gwang, a famous shaman.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.600
In the morning, Jong-Goo goes back to the&nbsp;
Stranger’s house with the pastor and confronts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.280
him. But when he gets there, the Stranger already&nbsp;
burned the photos and things he found yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.000
He ends up wrecking the Stranger’s&nbsp;
house and killing his dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.920
He then tells the Stranger to leave the village in&nbsp;
3 days. Jong-Goo’s wife brings their daughter to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.720
the hospital. They found out that her symptoms&nbsp;
are similar to the previous murder suspects.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.080
On the next day, Jong-Goo wakes up to a&nbsp;
scream, his wife finds a goat carcass hanging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.440
on their home entrance. But for some reason, he&nbsp;
can’t walk properly and keep falling. They bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.480
him to a local acupuncture practitioner, leaving&nbsp;
their daughter to their neighbor. This turns out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.360
to be a big mistake, as they come back, they find&nbsp;
their daughter killed the neighbor with a scissor.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.720
Il-Gwang, the shaman, arrives and locates a&nbsp;
vase with a dead raven in it. He says that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.160
the Japanese Stranger is a ghost and arranges&nbsp;
for an exorcism. He mentions that the ritual is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.200
out-of-body and mustn’t be interrupted at any&nbsp;
cost. Meanwhile, another murder case happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.880
A farmer kills his entire family and throws&nbsp;
them in a well, the same story of the rashes.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.480
The next day, Il-Gwang conducts the ritual. The&nbsp;
Stranger is doing a ritual of his own to possess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.520
the dead farmer in a truck. While Il-Gwang&nbsp;
is performing the ritual, Jong-Goo’s daughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.040
shrieks in pain, begging him to stop the ritual.&nbsp;
Jong-goo interrupts Il-Gwang’s ritual and takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.640
his daughter to a hospital. The interruption keeps&nbsp;
his daughter safe for a while. The Stranger takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.080
some damage but manages to survive. The strange&nbsp;
young lady is also seen at the Stranger’s house.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.480
The next morning, he assembles his friends&nbsp;
and goes out on a hunt for the Stranger.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.840
They run into the dead farmer who has turned&nbsp;
into an undead. They eventually manage to beat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.880
him. Just then they spot the Stranger and chase&nbsp;
him. They lose him over the cliffs after the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.880
Stranger jumps down and hides. As they drive back,&nbsp;
Jong-Goo loses control of his truck and swerves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.960
As he does, a person lands on his windshield. They&nbsp;
step out and see that it is the Stranger that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.520
were chasing. He and his men throw the Stranger’s&nbsp;
body over the cliff while the strange young&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.160
lady is seen again on the top of the hill. His&nbsp;
daughter gets better and they take her back home.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.120
At night, the police find Jong-Goo’s&nbsp;
partner gets infected and kills his family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.200
Il-Gwang tries to reach Jong-goo,&nbsp;
but he keeps declining his call.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.160
Il-Gwang goes to his house but gets intercepted&nbsp;
by the strange young lady who makes him bleed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.520
and puke excessively and asks him to leave town.&nbsp;
In fear, he gets into his car and drives away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.400
Il-Gwang, who is trying to leave town,&nbsp;
passes through a swarm of locusts and is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.680
forced to turn back. Jong-Goo sees the many&nbsp;
missed calls from Il-Gwang and reaches out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.400
Il-Gwang tells Jong-goo that the Stranger is&nbsp;
the good guy and that he was wrong about him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.960
And that strange young lady is the evil&nbsp;
spirit. He asks Jong-goo to go straight home.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.240
Jong-Goo meets with the young lady in front of&nbsp;
his house. She tells him that if he goes home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.880
everyone in his family will die. That the&nbsp;
Stranger is using his family as bait and is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.000
waiting for him. And that the Stranger is not&nbsp;
someone who can die. She also mentions about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.720
her protection but it would work only if Jong-Goo&nbsp;
waits until three rooster crows before going home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.040
He gets a call from Il-Gwang telling him&nbsp;
to don't trust the lady and to go home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.720
Jong-Goo doesn’t know who to trust. Moo-Myung&nbsp;
holds his hand, but she doesn’t seem human to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.600
him. He also notices his daughter’s hair clip&nbsp;
and clothing of people who had died earlier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.040
which makes Jong-Goo think that she’s the evil&nbsp;
one and runs back home. Inside, he finds his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.760
whole family has been killed by his daughter. The&nbsp;
daughter shows up and ends up killing him too.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.120
While these events transpire, the pastor locates&nbsp;
the Stranger who is still alive in a cave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.680
He goes there unaware of what to&nbsp;
expect. The Stranger transforms to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.200
reveal his demon form and kills the&nbsp;
pastor after taking his photograph.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.480
Il-Gwang comes to take pictures of the&nbsp;
dead. In the end, the evil spirit wins.
