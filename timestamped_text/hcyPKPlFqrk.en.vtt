00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.679
“This dude is bad, and he aint just ‘fly’,
he’s Super Fly.”

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.080
Welcome to Cinema Summary Ladies and Gentlemen. Today we hope to bring you up

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.360
to speed to the 1972 critical classic of the cadillac-cruising dope-slinging lifestyle.

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.080
Before there was hiphop, there was funk and the soul; so enjoy your viewing, here we go.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.900
Youngblood Priest, an African-American drug dealer who specializes in selling cocaine,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.510
enjoys a luxurious lifestyle in Harlem, but finds the dope-dealing life is getting too

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.700
risky and wants to go clean.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.770
The movie begins when Priest confronts Fat Freddie, one of his clients, about money that

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.800
Freddie owes.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.480
Priest gives Fatty a choice: steal from the competition, or your wife gets pressed

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.040
into working the streets.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.660
Freddie isn’t too keen on it but accepts
Priest’s generous offer; going with a fellow

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.960
‘employee’ to commit the robbery.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.760
So with that done, Priest finds his partner, Eddie, and asks him how much cash they currently have.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.020
Eddie tells him that they have $300,000, and
Priest reveals his plan to buy thirty kilos

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.260
of high-quality cocaine, which they can sell
for $1,000,000 within four months.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.690
With one million, they can leave their life
of crime, but Eddie protests that crime is

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.680
the only option left to them by “The Man.”

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.000
"It's the American dream, N****"

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.880
Priest is determined, however, and that night,
approaches Scatter, a retired dealer who started

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.510
Priest in the business.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.200
Scatter’s new gig is running a restaurant,
fairly successful one at-that.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.700
At first, he refuses to help Priest, but Priest plays on his emotions, claiming that he wants

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.900
to get out while he is young and before he has to face the same hurdles that Scatter

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.920
had to deal with.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.479
The hot-tempered Eddie threatens Scatter,
politely asking that he better tell them where

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.980
he gets coke if he won’t supply the dope,
but Scatter disarms Eddie and holds him at gunpoint.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.220
Priest, ever cool under pressure, defuses
the situation and convinces Scatter to help

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.740
them, although Scatter warns that it will
be the last time.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.980
Soon after, Priest and Eddie are joined by
one of their low-level dealers and Freddie,

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.920
who turns over the money he stole and agrees
that “the beef” between the men is settled.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.770
That night, Priest enjoys a romantic bath
with his girl friend Georgia, although she

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.950
disapproves of his drug usage.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.560
When Priest reacts hostilely, Georgia explains
that she loves him and wants to help him cope

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.069
with the difficulties of street life (like
they say “Behind every great man, is a great

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.069
woman”).

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.989
The next day, Freddie is picked up for fighting,and
gets beaten by the police, revealing the time

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.719
and place that Priest and Eddie will pick
up the first kilo of cocaine from Scatter.

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.829
Not wanting to get booked, Freddie makes a
break for it and dies after getting run over

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:24.959
by a car.

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.180
Meanwhile, Priest and Georgia are strolling
in a park, it is here where Priest confesses

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.329
that he has got a way out of dealing.

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:37.299
Georgia pleads with Priest to quit immediately,
money isn't the problem, but Priest is adamant:

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.739
he must get the money, because with his criminal
record, he’d be lucky to get a job.

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.450
That night, after picking up the kilo from
Scatter, Priest and Eddie are apprehended

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.909
by several policemen.

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.152
The lieutenant in charge, reveals that he
is Scatter’s supplier and that the two men

00:02:50.152 --> 00:02:51.959
can now go directly to him.

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.779
The lieutenant tells them they can have as
much “weight,” or kilos of cocaine, as

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:59.239
they want, and will be given both credit and
protection.

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.239
After the police leave, Eddie is absolutely
delighted by this killer deal, claiming that

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.809
they are set for life.

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:09.200
But Priest has got conviction: after 30 kilos,
he’s done, and out of there.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.540
Voiceover: [Breathes in, sits back] “That
much”.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.349
Soon after, the operation is in full swing
with both ‘families’ of Priest and Eddie’s

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.760
dealing, with many buying their premium coke.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.420
Priest’s white mistress, Cynthia, also sells
to her friends, but she’s very put-off by

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.239
Priest once she learns that Priest does not
return her love and is planning on quitting

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.480
the business.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.499
By his own admission, as a kid he wanted all
the to be successful and rich, with lover

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:35.769
like her, but now wants a simpler life and
will be ending their relationship.

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.840
Their argument is interrupted by the sudden
arrival of Scatter, who is being pursued by

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.840
his supplier.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.829
Scatter reveals that Deputy Commissioner Reardon
is the guy running the operation, and is trying

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.370
to kill him for quitting.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.139
Scatter gives Priest a packet of information
on Reardon and his family, then arranges to

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.450
meet him later, when Priest will give him
money and Scatter will escape to New York.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.030
But Scatter doesn’t make it: when he leaves,
he gets captured and killed by the corrupt

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.780
policemen, who give him a fatal overdose of
drugs and leave his body in Priest’s car.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.650
Both enraged and scared, Priest conducts a
meeting with two white men, then confronts

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.650
Eddie.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.840
Priest demands his half of their profits,
and when Eddie protests that they should keep

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.040
selling, Priest tells him that Scatter was
murdered by the police, and that they aren’t

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.040
safe.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.450
Priest leaves with cash in hand but Eddie
snitches to lieutenant.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.510
But Priest is no ‘dummy’, he gives the
briefcase carrying the money to a disguised

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.830
Georgia in exchange for one full of rags.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.990
Outside, Priest is held by two patrolmen,
smiling when Georgia manages to escape for them undetected.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.960
Priest is then picked up by the lieutenant
and other policemen and taken to the waterfront,

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.069
where he and Reardon have their showdown.

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.789
Reardon threatens Priest that he must continue
selling drugs as long as he is ordered to.

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.840
But Priest got his convictions and so begins
a police beatdown.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.069
Using his knowledge of karate, Priest kicks ass and takes names, then reveals that he knows who Reardon is.

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.090
Remember those 2 white men who he met earlier?

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.770
They’re contract killers, he hired to murder
Reardon and his entire family should anything

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.000
happen to him (Priest)

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
.Reardon thinks he’s bluffing, ordered his
men to open the briefcase.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.370
To their shock, it’s full of rags.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.409
Reardon can do nothing but watch as Priest
stalks off, giving the policemen one final

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.819
glare before driving off to join Georgia (Ride
off into the sunset, Mr. Priest.

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:15.889
Good luck.)

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.230
