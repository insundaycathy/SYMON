00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.810
Hello everyone, this is Mr. Brain Junkie here!

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.700
And today we'll be talking about a fantasy
action filmed called The Great Wall!

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.860
Be ready for some spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.390
A long time ago in the outer edges of China,
a group is being chased by the warriors of

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.440
Mongolia.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.350
In order to escape from the enemies, the leader
William tells his men to cut loose the horses

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.550
in order to lure the scavengers away, giving
them the opportunity to run.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.020
At night, while trying to recover from the
earlier fight, the men reveals that they are

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.180
mercenaries here to find the mysterious black
powder.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.559
Their journey has been perilous from the very
beginning, losing more than 20 of their men

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.920
in the process and leaving little resources
left.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.089
Just when they're contemplating about retreat,
A creature from the shadow attacks the group

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:49.109
and kills all the remaining warriors, leaving
only William and his friend Tovar behind.

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.570
The animal circles back again to attack, but
William is able to strike the monster down

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.120
and cut off its arm.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.889
Not sure about what they just killed, the
two decides to leave immediately as their

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:01.250
campsite is obviously not safe anymore.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.310
They continue traveling the next day, but
is quickly found by the Mongolian once again,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.340
forcing them to run for their lives as the
enemies chase closely behind.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.299
The two eventually arrive in front of The
Great Wall on the outskirts of China, and

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.060
is quickly stopped by a barrage of arrows
that barely misses them.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.189
With little choices left, William decides
to surrender to the Chinese instead of being

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.320
captured by the Mongolians, hoping that the
former can spare their lives.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.159
The commanders of The Great Wall are shocked
to see the giant claw that William has brought

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.979
with him, and Commander Lin demands to know
where the main character has acquired it.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.300
When they hear the man say that he killed
the monster by himself, the Chinese Commanders

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.749
laugh at William mockingly, not believing
a single word he said.

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:48.710
However, strategist Wang thinks that the foreigners'
stories may be real, as the men's weapons

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.590
and clothing are covered in the creature's
blood.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.679
Before they can decide on the two men's fates,
a scout rushes in and reports that they have

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:01.010
spotted enemies from the observation towers,
rushing towards the wall in great numbers.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.400
General Shao immediately orders the armies
to get ready for battle, and the two men are

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.100
quickly taken onto the wall, where a large
army of soldiers in colorful armors standby

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.340
for the siege.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.260
William is amazed to see the glory of the
army, as the soldiers all work together perfectly

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.500
despite their different roles, which are indicated
by their armor's colors.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.420
What stands out from the rest of the of army
are the soldiers in blue, which are led by

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.970
commander Lin and composed of only women.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.590
They all march towards the edge of the wall
and prepares to battle by using the giant

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.590
spears.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.210
The soldiers all wait patiently for the enemies
to come, and their attentions are quickly

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.050
drawn towards the far distance as a horde
of green monsters charges towards the wall.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.630
General Shao quickly orders for the artilleries
to attack, and numerous fire balls are thrown

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.840
into the air by the massive machines,

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.350
heading directly towards the enemies and creating
a sea of flames upon impact.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.320
The archers also begin firing at the monsters,
showering them with a barrage of arrows that

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.790
cover the entire sky, killing many of the
creatures while they rush in without hesitation.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.830
The monsters roar furiously as they run closer
towards the giant wall, eventually reaching

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.450
the base despite the onslaught of arrows.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.010
The women in blue armors begin to drop down
towards the creatures, striking the enemies

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.510
using their spears whiles the men quickly
pull them back up.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.520
Despite their tremendous efforts, many of
the soldiers are killed by the monster as

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.110
they're eaten alive.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.740
Very soon, the queen of the monsters arrive
in the far distance together with her numerous

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.520
bodyguards, in order to command the battle
more effectively.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.930
Strategist Wang sees this and tells the general,
who orders the artilleries to fire directly

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.180
towards the queen,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.240
but the bodyguards are able to block the attacks
quickly, protecting their leader in the process.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.040
The queen roars furiously towards the humans
and begins communicating with her minions,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.820
ordering them to change their strategy and
use their bodies to climb the walls.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.710
The monsters are able to climb the structure
very quickly and begins mauling the soldiers,

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.370
throwing them off the wall using incredible
strength.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.980
William desperately tries to break free with
Tovar after seeing the dangers, and surprising,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.370
they are released by another foreigner named
Ballard who cuts their ropes immediately.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.650
A young soldier named Peng sees his comrades
being killed, and rushes in to attack the

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.000
creature despite his fear, but gets pushed
back easily by the giant monster.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.790
Before the young man can be killed by the
voracious creature, William jumps in the air

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.090
and grabs onto a spear, charging at the creature
and stabs it right in the mouth.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.590
The monster pushes the man backwards as it
roars continuously, but William is able to

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.160
stab it again with Tovar's help, and the two
kills the creature by piercing it's heart.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.990
Tovar takes a red cape on the ground and begins
attracting another monster like a bull, causing

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.320
the creature to charge directly at the man,

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.910
but this allows William to kill it by using
an arrow and barely escapes the blinded creature

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.180
as it launches for the last time.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.370
After seeing so many of its minions killed,
the queen orders the creatures to retreat

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.190
by using her soundwaves,

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.840
making the monsters fall back as they carry
the bodies of their fallen comrades away,

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.320
preventing the humans to learn anything about
them.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.620
The Chinese commanders approach the westerners
after the victory, and the two men drop their

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.880
weapons immediately to show their co-operation.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.040
General Shao praises their bravery for aiding
with the battle, and decides to offer them

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.610
a living quarter instead of locking them up.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.100
The young soldier Peng goes to William right
after the siege, and thanks the man for saving

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.410
his life instead of leaving him for dead.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.930
The two also meets Ballard, the man who freed
them earlier, and it turns out that he was

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.370
also here looking for the black powder 25
years ago,

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.850
but is kept hostage as a teacher of English
ever since.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.300
The old man shows the two the mysterious black
powder that they were looking for, and assures

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.389
William that there's more than enough for
all three of them.

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.750
Ballard proposes that they leave as soon as
the siege begins, so that they can be riding

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.020
away while the battle rages.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.680
Before their conversation can finish, Strategist
Wang calls them for an urgent meeting as he

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.070
found a magnet inside the their belongings.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.290
Wang believes that the stone was the reason
why William was able to kill the monster so

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.110
easily during their first encounter, as the
magnet may have interfered with the creature's

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.110
mind.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.950
It turns out that the monsters are called
Tao Teis, and they landed on Earth 20 centuries

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.810
ago from outer space.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.889
Ever since that day, the creatures rise every
60 years to attack from the north of China,

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.650
trying to devour everything so they can feed
their queen in order to multiply.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.450
The capital of China has 2 million people
and is only about 300 miles away from the

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.450
wall.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.590
If the creatures obtain such large amounts
of nourishments, their numbers would explode,

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.820
spreading to every corners of the world.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.520
At the same time, General Shao has noticed
missing personnel at the west towers, and

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.419
proceeds to investigate along side commander
Lin.

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.450
The soldiers go into their formations, but
the men are surprised that the monsters have

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.090
purposely left the bodies, instead of devouring
them as food.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.510
The soldiers march forwards after noticing
one of the creatures in front of them, but

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.310
general Shao also sees the reflections of
a second Tao Tei from behind, trying to ambush

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.310
the team.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.410
The two monsters attack them simultaneously,
and the general tries to fend off the Tao

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.180
Tei from behind, but ends up mortally wounded
by the creature after trying to save commander

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.180
Lin.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.220
The entire army arrives soon after, but it
was too late to save their leader.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.810
With his last breath, General Shao declares
Lin to be his successor, and warns her to

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.290
never underestimate the monster's intelligence
ever again.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:25.050
A massive funeral is orchestrated as the people
mourn for their leader's death, sending numerous

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:30.020
candles flying in the air to light the way
for general Shao as he enters the afterlife.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.210
Very soon, Envoy Shen from the emperor of
China has come to the walls, bringing records

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.530
of the encounters with the monsters from 60
years ago.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.680
Apparently, the previous general recorded
that the creatures became paralyzed after

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:48.160
chasing the soldiers onto a mountain, where
a magnet is also present similar to William's.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.690
In order to verify how the magnet actually
affects the creatures, William suggests that

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:57.240
they capture a Tao Tei by using a hook, similar
to how a whale is captured,

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.530
but Tovar is extremely unhappy with his friend's
proposed involvements, reminding him of their

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.199
plan to escape with the black powders.

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:09.000
Strategist Wang begins concocting a large
amounts of anesthetics and putting them on

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.760
the hooks, preparing to capture one of the
creatures alive.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.330
Very Soon the Tao Teis begin to arrive in
masses while they try to sneak onto the wall,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.680
and the soldiers defend against the monsters
by attacking in their formation.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.650
Giant blades protrude from the walls and cuts
the creatures into pieces, while the warriors

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:29.740
attack the Tao Tei furiously as they fight
on the edges of the building.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.159
Lin orders to fire the harpoons, and the giant
hooks launch towards the enemies, hitting

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.099
many of the monsters and trapping them with
the chains.

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:42.180
However, the creatures soon realize the people's
intentions to capture them, and begins ripping

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:46.199
apart the hooks, all breaking free from the
restraints except for one.

00:08:46.199 --> 00:08:50.470
At the same time, Ballard is trying to convince
Tovar to leave the wall right now while the

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.569
battle is in place, but the man refuses to
abandon his friend.

00:08:54.569 --> 00:08:59.709
William is also contemplating about abandoning
the Chinese army, but in the last moment,

00:08:59.709 --> 00:09:03.930
decides to return and help the commanders
capture the last Tao Tei that's in chains.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.350
In order to isolate the creature from the
others, the army fires numerous bombs around

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:13.139
the monster, creating a field of flames that
surrounds the entire area.

00:09:13.139 --> 00:09:16.809
Realizing that the chains won't last much
longer, William drops down into the fields

00:09:16.809 --> 00:09:21.029
by sliding across the metals and finding the
monster unconscious on the ground.

00:09:21.029 --> 00:09:25.720
He ties the creature up so that it can retrieved,
but is quickly attacked by hostile enemies

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.790
as he tries to fight for his life.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:32.779
Luckily, the man is saved from the ambush
as Tovar appears to the rescue, saving William

00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:36.790
in the process and blaming the man for not
following their plans to escape.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.959
Their arguments are interrupted when more
Tao Teis begin to attack from the fogs,

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:45.170
but the two are able to kill the creatures
together by using their teamwork and shooting

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.910
the monsters in the eyes.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.149
As the fight continues, the monsters begin
to bypass the wall of flames and surrounds

00:09:51.149 --> 00:09:54.470
the men in large numbers, charging directly
at them,

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:59.470
but the Chinese army is able to fire numerous
bombs at the location, killing the Tao Ties

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.980
with explosions and saving the men's lives.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.940
They quickly put the giant beast inside a
cage and begins experimenting the magnet's

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.660
effects on the creature.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.029
Surprisingly, as Wang approaches the monster
along side the rock, the creature eventually

00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:15.959
stops moving altogether, proving the effects
of the stone.

00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:20.570
Envoy Chen demands to bring the Tao Tei to
the emperor right away despite Wang's protest,

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.560
but the order came directly from the king
himself.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.670
After the envoy leaves the wall, the army
detected more movements from the monsters

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:31.970
at the base of the building, and begins to
investigate as the armies descendent to the

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:32.970
bottom.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.929
To their shock, the creatures have dug a giant
hole through the base of the wall, using the

00:10:36.929 --> 00:10:41.029
previous battles as nothing more than ploys
to blindsight the armies.

00:10:41.029 --> 00:10:45.189
Meanwhile, Ballard and Tovar are stealing
the black powders and plans escape the great

00:10:45.189 --> 00:10:48.629
wall as the armies are busy investigating
the monsters,

00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:52.679
but they're stopped by William, who wants
his friend to stay and fight for a greater

00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:53.679
cause.

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:57.680
Tovar believes that William is blinded by
optimism as he thinks that the people have

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.199
no chance against the monster's armies.

00:11:00.199 --> 00:11:04.389
While they are arguing, Ballard knocks the
main character unconscious, telling Tovar

00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:07.990
to leave his friend behind as this would be
their only chance to run.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:12.829
General Lin soon discovers the escape of the
westerners and is furious at William for his

00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:16.870
betrayal, despite the man claiming to have
tried to stop his friend.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:21.519
Her anger is only tempered when she hears
the young warrior Peng, who vouches for William

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:25.329
as he claims to have witness the man trying
to stop the escapees.

00:11:25.329 --> 00:11:29.730
She orders to have the traitors captured right
away, and locks William in a cell so that

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.660
he can no longer interfere with the armies
plans.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.930
In order to catch up with the hordes of Tao
Teis, Lin decides to use the hot balloons

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:41.499
as a method for travel, but the inventions
are not tested and poses great danger for

00:11:41.499 --> 00:11:43.019
its users.

00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:46.970
Numerous people died as they try to ascend
into the skies by using the black powders

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:51.860
as fuels for the vehicles, leaving only a
handful of soldiers heading towards the capital.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:56.800
Peng releases William soon after, and the
man rushes to the outside where he meets Wang,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.600
demanding to know what's going on.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.660
The strategist tells him that they have failed
to prevent the Tao Teis from breaching the

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.860
walls, and the general has ordered for his
release, as she heads towards the capital

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.860
herself.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.000
Wang tells William that the only chance they
have now is to kill the Queen, as her death

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.570
would also disable all her minions.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.809
Instead of leaving like Wang suggested, William
decides to go after Lin so that they can save

00:12:18.809 --> 00:12:20.850
humanity from being destroyed.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:25.339
At the same time, General Lin has arrived
inside the capital, only to see that the place

00:12:25.339 --> 00:12:27.779
is overrun by the voracious creatures.

00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:32.040
They try to make it to the palace, but are
quickly attacked by numerous Tao Teis and

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.360
grounded by the creatures while they desperately
fight for their lives.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.889
Lin is quickly surrounded by the monsters
as they roar furiously at the woman, but before

00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:44.040
she is killed, William arrives to her rescue
and grabs her into the air,

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.239
using the grenades to repels the monsters
as they fly into the palace.

00:12:47.239 --> 00:12:51.860
They are able to retrieve the Tao Tei that
was captured earlier and Wang decides to load

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.279
the creature with bombs.

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:57.569
They plan to travel inside the sewers and
feed the monster, before releasing it towards

00:12:57.569 --> 00:13:01.540
the queen so that they have a chance to kill
her by using the explosives.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:06.300
However, their plan doesn't go smoothly as
the creatures have discovered their location,

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.329
and kills the majority of their team, leaving
the young warrior Peng wounded but still alive.

00:13:11.329 --> 00:13:16.199
Suddenly, numerous Tao Teis charge into the
underground tunnels, and Peng decides to sacrifice

00:13:16.199 --> 00:13:21.329
himself by blowing up the grenades, killing
the monsters and blocking the pathway as well.

00:13:21.329 --> 00:13:25.850
Not having any time to mourn, Wang quickly
opens the doors to the outside and they release

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.149
the monster that's tied up with bombs.

00:13:28.149 --> 00:13:32.660
The creature wakes up immediately after the
magnet was removed, and just like they planned,

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.879
it begins devouring the meat that was provided
and runs to the outside, trying to give it

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:37.899
to its queen.

00:13:37.899 --> 00:13:42.850
The three arrives inside a tower, and Wang
stays behind to guard the door using the magnet,

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.249
as William runs to higher grounds with Lin,
trying to get a clear shot at the bombs.

00:13:47.249 --> 00:13:51.569
The man launches the arrow at the queen, but
the bodyguards are able to block off the attack

00:13:51.569 --> 00:13:56.110
as it bounces off and explodes in the air,
alerting the monsters in the process.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:00.600
William quickly goes up the tower to try again,
but the queen orders all her minions to attack

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.600
the buildings,

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.839
causing all the Tao Teis to rush inside, as
Wang throws the magnet towards his teammates

00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:07.860
before being devoured alive.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.620
The man tries to shoot a second time, but
it was still blocked by the creatures and

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.569
the arrow explodes in the air,

00:14:13.569 --> 00:14:18.009
allowing the queen to finally see her attackers
and orders all her minions towards them.

00:14:18.009 --> 00:14:22.309
With only a single bomb left, the two leaps
out from the windows as they swing from the

00:14:22.309 --> 00:14:26.059
ropes, evading the Tao Teis that jumps towards
them from behind.

00:14:26.059 --> 00:14:30.829
William tosses the magnet at the bodyguards
and Lin throws the spear closely behind, allowing

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:35.190
the stone to delay the movements of the creatures
as the bomb lands inside the barrier.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:39.850
The queen tries desperately to put out the
flames, but a large explosion destroys everything

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.910
inside, sending all the creatures flying in
the air.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:48.189
As the queen dies, all the Tao Teis are immobilized
and crashes towards the ground, leaving thousands

00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:52.100
of bodies in the palace as the humans are
finally victorious.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.230
Sometimes later, William rides back to The
Great Wall, and find his friend Tovar in the

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.339
holding cells after being captured by the
Chinese army.

00:14:59.339 --> 00:15:03.759
He tells the man that the emperor gave him
a choice between Tovar's life or the powders,

00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:08.319
but William chose to save his friend, realizing
that friendship is more valuable than any

00:15:08.319 --> 00:15:09.660
material gains.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.970
He rides off into the the far distance along
side the army's escorts, while general Lin

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.679
looks at him from the walls to express farewell.

00:15:16.679 --> 00:15:20.730
William looks back as well before he leaves,
and has a good feeling that he'll come back

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.040
to this place in the future.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.949
