00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.200
a quiet place part 1 has taught us that kids in&nbsp;
this world are deadly and that giving birth to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.840
a newborn baby is a bad idea but in this part&nbsp;
the kids go on a redemption journey and show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.200
us that they besides screwing up things have the&nbsp;
potential to save the world as well in the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.600
10 minutes of this movie we hear a little bit&nbsp;
about the backstory and what happened before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.080
and how the monsters came turns&nbsp;
out they came on a giant meteoroid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.280
which doesn't make the situation better&nbsp;
but it does kind of make it cooler

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.000
now we start out where the first movie has&nbsp;
left off lee the father has been killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.840
saving his kids leaves his only three remaining&nbsp;
characters and a baby they decide that they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.480
no longer stay there and leave i tried to&nbsp;
empathize with the characters in most of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.440
my videos but seeing them carrying around&nbsp;
a baby in a mini casket on an oxygen tank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.720
triggers the nonsense antenna in me this world&nbsp;
is not death stranding therefore we don't need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.760
a newborn baby in fact this screaming little&nbsp;
human is nothing but a burden in this world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.400
would i leave it behind well i kind of want to&nbsp;
but perhaps it would be better to use it as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.440
decoy first but anyway just before they&nbsp;
arrive at their destination this happens

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.440
great not only are we stuck in a world full of&nbsp;
monsters with perfect hearing but also humans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.280
that set traps for other humans thank you but&nbsp;
fortunately our main girl has found a way to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.480
combat these monsters right her hearing device&nbsp;
which by the way is a cochlear implant we will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.360
get to that in a bit emits a high frequency&nbsp;
that they don't seem to like very much using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.720
this it is possible to stop any of the monsters&nbsp;
and even cause their outer shell to open up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.320
so basically this method can be used to stop them&nbsp;
break through their barrier and finally shoot them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.080
down with a clean headshot i can easily envision&nbsp;
a new normal where every person walks around with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.040
a high frequency device that shields off any&nbsp;
of these monsters combine this with holstering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.600
a double barrel shotgun and we could almost go&nbsp;
back to where things were or in a more advanced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.040
scenario having villages and towns be built with&nbsp;
high frequency towers around it so that none of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.840
these beings could enter human territory but for&nbsp;
that we need to figure out which frequencies are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.520
helpful and we will get to that our characters&nbsp;
are rescued by Emmett who was a former friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.640
of the family but has become quite irritated and&nbsp;
hostile towards others even though he rescued them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.560
he quickly points out that he wants them gone&nbsp;
by the next day sure thing my guy no problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.600
we will find a better place especially after&nbsp;
your trap has screwed my son's leg up for life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.600
if i were that woman i would assassinate this guy&nbsp;
during night time and make this my new HQ however&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.360
in the following scenes after Marcus has received&nbsp;
first aid for his leg injury he suddenly receives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.240
a radio signal through the headphones now this&nbsp;
isn't possible without having other people tuning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.320
in from a local radio station right and that is&nbsp;
what they conclude as well basically a ray of hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.840
up until now they have believed that there are no&nbsp;
people left or if there were it's mostly survival&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.760
tribes that are just as dangerous as uh as these&nbsp;
monsters but even though the signal comes in Emmet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.360
shows no signs of hope basically he suffers from&nbsp;
something that's called defeatism if you happen to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.080
be with such people you must have a very strong&nbsp;
character because you need to constantly bear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.440
their negativity and if you can't do that then&nbsp;
you probably better stay away that is unless you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.360
have the gift to inspire people and change their&nbsp;
hearts like Regan the little girl in this movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.160
she finds out that the song blasting through the&nbsp;
radio called beyond the sea by the way is a code&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.680
or more specifically a location where hope can be&nbsp;
found not just that but she's also able to locate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.680
that radio station from where the signal came in&nbsp;
it's located on a nearby island surprise surprise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.600
pack your swimsuit boys and girls we are going&nbsp;
on a trip what Regan understands here though is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.840
that this message is the only option they have and&nbsp;
that is what it really is isn't it food is scarce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.480
and gathering new items becomes increasingly&nbsp;
difficult and hunting for animals is way too loud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.160
using snipers and guns however i do think with&nbsp;
a bow and arrow it would be possible but as of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.760
now we haven't seen anyone use one but if humans&nbsp;
thousands of years ago could craft bows and arrows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.880
then we can assume we can do that too no with&nbsp;
this additional gear not only can we increasingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.080
hunt for small animals like pigeons but we could&nbsp;
also silently distract the monsters by diverting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.120
their attention to somewhere further away from us&nbsp;
they aren't able to pick what they want to hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.320
right i mean you can't do this neither whatever&nbsp;
sounds next or is louder than the sound before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.160
is what they will focus on remember this in the&nbsp;
first part for example they use fireworks set up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.680
far away for emergency situations and that was a&nbsp;
superb idea and can be conceptualized differently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.720
with different tools because Regan knew that her&nbsp;
mother wouldn't let her go she sneaked out and now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.680
tries to find the island on her own while i admire&nbsp;
her courage i usually don't recommend splitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.360
away from the group but in this scenario the&nbsp;
smaller the group the less noise we make so thumbs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.120
up however you need an insane amount of courage&nbsp;
to go about that especially since she's deaf&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.080
right she can't hear much meaning how would she&nbsp;
know when she makes a sound but perhaps exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.600
this disadvantage is what gives her the courage to&nbsp;
venture out mostly people become fearful when they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.640
have more information available and then interpret&nbsp;
this information in a negative way and since she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.720
is lacking this information sound there is no way&nbsp;
to overthink that stuff so as she has left her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.160
mother back home begs Emma to bring her back funny&nbsp;
how she doesn't do it herself but i guess men are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.120
still appreciated in this world Regan arrives at&nbsp;
an abandoned train and instead walking around it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.120
of course she enters it because rusty and broken&nbsp;
trains are very safe and extremely quiet when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.320
we walk through them it doesn't take a genius to&nbsp;
figure out what's coming next Regan screws up we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.920
get an epic close-up of the praying monster behind&nbsp;
her and she gets almost killed before Emmett saves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.520
her in a touching moment shortly after Emmet tells&nbsp;
Regan that he will bring her home she replies

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.720
implying that there is nothing to go back to and&nbsp;
she is right apart of course from her mother and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:27.040
brother is life worth living being in constant&nbsp;
fear of death probably not if a place exists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.320
where these monsters can't get you then in my&nbsp;
opinion it is worth risking your life to get there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.120
what do you think would you risk your life to get&nbsp;
to a safe zone or would you continue to live on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.840
the ground and stay low-key the next day Regan&nbsp;
and Emmett continue their journey to the pier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.680
i think this is all beautiful and stuff but maybe&nbsp;
they should have gone back waited for her Regan's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.120
brother to be cured and then get to the island&nbsp;
together maybe i agree that being a smaller&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.160
group enhances a chance to go unnoticed but it&nbsp;
is also true that now we do have an effective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.600
way to fight these monsters at the same time&nbsp;
Evelyn the mother leaves the safe house as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.160
leaving Regan's brother back alone she's leaving&nbsp;
the safe house to find extra oxygen for the baby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.280
and medicine to prevent her son's injury from&nbsp;
becoming a serious issue because we don't need an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.960
extra screaming child right now that she leaves&nbsp;
for these reasons makes absolute sense but her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.920
son with his injured leg and extreme anxiety&nbsp;
shouldn't leave the safe house no matter what

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.960
but that is exactly what he does why why&nbsp;
would you roam around outside after dark&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.160
with an injured leg there is no reason for&nbsp;
him to do that apart from being bored perhaps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.400
instead of leaving your safe house though and&nbsp;
endanger pretty much everyone in your vicinity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.760
how about turning the radio on and vibe to&nbsp;
your candle light for the time being Jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.560
so while the boy commits a fatal mistake we&nbsp;
cut back to Regan and Emmett the next scenes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.760
are interesting because they will let us know on&nbsp;
how we can beat every single one of these monsters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.520
for good both characters arrive at the pier and&nbsp;
hope to find a boat to get over to the island&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.920
but before they can get onto a boat they see&nbsp;
a little girl playing all huddled up in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.840
middle of the pier now i don't know about&nbsp;
y'all but this isn't something normal even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.400
post-apocalypse i don't think you should get&nbsp;
near her before i gave her a chance to attack&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.160
me i would run up tackle her with a stretched leg&nbsp;
and then put her into the sea that's not a joke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.640
ladies and gentlemen but Emmett storms over&nbsp;
like a father finding his lost daughter and

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.640
well we know where this ends wasn't he the guy who&nbsp;
warned us before about the crazy people out here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:44.000
huh well eventually they are attacked by those&nbsp;
hobos and Emmett is tied up with a belt full of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.160
noisy items and Regan is taken with them at least&nbsp;
almost here's what happens what Emmett decides to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.840
do is something that most people in this situation&nbsp;
would do make a lot of noise because by doing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:02.080
he alerts all monsters nearby who storm into the&nbsp;
area like crazy people on black Friday Regan jumps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.840
into the water and Emmett does so too and here&nbsp;
is the big revelation the monsters can't swim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.360
and it makes total sense by looking at their bony&nbsp;
structure anyway the people over on the island&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.320
seem to have figured that out early on and that is&nbsp;
why the signal they have sent was the song beyond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:24.000
the sea makes kind of sense doesn't it if all&nbsp;
that it takes to kill those monsters is deep water&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.080
then there is an easy way to beat them let me&nbsp;
explain so their perfect hearing means two things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.120
first they are attracted to the loudest thing&nbsp;
and second it implies that they are blind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.320
so if we had multiple sound sources built at the&nbsp;
pier or really anywhere where deep water starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.280
they with their incredible speed would just rush&nbsp;
in and crash into the depths of the ocean or sea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.560
now if we did this then we could play back these&nbsp;
sounds for as long as we wish or as long as it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.840
takes for the last alien to crash into the water&nbsp;
at the same time we could establish a safe route&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.320
between those two sound sources and get onto&nbsp;
the sea without paying much attention on how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:06.160
loud we are because the signals we send from the&nbsp;
towers would override the sounds that we make with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.720
the same method by the way we could also create&nbsp;
artificial white noise routes connecting villages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.440
and towns now of course it isn't literal white&nbsp;
noise but follows a similar principle so what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.400
i'm talking about are basically zones in which the&nbsp;
sent out signals from static towers override human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.360
noise in a given field and if we are very clever&nbsp;
we may even find frequencies that are super loud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:31.600
to the monsters but barely audible to humans which&nbsp;
usually stand outside of 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.800
this would add an extra comfort for living in&nbsp;
these zones but this method would only come into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.160
play if we couldn't kill off monsters and had&nbsp;
to live alongside with them so having Regan and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:48.000
Emmett finally arrive at their destination we can&nbsp;
finally lay eyes on how Marcus screws things up

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.160
thanks buddy thank you very much&nbsp;
that was absolutely necessary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.720
and at the same time his mother is almost&nbsp;
back and of course is now endangered as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.520
if he could have just stayed put this could have&nbsp;
easily been avoided i don't get why characters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.720
act so stupidly sometimes but then i remember&nbsp;
i'm watching a movie anyway Marcus hides in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.520
this giant soundproof oven or whatever the heck&nbsp;
that is but the bad thing is he forgot to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:21.040
the white cloth to prevent the door from locking&nbsp;
him in trapping himself and the baby of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:26.560
after just a few minutes he's already starting&nbsp;
to slowly suffocate but in this relatively big&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.840
enclosed space he could easily survive for a&nbsp;
few hours before he would actually suffocate we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:37.760
made the calculations in our video on how to beat&nbsp;
being buried alive Evelyn comes for help because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.920
she is a badass woman i love her the way she beats&nbsp;
this attack is pretty amazing plus we also learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:49.760
another interesting fact about these aliens so&nbsp;
what she does is she draws the attention to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:55.120
then shoots a bullet neatly on a coated surface&nbsp;
with fuel and covers the alien in flames it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.840
doesn't seem to work though which implies that&nbsp;
they could be indestructible her plan however&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:05.280
wasn't a fire attack in the first place but to&nbsp;
trigger the sprinkler system above water still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.600
seems to be the most reliable tactic in order&nbsp;
to distract them but if i were her i would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.880
thrown a big rock into a distant corner and only&nbsp;
then vanish on the ground in any way though she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.800
able to save Marcus and her baby in time meanwhile&nbsp;
Regan and Emmett arrive on the island they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:26.400
really know what to expect being careful as they&nbsp;
are they slowly walk into the island only to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:33.840
cheerful people having a nice barbecue with a big&nbsp;
bone fire huh i want you to imagine for a second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.400
the look Dr. Neville and i am legend would have&nbsp;
made if he suddenly found a bunch of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.600
having a blast telling him they have long found&nbsp;
the vaccine i guess the look that you would get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:50.000
would be something like this one right here if you&nbsp;
needed what the moment today i guess this was it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.120
now they socialize with the people and find&nbsp;
out how those people got onto the island&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.960
apparently there were multiple ships setting out&nbsp;
for sail shortly after the aliens have landed but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.760
of course panic started which led the monsters&nbsp;
to kill off pretty much everyone at the pier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.960
the lucky few that survived made it onto this&nbsp;
island now you must be pretty thankful to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:19.840
in the shoes of these people right it would&nbsp;
be a shame if a monster somehow made it over

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.600
having now broken out it starts&nbsp;
to wreak havoc here as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.720
now i'm happy they have sent out signals so&nbsp;
that our characters had the chance to be rescued&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.800
but the security measures for coming to this&nbsp;
island they suck the whole place is in chaos okay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:42.240
people running everywhere at the same time Emmett&nbsp;
Regan and their new friend jump into the car&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.840
and try to get to the local radio station luring&nbsp;
away the alien a stressful chase breaks out

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.560
their goal is to use the tools at the station to&nbsp;
immobilize the creature with loud noise of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.120
but just when they arrive our new friend here&nbsp;
commits a fatal mistake that only beginners&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:07.360
would do he turns his back to the monster and&nbsp;
gets swished away now at the same time Evelyn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.920
and Marcus back at the hideout also get into&nbsp;
a dangerous situation when they get noticed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:18.080
one of the aliens they're just barely able to take&nbsp;
refuge inside the oven but get attacked vigorously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:23.280
and are about to get killed on the island though&nbsp;
Regan slowly makes it into the studio while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:29.120
Emmett tries to shield off the monster even though&nbsp;
Regan takes her time she eventually grabs the mic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:34.000
puts her cochlear implant on it and creates a&nbsp;
shrieking feedback noise that blocks off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.680
monster at the same time she turns on the radio on&nbsp;
air and streams the sounds to any device that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.960
tuned in and that is when Marcus who by the&nbsp;
way really seems to love wearing headphones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.160
figures out that Regan is alive&nbsp;
and that the signal that was sent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:55.360
is a perfectly timed blessing and then as i have&nbsp;
told you at the beginning of this video both kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.640
rise up walk pretty [ __ ] awesome to their&nbsp;
respective opponent and kill them off as if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:06.320
they have never done anything else how about&nbsp;
that empowering boys and girls gotta love it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.680
this was a pretty great sequel although&nbsp;
the first one has still the edge for me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:17.520
what do you think let me know any of your thoughts&nbsp;
and binge another one how about that peace
