00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.200
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain an apocalyptic, drama, sci-fi,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.520
and thriller film called "Right at Your Door."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.840
On a typical Monday morning in Los&nbsp;
Angeles, an unemployed musician named Brad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.520
prepares coffee for his wife, Lexi, and&nbsp;
wakes her up to get her ready for work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.520
Before Lexi leaves the house, he warns her&nbsp;
that there's heavy traffic on route 101,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.760
so he advises her to take the side streets.&nbsp;
As Brad brushes his teeth to start his day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.640
he hears some troubling news about&nbsp;
multiple explosions across the city.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.320
As he learns more about the incident,&nbsp;
he begins to worry about his wife,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.040
so he tries calling Lexi on her cellphone. After&nbsp;
failing to connect to a line, he decides to go out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.200
and see what's happening on the streets. Although&nbsp;
their street appears to be quiet, he hears sirens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.200
blaring not far from their house. He immediately&nbsp;
runs back home when he hears the phone ringing.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.240
When he answers the call, his friend Steve&nbsp;
asks him if Lexi is in downtown, which has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.120
been affected by the blasts. He hangs up to call&nbsp;
Lexi again, but he still couldn't contact her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.560
While trying to get reception on the T.V.,&nbsp;
he hears the reporter on the radio mention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.920
plumes of smoke rising from the downtown&nbsp;
skyline, so he goes out to take a look.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.600
By that time, a red alert has&nbsp;
been issued throughout the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.040
Brad leaves Lexi a message, telling her&nbsp;
that he's going downtown to fetch her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.040
He asks her to give him a call to let him know&nbsp;
what route she's taking when she heads back home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.120
Brad tries heading downtown while listening&nbsp;
to the radio in his car. The reporter advises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.360
people not to enter any disaster zones because&nbsp;
the streets need to be open for rescue vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.560
A field reporter describes the chaotic&nbsp;
scene on the streets, noting that people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.600
are screaming as they run around trying to&nbsp;
find their way out of the disaster zones.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.960
Brad sees another car being blocked by the police,&nbsp;
so he backs away and tries to find another route.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.240
As he tries to avoid another vehicle,&nbsp;
he accidentally drives into the curb,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.480
blowing one of his front tires. He goes to a&nbsp;
hardware store and asks if they have a tire patch,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.360
but the clerk tells him that the store&nbsp;
will close soon because the news advises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.400
everyone to get off the streets. He&nbsp;
gets out of the store empty-handed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.200
but when he hears the news about toxic&nbsp;
chemicals spreading through the air,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.120
he goes back to buy a few rolls of duct&nbsp;
tape. The store closes as soon as he leaves.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.080
As Brad goes on his way, he witnesses the police&nbsp;
stopping a car, saying the occupant needs to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.720
quarantined due to contamination. A police officer&nbsp;
approaches Brad advising him to leave his window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.280
up. When the officer tells Brad to go home, he&nbsp;
explains that he needs to fetch his wife downtown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.280
However, the cop tells Brad that all the streets&nbsp;
heading downtown have been shut. The police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.120
officer warns him that the smoke is moving in&nbsp;
their direction and the ashes are poisonous.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.280
Not long after, the driver of the other car gets&nbsp;
out and tries to leave on foot, but the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.600
shoot him. Brad decides to drive back, fearing&nbsp;
that the cops will also shoot him if he insists&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.720
on driving downtown. On his way back, he sees a&nbsp;
child watching the smoke rising to the sky. Brad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.320
gets out of the car and tells the kid to go home,&nbsp;
warning him that something terrible has happened.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.960
When he arrives home, he tries the phone&nbsp;
again, but he still can't get an open line.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.480
A man suddenly barges into the house,&nbsp;
begging Brad to let him stay there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.200
The man, named Alvaro, explains that he&nbsp;
works next door but his boss is not home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.520
Alvaro can't go home because there are no more&nbsp;
buses on the road and he has no car of his own.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.160
Alvaro turns on the radio while Brad tries to&nbsp;
contact his wife again. He tunes into a Spanish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.560
radio station and tells Brad that they should seal&nbsp;
the house. Brad hesitates, knowing that Lexi is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.480
still out there. He tells Alvaro that they're&nbsp;
not going to do anything until Lexi gets home.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.000
After some time, Brad decides to seal the house&nbsp;
after not hearing anything from Lexi. Alvaro helps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.160
him move the furniture and seal the doors and&nbsp;
windows with duct tape and plastic. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.240
riots have started to break out across the city&nbsp;
as the people try to leave the quarantine area.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.400
Brad takes some blankets and bottles of water&nbsp;
outside the house for Lexi if she comes back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.400
As the ashes start to fall in their area, Alvaro&nbsp;
tells Brad that his wife is probably safe.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.320
The news announces that authorities will&nbsp;
distribute antibiotics to houses within the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.720
disaster zones soon. The report further advises&nbsp;
people to avoid contact with anyone who was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.360
near the explosions. Soon, Brad receives&nbsp;
a call from Lexi's mother, Mrs. Fontana,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.360
to ask them if they're doing alright. Brad&nbsp;
tells her that they're okay and they've sealed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.920
the house. When Mrs. Fontana asks to speak to&nbsp;
Lexi, Brad hangs up to avoid explaining that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.080
her daughter is still out there. Brad tells Alvaro&nbsp;
that he regrets not going out there for his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.480
Alvaro, however, asserts that Brad probably&nbsp;
would've been killed if he went out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.000
Brad breaks down and cries,&nbsp;
not knowing if Lexi is safe.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.160
In Downtown L.A., Lexi had managed to survive&nbsp;
the explosions, but she appears to be affected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.040
by the toxic ash. After a few hours, Brad&nbsp;
hears Lexi calling for him outside the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.880
She asks him to open the door, but Brad&nbsp;
hesitates, with tears flowing from his eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.680
Lexi explains that the blast was about half a&nbsp;
block from her car. She discloses that she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.280
already having a hard time breathing. Brad&nbsp;
assures her that he'll get her to a hospital,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.040
but he still won't open the door. Lexi starts&nbsp;
begging Brad to let her in, but he explains that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.960
he can't open it because she's contaminated&nbsp;
with toxic chemicals. He points out that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.560
news advised people who were in the red zones&nbsp;
at the time of the blast to undergo quarantine.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.280
Brad assures Lexi that she won't stay outside&nbsp;
for long. He tells Lexi to go to the back of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.040
the house, so she walks over there and sees the&nbsp;
blankets and water bottles that Brad prepared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.200
for her. She starts to wonder if Brad had&nbsp;
planned on locking her out of her own home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.880
Brad then reluctantly tells her that the&nbsp;
neighbor's handyman is inside the house with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.720
Lexi is furious to hear that Brad won't let&nbsp;
her in, but he allowed a stranger to stay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.720
As Lexi cries in despair, Brad tells her&nbsp;
to calm down and wait for more information.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.960
He assures Lexi that he'll stay with her right&nbsp;
behind the door. Meanwhile, the news reveals that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.720
the toxic chemicals also contain an unknown&nbsp;
viral strain that is very lethal to humans.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.120
Later that night, Brad explains that he left&nbsp;
the door open and waited for Lexi as long as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.760
he could. When he decided to seal the house,&nbsp;
he hoped that Lexi was safe somewhere. The news&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.000
soon announces that those who were in the affected&nbsp;
areas should remain quarantined for several days.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.680
Lexi gets impatient and breaks the door&nbsp;
with her cellphone. Brad quickly covers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.440
the hole with a blanket and cuts his arm on&nbsp;
the glass. Lexi keeps trying to break in by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.240
throwing a chair at the door. Alvaro runs over&nbsp;
and helps Brad reseal the door. He then claims&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.120
that the radio announced that a medical team&nbsp;
would stop by the neighborhood in the morning.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.920
Lexi asks Brad if he wants to go on without her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.480
but Brad assures Lexi that he loves her and will&nbsp;
get some help for her. Brad tries calling 911,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.080
but an automated message tells him that the&nbsp;
system is experiencing a high volume of calls.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.240
Meanwhile, Alvaro tries calling&nbsp;
his wife, but no one answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.400
When Lexi's phone rings, Brad looks at the caller&nbsp;
and finds out that it's her mother. He discloses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.000
that her mother also called earlier, but he&nbsp;
hung up on her after telling her they're okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.480
Brad goes to the bathroom and&nbsp;
washes his wound with bleach,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.240
but he feels unsatisfied, so he decides to&nbsp;
pour the whole bottle all over his body.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.960
The following day, Brad starts worrying when he&nbsp;
doesn't see Lexi outside as sirens blare on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.840
streets. Not far from the house, Lexi sees the&nbsp;
police detaining people, so she hides from them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.920
When she sees the cops load the person into&nbsp;
the back of a van, she runs back to the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.800
Brad tells her not to let the cops see her&nbsp;
because he witnessed them shooting someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.760
when he went out to get her. Lexi is&nbsp;
somewhat pleased to hear that Brad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.280
tried to fetch her. When she asks when the&nbsp;
doctors would arrive in the neighborhood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.760
Brad tells him that Alvaro had lied to keep them&nbsp;
both calm. Lexi asks Brad for her phone, so Brad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.840
goes back inside to seal the doors to the bedroom.&nbsp;
When he's done, he tells Lexi to go inside.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.720
Brad reveals that he was able to contact the&nbsp;
hotline, but they didn't tell him anything useful.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.080
Lexi senses that Brad isn't telling her&nbsp;
everything, so she speculates that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.680
authorities must've told him some bad news.&nbsp;
Brad tells her that they should just talk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.320
adding that nobody is sure about what's happening.&nbsp;
Lexi, however, loses hope and breaks down crying.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.720
When Lexi receives a call from her mother again,&nbsp;
she tells her mom that she's not feeling well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.560
because she was near the explosions. Mrs.&nbsp;
Fontana urges her in a panicked voice to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.920
get some help at a hospital, but Lexi points&nbsp;
out that she can't go anywhere because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.320
police are arresting everyone outside. As Mrs.&nbsp;
Fontana continues to press her to find help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.640
Lexi gets frustrated and tells&nbsp;
her that she's stressing her out.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.800
Lexi is suddenly distracted from the call&nbsp;
when someone outside activates the car alarm.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.480
When she sees that it's a child, Lexi&nbsp;
hangs up and tells the kid to come over.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.040
Lexi takes the child named Timmy into&nbsp;
the bedroom and gives him some water.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.480
When the landline starts ringing, Brad&nbsp;
refuses to answer, saying he doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.840
want to keep telling people that everything's&nbsp;
fine while they're going through a catastrophe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.880
He advises Alvaro to leave the house if&nbsp;
he has any problem with what he's doing.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.520
Lexi tells Brad that she wants to give Timmy&nbsp;
a bath to wash off the ashes on his body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.920
Brad reveals that he also saw Timmy on the street&nbsp;
the previous day, and he told him to go home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.600
When Timmy asks why he can't go inside, Brad&nbsp;
explains that they're trying to keep the dust&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.680
out of the house. Timmy discloses that he wasn't&nbsp;
able to go home because he got scared of the bomb.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.720
When Brad goes to the kitchen, Alvaro notifies&nbsp;
him that he's leaving the house. Brad tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.560
him that he didn't mean what he said earlier,&nbsp;
but Alvaro says he needs to be with his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.800
Alvaro has managed to contact his cousin, but&nbsp;
his cousin hasn't heard from Alvaro's wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.840
Brad suggests calling his neighbor&nbsp;
to find out if his wife is there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.440
Alvaro advises Brad to stay with Lexi&nbsp;
and let her know that she's not alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.040
He tells Brad that he'll exit the house through&nbsp;
the office, so Brad must seal the door to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.280
hallway. Alvaro asserts that he never should've&nbsp;
entered the house, but Brad points out that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.920
wouldn't have been able to seal up the&nbsp;
house in time if Alvaro wasn't there.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.160
After sealing the door, Brad knocks&nbsp;
to let Alvaro know that he can leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.200
Brad watches Alvaro as he goes on his way. Later&nbsp;
on, Brad seals up the hallway to the bathroom so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.280
Lexi and Timmy could take a bath. Brad has started&nbsp;
to feel disdainful of the authorities handling the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.280
catastrophe. He sarcastically tells Lexi that the&nbsp;
authorities called earlier to tell them that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.680
water is free from toxins and boys like Timmy are&nbsp;
immune from the chemicals. He quips that everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.120
is immune to the toxins, and the disaster&nbsp;
is just a big public service announcement.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.080
While getting ready to go to bed, Lexi hears a&nbsp;
noise outside the house. Brad gets a flashlight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.840
and sees a man in the backyard, so he tells&nbsp;
Lexi to get away from the back of the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.080
Lexi takes Timmy to the bathroom and goes back&nbsp;
to see what's happening. Soon, the man outside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.080
starts knocking at the window and calls out to&nbsp;
Lexi. She realizes that it's her friend Rick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.800
so she opens the window. Rick tells Lexi that&nbsp;
he will find the children's hospital where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.880
authorities are setting up an airlock. He invites&nbsp;
Lexi to go with him, but she points out that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.960
authorities will soon distribute antibiotics&nbsp;
in the area. Rick is skeptical that help will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.960
arrive in the neighborhood, so he points out that&nbsp;
there's a Navy medical ship docking off San Pedro.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.880
Lexi tells Brad about the ship, but he&nbsp;
urges her not to go near Rick because he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.080
could be in a worse condition than her.&nbsp;
Lexi points out that she's dying too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.280
so she goes back to talk to Rick, who tells&nbsp;
her that they only need to get on the right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.040
side of the barricades at the hospital to&nbsp;
get treatment. When Lexi returns to Brad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.440
he apologizes to her, saying he should be the&nbsp;
one taking her to the hospital. Lexi tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.800
that she'll also take Timmy along with her,&nbsp;
noting that it's their only chance to survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.840
She promises Brad that she'll come&nbsp;
back to him after getting treatment.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.720
That night, several soldiers arrive at the house&nbsp;
trying to find out if Brad is contaminated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.680
The man identifying himself as Corporal Marshall&nbsp;
asks Brad to stay inside the house until he goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.040
through a pre-screening process. When&nbsp;
Brad asks if they have any medicine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.640
the corporal tells him they're just gathering&nbsp;
data at the moment. When they learn that Lexi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.480
broke a window, they ask Brad to gather&nbsp;
a toxin sample that got inside the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.920
After giving them the sample, the corporal&nbsp;
urges him to keep his house sealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.320
He advises Brad to avoid close contact with&nbsp;
his wife if she returns. They put a red tag&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.000
on the house but don't explain to Brad what&nbsp;
it means. When they inspect the bedroom,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.320
Brad repeatedly tells them to get out of the house&nbsp;
since they're not providing him with any medicine.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.440
Later, Lexi comes back to the house and&nbsp;
tells Brad that the authorities took&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.200
all the children in the crowd, including&nbsp;
Timmy, and gave them medicine. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.160
the police took Rick and shoved him&nbsp;
into a van along with four other people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.880
so she started running. Brad tells Lexi that&nbsp;
soldiers stopped by the house earlier. Lexi is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.040
alarmed upon seeing the red tag on their house,&nbsp;
surmising that it's probably a bad sign. Lexi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.800
goes to the back of the house and recounts the&nbsp;
chaotic scene at the hospital. She doesn't think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.240
that anyone is still coming to give them medicine&nbsp;
because the hospitals appear to be overwhelmed.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.720
When Lexi hears a loud thud in the backyard,&nbsp;
she investigates with a flashlight and finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.960
out that birds are falling from the sky. Lexi&nbsp;
is unable to sleep, so she starts listening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.800
to her voice messages to pass the time. When&nbsp;
she hears a message from her brother Jason,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.120
she decides to give him a call. Jason&nbsp;
asks her if she went to get help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.120
but Lexi insists that there's nothing she can do&nbsp;
anymore. She tells him that she called because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.960
she just wants to talk. Jason calms down&nbsp;
and starts talking about their old house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.160
Soon, Lexi starts feeling unwell, so she&nbsp;
tells Jason that she loves him and hangs up.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.640
The following day, Brad tells Lexi that she did&nbsp;
something amazing by saving Timmy. She starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.320
apologizing to Brad, saying their fights in&nbsp;
the past few days seem stupid considering their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.640
current situation. As they run out of things to&nbsp;
talk about, she suddenly tells Brad that she had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.120
some doubts about getting married. Brad, on the&nbsp;
other hand, never once had any doubts about her.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.360
Brad suggests talking about the children they&nbsp;
never had, but Lexi hints that she's glad they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.320
didn't have kids because they probably&nbsp;
wouldn't be able to raise them right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.160
Brad surmises that they'll end up on a talk&nbsp;
show to explain how they managed to survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.080
He will also have to confess how much he loves&nbsp;
Lexi and how she makes his life complete. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.480
Brad sees Lexi spitting out blood, he apologizes,&nbsp;
but Lexi tells him it's not anyone's fault.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.880
Suddenly, two soldiers arrive at the&nbsp;
back of the house and take Lexi away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.520
As Brad yells at them, a soldier brandishing a&nbsp;
gun tells him to stay put. A few minutes later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.760
the soldier informs him that his wife is safe and&nbsp;
he did the right thing to keep her sealed outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.280
The soldier reveals that the level of&nbsp;
toxicity in the house has become irreversible,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.320
and it has become a breeding ground&nbsp;
for the poison. The soldier further&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.040
notifies him that he has become a lethal&nbsp;
carrier and there's nothing they can do.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.360
The soldier tells him not to struggle as&nbsp;
they begin boarding up the entire house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.040
As Brad calls out to them to ask more questions,&nbsp;
they drill a hole through the door and inserts a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.160
pipe. Not long, the pipe starts expelling an&nbsp;
unknown gas, causing Brad to cough profusely.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.160
Brad tries unlocking the doors, yelling that he's&nbsp;
still in the house, but the soldiers keep boarding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.160
up the doors and windows with plywood. Brad&nbsp;
manages to break through the plywood at the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.400
but he finds out that the house is already covered&nbsp;
with a fumigation tent. He repeatedly tells them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.320
that he's still alive, but they ignore him&nbsp;
and continue securing the tent. Lexi tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.680
to break free from the soldiers to help Brad,&nbsp;
but they hold her back and bring her to a van.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.360
As Brad struggles to get out of the tent,&nbsp;
a soldier hits him with the butt of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.360
firearm to knock him down. Brad soon stops&nbsp;
struggling as he takes his last few breaths.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.600
Moments later, a nurse tells Lexi that there's&nbsp;
nothing they could've done for Brad because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.680
the virus inside the house has grown out of&nbsp;
control. Lexi stares into space in shock from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.840
what happened to her husband. The nurse advises&nbsp;
Lexi to pray, saying she still might survive.
