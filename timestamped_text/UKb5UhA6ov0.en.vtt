00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.967
Hey everyone.

00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:04.734
Welcome back to Movie Recap.

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:06.896
Today&nbsp;I'm gonna show you a movie called,

00:00:06.896 --> 00:00:07.879
Evil Dead.

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:10.829
It is a 2013 American supernatural horror film

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:14.628
directed by Federico lvarez, and produced by Robert Tapert,

00:00:14.628 --> 00:00:16.949
Sam Raimi, and Bruce Campbell.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.283
The movie is about five friends head to a remote cabin,

00:00:20.283 --> 00:00:22.200
where the discovery of a "Book of the Dead"

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.999
leads them to unwittingly summon up demons living in the nearby woods.

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.405
Let s start...!

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.567
The film starts with a young woman walking&nbsp;through the woods.

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:42.212
She's dripping with blood.

00:00:42.212 --> 00:00:45.112
A figure stalks her and eventually jumps her,

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:46.549
throwing a bag over her head

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:49.945
and having his redneck buddy whack her with the butt of his axe.

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:51.344
The woman wakes up in a cellar

00:00:51.344 --> 00:00:53.804
in the presence of a woman who speaks only Welsh,

00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:57.104
and she's&nbsp;surrounded by what appear to be burn victims.

00:00:57.104 --> 00:00:59.712
The young woman's father appears before her.

00:00:59.712 --> 00:01:03.782
She&nbsp;asks for her mother, and the father tells her that she killed her mother.

00:01:03.782 --> 00:01:06.527
The old woman&nbsp;hurries the father to kill his daughter,

00:01:06.527 --> 00:01:09.477
and so he douses her with gas as she pleads with&nbsp;him.

00:01:09.477 --> 00:01:10.978
Before he can strike a match,

00:01:10.978 --> 00:01:13.425
the young woman tells him she will eat his soul.

00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:16.462
Her eyes turn&nbsp;yellow, and as the father drops the match,

00:01:16.462 --> 00:01:19.066
she appears demonic and starts thrashing.

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:22.204
The father&nbsp;raises a shotgun, tells her he loves her,

00:01:22.204 --> 00:01:25.020
and then blasts her head clean off her shoulders.

00:01:26.306 --> 00:01:30.634
Sometime later, a car is driving to a quiet part of the woods where a cabin is.

00:01:30.634 --> 00:01:34.570
We meet David,&nbsp;his girlfriend Natalie, and their friends Olivia,

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.404
who is a nurse, and Eric.

00:01:36.404 --> 00:01:40.619
Olivia tells David his&nbsp;sister Mia is waiting for him in the back.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.940
David finds Mia, sitting on an old broken down&nbsp;1973 Olds Delta 88,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.191
smoking a cigarette while drawing.

00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:52.806
He tells her she looks beautiful,&nbsp;but she thinks he's being a liar.

00:01:54.252 --> 00:01:56.092
Everyone gathers around a well.

00:01:56.092 --> 00:01:58.620
Mia, being a recovering drug addict,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.173
pulls out a bag of powdered drugs and pours it&nbsp;down the well,

00:02:02.173 --> 00:02:05.104
vowing to be done with it for good and going cold turkey.

00:02:06.588 --> 00:02:10.160
The group enters the cabin, where Mia complains about a smell.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.121
We learn here&nbsp;that Mia fondly remembers her mother,

00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:15.105
but David doesn't want her to.

00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:19.487
It also appears that their&nbsp;mother was emotionally abusive toward Mia.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.200
That evening, Mia starts screaming as she&nbsp;is apparently suffering from withdrawals.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.600
Olivia gives her a sedative but Mia&nbsp;continues complaining about a rotten smell

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.520
that nobody else seems to notice.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.539
Their dog,&nbsp;Grandpa, sniffs around the floor

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:37.604
where they find a door leading to a cellar under a rug.

00:02:37.604 --> 00:02:39.568
The floor is smeared with blood.

00:02:39.568 --> 00:02:41.320
David and Eric go into the cellar

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.161
and discover the stench&nbsp;is coming from the rotting corpses of animals.

00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:49.605
They also find the "Evil Book" from&nbsp;before, wrapped in wires and plastic.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.060
The next day, Mia is wandering outside in the&nbsp;rain.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.178
Eric opens the cover of the book,

00:02:56.178 --> 00:02:59.445
which is scribbled all over with warnings like "Leave&nbsp;this book alone"

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.071
and "Do not fucking read this."

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.355
Naturally, Eric looks through it

00:03:03.355 --> 00:03:05.989
and finds a page&nbsp;with some words scribbled out

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.458
and the warning to not speak, write, or hear what is in it.

00:03:09.458 --> 00:03:13.585
He puts&nbsp;a piece of paper over the book and shades over it with a pencil,

00:03:13.585 --> 00:03:16.496
revealing several words that he&nbsp;begins to read.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:20.900
Outside, Mia starts being sick and hears a faint voice calling her,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.720
and then sees a figure staring at her.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.440
She comes into the cabin and&nbsp;starts grabbing her things,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.506
saying she can't be there anymore.

00:03:29.506 --> 00:03:32.288
She&nbsp;jumps out the window and steals Eric's car,

00:03:32.288 --> 00:03:33.851
but as she drives through the woods,

00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:37.120
she sees the&nbsp;figure again and drives the car into a swamp.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.601
When she comes to, Mia tries to get out,

00:03:41.601 --> 00:03:43.474
but the&nbsp;figure rises from the swamp,

00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:46.586
and she runs away, tumbling into a thorn bush.

00:03:46.586 --> 00:03:49.944
The branches and&nbsp;sticks wrap themselves around her arms and legs,

00:03:49.944 --> 00:03:53.745
and the figure, which is a bloodied&nbsp;and horrifying version of herself,

00:03:53.745 --> 00:03:56.260
regurgitates a black wormy thing with&nbsp;thorns

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.795
that makes its way up Mia's leg and goes right inside her.

00:03:59.795 --> 00:04:02.240
David and&nbsp;Olivia hear her screaming and find her.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.760
The group suspects she was trying to harm herself.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.268
David goes into her room,

00:04:09.268 --> 00:04:12.938
and she tells him that&nbsp;there is something in the room with them.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.909
He goes outside and sees blood on the ground.

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:22.046
He&nbsp;calls for Grandpa and finds him in a hole beneath the tool shed.

00:04:22.046 --> 00:04:23.514
Grandpa is whimpering.

00:04:23.514 --> 00:04:27.945
David runs&nbsp;into the tool shed and pulls him out of the hole, but he's dead.

00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:30.706
David suspects Mia bludgeoned him&nbsp;to death with a hammer

00:04:30.706 --> 00:04:32.105
that was lying nearby.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.669
He runs back into the cabin

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.926
and tries to&nbsp;get to Mia, but she's taking a shower.

00:04:38.926 --> 00:04:40.677
She turns the water up to the&nbsp;point

00:04:40.677 --> 00:04:44.213
where it becomes scalding hot and her flesh starts burning.

00:04:44.213 --> 00:04:46.123
The group pulls her out in time.

00:04:46.123 --> 00:04:48.249
Eric looks at an open page in the book

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:51.040
and notices&nbsp;a picture of a being with burning flesh.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.973
David takes Mia in his Jeep

00:04:54.973 --> 00:04:57.989
and drives her&nbsp;to a hospital as she's foaming at the mouth.

00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:01.798
Unfortunately, the roads are&nbsp;flooded, and he has to turn back.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.819
Olivia gives Mia another sedative.

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.726
While the group&nbsp;argues about her,

00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:10.367
she comes into the living room dragging a rifle.

00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:12.828
She holds it up, and fires near&nbsp;David,

00:05:12.828 --> 00:05:16.325
and the door swings open as Mia lets out a frightening scream.

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:21.185
She says in a possessed&nbsp;voice "You are all going to die tonight."

00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:23.540
Olivia tries to get the rifle away from her,

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.831
but Mia tackles her as her eyes turn yellow and she spits blood all over her.

00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:30.826
Olivia kicks her into the cellar, and Eric closes it.

00:05:30.826 --> 00:05:34.833
He suspects this has to do&nbsp;with the stuff they found down in the cellar.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.520
Olivia tries to clean the&nbsp;blood and throw up off herself,

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.600
but she sees an image of herself&nbsp;mutilated in the mirror, which shatters.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.864
She walks away but then freezes, and her eyes&nbsp;twitch as she wets herself.

00:05:50.794 --> 00:05:54.310
Next to her is the book, open to a page with a person holding&nbsp;a knife

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.175
and their severed face flesh.

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:01.130
Eric goes into the bathroom to find Olivia,

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.244
who&nbsp;is cutting the flesh from her cheek with the broken glass.

00:06:04.244 --> 00:06:08.511
Horrified, he stumbles backward&nbsp;and slips on the cheek flesh.

00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:12.550
Olivia stabs him with the broken glass and then in the face with&nbsp;the needle.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.585
Eric throws her off and breaks off a piece of the toilet,

00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:19.840
which he uses to bludgeon her&nbsp;to death, just as David and Natalie come in.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.100
David tries to patch up Eric's wounds.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.309
He tells&nbsp;Natalie to bring a jug of water and sugar.

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:29.743
Eric tells her to stay away from Mia.

00:06:29.743 --> 00:06:32.540
He tells&nbsp;David that it's his fault this is happening

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.391
because he read from the book.

00:06:36.653 --> 00:06:40.551
Natalie goes to the living room and finds that the cellar door is open.

00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:43.641
Mia is&nbsp;still down there, crying and asking for help.

00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:46.067
As Natalie tries to go down and get her,

00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:48.806
Mia's&nbsp;voice becomes low and demonic and threatening,

00:06:48.806 --> 00:06:51.481
saying "He won't stop until he has all of you!"

00:06:51.481 --> 00:06:55.662
Natalie tries to run but Mia grabs her and bites into her hand.

00:06:55.662 --> 00:06:58.275
She tries to defend herself with&nbsp;a box cutter

00:06:58.275 --> 00:07:01.866
but Mia takes it from her and slices her tongue down the middle.

00:07:01.866 --> 00:07:05.456
She grabs Natalie&nbsp;and kisses her, forcing blood into her mouth.

00:07:05.456 --> 00:07:08.066
David finds them and pulls Natalie out.

00:07:08.066 --> 00:07:11.158
They nail&nbsp;the cellar door shut, locking Mia down there.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.140
David finds Eric trying to burn the book,&nbsp;but it doesn't work.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.556
He tells David about what he knows from the book,

00:07:19.556 --> 00:07:23.285
an evil entity&nbsp;has been unleashed, and it's attached to Mia's soul.

00:07:23.285 --> 00:07:27.293
It seeks a collection of souls to&nbsp;unleash something called the Abomination.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.266
Meanwhile, Natalie tends to the bite wound on&nbsp;her hand.

00:07:32.266 --> 00:07:37.075
It starts to burn into her arm and she notices an electric knife and reaches for&nbsp;it.

00:07:37.075 --> 00:07:40.314
Mia peeks from the cellar and tells her not to cut it off,

00:07:40.314 --> 00:07:42.366
but Natalie slices into her arm.

00:07:42.366 --> 00:07:44.960
David and Eric find her as her arm falls off.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.257
Eric tells David there are three ways to put an&nbsp;end to this.

00:07:52.257 --> 00:07:55.452
Bury Mia alive, dismember her, or burn her alive.

00:07:55.452 --> 00:07:59.362
David refuses to do any of that,&nbsp;and Eric calls him a coward.

00:07:59.362 --> 00:08:02.317
Suddenly, a noise is heard, and Natalie comes in,

00:08:02.317 --> 00:08:04.819
now possessed, with&nbsp;nails in her head.

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:08.847
She's holding a nail gun and shoots at Eric, who gets a few nails in him.

00:08:08.847 --> 00:08:12.931
David&nbsp;tries to get the rifle, but Natalie starts hitting him with a crowbar.

00:08:12.931 --> 00:08:14.853
Eric shoots her with the nail&nbsp;gun,

00:08:14.853 --> 00:08:17.667
and she goes to start bludgeoning him with the crowbar.

00:08:17.667 --> 00:08:22.092
Before she can deliver the fatal&nbsp;blow, David blows her hand off with the rifle.

00:08:22.092 --> 00:08:24.308
Natalie appears to revert back to normal,

00:08:24.308 --> 00:08:26.400
complaining about the pain before she dies.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.920
David finally decides to burn&nbsp;the cabin with Mia still inside.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.526
He pours gasoline on the floor, but before he&nbsp;can drop the lighter,

00:08:37.526 --> 00:08:40.811
Mia, in her normal voice, starts singing a lullaby

00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:43.922
that their mother&nbsp;used to sing, and David cannot do it.

00:08:43.922 --> 00:08:48.056
Outside, a bolt of lightning strikes a tree, setting&nbsp;it on fire.

00:08:48.056 --> 00:08:49.757
He hatches another plan.

00:08:49.757 --> 00:08:54.400
He grabs two syringes, among other things,&nbsp;and starts to dig up a hole outside.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.290
He heads into the cellar.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.994
He finds Mia,&nbsp;who slashes at him with the box cutter and throws him around.

00:09:02.994 --> 00:09:06.432
She tries to drown him,&nbsp;but Eric steps in and hits Mia.

00:09:06.432 --> 00:09:09.610
He's also been stuck with the box cutter in his stomach.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.284
David goes to him, and Eric finally dies.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.309
David takes Mia outside with a bag over her&nbsp;head and starts to bury her.

00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:22.325
She talks to him in her normal voice

00:09:22.325 --> 00:09:24.840
and pleads with him, but&nbsp;he won't buy it.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.203
She starts telling him about their mother and more of her abusiveness.

00:09:28.203 --> 00:09:31.340
Their&nbsp;mother kept asking for David, who was never there,

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.470
and how Mia would have to keep telling her&nbsp;he's coming back.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.006
He completely buries her,

00:09:36.006 --> 00:09:40.336
and then waits a while as the rain stops and the&nbsp;fire on the tree goes out.

00:09:40.336 --> 00:09:43.034
David digs Mia back up and pulls her out.

00:09:43.034 --> 00:09:46.194
He grabs a car battery with the&nbsp;syringes attached to it

00:09:46.194 --> 00:09:49.341
and sticks them in Mia's chest, trying to revive her.

00:09:49.341 --> 00:09:50.494
She doesn't come&nbsp;back.

00:09:50.692 --> 00:09:53.398
He covers her body and walks away tearfully.

00:09:53.398 --> 00:09:56.338
However, Mia rises and talks to David.

00:09:56.338 --> 00:09:59.010
She is&nbsp;completely back to normal, and they hug.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.552
The two go back into the cabin to get the keys&nbsp;to David's Jeep,

00:10:05.552 --> 00:10:09.326
but a possessed Eric is behind him and he stabs David in the neck.

00:10:09.326 --> 00:10:13.615
David&nbsp;goes into the hallway and gets Mia outside and locks her out.

00:10:13.615 --> 00:10:16.714
He grabs the rifle&nbsp;and shoots at the gasoline container,

00:10:16.714 --> 00:10:21.000
letting it consume the cabin in flames&nbsp;and killing himself and Eric for good.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.472
Outside, it starts raining blood.

00:10:25.472 --> 00:10:28.414
A hand bursts&nbsp;from the ground and grabs at Mia.

00:10:28.414 --> 00:10:29.935
It's the Abomination.

00:10:29.935 --> 00:10:34.333
It chases after Mia, who grabs a&nbsp;chainsaw from the tool shed and tries to run.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.053
She hides under the Jeep

00:10:36.053 --> 00:10:39.758
and manages to slice off&nbsp;the Abomination's legs, crippling it.

00:10:39.758 --> 00:10:43.495
As she tries to run, though, the Abomination tips the Jeep over

00:10:43.495 --> 00:10:45.170
and it falls on Mia's arm.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.057
She pulls herself free, severing her arm.

00:10:48.057 --> 00:10:49.993
The Abomination inches toward&nbsp;Mia,

00:10:49.993 --> 00:10:54.160
but she sticks her arm into the handle of the chainsaw and kills the Abomination.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.478
Its corpse sinks back into the ground.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.883
The bloody rain stops, and the sun comes out.

00:11:04.883 --> 00:11:08.584
Mia&nbsp;walks away, now free from the curse, but alone.

00:11:08.584 --> 00:11:11.852
Meanwhile, the book lies&nbsp;outside the burning cabin,

00:11:11.852 --> 00:11:14.827
closing itself and waiting&nbsp;for its next victims.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.442
Thanks for watching.

00:11:18.442 --> 00:11:20.628
