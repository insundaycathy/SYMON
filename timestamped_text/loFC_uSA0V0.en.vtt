00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.520
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going to&nbsp;
explain the third part of a drama mini-series&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:15.920
called “Click Bait,” Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care!
&nbsp;

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.520
Sarah’s brother Simon and his friend Darryl&nbsp;
are hiding something about Nick’s case from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.200
the police. When Detective Roshan informs Pia&nbsp;
about him being in Sacramento to meet Simon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.040
Pia drives there as well. On her way, she is&nbsp;
looking at Simon’s socials and sees he has posted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.720
a picture of him and Darryl the day Nick was&nbsp;
kidnapped. She goes to the motel Roshan is staying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.160
in and meets him. Pia points out the picture&nbsp;
Simon posted and claims that it could be fake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.000
because the rest of Simon's feed is only politics.&nbsp;
Roshan says he notices that himself but doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.080
react much. Pia asks him what they should do&nbsp;
now and moves forward to Roshan. They make out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.960
but Roshan stops her midway, saying that this&nbsp;
could lead to being taken off the case. 
&nbsp;

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.400
Meanwhile, Simon is packing his luggage hurriedly&nbsp;
to run away from the city. As he packs, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.760
box with Sarah’s belongings catches his eye. He&nbsp;
brings it out and reminisces about his sister—the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.120
scene changes to three months prior when Simon&nbsp;
is devastated after Sarah’s death. He has seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.960
the last text messages exchanged between Sarah and&nbsp;
Jeremy and blames the man for killing his sister.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.520
He reads his sister’s journal, where she has&nbsp;
written everything that Jeremy has ever told her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.800
From the journal, Simon and Darryl find out the&nbsp;
couple planned to meet at an Oakland Lynx game.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.680
From this information, they figure out Jeremy&nbsp;
is actually Nick and are able to get his address&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.640
and personal information. The morning Nick got&nbsp;
abducted, Simon and Darryl waited for him on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.960
his daily route to work. A nervous Simon sedated&nbsp;
him forcefully and took him inside the van. 
&nbsp;

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.600
Back in the present, Simon is about to leave the&nbsp;
city when he is approached by Roshan and a police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.040
officer. They want him to come to the police to&nbsp;
get his official statement. Simon obliges and gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.240
inside his own car while the officers get in the&nbsp;
police vehicle. But before they can leave, Simon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.320
gets out of the car and runs away. Roshan follows&nbsp;
him behind, and a chase ensues between the two.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.360
At the same time, Pia goes to Simon’s apartment&nbsp;
building and sees Darryl trying to run away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.920
He recognizes her and asks her what she is doing&nbsp;
there. Pia sees a gun on the man and stays quiet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.720
Darryl tries to abduct her, but she manages&nbsp;
to strike him with her keys and escape.
&nbsp;

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.120
Simon, on the other hand, is eventually caught.&nbsp;
While being arrested, he thinks of the events that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.800
happened after they abducted Nick. The scene cuts&nbsp;
to eleven days prior. Nick is kept in a van with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.800
his hands tied. After he regains consciousness, he&nbsp;
asks the abductors why he is there. Darryl angrily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.600
tells him about Sarah, but Nick claims he doesn’t&nbsp;
know her. When he asks what happened to Sarah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.840
an enraged Simon hits him in the face. They make&nbsp;
him write “I abuse women” and “At 5 million views&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.040
I die” on the paper and videotape it. Simon&nbsp;
uploads it on the internet, saying that Nick’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.440
life is now officially over. Darryl, however, is&nbsp;
still not satisfied. He writes “I killed a woman”&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.440
on the third paper and makes Nick pose with it.&nbsp;
Nick retaliates, saying he didn’t kill anyone. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.720
asks Simon how his sister died and finds out that&nbsp;
she killed herself. Nick asks more questions about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.560
her death, angering Simon even more. He punches&nbsp;
Nick repeatedly, making him sob in pain. 
&nbsp;

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.160
After a while, the video reaches three and a half&nbsp;
million views. Nick asks Simon what makes him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.280
think Nick killed his sister. Simon pulls up his&nbsp;
dating profile on his laptop and shows it to an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.880
utterly surprised Nick. Nick claims that it is not&nbsp;
his profile because he has a wife and two kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.400
Simon, in turn, tells him about Sophie cheating&nbsp;
on him which surprises Nick because he hadn’t told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.840
this to anyone yet. When Nick still denies knowing&nbsp;
Sarah, Simon shows him a picture of him and Sarah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.960
on a beach. Nick claims that it is clearly&nbsp;
photoshopped, but the other two don’t believe him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.480
Sometime later, Nick tells Simon that his father&nbsp;
also killed himself. He reveals that he and Pia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.600
had found their father’s body when they were just&nbsp;
kids. Since Nick also has a sister, he knows what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.480
Simon must have gone through. Nick tries to reason&nbsp;
with Simon, saying that he knows how it feels like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.440
to lose a loved one. He then asks Simon to show&nbsp;
him that picture again. Simon brings out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.640
picture and sees the level of the horizon doesn’t&nbsp;
match, so the picture is clearly edited. 
&nbsp;

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.520
Right then, Darryl calls Simon outside, saying&nbsp;
that the video is at four million now. Back in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.000
the present, Simon sits in the interrogation room&nbsp;
with Roshan. The detective asks him about his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
relationship with Nick, but Simon doesn’t speak.&nbsp;
Instead, he asks to speak to Nick’s sister. Roshan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.040
is surprised but asks Pia to come in anyway.&nbsp;
She sits in front of Simon, who stays quiet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.680
for the most part. Pia reminds him that although&nbsp;
he avenged his sister’s death, he will never get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.000
to be with her or hug her again. She is gone, and&nbsp;
nothing will bring her back. At last, she asks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.400
what he accomplished by killing her brother.
We are then taken back to the time the video had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.080
just hit five million views. Simon and Darryl are&nbsp;
outside the van. An excited Darryl hands Simon a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.160
gun, saying that it is now showtime. Darryl opens&nbsp;
the van’s doors but is instantly attacked by Nick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.320
who has freed himself. Darryl asks Simon to shoot&nbsp;
Nick, but he doesn’t. Nick runs away but is still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.920
followed by Simon. He soon finds Nick and holds&nbsp;
him at gunpoint. Nick explains that whoever did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.920
this had access to his family photos, his life,&nbsp;
and his marriage. He knows who it is because he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.520
had only told one person about his wife’s affair.&nbsp;
Nick promises to find the person who drove Sarah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:38.080
to death and begs Simon to leave him. At last,&nbsp;
Simon lets him go, revealing that he, in fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.280
didn’t kill Nick. Simon apologizes to&nbsp;
Pia and tells her that he let Nick go.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.680
Roshan, however, doesn’t believe him. 
In the following scene, we see Nick’s son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.640
Ethan texting someone named Allison about the&nbsp;
murderer being found. He thanks her for being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.840
there for him all this time. The next day, the&nbsp;
Brewers’ sons return to school for the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.120
time since Nick's disappearance. It is easier for&nbsp;
them because Sophie teaches at the same school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.160
She asks the boys to stay out of trouble and&nbsp;
leaves. Kai’s friends welcome him back, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.040
Ethan is confronted by a bully. The bully makes&nbsp;
jokes about Sophie’s relationship with Curtis,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.640
which angers Ethan, but he doesn’t react. Kai,&nbsp;
who has been listening to the conversation nearby,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.840
loses his temper and attacks the bully. They get&nbsp;
into a fight which is stopped when Ethan pulls Kai&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:30.160
away. The bully’s nose is left bloodied after.
Later, both Ethan and Kai are at the principal's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.120
office with Sophie. Ethan texts his internet&nbsp;
friend, Allison, saying he might be in trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.120
At night, the family is having dinner when Ethan&nbsp;
asks Pia what Nick’s murderers looked like. Pia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.480
answers that they looked sad. She then reveals&nbsp;
that Simon said he let Nick go because he realized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:52.240
he had gotten the wrong person. Andrea says the&nbsp;
killer is obviously lying, but Pia believes him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.320
Sophie takes her aside and asks her to&nbsp;
keep the conspiracy theory to herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.960
She doesn’t want to give her kids false hope&nbsp;
that their dad might have been a good person. 
&nbsp;

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.600
Sometime later, Ethan is in his room texting&nbsp;
Allison again. He tells her about Pia’s theory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.400
making Allison question more about the matter.&nbsp;
He then watches a video of Mandy, the artist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.280
who was one of the girls Nick met online. She&nbsp;
says that she had never met Nick in real life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.720
This shocks Ethan because now, the only person&nbsp;
alive who has claimed to meet Ethan is Emma,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.640
and if she is lying, Nick might be innocent. Ethan&nbsp;
texts Allison about this as well. The following&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.240
day, Sophie leaves for work, leaving the boys&nbsp;
behind. Ethan calls Pia, but she doesn’t pick up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.280
so he goes to her work to meet her. He then&nbsp;
tells her that Nick never met Mandy, making her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.400
believe that Nick might be innocent. Pia calls&nbsp;
Emma to ask her, but she doesn’t pick up.
&nbsp;

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.840
The two then go to the police station to inform&nbsp;
Roshan about the matter. Meanwhile, Sophie finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.640
out from the principal that the bully’s parents&nbsp;
are trying to press charges against Kai. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.600
requests her to arrange a mediation so she can&nbsp;
talk to the parents directly. The principal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.640
accepts to do it but suggests to Sophie that she&nbsp;
and her kids should leave the school to avoid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:08.400
more chaos. In the meantime, Pia tells Roshan&nbsp;
that Mandy has never talked to Nick. But Roshan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.360
dismisses her because that doesn’t prove anything.&nbsp;
He says he will give Emma a call to confirm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.960
and continues to another case. While returning&nbsp;
home, Pia sees Ethan texting someone constantly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:24.400
and asks him who it is. Ethan reveals that it&nbsp;
is his internet friend who he likes. Pia asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.760
him to make sure he is not being catfished. 
When he returns, Sophie then asks Ethan to stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.640
home and leaves with Kai to meet the bully’s&nbsp;
father. Ethan goes through his and Allison’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:40.320
messages and notices a pattern of texts where&nbsp;
she urges him to tell her more about Nick’s case.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.320
He quickly asks her to meet him in real&nbsp;
life, but she claims she cannot meet him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.280
because she has an anxiety disorder. Ethan&nbsp;
realizes that he has been catfished. He throws&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.800
his phone away in frustration but receives a text&nbsp;
from Allison again. She has sent him her location,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.880
so he quickly leaves to meet her. When he finally&nbsp;
knocks on her door, a middle-aged man greets him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.040
Ethan calls him out for catfishing him, but&nbsp;
the man turns out to be Allison’s father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.560
He then meets Allison, who invites him in. 
Meanwhile, Pia goes to Vince again to ask him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.560
figure who was pretending to be Nick in the dating&nbsp;
profiles. Vince, in turn, tells her about Tara,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.280
the girl who dropped out of the volleyball team&nbsp;
after arguing with Ben. She might be able to tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:27.200
who was behind the fake profiles. In the meantime,&nbsp;
Alison and Ethan instantly bond and start talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.720
about Nick’s case. Allison suggests Ethan call&nbsp;
Emma on his own because she might answer his calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.200
since he was supposed to be her stepson.&nbsp;
The two get her social media profile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.640
and video call her. To their surprise, she picks&nbsp;
up the call. Ethan greets her and directly asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:48.400
her if she has met his dad. At first, Emma says&nbsp;
that they were in love but then nervously admits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.200
she never met him. Allison videos the&nbsp;
conversation. After the call, Allison&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.240
tells him that if she gets the pictures that fake&nbsp;
Nick sent to Emma, she can use the metadata to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.440
find where they were sent from. Ethan promises&nbsp;
to ask Emma for the pictures and leaves. 
&nbsp;

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.840
Pia, on the other hand, goes to meet Tara, who&nbsp;
tells her that she and Nick were fighting because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.800
he didn’t want her to leave the volleyball team.&nbsp;
It turns out that Nick’s coworker Matt and Tara&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:18.160
had an affair. When she ended the relationship,&nbsp;
Matt uploaded her nudes on the internet. Nick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.080
was helping her through the situation and not&nbsp;
abusing her. Pia is beyond surprised to hear this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.040
She realizes that Nick is the one who made those&nbsp;
fake dating profiles and rushes to his work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.720
to confirm. She barges into his office and asks&nbsp;
another coworker, Dawn, to unlock Matt’s computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:40.800
which she reluctantly does. At first, she finds&nbsp;
Tara’s pictures. Then, she sees every picture used&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:46.640
in Nick’s dating profile on Matt’s computer. She&nbsp;
is now sure that Matt is the culprit. Pia takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.280
pictures of the computer’s screen as evidence. 
In the meantime, Ethan sends the pictures to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.480
Allison for her to find out the address. Kai&nbsp;
barges into his room and sees him closing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:01.760
tabs abruptly. He asks him what is wrong, but&nbsp;
Ethan dismisses it. Sophie calls them down to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.400
have a chat. She tells them about wanting to&nbsp;
transfer to a different school for a fresh start.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.280
Ethan takes this opportunity to show her the&nbsp;
video of Emma admitting that she never met Nick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.320
Hearing this, Kai sneaks into Ethan’s room&nbsp;
and goes through his computer. Just then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.600
Allison texts Ethan the hacker’s address. Kai&nbsp;
reads the messages and figures out the address&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:27.040
is of the person who stole Nick’s identity. 
In the meantime, Pia calls Roshan and tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.360
him about the pictures she found on Matt’s&nbsp;
computer. Roshan thinks she is overreacting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.880
at first but then believes her. When Pia gets to&nbsp;
her apartment, Matt is waiting for her outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.120
asking her why she broke into his&nbsp;
office. Pia accuses him of abusing Tara,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:47.200
but he denies posting the pictures online. He gets&nbsp;
aggressive but leaves when Pia’s roommate arrives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:53.040
Meanwhile, Sophie checks up on her sons and finds&nbsp;
Kai missing. We see Kai on his way to the address&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.160
that Allison had sent Ethan. He wants to take&nbsp;
revenge on the person who faked being his dad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.520
and even has a baseball bat with him. 
Back home, Ethan checks the “find my fam” app&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:10.080
and sees Kai has turned his phone off. Sophie gets&nbsp;
worried by the second and calls Pia. Just then,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:15.440
Ethan notices Allison’s last text and figures&nbsp;
where Kai must have gone. The scene changes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:21.440
Nick’s very first day at work. Matt takes him in&nbsp;
and introduces Nick to the administration manager,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.080
Dawn Gleed. Back in the present, Kai finally&nbsp;
reaches the address and knocks on the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:32.160
Dawn opens the door and invites him in.&nbsp;
She and her husband Ed share a knowing look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:37.360
while telling the boy to make himself home. Pia&nbsp;
and Sophie make their way to the address in their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.720
own cars. Roshan is informed of the situation as&nbsp;
well. Kai now sits with the old couple in their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.320
dining room. He asks them about the catfish, but&nbsp;
Dawn jokingly says they used to have a goldfish.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.520
Kai feels uncomfortable and says he wants to&nbsp;
return home. Instead of answering the boy, Dawn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:57.760
asks Kai if his mother knows where he is. Kai lies&nbsp;
and says he told everyone before coming there.
&nbsp;

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.320
Ed offers to drive him home and goes to his&nbsp;
room to get the car keys. Dawn follows him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.040
behind nervously, saying that Sophie might have&nbsp;
already called the police. After that, Ed brings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:10.240
out a gun, blaming Dawn for getting them into the&nbsp;
mess. We are taken back to Nick’s first day at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:16.080
work again. Dawn helps him set up his computer and&nbsp;
in the process, gains access to pictures from his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:21.760
phone and his social media credentials. When she&nbsp;
returns home that day, we see her lifestyle has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:27.360
been repetitive and boring for the past several&nbsp;
years. At night, she is in front of her computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.440
Dawn excitedly logs into a dating app as Nick. One&nbsp;
day at work, Dawn comes across Nick day drinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.240
in his office. She asks him what is wrong,&nbsp;
and Nick tells her about Sophie’s affair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:44.400
He trusts her enough to go into details, which she&nbsp;
later tells the girls who she talks to as Nick.
&nbsp;

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:49.920
Back in the present, Sophie and Pia get to Dawn’s&nbsp;
address and break inside the house. No one seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.880
to be home, but the two find Dawn and Ed’s&nbsp;
picture, realizing that she was responsible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:00.240
for stealing Nick’s identity. Meanwhile, the&nbsp;
couple nervously drives Kai away from his home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.880
Dawn throws Kai’s phone out when he tries to&nbsp;
call his mother. Kai begs the two to let him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:10.560
go. They stop the car at a ranch and get the boy&nbsp;
inside a trailer. Dawn is nervous because of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.760
gun Ed possesses, but Ed says that he is not&nbsp;
going to jail at all costs. At the same time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:21.200
the police locate their car in the ranch and&nbsp;
drive to it. Dawn nervously tells Ed she didn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.640
mean to hurt anyone. Ed, in turn, asks her&nbsp;
if she was in love with women she talked to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:31.520
as Nick but Dawn says she was just lonely and&nbsp;
wanted to live a few moments as a young person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:37.360
like Nick. A flashback shows Dawn using a&nbsp;
voice-changing app to talk to Emma on the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:43.280
She tells her how much she loves her as Nick.
That night, she mistakenly leaves her laptop open,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:48.560
and her messages are revealed to Ed. He is&nbsp;
furious at her for stealing someone’s identity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.440
to do something so childish. Dawn begs&nbsp;
for forgiveness, but Ed walks away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:59.360
Right then, Sarah sends her the texts threatening&nbsp;
her to commit suicide. An enraged Dawn texts back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:05.120
that she doesn’t care, driving Sarah to actually&nbsp;
kill herself. When Simon let Nick go that day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.960
he ran to Dawn’s home directly because he knew she&nbsp;
was the only one who had access to his photos and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:16.400
the one person who he told about Sophie’s affair.&nbsp;
Nick confronts Dawn for stealing his identity and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:22.560
asks her to come to him to the police. Just then,&nbsp;
Ed, from behind Nick, hits him on the head with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:27.840
a hammer, killing him instantly. Back in the&nbsp;
trailer, Kai manages to break the glass window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:33.360
and escape. The couple runs after him. After&nbsp;
they leave, the police arrive at the trailer. 
&nbsp;

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.800
They spread out looking for the couple and the&nbsp;
kid. The police finally find Dawn and arrest her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.840
She claims that her husband has Kai and begs&nbsp;
to police to let her see Ed because only she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:50.400
can stop him. They soon find Ed holding Kai at&nbsp;
gunpoint. Dawn apologizes and lovingly asks her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:57.040
husband to let the child go. He does as she says,&nbsp;
and Kai finally gets to Sophie. Ed sobs and points&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:02.320
his gun at the police, causing them to shoot&nbsp;
him dead. Dawn hugs her husband’s limp body on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:08.640
the ground but is soon dragged away by the police.&nbsp;
Roshan finally drives the Brewer family back home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:13.520
Then, we see Sophie put back Nick’s picture in&nbsp;
the house again, knowing that her husband was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:20.160
the person she knew and loved. The scene cuts to&nbsp;
Nick’s funeral. Roshan tells Pia that Tara has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.960
decided to press charges against Matt. Sophie&nbsp;
stands at the entrance of the funeral feeling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.440
overwhelmed, but Pia manages to reassure her&nbsp;
that they will get through this by supporting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:35.120
each other as a family. The series ends as the&nbsp;
two walk into the funeral home together.
