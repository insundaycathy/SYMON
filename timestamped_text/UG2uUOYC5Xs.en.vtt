00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.080
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I'm going to explain an action,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.280
thriller, and sci-fi film called "The Island."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.480
A group of people in an isolated colony have&nbsp;
to live in a tightly controlled environment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.720
knowing that much of the earth is now&nbsp;
uninhabitable due to widespread contamination.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.240
They have to follow a rigorous daily&nbsp;
routine of proper diet and exercise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.040
to keep themselves healthy. Each dreams of&nbsp;
going to an uncontaminated paradise island,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.400
but they're told that only those who win the&nbsp;
weekly lottery are allowed to live there.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.160
Lincoln Six Echo dreams about reaching&nbsp;
the island on a boat, but he also suffers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.000
from nightmares that cause him to wake up&nbsp;
confused about his surroundings and identity.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.720
When he gets out of his room, he is greeted&nbsp;
by other inhabitants who are all wearing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.760
same outfit. Upon entering the elevator, they're&nbsp;
informed that the lottery has picked a resident&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.240
named Starkweather Two Delta to go to the island.&nbsp;
Starkweather, who has been staying at the compound&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.960
for six months, shares his excitement of getting&nbsp;
to breathe fresh air and swim in the ocean.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.800
A resident named Gandu Three Echo starts&nbsp;
hitting the screen in frustration. He tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.800
the other men at the lift that he has been there&nbsp;
for seven years and still hasn't won the lottery.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.760
When Lincoln arrives at the cafeteria, the&nbsp;
server informs him that he cannot have bacon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.120
because of a nutrition flag. Before he could sit&nbsp;
at a table, his best friend, Jordan Two Delta,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.960
approaches him from behind and tells him to "watch&nbsp;
and learn." She uses her charms on the server to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.680
get some bacon, despite not being allowed to have&nbsp;
them. Jordan goes back to Lincoln and drops the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.720
bacon in his tray. As they continue chatting, a&nbsp;
guard interrupts them and tells them to separate.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.080
After the meal, Lincoln reports to Dr. Merrick,&nbsp;
the head scientist at the facility. Merrick warns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.640
Lincoln about being in constant proximity&nbsp;
to Jordan and asks him about his nightmares.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.720
Lincoln tells Merrick about a boat that takes&nbsp;
him to the island and begins sketching it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.200
As the doctor asks him more questions, he&nbsp;
complains about the food choices and the clothes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.960
available to him and says he wishes there's&nbsp;
more to his life than just going to the island.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.960
The doctor advises Lincoln to&nbsp;
consider himself lucky to survive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.040
the contamination and be a part of the&nbsp;
facility that will repopulate the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.520
When Lincoln asks him if he plans on going to&nbsp;
the island, Merrick says that he and other staff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.960
members are ineligible to win the lottery&nbsp;
because they are needed at the compound.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.040
Lincoln finishes the sketch of&nbsp;
the boat and shows it to Merrick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.120
Below the drawing, Lincoln has written the&nbsp;
word "renovatio." When the doctor asks him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.200
what it means, Lincoln said that he saw it in&nbsp;
his dreams, but he doesn't know its meaning.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.040
The doctor decides to run some tests on Lincoln.&nbsp;
During the examination, he drops several tiny&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.880
metallic orbs onto Lincoln's face and tells&nbsp;
him that those are microsensors that will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.400
be attached to his optic nerves. The balls start&nbsp;
transforming and crawl up into Lincoln's eyelid.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.760
Merrick informs him that the sensors&nbsp;
will be uploading data to the facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.200
After 24 hours, he will be expelling the&nbsp;
tiny devices from his body when he urinates.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.680
At the work center, Lincoln complains to his&nbsp;
co-workers about being bored from doing their job.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.840
His co-worker, Jones Three Echo, suggests that&nbsp;
they are doing important work by feeding the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.400
nutrient lines to keep the residents healthy.&nbsp;
Gandu Three Echo approaches them and alerts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.280
them to a new arrival, leaving Jones to wonder how&nbsp;
they keep finding survivors outside the compound.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.880
The atmosphere at the work center shifts abruptly&nbsp;
when a pregnant woman suddenly collapses. While&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.840
her co-workers call for help, the woman, named&nbsp;
Lima One Alpha, realizes that she is now in labor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.320
She smiles as she breathes heavily, knowing that&nbsp;
she and her baby are now headed to the island.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.200
Lincoln takes advantage of the situation and&nbsp;
reports that his workstation has broken down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.400
He manages to get the key to Sector Six, where&nbsp;
he meets a technician named James McCord.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.000
He tells McCord that his computer broke down&nbsp;
again, but the technician knows that he just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.160
made it up to see him. They hang out at&nbsp;
McCord's workstation drinking an unknown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.160
beverage from a flask until the technician&nbsp;
was called to report in "product extraction."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.160
After McCord leaves, Lincoln catches a bug and&nbsp;
puts it in a matchbox labeled "Ace of Spades."

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.280
McCord heads to product extraction&nbsp;
while lab personnel is working on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.360
a pod containing a human body. The&nbsp;
lab personnel cuts the pod open and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.920
remove the tubes attached to the man that&nbsp;
emerged from the pod. As the man struggles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.760
a lab worker removes an obstruction&nbsp;
inside his mouth, allowing him to breathe.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.960
A scientist comes in to check&nbsp;
on the condition of the man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.200
After the inspection, he tells the lab&nbsp;
personnel that the man appears to be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.240
"fine product." They put a tag on the man's wrist&nbsp;
and cover it with a bracelet. In another sector,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.960
more pods containing human bodies receive fluids&nbsp;
from the nutrient lines being fed by Jones.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.560
Later that night, Lincoln tells Jordan about the&nbsp;
bug that he found. He starts wondering about how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.880
the insect survived the contamination and surmised&nbsp;
that something might be wrong with the facility.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.240
After Jordan leaves, Gandu and Jones approach&nbsp;
him and tell him that the lottery is starting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.920
The residents watch in anticipation as&nbsp;
their photos are flashed on the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.520
A few moments later, a woman announces that&nbsp;
Jordan Two Delta has won. While Jordan celebrates,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.880
Lincoln is dismayed by the thought of&nbsp;
being left behind by his best friend.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.800
That night, Lincoln was abruptly&nbsp;
awakened by a nightmare.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.680
Unable to fall back to sleep, he decides to&nbsp;
take the bug back to Sector Six and release it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.600
He follows the bug and reaches a&nbsp;
hatch that leads to a restricted area.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.640
Lincoln climbs up quietly and sneaks into a room&nbsp;
to change his clothes. Now wearing a lab coat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.920
he walks around freely as he inspects the other&nbsp;
rooms. During his investigation, he comes across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.160
a window with a view of the delivery room,&nbsp;
where Lima One Alpha just finished giving birth.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.560
Moments after the delivery, a doctor injects a&nbsp;
serum into a tube attached to Lima. As the liquid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.920
runs through the pipes, Lima's body begins to&nbsp;
shake violently. A nurse holds down her feet tight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.960
until she flatlines. In the next room, Lincoln&nbsp;
watches in shock as they cover Lima with a bag.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.640
The nurse brings the baby into another room,&nbsp;
where a couple is waiting. She then hands over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.760
the infant to the woman that looks exactly like&nbsp;
Lima. In the operating room, other staff members&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.480
are preparing to remove Starkweather's liver.&nbsp;
However, he wakes up before the surgeon can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.960
even make an incision. He runs out of the room&nbsp;
screaming for his life only to be caught by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.760
guards armed with harpoon guns. Lincoln witnesses&nbsp;
the incident while hiding behind a mobile tray.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.320
Lincoln runs back down to Sector Six while&nbsp;
the guards watch the footage of Starkweather's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.600
capture. Merrick enters the security station&nbsp;
and asks the staff to play the video again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.440
He notices a frame showing an unknown&nbsp;
figure taking cover behind a tray and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.080
tells the guards to run a facial&nbsp;
match then find the resident.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.000
Meanwhile, Lincoln runs to the women's quarters&nbsp;
to find Jordan as Merrick orders a total lockdown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.880
When Lincoln reaches her room,&nbsp;
he describes what he witnessed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.680
in the medical sector and warns&nbsp;
her that her life is in danger.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.640
Lincoln and Jordan start running from the&nbsp;
guards and eventually end up in Sector Six.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.600
They exit the sector through a&nbsp;
vent and fall into a large room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.040
where they see hundreds of people lying&nbsp;
on gurneys while watching a video feed.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.080
On their way out, they come across a&nbsp;
giant hologram of mountains and the ocean.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.240
Lincoln notices the machinery that powers the&nbsp;
hologram while Jordan opens a blast door that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.800
leads outside. When they emerge from the&nbsp;
compound, they find themselves in a desert.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.120
Back inside the facility, an announcer&nbsp;
tells the residents that Lincoln has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.640
put on quarantine while Jordan has&nbsp;
been sent on her way to the island.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.840
Meanwhile, Merrick gives a&nbsp;
presentation to potential clients,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.640
assuring them that the institute complies with&nbsp;
the nation's eugenics laws. He further stresses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.640
that all the clones are in a vegetative&nbsp;
state and incapable of feeling any emotion.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:28.480
After the presentation, Merrick meets with a&nbsp;
mercenary named Albert Laurent and asks him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.360
bring back Jordan and Lincoln. When Laurent points&nbsp;
out their supposed vegetative state, Merrick&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.920
explains that the organs always fail without&nbsp;
consciousness and human experience. Laurent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.320
immediately orders his men to prepare to search&nbsp;
for the clones as they wait for their description.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.240
In the desert, Jordan and Lincoln see a&nbsp;
snake and note that the animal is alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.400
and unaffected by the supposed contamination.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.080
Later on, Merrick informs Laurent that&nbsp;
Jordan Two Delta's sponsor, Sarah Jordan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.800
has been injured in a car accident and needs&nbsp;
multiple organ transplants within 48 hours.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.960
On the road, Lincoln comes&nbsp;
across a sign marked "Route 39."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.200
He looks at the matchbox he took from&nbsp;
McCord's workstation and notices that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.560
it is the same route marked as&nbsp;
the Ace of Spades bar location.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.040
The two clones follow the trail and eventually&nbsp;
arrive at the bar, where they find McCord.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.080
McCord reluctantly takes the two clones to his&nbsp;
home and tells them the truth about the facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.000
Lincoln and Jordan learn that they were&nbsp;
clones who were raised to provide spare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.360
organs when their wealthy sponsors&nbsp;
get sick. The memories they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.120
are just imprints to make them think that&nbsp;
they've had a life before they were cloned.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.600
Their sponsors are not aware that the clones are&nbsp;
conscious because Merrick keeps them well hidden.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.160
Lincoln insists on finding their sponsors,&nbsp;
so McCord gives them some clothes, cash,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.880
and credit cards. Laurent learns that Lincoln&nbsp;
has been implanted with microsensors that emit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.320
low-frequency RF signals, so he uses them to track&nbsp;
their location. Lincoln passes the microsensors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.800
at the train station, but Laurent's team has&nbsp;
already followed them there. While buying a map,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.040
McCord recognizes one of the mercenaries&nbsp;
and tries to warn the two clones.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.200
The mercenary shoots McCord in the chest,&nbsp;
and Lincoln and Jordan make a run for it.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.720
The clones arrive in Los Angeles to find Lincoln&nbsp;
Six Echo's sponsor, Tom Lincoln. While walking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.120
on their way to find a directory, Jordan comes&nbsp;
across an advertisement featuring her sponsor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.880
She stares in amazement at the TV&nbsp;
as she sees Sarah kissing a man.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.840
Meanwhile, Laurent's men also arrive in&nbsp;
the city and immediately start tapping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.920
into the surveillance cameras to find the&nbsp;
two clones. The operatives discover their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.360
exact location when Lincoln uses the&nbsp;
credit card at the information booth.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.240
Lincoln and Jordan use the directory to search&nbsp;
for Tom Lincoln only to find out that he is not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.960
listed. When they ask about Sarah Jordan, the&nbsp;
directory immediately makes a video call to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:44.320
Sarah's house. A young boy answers the call and&nbsp;
informs Jordan that his mother is at the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.320
As the boy turns to look at the monitor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.760
he recognizes Jordan's face and&nbsp;
wonders if he's talking to his mom.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.760
Laurent and his team reach the location of the&nbsp;
clones as soon as they drop the video call,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.240
but the police also arrive at the scene to&nbsp;
pick them up for the murder of James McCord.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.760
Merrick tells Laurent to use any means&nbsp;
necessary to retrieve the clones,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.440
fearing that the facility will also&nbsp;
be implicated in the investigation.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.440
On their way to the police station, Lincoln&nbsp;
asks the cop to pull up Tom Lincoln's file&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.000
to find out where he lives. As the squad car&nbsp;
waits for the green light at the intersection,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.560
Laurent's armored van crashes the vehicle's&nbsp;
front. A firefight ensues between Laurent's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.640
operatives and the cops, giving Lincoln&nbsp;
and Jordan some time to break free. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.040
mercenaries leave the shootout and chase&nbsp;
after the clones, but they eventually getaway.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.800
Back at the compound, Gandu Three Echo&nbsp;
tells Merrick that he has doubts whether&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:35.440
the contamination is real because of the bug&nbsp;
that Lincoln found. Fearing that he might share&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.000
his suspicions with others, Merrick eliminates&nbsp;
Gandu by injecting him with an unknown chemical.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.600
The following day, the two clones arrive&nbsp;
at Tom Lincoln's house. As Lincoln Six Echo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.160
curiously inspects a scanner, it lights up when it&nbsp;
detects his features and opens the door for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.560
Lincoln walks around the house and&nbsp;
sees several pictures of his sponsor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.880
He becomes fascinated by the display of&nbsp;
a model boat marked "Renovatio." While&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:04.400
checking out the display, Tom attacks him from&nbsp;
behind with a golf club. Tom, who wears glasses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.800
swings the club again to hit the clone, but he&nbsp;
stops after seeing his face staring back at him.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.920
At the Institute, Merrick learns that Lincoln&nbsp;
experienced 30 years of growth in his memories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.800
in the past three years. The Chief of Incubation&nbsp;
surmises that the anomaly is an infection,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.360
but Merrick asserts that these&nbsp;
are memories of his sponsor.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.840
Back at the house, Tom helps the clones&nbsp;
remove the bracelets from their wrists.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.560
Later on, he explains to Lincoln that he has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.240
cirrhotic hepatitis and his liver will&nbsp;
start failing within the next two years.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.040
Lincoln convinces Tom to go to the media and&nbsp;
tell the world about the clones at the facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.240
Tom, however, secretly calls the institute and&nbsp;
notifies them that the clones are in his house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.440
As they prepare to leave, Jordan detects that&nbsp;
Tom is hiding something, so she stays behind.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.000
On their way to the TV station, Laurent&nbsp;
catches up and blocks them when they arrive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
at an intersection. Tom suddenly points&nbsp;
a gun at Lincoln, letting him know that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
he has no intention of letting the world&nbsp;
know about what goes on at the institute.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.440
Lincoln drives away from the mercenaries&nbsp;
until they get to an abandoned museum.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.400
Lincoln gets out of the car and tries to run&nbsp;
away, but Tom tackles him. As they struggle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.600
to subdue each other, Tom loses his glasses.&nbsp;
The mercenaries arrive just in time to see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.840
identical men emerge from the scuffle, with&nbsp;
one pointing a gun at the other. As Laurent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.400
tries to assess the situation, both men start&nbsp;
claiming that they're the real Tom Lincoln.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.560
As the two men argue about their identity,&nbsp;
Lincoln Six Echo suddenly wraps the clone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.480
bracelet on Tom's wrist. Seeing the&nbsp;
bracelet, Laurent decides to shoot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.880
Tom. Lincoln later tells Laurent that Jordan&nbsp;
has left the state to look for her sponsor.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.520
Realizing that some clones could behave&nbsp;
unpredictably, Merrick orders his staff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.080
to dispose of them. The institute calls Tom&nbsp;
Lincoln's house to inform him of the recall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.560
and invite him back to the facility for a&nbsp;
rescan. Merrick launches mass winnings for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.840
the lottery to remove the potentially&nbsp;
disruptive clones from the population.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.800
Lincoln and Jordan start making plans&nbsp;
to leave on Tom's boat and head south,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.280
but not before they free the&nbsp;
other clones at the facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.080
Meanwhile, the staff at the institute have&nbsp;
already started disposing of the clones that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.160
are still being incubated. As Lincoln&nbsp;
prepares to head back to the institute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.120
Jordan uses McCord's credit card to alert the&nbsp;
mercenaries to her location. Laurent and his men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.680
arrive at a park to grab her and take her back&nbsp;
to the compound, where they'll take her organs.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.520
Lincoln arrives at the facility and meets&nbsp;
up with the public relations officer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.320
Charles Whitman. Before they start the rescan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.840
Lincoln knocks Whitman with a gun and&nbsp;
goes on his way to free the other clones.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.400
In the operating room, a guard taunts&nbsp;
Jordan as they prepare to remove her organs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.400
When the guard turns his back on her, she&nbsp;
takes out a gun that she hid in his pants and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.200
shoots him in the leg. She leaves the operating&nbsp;
room with a security key and a walkie-talkie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.640
She meets up with Jordan at the entrance,&nbsp;
and they walk through the halls until they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.720
reach the area where the clones are being&nbsp;
prepared for disposal. Lincoln goes on his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.560
way to shut down the holographic power&nbsp;
grid while Jordan follows the clones.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:57.120
Merrick reveals to Laurent that Sarah Jordan is&nbsp;
unlikely to survive even if the transplants are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.000
successful. Laurent, somehow, starts feeling&nbsp;
an affinity with the clones as he recalls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.840
how and his brothers were once branded to&nbsp;
indicate that they were less than humans.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.800
As Lincoln makes his way to the hologram room, the&nbsp;
institute's security team issues an alert for him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:15.600
after a doctor discovers that the corpse belonged&nbsp;
to Tom. Laurent manages to track down Jordan and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.720
disarms her while staff members usher the lottery&nbsp;
winners to an incineration chamber. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.280
as soon as the staff starts the incineration&nbsp;
process, Jordan and Laurent save the clones.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.800
Meanwhile, Lincoln reaches the hologram room and&nbsp;
pulls down a lever to overload the reaction fan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.680
Merrick then arrives at the room armed with a&nbsp;
harpoon gun to deal with Lincoln personally.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.200
Merrick struggles to subdue Lincoln&nbsp;
but eventually gains the upper hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.200
He strangles Lincoln with his bare hands,&nbsp;
leaving his harpoon gun lying next to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.240
Upon seeing the weapon, Lincoln reaches for&nbsp;
it and uses it to shoot Merrick in the neck.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.880
As the grid begins to malfunction, the turbine&nbsp;
fan spins out of control and breaks the walkway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.720
where the two men are fighting. The two&nbsp;
men are left hanging on a harpoon cable,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.560
but only Lincoln makes it back up&nbsp;
alive. As the hologram starts to fade,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.560
clones run outside of the compound to&nbsp;
breathe the fresh air for the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.400
Laurent looks on and smiles as Lincoln and&nbsp;
Jordan celebrate their freedom with a kiss.
