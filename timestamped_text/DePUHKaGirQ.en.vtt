00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.880
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain an action, fantasy, thriller film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.280
called “Underworld: Rise of the Lycans.”&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.480
Two decades after the creation of vampires&nbsp;
and werewolves, a war began. The werewolves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.560
grow in numbers as they could now infect&nbsp;
others, turning them into werewolves. Viktor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.440
leader of the vampires, created a legion&nbsp;
to protect them from werewolves. One day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.240
a baby named Lucian was born from the&nbsp;
werewolves. Over the years, Lucian grew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.320
stronger than the others. Lucian was the first&nbsp;
Lycan, a hybrid between werewolf and human.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.160
Viktor then used Lucian to breed more&nbsp;
Lycans, turning them into immortal slaves.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.160
Years later, a council meeting takes place.&nbsp;
Coloman, Viktor’s advisor, informs Viktor that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.480
the human nobles are upset with the werewolves.&nbsp;
Viktor doesn’t care and shrugs any idea of helping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.600
the humans. Meanwhile, a rider in patrol is being&nbsp;
chased by wolves in the woods. She kills two of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.840
them as she makes her way back to the castle. She&nbsp;
reaches the castle, and this alarms Lucian and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.800
vampires. Lucian takes his crossbow and shoots the&nbsp;
remaining wolves down. The rider reveals herself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.160
to be Sonja, Viktor’s daughter. Sonja insults&nbsp;
Lucian, and Viktor tells Sonja to be more grateful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.240
to the man who saved her. Sonja tells them that&nbsp;
she needed no saving and dismisses herself.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.640
Viktor then tells Sonja that she missed&nbsp;
the council. Sonja gives an excuse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.800
but Viktor reminds her to stay in the castle and&nbsp;
do her duty as a council member. Viktor wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.200
Sonja to be more political, ruthless, and cunning&nbsp;
like him, and above all, loyal to no one but him.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.480
Outside, the Lycans are working as slaves.&nbsp;
One of them gets tired and takes a break.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.600
Kosta, the overseer, sees this and instantly whips&nbsp;
him, telling him to keep working. Lucian comes and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.640
stops Kosta. Kosta insults Lucian, calling him the&nbsp;
master’s dog, and curses him before walking away.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.880
Back at the council, Coloman informs Viktor&nbsp;
that the werewolves are being more ruthless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.040
than before. Viktor reminds him that the&nbsp;
Lycans protect them. Coloman agrees but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.240
also reminds him about the human nobles,&nbsp;
suggesting to Viktor that they protect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.240
them. Coloman further suggests that they&nbsp;
should use the Lycans to patrol at day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.000
Viktor thinks this to be preposterous as&nbsp;
he thinks the Lycans only as savage beasts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.760
Coloman proceeds to go into detail, telling him&nbsp;
that they should create a privileged class of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.680
Lycans with better food and quarters and let&nbsp;
Lucian lead them. He then calls on Sonja to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.280
hear her thoughts, but Viktor sees Sonja&nbsp;
has not attended the council once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.840
Viktor tells Tannis to find Sonja and tells&nbsp;
Coloman that he will consider his suggestion.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.560
Meanwhile, the Lycans are now being dismissed&nbsp;
from work. Lucian, however, sneaks towards an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.320
underground passage through a trapdoor and makes&nbsp;
his way to an abandoned part of the castle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.880
There he meets Sonja, and the two immediately get&nbsp;
passionate with one another. Afterward, Lucian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.360
tells Sonja that he wants to leave, and invites&nbsp;
her to join him. Lucian shows Sonja his self-made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.760
key to unbind his shackle. Sonja tells him not to&nbsp;
do it, but Lucian makes his point clear, telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.400
her that the way the Lycans are treated is unfair.&nbsp;
He must leave, but he can’t do it without Sonja.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.840
Tannis is still looking for Sonja. He checks her&nbsp;
bed, but she wasn’t there. He roams around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.080
castle until he sees Lucian and Sonja together.&nbsp;
Tannis reports to Viktor but doesn’t tell him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.280
about Sonja and Lucian. Instead, he lies and tells&nbsp;
Viktor that Sonja won’t answer from her room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.320
Tannis then tells Viktor that they should&nbsp;
prepare for the nobles are arriving.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.400
The humans arrive at the rendezvous point&nbsp;
in the woods, and the patrol fires a flare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.520
to signal their arrival. Sonja sees the signal and&nbsp;
prepares to intercept them. Lucian hands Sonja her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.960
sword but asks her to let someone else go in her&nbsp;
stead as he fears something terrible might happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.760
Sonja is insistent that she can handle herself and&nbsp;
tells him that he can watch her from the walls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.320
On the way out, Tannis also&nbsp;
stops her on Viktor’s command,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.920
but Sonja doesn’t listen and heads out with&nbsp;
her men. Tannis then approaches Lucian,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.000
telling him to be careful in keeping his secret.&nbsp;
Lucian realizes that Tannis knows about them.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.960
Sonja arrives at the woods and intercepts the&nbsp;
humans. But suddenly, the wolves make their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.960
presence known. Lucian senses that the attack&nbsp;
will overwhelm Sonja and tries to send some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.440
troops to aid her, but they disobey his command,&nbsp;
so he steals a horse and immediately heads out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.600
Sonja and the humans get ambushed by wolves. The&nbsp;
wolves wipe out the troops and start killing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.600
human slaves. One of the slaves, Raze, fights&nbsp;
back and defends the slaves. Sonja fights back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.760
killing werewolves when Lucian arrives to help&nbsp;
them. They retaliate, but a massive pack of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.640
wolves approaches them. Lucian uses the key,&nbsp;
unshackles himself, and turns into a werewolf.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.440
Surprisingly, he is able to command the wolves&nbsp;
to back off. But the rest of the troops arrive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.400
and shoot Lucian in the back. Viktor is with them&nbsp;
and immediately approaches the two. Sonja tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.040
reason that Lucian did it to save her. But Viktor&nbsp;
is furious that Lucian and Sonja disobeyed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.200
He tells Lucian that he will now be treated&nbsp;
like a slave. Sonja tries to stop her father,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.360
but Viktor shuts her, and they head back. Tannis&nbsp;
sees and picks up the shackle and observes it.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.840
Back at the castle, the council gathers outside&nbsp;
to witness Lucian’s punishment. Viktor tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.000
Lucian that he has regretted raising him for his&nbsp;
betrayal and tells Kosta to lash him thirty times.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.120
The lashing begins. Sonja listens in distress&nbsp;
to her secret lover’s agony. Viktor walks away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.040
and Coloman follows, telling him to stop the&nbsp;
punishment for Lucian is their protector.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.040
Viktor shows no sympathy, calling them beasts.&nbsp;
Coloman warns him that it could potentially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.760
stir the other Lycans. Viktor doesn’t listen and&nbsp;
proves that the Lycans cannot be trusted at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.040
After the punishment, the guards&nbsp;
take Lucian to the dungeon. There,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.800
Raze sees Lucian significantly injured,&nbsp;
feels sorry, and gives him water to drink.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.960
Viktor approaches Sonja and is curious&nbsp;
why she was concerned for Lucian, a slave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.560
Sonja reminds Viktor that he told her to&nbsp;
be more grateful to the one who saved her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.520
and asks why he was not grateful&nbsp;
to the one who saved his daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.800
Viktor tells her that he reserves no gratitude&nbsp;
nor sentiment to those who break his rule.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.000
In prison, Lucian commends Raze for his bravery in&nbsp;
the fight against the wolves. Lucian then asks if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.560
Raze was afraid of the wolves, to which he replies&nbsp;
he was, but he wanted to live. Lucian reassures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.920
Raze that he is not like them and explains&nbsp;
that werewolves are mindless savage beasts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.000
unlike a Lycan like him. Raze then tells him&nbsp;
that the wolves obeyed him, which leaves Lucian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.480
wondering why. Sonja then secretly makes her&nbsp;
way to the dungeon and meets Lucian apologizing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.800
blaming herself. Lucian tells her that it’s not&nbsp;
her fault and tells her that he has to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.280
He then tells Sonja that Tannis knows about the&nbsp;
two of them. Sonja wonders how but Lucian suspects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.200
that Tannis has not told Viktor yet and must want&nbsp;
something, so he tells Sonja to find out what.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.840
At the dungeon, the guards give the Lycans&nbsp;
food and make fun of them, calling them dogs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.040
When the guards leave, Lucian tells the&nbsp;
Lycans to stop bickering as they are not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.200
animals. Lucian could not take it anymore, so&nbsp;
he stirs the Lycans, telling them that it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.720
finally time for them to stop being treated&nbsp;
like animals, and start acting like Lycans.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.040
At the council chamber, Viktor tells Sonja&nbsp;
that he will execute Lucian for fear that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.600
might stir the other Lycans. Later that night,&nbsp;
Sonja ambushes Tannis and pins him to a wall,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.720
asking him if he has told Viktor&nbsp;
anything. Tannis says he hasn’t,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.800
so Sonja asks why he told Viktor nothing.&nbsp;
Tannis explains that reporting to Viktor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.400
about his daughter consorting with a Lycan&nbsp;
might risk his own life. Tannis then tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.480
her that he plans to use this information for his&nbsp;
own benefit that he wants to be on the council.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.840
Sonja bargains that if Tannis helps them and&nbsp;
keeps the secret, she will give up her seat.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.240
The guards then take Lucian somewhere private.&nbsp;
There he meets Sonja with Tannis’ help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.120
Sonja immediately tells Lucian that&nbsp;
Viktor plans to kill him the next day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.000
and tells him to leave at sunrise when&nbsp;
Viktor and the patrol guards are asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.320
Sonja will keep her father company, but they&nbsp;
plan to meet in three days after sunset.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.640
They kiss each other goodbye, and Sonja leaves.&nbsp;
The guard then takes Lucian back to his prison.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.600
Later on, the guards take the humans out to&nbsp;
finally turn them into Lycans. Lucian wishes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.080
Raze well on his way out. Out of the blue, Tannis&nbsp;
approaches Lucian from above and tells him to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.240
ready when things change. He then gives Lucian a&nbsp;
key to his shackles as a parting gift and leaves.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.240
The humans are now turned into Lycans&nbsp;
and are brought back into the cell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.520
Lucian explains that they are going to&nbsp;
be used for the vampires’ protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.440
Raze tells him that he’d rather die, but Lucian&nbsp;
explains his plan to escape and invites them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.360
come with him. He continues that there is&nbsp;
life waiting for them outside the castle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.840
Raze and the others agree to go&nbsp;
with him than stay and serve.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.640
Dawn is upon them, and the time has come. Kosta&nbsp;
goes into the dungeon to check on the new Lycans,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.560
but they tell him that Lucian has escaped.&nbsp;
This prompts Kosta to check Lucian’s cell,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.440
opening it, and to his demise, Lucian, in&nbsp;
werewolf form, ambushes him and kills him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.600
He then reverts to human form and rallies all&nbsp;
the Lycans and starts releasing everyone. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.840
then begin their escape, overwhelming the guards&nbsp;
in the dungeon, and releasing the other Lycans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.320
They make their way outside, but one of them&nbsp;
makes a noise, alerting the troops. On the run,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.720
the guards fire a barrage of ballista at them,&nbsp;
killing some of the Lycans. Lucian and the others&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.360
maneuver around, but the troops focus fires at&nbsp;
the door and trap most of the Lycans behind. Raze&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.200
desperately tries to help, but Lucian tells him&nbsp;
it’s useless and promises the trapped Lycans that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.760
he will come back for them. Lucian and the others&nbsp;
find the exit, but two guards intercept them. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.240
with all of Lucian’s might, he rams both guards,&nbsp;
pushing them outside the castle, and basking them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.160
in burning sunlight. The rest of the remaining&nbsp;
Lycans follow, and they head for the woods.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.320
Viktor investigates the dungeon where they find&nbsp;
Kosta’s dead body and see Lucian’s shackles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.160
Viktor interrogates Tannis and asks where the key&nbsp;
to the shackle is, and he responds that it’s in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.040
the armory. Viktor then asks how the shackled&nbsp;
is open, to which Tannis claims he has no idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.880
Viktor threatens to kill Tannis, but he&nbsp;
pleads and tells Viktor to check the armory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.160
In the armory, Tannis nervously checks&nbsp;
where he placed the key and finds it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.360
This makes Viktor conclude that Lucian must&nbsp;
have made another key and spares Tannis.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.840
Outside, Lucian tells his brethren that&nbsp;
they will go back to save the other Lycans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.800
Lucian then asks to Raze to lead them to&nbsp;
the noble’s estate with who he was with.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.600
Raze agrees, and they raid the place. After&nbsp;
the raid, Lucian frees some slaves and lets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.640
them choose to fight with him or not,&nbsp;
promising immortality to those who join&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.040
him. The Lycans now grow in numbers, and Lucian&nbsp;
commands Raze to free more slaves to join him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.000
Lucian leaves and entrusts the Lycans under Raze’s&nbsp;
command. In the middle of the night, Lucian finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.680
a cave and enters. He finds himself in the&nbsp;
den of the werewolves and meets their leader.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.960
That same night, Viktor finds the tunnel Lucian&nbsp;
uses to meet Sonja secretly. He then investigates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.120
the tunnel and eventually came to a horrifying&nbsp;
conclusion. Viktor then enters Sonja’s room and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.400
meets her there. Viktor talks about Lucian&nbsp;
telling her how he could’ve been anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.200
Suddenly, Viktor asks Sonja if she helped&nbsp;
him escape. Sonja strongly denies it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.320
but Viktor bites her neck, revealing her memories&nbsp;
to him. Viktor is furious and slaps her. Viktor is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.960
in complete disbelief. Sonja tells him that&nbsp;
she loves Lucian, further angering Viktor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.200
He feels betrayed by the person he loved more than&nbsp;
anything. Viktor leaves and locks her in her room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.280
Viktor heads back to the council and learns&nbsp;
of what Lucian did to the other estates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.040
Coloman tells Viktor that he needs to bring&nbsp;
Lucian back before anything could get worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.560
But Viktor tells them that he need not do&nbsp;
anything for Lucian will surely return to Sonja.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.040
Lucian returns to the camp and wonders&nbsp;
why Sonja hasn’t arrived yet. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.680
a girl on a horse arrives. Lucian thought it to&nbsp;
be Sonja, but to his disappointment, it was Luka&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.320
who tells him that Sonja has been arrested. This&nbsp;
prompts Lucian to hurry back to the castle alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.480
Raze tries to stop him, for they might lose their&nbsp;
men. Lucian then tells him that Raze will be in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.840
charge until he returns or leads them if he&nbsp;
doesn’t return and runs back to the castle.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.960
Lucian arrives outside the walls and sneaks his&nbsp;
way in. He sneaks past more guards and silently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.960
ambushes the two men guarding Sonja’s&nbsp;
room. Lucian and Sonja finally reunite,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.800
and they immediately make a run for it. They&nbsp;
head for the secret tunnel they used. Viktor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.880
was immediately notified of this escape but he&nbsp;
already anticipated this. While on the tunnel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.640
Lucian and Sonja see an explosive barrel falling&nbsp;
from above and a torch along with it, causing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.960
an explosion that blocks their way. It turns&nbsp;
out Viktor and his men blocking their escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.880
Lucian and Sonja desperately try to escape, but&nbsp;
they eventually got cornered, leaving them with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.040
no other choice but to fight. They kill a few&nbsp;
men but Lucian gets outnumbered and Sonja faces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.600
Viktor himself. The two fight fiercely but&nbsp;
Sonja gets the upper hand and disarms Viktor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.600
Viktor tells her that killing him is futile.&nbsp;
Sonja begs to let them go and declares that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.400
is pregnant with Lucian’s child. She calls this&nbsp;
a miracle a union between vampires and Lycans.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.480
But Viktor is disgusted and curses her very&nbsp;
birth. Viktor then cunningly pulls a knife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.960
and disarms Sonja, calling the fight over. Viktor&nbsp;
tells Sonja that he only wanted to catch Lucian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.480
and disregard her disobedience but because&nbsp;
of the baby, she too will now be punished.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.560
At the dungeon, Lucian starts regretting&nbsp;
his actions, but Sonja tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.920
he was right all along. Lucian feels&nbsp;
that he failed her but Sonja reminds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.720
him that they both made their decisions&nbsp;
and took their own risks for each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.520
Suddenly, the guards take Sonja away, making&nbsp;
Lucian furious until one of the guards shoots him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.160
knocking him out. They then take Lucian to the&nbsp;
council for Sonja’s trial. Coloman recalls all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.400
of her crimes and claims them to be unforgivable,&nbsp;
declaring death as the punishment. He calls on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.720
vote to which the majority of the council agrees,&nbsp;
now waiting for Viktor’s vote. Viktor and Sonja’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.120
stares are intensely fixed at each other. But&nbsp;
unfortunately, Viktor agrees and they take Sonja&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.680
for execution. Lucian desperately pleads to Viktor&nbsp;
but they take him away, unable to do anything.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.560
They then chain Sonja at a stake in the execution&nbsp;
chamber and in front of her they chain Lucian.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.760
The council enters and Viktor immediately&nbsp;
commands the guard to lash Lucian again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.720
Sonja watches in despair as her lover suffers.&nbsp;
Lucian is down so Viktor ends the lash,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.400
looks at her daughter’s reaction, and leaves&nbsp;
along with the council. The lovers are left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.880
with nothing but each other, feeling nothing&nbsp;
but sorrow. Suddenly, the ceiling slowly opens.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.840
Terrified, Lucian tells Sonja to keep her eyes&nbsp;
on him and him only. Unable to do anything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.000
the lovers could only stare and say they love each&nbsp;
other and as the ceiling fully opens, Sonja bids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.120
goodbye. Sunlight enters and Sonja burns. Lucian&nbsp;
wails at the excruciating sight of Sonja’s death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.520
and mourns deeply. At Sonja’s room, Viktor hears&nbsp;
Lucian’s cry and mourns his daughter’s loss.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.560
Later that night, Viktor enters the chamber and&nbsp;
looks at his dead daughter. Lucian is enraged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.640
at the sight of Viktor. Viktor notices him and&nbsp;
immediately tells his men to fetch his knives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.040
But as the moonlight shines upon Lucian, he&nbsp;
transforms into a wolf and assaults Viktor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.040
Viktor’s troops enter the room so Lucian jumps&nbsp;
out of the window and tries to make an escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.840
He reaches atop the walls but the troops slow him&nbsp;
down, firing harpoons at him. The troops intend to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.840
finish the weakened Lycan so they shoot arrows&nbsp;
at him. However, this prompts Lucian to let out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.320
a loud roar, so loud that it reaches his brethren&nbsp;
in the woods. This goes on until a soldier shoots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.880
him and knocks him down. But it was too late. The&nbsp;
ground starts to shake and a feeling of uneasiness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.120
reaches Viktor. The roar had signaled the entire&nbsp;
pack of wolves to attack the castle and with them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:04.080
his Lycan brethren. An all-out war has begun.&nbsp;
The vampires prepare to defend themselves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.400
manning the walls and shooting ballistae. But&nbsp;
it is futile, the wolves outnumber the vampires,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.400
and eventually, they reach the wall, beginning&nbsp;
the slaughter. The council attempts to run but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.320
the wolves reach them and kill them one by&nbsp;
one. Raze reaches the wall and finds Lucian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.640
heavily injured. He helps him remove the arrows&nbsp;
and gives him clothing. Lucian tells him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.400
free the other Lycans first. Raze then frees&nbsp;
the slaves and they join him in the fight.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.640
Viktor, prepared for battle, is on his way&nbsp;
out when he finds Tannis trying to salvage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.200
his scrolls. He then stops Tannis and tells him&nbsp;
to go to the Elders instead. Viktor and his men&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.920
then join the fight. Lucian has now recovered and&nbsp;
sets his eyes on Viktor. He joins the fight and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.480
approaches Viktor. Viktor sees him coming so he&nbsp;
jumps on one of the holes leading to the dungeont.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.800
Lucian then chases after him. While this was all&nbsp;
happening, Tannis had just finish securing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.720
Elders’ coffins in a boat and slowly makes&nbsp;
rows his out. Lucian finds himself in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.120
dungeon when suddenly Viktor tries to attack him&nbsp;
by surprise. Lucian barely retaliates and falls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.840
Viktor tells Lucian that he defiled and killed his&nbsp;
daughter to which Lucian yells that he loved her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.200
Viktor then jumps down and the swordfight&nbsp;
continues until Lucian tackles and pins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.360
Viktor down. Viktor grabs a random shackle&nbsp;
on his side, hits him, and kicks him back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.080
Viktor runs towards the sewers and Lucian&nbsp;
jumps down, knocking Viktor down the stairway.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.000
Lucian picks up his sword and jumps on one of the&nbsp;
chains but Viktor cuts the chain causing Lucian to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
fall on the stairs. But Lucian notices that the&nbsp;
ceiling that holds the chains were crumbling,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.080
revealing sunlight. So Lucian pulls the chain&nbsp;
hard to let the sunlight enter burning Viktor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.960
as he uses the chains to go down faster. Lucian&nbsp;
then chains the disoriented vampire. Viktor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.400
provokes Lucian telling him that he should’ve&nbsp;
just killed him on the day he was born.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.840
Lucian agrees but stabs Viktor in the&nbsp;
mouth and reminds him of his mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.520
Lucian then pushes the vampire off the stairs&nbsp;
and Viktor falls down the water as he burns.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.480
The fight is now over and Lucian heads&nbsp;
out of the castle to meet his brethren&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.920
in the morning who just won the battle&nbsp;
against the vampires. Raze tells Lucian&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.600
that the fighting is now over. But Lucian&nbsp;
acknowledges that the war has only just begun.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.560
Unbeknownst to them, Tannis has escaped with the&nbsp;
ship along with the Elders. And on that ship,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.840
Viktor survived and as they escape, Viktor&nbsp;
secures himself in one of the coffins.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.920
In the far future, voices narrate the&nbsp;
events of what happened centuries ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.400
the truth about Viktor causing&nbsp;
the demise of the vampires,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.640
and his precious daughter who he condemned to&nbsp;
death. And now, in the midst of a stormy night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.480
sitting at a window of a skyscraper balcony is a&nbsp;
woman in black bearing a face similar to Sonja.
