00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.940
Welcome to the breakdown where we breakdown
all the messed up movies!

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.280
Today on Screepy Week, is ULTIMATE REVENGE!

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.510
So I had to pick something where Revenge is
the topic!

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.000
That something we are watching today is Lady
Vengeance.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.240
Also known as Sympathy for Lady Vengeance!

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:29.980
And yes it is apart of the Vengeance Trilogy,
starting with Sympathy for Mr Vengeance, then

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.699
Oldboy, and then Lady Vengeance.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.210
I'm not gonna bullshit yall, I wanted a female
lead! so Instead we are gonna do the trilogy

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.750
out of order! plus they aren't narratively
connected so its fine!

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.040
Lady Vengeance is about a fine ass fresh release
from an All Girl Prison.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.580
Apparently she was imprisoned for 13 years
after murdering a little boy!

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.860
Well...turns out that somebody forced her
to take the blame and so our main character

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.390
Geum-Ja begins to unfold a very intricately
planned attempt to serve a cold dish of revenge

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.210
against the real murderer!

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.800
You can find this entire movie for free on
TubiTV...so I will just get a more general

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.150
outline of the movie!

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:22.460
If you wanna see what happens, including all
the messed up parts, stay tuned for the breakdown!

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.000
Cue the Gohan!

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.659
Outside of a female only prison, Christian
singers and their religious leader sit in

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.210
wait for an angel!

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.360
A true angel that is a model to prisoners
everywhere!

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.820
As soon as others are released, they begin
their sacred song in wait for their angel!

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.940
This angel is Geum-ja, who walks upon her
audience with a cold face!

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.360
Firstly lets talk about why Geum-ja went behind
bars!

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.479
13 years ago when she was 20 years old, Geum-ja
apparently kidnapped and killed a little boy

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.940
named Won-mo.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.490
Her young age along with her naive appearance
and beauty made her a national sensation!

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.899
They was even gonna make a movie about her!

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.810
This man watching a report about Geum-ja's
crime sees something good and angelic behind

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.800
Geum-ja's face, and visits her to inspire
a change in lifestyle!

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.230
Apparently, his visit inspires Geum-ja to
become a true angel, a very kindhearted woman

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.280
who is well known and appreciated by her fellow
inmates and watchers outside of those walls!

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.600
She become probably the greatest prisoner
all over the country.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.060
After 13 years, she is released and presented
with a sacred tofu meal!

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.130
Once she eats it, its like a promise to live
white as snow and never to sin again!

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.790
But she pushes the food out of the priests
hand and rejects it,telling him and his band

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.819
of santa singers to screw themselves!

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.220
Geum-Ja has been pretending to be angelic
for 13 years!

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.550
Now I'm not saying she isn't a good person
entirely but overall I think she is kinda

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.550
nuts.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.349
I guess It would be good to call her an anti
hero.

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.711
A lot of times throughout the film, she takes
it upon herself to revisit all of her old

00:03:15.711 --> 00:03:17.330
prison peers!

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.080
It makes you wonder if she only befriended
them and helped them so that they would be

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.099
indebted to her later!

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:30.410
This old friend of hers reveals that Geum-ja
has a plan that's already been enacted!

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.239
This plan is to capture the real murderer
of the boy that Geum-ja went to jail for.

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:43.160
She even has a dream about it, holding a dirty
dog of a human and then blowing his head out!

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.740
Right over the pure white snow and she smiles
about it!

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.241
She still wishes to apologize.

00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:52.690
Apologize to the parents of the boy who was
murdered!

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.300
Remember yall that boys name is Won-mo.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.440
Her apology is cutting off her finger like
a yakuza member who cant do shit right, but

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.430
the parents didn't ask for that and just get
her to help fast enough to have it put back

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.430
on!

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.999
She wasted all her money on that operation!

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:13.040
She has to work at a bakery to get by, next
to two creepy guys!

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.160
Geum-ja visits another fellow released prisoner!

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.440
One that Geum-ja gave a whole kidney too after
the woman was found to have some kind of kidney

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.440
failure.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.310
She's like "Then this bitch decides to give
me a whole kidney!"

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.820
This movie is like a mix of Amelie and I Saw
the Devil!

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.990
Well, Geum-ja enlists her and her boyfriends
help in creating a special type of gun, the

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.500
same one she used in her dream killing the
dirty dog!

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.270
The gun is a special type of North Korean
spy weapon!

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.990
It seems that the gun blueprint was hidden
in a Buddhist book, so it seems likely she

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.000
organized it herself.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.300
While working at her bakery, Geum-ja comes
into contact with the Detective!

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.810
The one who looked over her case 13 years
ago.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.050
Like most Asian detectives in films like this,
he doesn't believe that Geum-ja murdered the

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.330
boy because she didn't know facts of the case
that the killer would know.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.590
This is them arguing 13 years older about
it, and Geum-ja had a weird insistence on

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.370
saying she was the killer.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.860
On the way to some kind of weird reenactment
of the murder, a man is above egging her on,

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.400
with a baby in his grasp.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.990
During this reenactment, she utilizes the
real killers help to figure out how the murder

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.780
actually went down!

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.759
Like, the boy Won-mo was smothered with a
brown pillow, something she wouldn't know

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.759
if the real killer didn't point to his brown
watch!

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:46.840
A year before she went to prison, she was
a wild 19 year old who was pregnant.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.090
She stays with her old teacher, a man by the
name of Mr Baek, played by the same man who

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.400
played the villain in I Saw the Devil.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.590
And Ik he is in Oldboy too.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.960
Mr Baek forced Geum-ja to go along with a
kidnap for ransom.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.900
The person they both kidnapped was Won-mo,
however, he was already killed even after

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.600
the parents payed the ransom!

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:19.590
Mr Baek forces Geum-ja to take the blame for
the murder, or else her baby girl will be

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.410
killed next!

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:27.550
Also Geum-ja told her coworker this all after
some sex.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.979
A big reason she hangs around or even gives
him attention is because he is 20 years old,

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:39.230
the same age she was when she went to jail,
and also the same age the murdered boy, Won-mo

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.350
would be if he lived.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:47.280
Mr Baek put Geum-ja's daughter up for adoption,
and she finds out some Australians adopted

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.580
her and named her Jenny.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.880
Geum-ja litterlly catches a flight to Australia
to meet her daughter her, who is about 13

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.880
years old.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:22.300
They are pretty weird, I mean what is this
scene y'all?

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.160
Keep in mind that Jenny only knows English.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.630
Well actually Idk really.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:33.320
I think the actress is multilingual only introspective
in Geum-ja's mind.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.800
Her mother doesn't want her to come back to
Seoul with her, hope I said it right, but

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:51.620
after some funny arguing they so happen to
go back together anyway.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.759
Right as she gets back, Geum-ja receives her
special weapon, but its only close range so

00:07:56.759 --> 00:08:01.150
she gotta be so close to her target that she
can see the white in their eyes.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:06.500
Before we continue with what happened after
that, lets go back to Geum-ja's jail days.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.259
Geum-ja was like a good kingpin!

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:15.510
She earned the title "Witch" after she secretly
murdered this mean prison bully, by poisoning

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.710
her with bleach.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.680
She was still known as a angel too though.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.630
This means that Geum-ja has only murdered
once so far, and its not any little kids.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:31.449
Anyway, Geum-ja managed to track down Mr.Baek,
the man she is looking for!

00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:36.500
She also tracks down his current wife, a woman
who hates her husband anyway because he is

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.620
very abusive.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:43.309
They both plot to figure out how to take down
Mr Baek, but somebody knows that something

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:44.749
is being planned.

00:08:44.749 --> 00:08:50.360
The priest who visited Geum-ja is seen taking
pictures of her, and reports the images back

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.930
to Mr Baek.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:57.470
Mr Baek is a school teacher btw.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:03.239
Seeing his wife betray him and possibly plan
his downfall hurts him, but man eff this preacher

00:09:03.239 --> 00:09:06.309
though really.

00:09:06.309 --> 00:09:11.829
Mr Baek gets the services of some thugs to
take care of Geum-ja, while he waits for his

00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:15.470
wife to come cook for him and then he will
tie her up!

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.889
Things are all going according to plan though
for Geum-ja!

00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:22.929
While walking with her daughter, they get
attacked and intercepted by those thugs.

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:29.129
Geum-ja gets her shit kicked in by the man,
like she really got beat, but when he aint

00:09:29.129 --> 00:09:34.560
looking, she pulls out here vengeance gun
and blows his brains right out all over the

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.560
street!

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.689
Then she walks towards the guy holding her
daughter, cuz remember its close range, and

00:09:38.689 --> 00:09:40.679
she blows his hand right off!

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:44.970
Meanwhile, Mr Baek doesn't realize his plan
has failed!

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:50.709
He tied his wife up after she made him some
food, but unknown to him, his wife tampered

00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:54.879
the food with some kind of sedative, and he
passes right out!

00:09:54.879 --> 00:10:00.179
Geum-ja drags her daughter into Mr Baek's
flat, examining the man who threatened her

00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:03.759
child and took away 13 years of her life.

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:09.160
She frantically cuts his hair out, probably
fighting the urge to end him right there until

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.309
she realizes she's got more to her plan!

00:10:12.309 --> 00:10:17.510
She and the wife then transport the man to
an abandoned school, probably one where Won-mo

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.459
went, and tie him.

00:10:19.459 --> 00:10:25.040
He speaks pretty good English, and she uses
him at gunpoint to translate an apology and

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.139
explanation to her daughter!

00:10:27.139 --> 00:10:32.319
Overall, she believes she is too much of a
sinner to take care of her angel daughter,

00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:36.279
so after she kills this man, she will send
Jenny back to Australia!

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:42.139
She now has her number one enemy in her grasp
though, and is itching to kill him.

00:10:42.139 --> 00:10:45.490
She intimidates him with the pistol like 40
times!

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:51.519
His phone starts to ring though, and she pulls
it out, but what she finds is horrifying!

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:58.480
She not only finds Won-mo's marble, but she
finds the trinkets of at least 3 to 4 other

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.480
children.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.329
This means, that Mr Baek killed more children
while Geum-ja was in jail.

00:11:04.329 --> 00:11:10.060
She loses it, choking him with that remake
Jennifer Hills face, stomping him and shooting

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.910
him in both of his feet!

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:19.029
The fact that 4 kids died overall is very
bothersome to Geum-ja, and she shows the detective

00:11:19.029 --> 00:11:20.940
who oversaw her case!

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:26.139
Eventually they look through his apartment,
finding video tapes of each of the kidnapped

00:11:26.139 --> 00:11:27.139
and murdered children!

00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:32.529
I don't know for sure if the children were
killed on the tapes, but they were crying

00:11:32.529 --> 00:11:33.529
alright!

00:11:33.529 --> 00:11:38.720
I'm guessing they were killed since the Detective
gets up after watching to go vomit in the

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.720
toilet.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.889
The detective forgets the law after that!

00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:48.559
He helps Geum-ja arrange for the parents of
each of the murdered children to be sent to

00:11:48.559 --> 00:11:52.379
the abandoned school where Mr Baek is tied
up.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:57.559
They have a confused look at first, until
Geum-ja starts to play the video tapes of

00:11:57.559 --> 00:11:59.360
the children crying.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.709
I don't believe she played the actual murder
of the children, she seems to cut the tapes

00:12:04.709 --> 00:12:05.709
off quickly.

00:12:05.709 --> 00:12:11.009
It's very disturbing to see children crying
like that in this sort of position.

00:12:11.009 --> 00:12:16.029
Where do you get the children to act for these
type of scenes!

00:12:16.029 --> 00:12:22.621
Apparently, Mr Baek would kidnap the children,
play a video of him about to kill them, then

00:12:22.621 --> 00:12:28.829
he would ask for ransom using the video audio
to make the parents think the child was still

00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:29.829
alive.

00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:35.549
He would get the ransom, quit his teaching
job, leave and then start over someplace else.

00:12:35.549 --> 00:12:38.160
Geum-ja gives the parents two options.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.459
Either they can lets Mr Baek go to jail, she'll
hand him over to the detective.

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:48.779
Or, they can kill him, each taking turns to
torture him to death!

00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:55.920
The parents debate about it, believing a trial
is a waste of time.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.809
They all decide that maybe they should take
matters into their own hands!

00:13:00.809 --> 00:13:06.189
And just so there is no snitching after, which
is someone telling the police about what they

00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:11.499
did, Geum-ja makes sure to let them know that
snitches get stitches.

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:17.009
All of their conversations about how they
would go inside and torture him were broadcast

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:22.730
through a speaker heard in the room Mr Baek
was held inside, so he knows he's about to

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:23.730
be ended.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:30.529
Each and every family tortures him, stabbing
him all over with their wide variety of weapons.

00:13:30.529 --> 00:13:35.769
The old lady is the last one, and she kills
Mr Baek with scissors to the neck!

00:13:35.769 --> 00:13:41.859
The families then work together to clean up
the space, and all take a group photo so that

00:13:41.859 --> 00:13:45.170
nobody can snitch on anybody else!

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:49.009
Next they dig a grave, but Geum-ja didn't
really get her any action.

00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:53.189
She shoots the man twice in the head as they
finish his burial.

00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:56.980
Naw that's not a burial, that's just hiding
his body.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:03.569
With her vengeance complete, she begins to
both cry and smile viciously after 13 years

00:14:03.569 --> 00:14:05.709
of planning and waiting!

00:14:05.709 --> 00:14:11.079
Now....would yall believe me if I said that
I didn't know the film was fading to black

00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:13.930
and white until I got to this part.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:20.120
There are two versions of the film, one with
full color and one that fades to black and

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.239
white!

00:14:21.239 --> 00:14:24.790
Even the film sets and actor clothes reflect
this.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:30.459
I mean, Geum-ja wore a blue jacket earlier
but now she has a black leather jacket.

00:14:30.459 --> 00:14:35.480
When I initially watched the movie it was
on TubiTV, so I don't know if the copy my

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.559
video uses will be black and white but if
it isn't then it would be around the time

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:45.319
the parents came to the school.

00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:51.109
After all that murder, the parents and families
all sing happy birth to each of their children

00:14:51.109 --> 00:14:52.579
resting in heaven.

00:14:52.579 --> 00:14:58.169
In the bathroom, Geum-ja cleans off her red
eye shadow, and is done with the vengeance

00:14:58.169 --> 00:14:59.399
part of her life.

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:03.990
Suddenly though, Geum-ja is interrupted by
the spirit of Won-mo!

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.709
He over here using lung killers!

00:15:06.709 --> 00:15:11.249
She goes to speak with him, but right before
she can say anything, he gags her!

00:15:11.249 --> 00:15:13.739
He wasn't hearing no B.S.

00:15:13.739 --> 00:15:19.730
He quickly transforms into the age he woulda
been had he not died, and walks away.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.999
As Geum-ja leaves, she has a cake in her hand.

00:15:22.999 --> 00:15:28.439
Her coworker follows behind, singing and asking
if she is actually going to send her daughter

00:15:28.439 --> 00:15:29.439
back!

00:15:29.439 --> 00:15:35.269
She embraces with her daughter in the pure
white snow, and shoes her a white tofu cake.

00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:41.519
Remember, the white tofu cake is a promise
to live good like pure white, and sinless.

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:46.769
Jenny eats the cake, and offers some to her
mom too, but initially she thinks her time

00:15:46.769 --> 00:15:48.609
to be good is over.

00:15:48.609 --> 00:15:54.149
Well she retracts that, and the movie ends
as Geum-ja devours that white tofu cake!

00:15:54.149 --> 00:16:00.059
Well its nothing left to say but farewell
Geum-ja and the vengeance that overwhelmed

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:01.059
you!

00:16:01.059 --> 00:16:04.629
Now that we got through this film, lets talk
about the most disturbed moment, and most

00:16:04.629 --> 00:18:06.080
enjoyed moment in that SPOOKY STUFF!
