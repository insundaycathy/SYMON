00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.820
Gladiator, starring Russell Crowe as a disgraced
Roman general and Joaquin Phoenix playing

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.660
the caeser Commodus, son of Marcus Aureliusâ€™.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.930
It is an epic historical film that captures a very
Shakespearean sense of drama and atmosphere,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:28.640
and quite like Shakespeare takes a few artistic liberties with the source material, and historical facts

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.720
thus there are a few anachronisms, but that shouldn't take away from the enjoyment of the film.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.380
But in terms of cinematic legacy, Gladiator is a
love letter to classic â€˜sword-and-sandalâ€™

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.320
films of yesteryear; such as Spartacus, Ben-Hurr, Clash of the Titans, and Quo Vadis.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.320
Ave Imperator!

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.480
Gird your loins, we fight in the Arena!

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.630
In AD 180, Hispano-Roman General Maximus Decimus
Meridius intends to return to his home after

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.930
he leads the Roman army to victory against
the Germanic tribes near Vindobona on the

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.239
Limes Germanicus.

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.829
Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that
his own son, Commodus, is unfit to succeed

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:14.810
and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him,
as regent, to help save Rome from corruption.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.200
Commodus murders his father when he is told
about the plan.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.060
Commodus announces he is the new Emperor,
asks Maximus for his loyalty, and the general

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.400
refuses.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.221
Maximus is arrested by guards and is told
that he will die at dawn and meet his family

00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:34.020
in the afterlife, but he kills his captors
and rides for his home near Trujillo.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.860
He finds it burning and his family murdered.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.500
Maximus buries his wife and son; then collapses.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.570
He is found by slavers who take him to the
Roman province of Zucchabar, where he is sold

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.980
to a gladiator trainer named Proximo.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.320
Although reluctant at first, Maximus fights
in local tournaments and make friends with

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.360
two other gladiators: Juba, a Numidian; and
Hagen, a German.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.100
His military skills help him win matches and
gain recognition from other gladiators and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.100
the crowd.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.810
Proximo reveals that his own past has shown
him that to be a good killer is not enough;

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.729
a good gladiator is one who can "win the crowd".

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.239
Proximo takes his gladiators to fight in Rome's
Colosseum, because Commodus has organized

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.790
150 days of games.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.269
Disguised by a masked helmet, Maximus debuts
in gladiatorial combat in the Colosseum as

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.060
a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle
of Zama, where the Cartaginians are supposed

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.180
to be massacred by gladiators playing the
legionnaires of Scipio Africanus; but Maximus

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.999
leads his side to victory.

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:39.749
Commodus is pleased by the surprising outcome
and enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations.

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:45.400
Maximus cannot kill Commodus because Commodus's
nephew, Lucilla's son, whom Maximus has befriended,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.989
accompanies him.

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.909
Commodus orders the disguised Maximus, as
leader of the gladiators, to show himself

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:56.569
and give his name, which leads to Maximus
revealing himself and declaring vengeance.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.980
The Emperor is compelled by the crowd to let
the gladiators live, and the Praetorian Guard

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.379
is held back from striking them down.

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.110
Maximus's next fight is a victory against
a legendary undefeated gladiator.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.129
Commodus has ordered that the loser should
die; but Maximus spares his opponent's life,

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.829
and he is called "Maximus the Merciful" by
the crowd.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.120
Angered at this outcome, Commodus taunts Maximus
about his family's deaths, but Maximus turns

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.269
and walks awayâ€”another defiant act that
the emperor has to endure.

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.919
Maximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly,
that his former legions remain loyal.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:37.560
Lucilla, Commodus' sister; Gracchus, an influential
senator; and Maximus meet secretly.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.370
Maximus will escape Rome, join his soldiers,
topple Commodus by force, and hand power back

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.919
to the Roman Senate.

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.670
Commodus learns of the plot by threatening
Lucilla, and has the Praetorian Guard arrest

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.299
Gracchus and attack the gladiators' barracks.

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:57.719
Proximo and his men (including Hagen) sacrifice
themselves to enable Maximus to escape.

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:02.939
Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with
Cicero, where Cicero is killed.

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.049
Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel.

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.780
He stabs Maximus before the match to gain
an advantage.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.010
Maximus disarms Commodus, whom the Praetorian
Guard refuse to aid.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.640
The emperor feigns being disarmed then produces
a hidden knife.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.790
Maximus drives the blade into Commodus's throat
and then grows weak.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.570
Before he dies he asks for political reforms,
for his gladiator allies to be freed, and

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.500
for Senator Gracchus to be reinstated.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.670
He then succumbs to his wound.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.010
While the dead Commodus is left abandoned
on the dirt floor of the arena, Maximus's

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:47.390
friends and allies solemnly lift Maximus up
and honor him as "a soldier of Rome", at Lucilla's

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.390
behest.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.750
The crowd stands in respect as Maximus is
carried out to be given an honorable funeral.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.650
Juba visits the Colosseum at night and buries
the figurines of Maximus' wife and son at

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.500
the spot where he died.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.530
Juba says he is to return to his own family
and promises to see Maximus again, "but not

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.030
yet".
