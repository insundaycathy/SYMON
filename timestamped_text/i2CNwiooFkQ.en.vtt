00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.960
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going&nbsp;
to explain an episode from an American adult&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.760
animated anthology “Love, Death&nbsp;
&amp; Robots” called “Ice Age”.
&nbsp;

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.040
A young couple has just moved into their brand&nbsp;
new apartment. The husband named Rob brings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.240
boxes of their belongings into the house while&nbsp;
his wife Gail places utensils in the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.520
Gail is bothered by an old fridge that&nbsp;
the landlord had kept in the apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.960
They can not get rid of it, but&nbsp;
it looks hideous in the kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.280
Rob tries to be optimistic and tells her that old&nbsp;
fridges have technology that the new ones don’t,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.800
like the massive motor it has on top of it.&nbsp;
Gail sarcastically says that it is insane,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.600
making fun of her husband's geekiness. Tired&nbsp;
after carrying all the boxes, she suggests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.680
they drink some wine. Rob opens the old fridge to&nbsp;
see if it has some ice. To his surprise, he sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.440
thick chunks of ice cover the freezer. He gets a&nbsp;
cube and puts it in his drink. They sit down and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.000
make a toast to their new house. After taking a&nbsp;
sip, Rob notices a strange structure in the ice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.080
When Rob realizes what it is, he doesn’t seem&nbsp;
to believe his eyes. He hands the cube to Gail,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.400
asking her to confirm there’s something&nbsp;
in it. She brings out a magnifying glass,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.480
and the two look into it to see a tiny mammoth&nbsp;
frozen inside the cube. The two are confused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.680
and surprised. They notice that the tiny creature&nbsp;
was hunted because it has spears on its side.
&nbsp;

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.800
A confused Gail goes back to the freezer&nbsp;
and removes pieces of ice to finally reveal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.760
a tiny working medieval civilization. The time&nbsp;
inside the freezer seems to be passing by faster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.520
as the people go about their normal day in&nbsp;
seconds. The couple is fascinated and baffled as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.560
to how this can be possible. The people inside do&nbsp;
not seem to care about large giants watching them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.880
Sometime later, Rob buries the mammoth’s tiny body&nbsp;
under their house plant. Gail makes fun of him and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.840
opens the freezer again to see that the medieval&nbsp;
time has changed to the industrial revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.800
While they were away for a few minutes, decades&nbsp;
have gone by in the freezer. They watch people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.800
build tall buildings and houses in seconds. Rob&nbsp;
is sad because he missed the Renaissance period&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.840
and wonders if the people inside the freezer think&nbsp;
they are gods. Just then, two construction workers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.680
from inside the freezer complain about&nbsp;
the two idiots who watch them every day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.360
saying that they’re tired of looking at broccoli&nbsp;
on Gail’s teeth. In no time, the industrial era&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.120
changes into the modern era, and massive&nbsp;
skyscrapers are made. Tiny objects fly over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.320
the buildings, which Rob is confused about, but&nbsp;
Gail suggests that they might be airplanes. 
&nbsp;

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.440
The couple watches in fascination as the&nbsp;
time changes to the present. Rob laughs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.720
looking at a Starbucks building, trying to relate&nbsp;
to the tiny world. He moves closer to get a better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.800
look when suddenly, a massive bright missile&nbsp;
launches on the tiny city. A startled Rob falls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.160
back to the kitchen floor as Gail tries to help&nbsp;
him. The people inside the freezer are at a war,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.680
and everything seems to be destroyed. The couple&nbsp;
gets a look at humanity’s harsh future but doesn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.640
seem to care. Gail closes the refrigerator&nbsp;
claiming that the people cannot outgrow a war&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.920
in a few minutes, so they should come back&nbsp;
later. The two order a pizza and enjoy it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.640
completely ignoring the nuclear war happening&nbsp;
inside their freezer. About an hour later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.640
Rob suggests they check what is going on inside.&nbsp;
The couple seems to be afraid to open the freezer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.360
fearing they would look at the extinction of&nbsp;
humans. However, they are met with a pleasant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.720
surprise when they finally open it. The war&nbsp;
has ended, and mankind has recovered from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.920
They even notice flying cars and compare the&nbsp;
tiny futuristic place to the emerald city.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.280
Humans are more advanced than ever before.
The futuristic world has several skyscrapers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.800
connected with bridges in the beginning, but then,&nbsp;
a singular pyramid like structure takes over.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.360
They assume that everyone lives inside&nbsp;
the pyramid now. When the pyramid unfolds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.120
it reveals a diamond-shaped structure inside.&nbsp;
The structure absorbs the whole city, and Soon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.880
a sphere of energy forms in the middle. It finally&nbsp;
bursts, sending sparks of energy flying into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.880
couple’s kitchen. They watch in fascination as the&nbsp;
sparks jump around the room like fireflies. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.600
believe that humans have unfolded every secret of&nbsp;
the universe and are now traveling around space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.040
that is beyond their expectations. Then, the&nbsp;
sparks of light converge into the sphere again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.640
and transfer into the freezer, which the couple&nbsp;
assumes is their true home. At last, the sphere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.840
disappears, presumably indicating the end of&nbsp;
the world. The couple watches the empty freezer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.880
in confusion. Rob wonders if they are coming&nbsp;
back, but Gail claims that it is unlikely.
&nbsp;

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.720
Rob finally unplugs the refrigerator, and the&nbsp;
couple hug, having witnessed the past, present,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.560
and future of humanity in the past few hours. It&nbsp;
is now the following morning. The two wake up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.240
continue with their morning routine. However, the&nbsp;
thought of last evening hasn’t left their minds.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.000
They decide to open the freezer for the&nbsp;
last time to check if everything is really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.240
over. To their utmost surprise, the era of&nbsp;
dinosaurs has returned. Several tiny apes eat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.000
the flesh from a dead dinosaur. They run away as&nbsp;
another dinosaur attacks them. The episode ends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.080
as the couple continues to watch the tiny&nbsp;
creatures in their natural habitat.
&nbsp;

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.240
This episode of love death and&nbsp;
robots is particularly famous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.320
for the interesting concept of the whole creation,&nbsp;
evolution, and the end of mankind being shown in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.720
minuscule measurements. The concept of both time&nbsp;
and dimension is challenged by a magical freezer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.440
It is only right to call the freezer a natural&nbsp;
phenomenon because how it came into existence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.240
is never explained in the short movie. Some fans&nbsp;
of the show believe that the fridge belonged to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.880
the previous owners who were tired of watching the&nbsp;
fate of humanity repeatedly, so they left it in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.334
the house before moving. 

00:05:58.334 --> 00:06:01.360
The film also provides us hope for the future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.120
because the world inside the freezer&nbsp;
recovered from the most devastating war&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.880
mankind had ever seen. However, by watching&nbsp;
Rob and Gail order pizza and enjoy it while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.040
the little world was at war, we come&nbsp;
across the negligence of the people and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.360
their non-existent sense of responsibility&nbsp;
towards the problems of the world. 
&nbsp;

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.920
In this short film, we can witness a possible&nbsp;
future of humanity that doesn’t end in its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.560
extinction. Unlike the usual devastating&nbsp;
endings that most of the movies predict,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.280
“Ice Age” shows us the possibility of humans&nbsp;
figuring out the universe and becoming one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.880
with it. The ball of energy formed in the pyramid&nbsp;
like tower is most likely a technology that allows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.600
them to escape reality. After finding&nbsp;
out every secret about our existence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.880
the ball of energy disappeared into thin air,&nbsp;
indicating that humans changed dimensions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.716
and have turned into a higher being.
