00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.560
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going&nbsp;
to explain an action, horror, mystery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.800
and sci-fi film called "Pandorum."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.120
The Earth's resources have been rapidly&nbsp;
depleting due to its large population.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.720
By 2153, the population has grown to 24.34&nbsp;
billion, making food and water even more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.480
scarce. That same year, the Paleo-17 space probe&nbsp;
has reached the planet, Tanis. Project Elysium&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.880
is launched in 2174 as nations start to fight&nbsp;
over what remains of the world's resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.600
Soon, Elysium glides through space as its crew&nbsp;
listens to a multilingual message from Earth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.120
telling them, "You're all that's left of&nbsp;
us. Good luck, God Bless, and God speed."

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.040
Corporal Bower gasps for air as he wakes&nbsp;
up in panic inside his hypersleep pod.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.200
He breaks free from the harness&nbsp;
supporting him and rips out all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.480
the tubes attached to him as he leaves&nbsp;
the capsule. He checks the other pods&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.440
for other crew members and sees that&nbsp;
the pod for a crew member named Cooper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.160
is empty. Lieutenant Payton, on the other hand,&nbsp;
is still in his capsule, deep in hyper-sleep.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.880
As he gets dressed, he finds a picture of a&nbsp;
woman on his locker and takes it. He tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.640
unlocking the door to the bridge, but he fails,&nbsp;
so he tries to wake Payton by repeatedly hitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.440
his pod with a metal rod. A sudden power surge&nbsp;
on the ship soon causes Payton's pod to open.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.280
When Payton emerges, Bower informs him that they&nbsp;
are in the Elysium, but he can't find the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.840
crew members. With no other people around, Bower&nbsp;
speculates that the flight computer awakened him.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.800
Due to their long slumber, the two men struggle&nbsp;
to remember important details about their mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.840
Bower recalls the training he went through,&nbsp;
but he can't remember the objective.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.240
As they inspect the ship, they come across&nbsp;
the door of the bridge. Bower sees a few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.920
tools lying close to the door and asserts&nbsp;
that someone else tried to open it manually.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.440
The two men reach the communications&nbsp;
room and manage to activate the consoles.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.640
Payton tries to contact other team&nbsp;
members, but no one is answering.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.560
Bower learns from the tattoo on his arm that&nbsp;
they belong to Flight Team 5. When another power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.840
surge hits the ship, Payton tells Bower that&nbsp;
they have to find a way to get to the bridge.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.200
Bower climbs up the vent to look for&nbsp;
another opening that will allow him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.160
open the doors from the other side&nbsp;
of the command center. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.520
more power surges keep happening,&nbsp;
each lasting longer than the last.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.520
Bower figures out that the reactor needs to be&nbsp;
reset to keep the power up and running. Payton&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.960
deduces that Bower must be the ship's technical&nbsp;
engineer from his knowledge about the reactor.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.800
As he crawls through the vents, the&nbsp;
tubes around Bower start to get tighter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.480
making him feel claustrophobic. To calm him&nbsp;
down, Payton jokes that he had managed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.080
open the door on his own. Bower keeps going&nbsp;
until he falls down an angled section of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.080
vent. After activating a light stick, Bower&nbsp;
discovers Cooper's rotting corpse beside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.240
him. He struggles to free his hand from the&nbsp;
tubes constricting him to unlock the shaft.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.560
He falls through the grate and&nbsp;
finds himself in the storage room.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.280
Bower uses a metal bar to pry open the door, but&nbsp;
he loses communication with Payton after getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.720
in. While he is walking through the ship's&nbsp;
corridor, he sees a woman trying to force&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.760
a door open with a metal rod. However, she runs&nbsp;
away as soon as she sees Bower. He chases after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.600
her until he reaches another corridor where he&nbsp;
sees someone standing a few feet away from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.880
Bower tells the woman that he's part of&nbsp;
the flight crew as he walks closer to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.880
However, when he shines the light on her face,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.240
he discovers that it's a dead body of a man&nbsp;
hanging from a wire attached to the ceiling.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.600
The woman named Nadia suddenly emerges&nbsp;
from hiding and kicks Bower in the face.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.040
When he gets up, she knocks him to the ground&nbsp;
and gets on top of him, pinning him down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.760
While holding a knife to his neck, she takes&nbsp;
away his supplies asks him to remove his shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.040
However, she suddenly takes off when she&nbsp;
hears screeching sounds across the corridor.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.600
As Bower tries to run away, something pulls&nbsp;
the hanging corpse to the floor above him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.800
Bower runs back to the storage room&nbsp;
to hide. He takes a peek and sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.880
a ghoulish creature holding a&nbsp;
glowing spear looking for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.800
Unable to find Bower, the monstrous hunter&nbsp;
wails, prompting others to follow suit.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.640
While hiding in a vent, Payton&nbsp;
suddenly calls out to him on the radio.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.920
Bower quickly shuts it off to prevent&nbsp;
attracting the attention of the monsters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.960
A hunter suddenly turns up next to&nbsp;
him and tears the vent door open.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.280
He keeps himself quiet as the ghoul reaches into&nbsp;
the vent and grabs Cooper's body. Bower turns the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.400
radio back on and tells Payton that creatures&nbsp;
are running around the ship hunting people.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.120
Bower is hoping to contact someone on the bridge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.720
but Payton tells him that there will be no one to&nbsp;
help them because they're on a one-way mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.800
Payton tells him that the ship was not meant to&nbsp;
collect data or transfer cargo. Its mission is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.680
to take 60,000 people to Tanis. Bower recalls when&nbsp;
people on Earth first saw images of Tanis, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.760
was the first Earth-like planet discovered in&nbsp;
outer space. Bower believes that his wife must be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.600
onboard the ship because there's no way he would&nbsp;
leave her behind. Bower wants to find her, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.040
Payton argues that it would be easier to look for&nbsp;
their wives once they are in control of the ship.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.240
Bower wanders around the security room and finds a&nbsp;
non-lethal anti-riot gun. Bower then tells Payton&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.920
to look for a path to the reactor bay so he could&nbsp;
reset it. While Payton looks for a safe route,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.160
Bower feels his hand trembling, so he asks&nbsp;
Payton if he remembers the symptoms of Pandorum.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.360
Payton recalls that the syndrome had&nbsp;
caused the Eden mission to fail. An&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.800
officer had a psychological breakdown&nbsp;
after two years on duty. Believing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.720
the flight was cursed, he evacuated the ship,&nbsp;
sending 5,000 to their deaths in outer space.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.280
Bower soon reaches a corridor, where he&nbsp;
comes across another man hanging from a wire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.960
When he comes closer to investigate, the&nbsp;
man suddenly wakes up and flails around.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.440
Bower tells him to relax and be quiet before&nbsp;
cutting him down. He finds out that the man, named&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.960
Shepard, belongs to team 6. Shepard initially&nbsp;
thinks that Bower is a member of a rescue team,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.120
but when Shepard realizes that Bower just woke up,&nbsp;
he ignores the chain of command and tries to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.440
off on his own. He starts covering himself up with&nbsp;
grease to disguise his scent from the hunters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.640
But before he could walk away, he sees the&nbsp;
blue torches moving in their direction.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.960
Bower aims his non-lethal gun at the hunters, but&nbsp;
Shepard tells him to run because it won't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.040
an effect on them. Bower tries to catch up with&nbsp;
Shepard, but hunters catch Shepard while he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.440
hiding in a corner. While the hunters are feasting&nbsp;
on Shepard, Bower shoots his weapon at a creature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.360
not realizing that there's a glass between&nbsp;
them. Several hunters start chasing after him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.640
so he hides by hanging from the tubes&nbsp;
on the ceiling. Hunters soon find him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.040
and snag him with a wire, but&nbsp;
a man arrives to cut him loose.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.560
Bower can't understand the man's language,&nbsp;
but he learns that he's part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.720
agricultural team when he sees his tattoo.&nbsp;
He tells the agriculturalist, named Manh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.560
that he's looking for the reactor,&nbsp;
so he tells Manh to stay behind.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.040
Back in the communications room, Payton tries&nbsp;
to break the door open with a metal bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.320
He suddenly hears someone moving through&nbsp;
the vents, so he locks it with a wrench.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.480
While finding his way to the reactor, Bower&nbsp;
comes across an area full of shipping containers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.480
Nadia suddenly shows up and attacks him.&nbsp;
Bower retaliates, but Nadia manages to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.760
throw him out of the container. Nadia&nbsp;
follows him down to attack him again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.120
but Manh shows up to defend him.&nbsp;
While Manh and Nadia are fighting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.520
Bower uses his anti-riot gun, causing debris&nbsp;
to fall on them. As soon as they take cover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.040
Bower appeals to both of them to start working&nbsp;
as a team instead of fighting each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.040
Manh volunteers to take Bower to the reactor,&nbsp;
so they go on their way, leaving Nadia behind.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.600
Nadia soon follows them and says they're going&nbsp;
in the wrong direction. Bower asks her to show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.120
him the way, but she says she doesn't want to go&nbsp;
there because no one comes back alive from that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.760
area. Nadia agrees to take Bower after he claims&nbsp;
that he is capable of flying and landing the ship.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.320
Nadia leads them to a locked door,&nbsp;
but she tells them to they have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.200
wait before she could open it. While&nbsp;
they're waiting, they hear the growls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.440
of hunters getting closer. A power surge&nbsp;
hits the ship as the hunters reach the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.800
The door soon opens, with the three barely&nbsp;
escaping from the monstrous creatures.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.360
Inside the room, Bower learns that Nadia is&nbsp;
part of the genetic sampling team responsible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.360
for gathering the D.N.A. of every plant and&nbsp;
animal life on Earth to preserve it on the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.200
There used to be five of them guarding the&nbsp;
specimens when Nadia woke up several months ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.720
Now, she's the only one left. Nadia&nbsp;
stresses that they've already lost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.920
30 percent of the genetic samples.&nbsp;
She fears that all the specimens in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.560
the Embryonic chamber will be wiped&nbsp;
out if they don't fix the reactor.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.800
In the communications room, Payton is suddenly&nbsp;
awakened by a noise coming from the vent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.480
so he climbs up to investigate. He follows&nbsp;
the noise and figures out that it's coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.000
from inside the bundle of pipes, so he&nbsp;
prepares to hit it when something comes out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.400
However, he is startled when he sees a hand reach&nbsp;
out to him. A man calls out for help and tries to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.640
inch his way out of the pipes, so Payton pulls him&nbsp;
out. The man tells him that he is Corporal Gallo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.120
and he came from the bridge of the ship.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.280
The trio soon reaches the hyper-sleep chamber,&nbsp;
which is also the main hunting ground of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.520
ghoulish creatures. Bower takes a look inside&nbsp;
the pods and finds that most of them are empty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.760
Bower surmises that his wife&nbsp;
could be in one of the pods,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.400
but Nadia says family members are&nbsp;
kept in another part of the ship.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.480
Manh falls behind the two as he listens&nbsp;
intently for the arrival of hunters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.920
He doesn't move even when Bower calls&nbsp;
out to him, so they decide to leave him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.360
However, Bower falls through a broken&nbsp;
grate as he tries to follow Nadia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.200
When Nadia goes back for him, she falls&nbsp;
through the grate too. They soon discover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.760
that they've fallen through the pit where&nbsp;
the hunters dump the bones of their victims.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.240
The two carefully climb back up when everything&nbsp;
goes quiet, but a ghoul notices Bower and attacks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.400
him. The hunter then goes after Nadia while&nbsp;
Bower is still disoriented from the attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.160
Bower breaks free from the wires binding him&nbsp;
and lunges after the creature. Bower is thrown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.560
across the room, but he manages to strike a blow&nbsp;
against the hunter using a pipe. He tries to hit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.640
the ghoul again, but the creature blocks it and&nbsp;
hits him, sending him crashing against a pod.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.560
Manh emerges and slashes the monster in the&nbsp;
head. The three take turns to attack the ghoul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.640
until Bower stabs it in the chest. They continue&nbsp;
stabbing the hunter to make sure that it's dead.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.080
The leader of the hunters soon arrives and starts&nbsp;
banging on the floor to call the other creatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.240
Some of the ghouls run after them while others&nbsp;
jump on the fallen creature to feast on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.560
As the group runs away, a pod opens up and wakes&nbsp;
the man inside it. The monsters start attacking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.480
the man as soon as he emerges. Bower tries to&nbsp;
come back to help, but Manh drags him away.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.840
Payton checks Gallo's tattoo and learns&nbsp;
that he was part of Flight Team 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.800
He tries to ask more questions, but Gallo becomes&nbsp;
irritated, saying he doesn't know anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.560
Payton notices the blood smeared across&nbsp;
Gallo's body and asks him if it was his.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.000
Gallo says that some of it is his own but&nbsp;
hints that some belong to his teammates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.840
He asserts that something was wrong with the&nbsp;
other crew members, so he had to defend himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.160
He tells Payton that he would've&nbsp;
done the same thing if he saw them.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.560
The three soon come across a large chamber&nbsp;
after getting lost on their way to the reactor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.840
They meet a man named Leland, who offers to&nbsp;
cook for them. As Leland prepares the food,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.800
Bower asks Nadia if the creatures&nbsp;
could've originated from Nadia's lab.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.720
Nadia thinks that the hunters were passengers&nbsp;
who have mutated because of the accelerators&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.400
injected into their bloodstream. The enzyme&nbsp;
was supposed to help the humans adapt to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.000
environment when they reach Tanis, but the people&nbsp;
who were awakened before them adapted to the ship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.240
instead. She deduces that the ghouls may have been&nbsp;
awake much longer than any surviving crew members.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.480
Meanwhile, Payton grabs a needle gun to&nbsp;
sedate Gallo, but he refuses and starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.240
asking Payton if he'd seen the symptoms of&nbsp;
Pandorum first-hand. Gallo stresses that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.160
syndrome is affected by psychological trauma&nbsp;
and comes with an emotional trigger effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.800
Payton's hand starts shaking, so&nbsp;
he tries to hide it from Gallo.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.160
Back in the chamber, Leland starts&nbsp;
telling the group what happened on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.760
the ship with the help of&nbsp;
the drawings on the walls.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.240
Gallo also reveals to Payton what transpired&nbsp;
at the bridge before Bower woke up.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.240
When Elysium left Earth, three crew members&nbsp;
were left in charge of flying the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.480
Gallo detected mild symptoms of Pandorum on&nbsp;
his commanding officer and his 2nd lieutenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.160
The symptoms, however, became more severe&nbsp;
when they received a message from Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.920
The transmission bids them farewell,&nbsp;
saying, "You're all that's left of us.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.480
Good luck, God Bless, and God speed." The&nbsp;
crew learns that Earth has been decimated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.280
Elysium scanned the grid for any signs&nbsp;
of the planet but couldn't find it.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.200
Soon after receiving the message, Gallo&nbsp;
killed the C.O. and his 2nd lieutenant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.320
claiming that they had lost their minds.&nbsp;
Instead of going back to hyper-sleep,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.760
Gallo stayed up and woke other passengers.&nbsp;
He put some of them on the cargo hold,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.520
leaving them with no choice but to scavenge&nbsp;
for food and eventually feed on each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.800
After growing tired of leading the&nbsp;
crew, Gallo went back to hyper-sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.320
While he was in hibernation, a different kind&nbsp;
of evil was unleashed from the cargo hold.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.840
As Leland tells his story, white&nbsp;
smoke emanates from the walls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.760
and the group starts to feel light-headed.&nbsp;
They pass out as soon as Leland finishes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.040
Back in the communications room, Payton's&nbsp;
shivers have become much worse and apparent.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.400
When Bower wakes up, he finds himself and his two&nbsp;
companions tied upside down in Leland's chamber.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.480
Nadia concludes that Leland is planning to&nbsp;
eat them. She goes on to antagonize Leland,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.400
so he stabs her near her ribs. Bower tries&nbsp;
to convince Leland that he can save the ship,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.720
but Leland asserts that Bower will say anything&nbsp;
to survive. Bower explains that the power surges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.600
indicate that the ship is in its final&nbsp;
phase before it totally shuts down and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.160
kills everyone on board. He says that they have&nbsp;
less than an hour to reset the reactor. Leland&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.080
realizes that the power surges have been&nbsp;
getting worse, so he agrees to help them.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.680
Bower contacts Payton and asks him to check the&nbsp;
data from the last power surge to find out how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.920
much time they have left. Payton informs them that&nbsp;
they have 47 minutes before the ship shuts down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.520
completely. Bower then tells the lieutenant&nbsp;
to find them a safe path to the reactor.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.600
The group comes across a little ghoul&nbsp;
along the way, so Manh tries to kill it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.960
Nadia stops him and points out that&nbsp;
it's just a child. As they argue,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.880
the creature runs away and jumps up to an&nbsp;
open vent. A full-grown hunter soon emerges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.400
and chases them. They hide in a chamber&nbsp;
containing the pods of the crew's family.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.080
Back in the communications room, Gallo&nbsp;
tries to convince Payton to leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.520
ship and forget about resetting the power&nbsp;
supply. He argues that Bower couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.360
figure out his own name when he woke up 24&nbsp;
hours ago, much less configure a reactor.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.240
Bower soon notices that all the pods are empty.&nbsp;
Nadia asks him if he thinks his wife was in one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.960
of the pods. Bower says she's not, recalling&nbsp;
that she refused to come with him. He reveals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.800
that he decided to enlist to be included in&nbsp;
Project Elysium because his wife left him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.880
Seeing the empty capsules, Bower starts to&nbsp;
feel discouraged and refuses to go further.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.880
Nadia, however, convinces him that they need&nbsp;
to complete the mission and reach Tanis.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.480
When he sees the pod of Payton's wife, he starts&nbsp;
to remember something about the lieutenant,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.920
but he doesn't disclose it to the group.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.320
The group soon reaches the reactor room, but&nbsp;
they find that it's full of sleeping hunters.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.840
One creature was suddenly jolted awake by the&nbsp;
noise when Bower steps on the footway, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.000
soon falls back to sleep. Bower walks further,&nbsp;
but the footpath suddenly breaks before he could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.480
reach the reactor. Nadia quickly runs toward him&nbsp;
to pull him up while Manh holds the bridge. Bower,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.240
however, decides to drop down when he sees Manh&nbsp;
struggling to carry the weight of the footpath.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.480
Bower covers himself up with slime and wears&nbsp;
dead skin that he found lying around to avoid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.120
being detected when he sets foot on the&nbsp;
ground where the creatures are sleeping.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.920
Meanwhile, Gallo manages to take the needle&nbsp;
gun from Payton and force him to open up a pod.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.080
He tells Payton to enter the&nbsp;
code to eject the capsule,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.080
but Payton stops and leaves&nbsp;
him locked up in there.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.000
While Bower sneaks his way back up to&nbsp;
the console, Leland accidentally drops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.680
a flashlight and wakes up the monsters. Manh&nbsp;
drops the bridge on them and yells to attract&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.160
their attention. Bower soon reaches the reactor&nbsp;
and resets it with less than 4 minutes left.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.440
As the machine restarts, the discharge&nbsp;
blasts away some of the hunters.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.280
Manh makes it out of the reactor bay, but he&nbsp;
soon meets the chief hunter and fights with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.240
In the communications room, Payton&nbsp;
tries to open the door to the bridge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.560
but Gallo warns him against going in there. He&nbsp;
mutes the audio coming from Gallo's pod, but he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.200
still hears his voice somehow. Manh manages to&nbsp;
stab the chief hunter with the spear. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.120
Leland sees Bower and Nadia being chased by&nbsp;
ghouls, so he decides to close the door on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.160
Fortunately, they are able to lock&nbsp;
the ghouls out on the other side.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.880
The creature continues attacking Manh and bites&nbsp;
him on the stomach. As the hunter chews on him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.800
Manh breaks a rod protruding from the creature's&nbsp;
suit and stabs it repeatedly until it dies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.920
When he turns around, he sees a&nbsp;
young ghoul staring at him. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.640
approaches it to stab it with&nbsp;
his knife, but he hesitates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.560
As he slowly puts his weapon down, the child&nbsp;
suddenly strikes at him, cutting his throat open.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.560
Gallo breaks out of the pod and tries&nbsp;
to inject Payton with the sedative.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.600
As they struggle, Payton sees&nbsp;
their tattooed arms start to merge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.720
When the needle pierces his skin, he&nbsp;
realizes that he is alone in the room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.200
Leland soon arrives at the bridge, telling Payton&nbsp;
that he helped Bower to restart the reactor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.320
Payton stabs Leland with the needle gun&nbsp;
in the eye and walks back to the console.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.680
Nadia and Bower soon arrive at the communications&nbsp;
room, evading the monsters chasing after them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.480
Bower heads straight to the bridge to&nbsp;
confront Payton, recalling that he's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.040
really his lieutenant. Payton reveals that he is&nbsp;
Corporal Gallo. When Bower asks where they are,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.840
Payton opens the window and shows them&nbsp;
there is no sign of stars anywhere.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.440
Bower soon starts feeling symptoms&nbsp;
of Pandorum while Payton explains his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.120
motivation for sabotaging the mission. He&nbsp;
subdues Payton and starts pulling out his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.040
teeth. But Nadia suddenly interrupts him&nbsp;
and tells him to look at the window again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.560
They soon discover that they're underwater&nbsp;
and they've been in Tanis all along. A console&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.560
informs them that it has been 923 since the&nbsp;
ship flew out of the Earth's atmosphere.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.560
Payton attacks Bower, who starts hallucinating&nbsp;
as the symptoms of Pandorum get worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.120
Nadia tries to fight Payton, but the lieutenant&nbsp;
overpowers her. Bower shoots his anti-riot gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.720
at a compartment, thinking that there's a&nbsp;
hunter emerging. The blast breaks a piece&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.240
of the compartment and hits the window, causing it&nbsp;
to crack and break open from the water pressure.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.880
As the water floods the room, Nadia&nbsp;
and Bower run to a pod and get inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.040
Payton drowns as the water continues to flow&nbsp;
into the ship. Nadia panics as she sees the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.600
water level in the pod rising rapidly, but Bower&nbsp;
tells her to hold on. The pod soon takes off and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.840
propels its way to the surface. Bower puts the&nbsp;
oxygen mask on Nadia while he holds his breath.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.160
Upon reaching the surface, Bower takes&nbsp;
off the oxygen mask and wakes Nadia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.080
telling her that they're safe. Soon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.160
other pods emerge from the water as a result&nbsp;
of the ship's emergency evacuation protocol.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.920
Bower and Nadia smile as they watch the other&nbsp;
people start waking up to a wondrous new planet.
