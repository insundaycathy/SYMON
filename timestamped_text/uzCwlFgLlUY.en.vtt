00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.860
Welcome to Moviecaps.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.990
Today I will show you a Drama, Fantasy, Sci
fi film from 2013, titled After the dark.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.610
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.289
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.230
James oversleeps and barely makes it to class;
Mr. Zimit, a philosophy teacher, reluctantly

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.550
lets him in.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.230
His girlfriend Petra, the best student in
her class, gives him a disappointed look.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.390
It's an international school in Jakarta.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.740
It is their last day.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.630
Mr. Zimit has challenged his class of twenty
with thought exercises to prepare them for

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.849
their future.

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.579
The class gives their examples of thought
experiments.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.170
For example, if you give a monkey a typewriter
and an infinite amount of time, it will surely

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.440
type out the entire hamlet eventually.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.190
Or trolley problem, one with a lever, where
you have to choose between 1 or 4 people,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.290
and the obese man problem where you have to
push him on the tracks to stop the trolley.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.329
Would you do it?

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.019
Mr. Zimit holds an exercise in which he assumes
an impending atomic apocalypse.

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.770
There's a bunker that will give them shelter
for a year.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.339
They look around and see all kinds of leisures.

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.789
The problem with this is that there are only
supplies for ten people.

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.420
The students have to decide which of them
to let in and they do not have much time before

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.740
the atomic radiation reaches them.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.450
The best student, Petra, initially refuses
to participate, but Zimit threatens to lower

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.290
her boyfriend's academic grade if she does
not.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.120
So she stays.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.780
Zimit distributes cards containing details
about the characters of the students in the

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.930
exercise.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.430
The odd thing that everyone notices is that
after Zimit gives Petra and James their cards,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.190
he starts coughing.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.470
Everyone starts to introduce their characters
in the thought exercise.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.030
James is an organic farmer and Petra is an
engineer.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.430
Real estate agent.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.470
Carpenter.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.610
Opera singer.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.850
Hedge fund manager.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.850
Harpist.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.850
Astronaut.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.130
PHD in chemistry.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.250
Electrician.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.390
Wine auctioneer.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.530
Surgeon.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.670
Housekeeper.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.210
Fashion designer.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.380
Pastry chef.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.560
Zoologist.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.730
Psychotherapist.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.910
Soldier.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.090
Senator.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.740
And last but not least, a published poet.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.610
He is immediately shot by Zimit, on the grounds
that this is more humane than letting them

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.660
die by radiation, since he would not get into
the bunker anyway.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.959
Zimit is part of the exercise, but his abilities
are hidden.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.879
The students defend their right to enter the
bunker, then there is a group vote after the

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:16.879
discussion.

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.000
The last place was between Zimit and the opera
singer, Zimit got the spot.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.370
In their hypothetical scenario, they take
5 minutes to say goodbye, and in the classroom

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.840
they move the desks to sit with the survivors
and the abandoned.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.620
They hear gunshots.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.680
Zimit has killed everyone who did not get
a spot in the bunker.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.370
The group is shocked.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.410
Petra whispers to James that she does not
want him in the bunker.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.659
James devises a plan where everyone, before
going into the bunker, gathers some plants.

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.269
While everyone is separated, he goes to each
of them in turn and tells them that they will

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.890
meet in the bunker.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.170
After a while, Zimit notices this.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.359
They disable the external keypad and close
the bunker while Zimit stays outside.

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.939
Inside, they take a look at what they'll be
working with next year.

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.760
An artificial garden, a day bed, anything
to relieve depression.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.969
James meets Petra later on the bed and tells
her he can get through anything with her.

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.370
When James falls asleep, Petra goes to check
on Zimit.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.769
Outside, Zimit holds up a piece of paper that
says only he has the exit code.

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.599
The group is not sure if what he wrote is
true or not.

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.469
They will have to live for a year to find
an answer to this.

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:24.019
The group lives in a bunker and performs some
mundane tasks there.

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.930
Their lives are unsatisfying and agonizing.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.010
Petra still checks on Zimit's body from time
to time.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.010
She looks dejected.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.980
It has not been what you would call a heavenly
year.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.689
They wondered if the end of their first ordeal
would be the beginning of their next.

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:42.780
After surviving the year in the bunker, the
survivors discover that the exit code is necessary.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.370
All attempts to break out of the bunker are
futile.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.160
Their supplies are depleted.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.770
They all end themselves.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.080
The thought exercise was a bust.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.650
Zimit's card is a bunker builder, so he's
the only one who has the code.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.049
They decide to try the exercise again.

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.049
They still have a bunker and still have an
apocalypse.

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.799
While everyone is distracted, Zimit runs in
and grabs a gun.

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.230
Petra takes notice.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.109
It turns out that the previously distributed
cards contain a second detail that changes

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:10.109
the vote.

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.239
James, an organic farmer who is homosexual,
is accepted.

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.630
The surgeon who was previously approved may
now have contracted the Ebola virus and is

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.820
rejected.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.670
She berates Zimit and calls his logic nonsense.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.410
The hedge fund manager travels with a bag
of gold and is accepted.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.770
The bonus is that she is a girl and can carry
a child.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.400
Carpenter is infertile, but gets in anyway.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.300
Petra is also an electrical engineer.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.650
The electrician has a very rare disease and
is rejected.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.630
Psychotherapists can not have children.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.820
The zoologist blogs for PETA.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.920
The chemist with a PhD who won the genetic
lottery.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.550
The real estate agent is also a midwife.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.510
The pastry chef has nothing extra on his menu
and is a bit confused.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.700
The opera singer speaks 7 languages, but she
has a second addition that is not so welcome

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.660
- in 3 years she will develop a throat tumor.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.130
Wine auctioneer has an IQ of 200.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.330
Fashion designer has nothing significant to
add.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.850
Harpist with autism spectrum disorder.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.040
Senator is the first female Supreme Court
justice.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.040
Soldier with perfect memory.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.380
Housekeeper is just a nice guy.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.620
Let's hear the Published poet's story... maybe
not this time.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.560
Zimit says his spot is for him.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.670
They still do not know the code.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.030
Those who did not make it into the bunker
try to escape the explosions.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.470
They fail.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.220
Those chosen to live in the bunker rush there.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.590
Petra wakes up and goes snooping around.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.470
She sees James with the Chemist.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.330
It turns out that he is also homosexual outside
the exercise.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.790
Aside from what's on the cards, they keep
their personalities within the thought experiment.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.670
Petra is mildly disappointed.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.820
The group discusses how they will get together
to procreate.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.400
Since the carpenter is infertile, he is eliminated,
as are the chemist and James.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.770
Petra is paired with Zimit and off they go.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.730
The midwife is with the soldier and the senator
is with the housekeeper.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.900
Explosions still ravage the earth.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.200
After 10 weeks of no pregnancies, Zimit argues
that they must change couples.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.660
The soldier with the perfect memory refuses,
saying they are taking logic too far to solve

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:10.870
things.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.870
Zimit walks away.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.620
A moment later he returns with a gun and threatens
everyone but the soldier to leave the room.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.570
The chemist hides behind a corner.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.490
As everyone leaves, he lunges at Zimit, causing
him to drop the gun.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.580
The soldier grabs it and holds him at gunpoint,
but that doesn't faze him.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.560
Zimit seems to get the better of the chemist,
but he picks up a nearby pencil and jabs him

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.860
in the ear.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.380
Zimit responds by opening the bunker doors
and killing everyone.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.650
Another bust.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.320
James questions Zimit's motives for the exercise
and asks why he seems so intent on punishing

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.320
them.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.740
He mentions the strange cough he had when
he assigned him and Petra the roles, and he

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.180
has not coughed since.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.010
He pretends to leave and suddenly bolts to
grab the box with the cards.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.290
James discovers that the box has hidden compartments
and his and Petra's cards have been tampered

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.290
with.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.910
He questions Zimit's vendetta against him.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.180
Zimit asks if he remembers the allegory of
Plato's cave.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.080
In short, a man lives his whole life, since
he is a small child, chained to a wall.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.130
He only ever sees shadows and hears echoes,
assuming that this is reality as it really

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.850
looks and sounds.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.780
One day he is unchained and finds that the
shadows are caused by bodies and the echoes

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.560
are caused by voices.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.820
The whole idea of what was real was just an
illusion.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.750
Zimit says that this allegory is something
like James.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.720
He claims the exercise is meant to confront
James about how his privilege has ill-prepared

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.050
him for the real world, but James does not
believe him.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.190
Why make him a farmer, he could have been
something useless, like florist.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.200
Petra insists that the exercise be done a
third time.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.160
This time James will be a florist.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.970
In their third exercise they are on an island,
they are early.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.530
Zimit goes for a quick check, we all know
it's not just a quick check.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.520
He grabs a gun and hides the rest, hears a
noise but thinks nothing of it.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.880
Once outside, Petra joins him, she offers
him an innocent hug, telling that she knows

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.740
it's been hard on him.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.650
Petra asks everyone to trust her to choose
who gets to enter the bunker.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:03.950
Everyone agrees.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.440
Petra chooses and explains all of her choices.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.010
A wine auctioneer with a genius IQ and some
wine with her.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.420
Outright Zimit is speechless.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:16.410
Fashion designer, dressing well boosts confidence
that promotes productivity, which rebuilds

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.890
civilization, also our poor Poet, his second
skill is champion poker player and he brought

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.490
his cards with him.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.820
Harpist with autism, some people consider
it a gift.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.980
Surgeon who was exposed to ebola - Petra is
praying she wasn’t infected.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.769
Opera singer, she could be mute in 3 years,
but now everyone could fall asleep to her

00:08:34.769 --> 00:08:35.769
singing.

00:08:35.769 --> 00:08:38.750
Chemist is taken in because of his perfect
genes, but he is distraught that he will be

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.949
the only one who wont have a partner as he
is homosexual.

00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:45.950
In class he says that statistically someone
has to be, the pastry chef comes out of the

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.070
closet and is allowed in the bunker.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.730
Two spots left.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.440
Petra chooses James.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.459
Zimit has enough, there is no way you can
justify it.

00:08:54.459 --> 00:08:56.970
In class he threatens her with a failing grade.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.939
He won't allow this to slide.

00:08:58.939 --> 00:09:01.749
When he reaches for his gun, it's not there.

00:09:01.749 --> 00:09:04.010
Petra swindled it while hugging him earlier.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.680
She gives him back the gun.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.519
He tries to shoot, but the gun is not loaded.

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:10.009
Petra hands him 2 bullets.

00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:12.720
(She doesn't want him to suffer like last
time).

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.019
James threatens Zimit with a rifle.

00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:17.100
He saw him trying to hide the guns.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.380
With the last card under his sleeve, Zimit
says that no one knows the exit code except

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.420
him.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.079
Soldier with her perfect memory remembers
it from the previous iteration.

00:09:26.079 --> 00:09:27.740
He leaves defeated.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.740
Petra wants to give the last slot to the Soldier,
in her logic, everyone’s life is equal.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.230
Soldier outright refuses to take her spot.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.660
So the sterile carpenter takes the last spot.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:42.580
James, (who is no longer homosexual in this
exercise), begs Petra to come.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.449
She says she will take the boat and try to
get out of the radiation zone, and the carpenter

00:09:46.449 --> 00:09:48.660
tells that he has the keys to the boat.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.040
He pushes her inside, switching places with
her before the door closes.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.579
Rest rush to the boat to get off the island.

00:09:55.579 --> 00:10:00.100
Petra continues the thought exercise, explaining
that despite horrific circumstances, that

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.949
should make everyone absolutely miserable,
somehow they had fun.

00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:05.060
Cards helped.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.060
Alot.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.199
Some good wine.

00:10:07.199 --> 00:10:10.089
Shakespere performances and original poems.

00:10:10.089 --> 00:10:15.220
James tells how much he loves Petra, but she
hesitates to respond with the same phrase.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.809
Petra makes a harp for the harpist and with
the Opera singer, their evenings were always

00:10:18.809 --> 00:10:23.390
magical.The bunker was enjoyable and filled
with creativity.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.749
When they leave, they discover that the bombs
never fell.

00:10:26.749 --> 00:10:30.649
Zimit narrates that they will die, as none
of them have the technical skills to survive

00:10:30.649 --> 00:10:34.649
on an island, but Petra counters that they
will live the rest of their short lives well

00:10:34.649 --> 00:10:40.019
and welcome death when it arrives, they summon
it, because that’s the way that cookie crumbles.

00:10:40.019 --> 00:10:43.029
Zimit shoots, stopping him from detonating
the rocket.

00:10:43.029 --> 00:10:46.440
He had found a cave and went deep enough to
avoid the radiation.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.649
For the past year he has been there.

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:52.579
Zimit can’t let him commit an act as unreasonable
as ending the human race.

00:10:52.579 --> 00:10:56.339
He threatens to shoot James with his last
bullet, but the rest of the survivors stand

00:10:56.339 --> 00:10:57.620
in front of him.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.660
My man poet didn’t have enough.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.740
They press the detonation button.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.120
Boom.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.879
Back in class, Zimit is ashamed by the latest
exercise.

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:08.649
Flashback to Carpenter.

00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:11.149
He ran his own little thought exercise.

00:11:11.149 --> 00:11:13.699
One man with 6 women all to himself.

00:11:13.699 --> 00:11:18.690
After questioning, what happened to 3 other
males he explains - Real estate agent Drowned.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.449
Housekeeper had a barracuda attack.

00:11:21.449 --> 00:11:23.410
Electrician had a run in with the palm tree.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.829
Being infertile doesn't mean the chance of
procreation is 0.

00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:30.519
What's the point of living if you can’t
do some pair yoga exercises?

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:32.220
Chemist gives him praise.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.760
At the end of the session, everyone leaves
except Petra, she steps outside and accuses

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.160
Zimit of trying to use the exercise to punish
James.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.390
Zimit has been having an affair with Petra,
and he believes James is beneath her.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:47.269
Petra argues that intelligence isn't all that
matters.

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:48.850
She loves James.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.399
Petra gives Zimit a last kiss and leaves.

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:55.869
The film ends with Zimit alone in the school,
running many thought exercises with himself,

00:11:55.869 --> 00:11:58.060
as he contemplates ending it all.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.060
The End.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.600
Thank you for watching!
