00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.680
if you received a call from a distressed girl from&nbsp;
the past that gradually becomes your time warp bff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.560
but switches into psychopath mode and tries to&nbsp;
murder you and your whole family what would you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.680
do in this how to beat video we follow Seo-&nbsp;
Yeon look at the mistakes she made and figure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.280
out what we would do in order to survive and&nbsp;
ultimately beat the call if you like this type&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.200
of video consider leaving a like and subscribe&nbsp;
Seo-Yeon is on her way back to her child at home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.640
i am not sure how she intended to arrive there but&nbsp;
without the help of the local strawberry farmer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.760
the opening scene would be a pretty long one&nbsp;
once they arrive we learn that she has lost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.240
her phone somewhere along the way and of course&nbsp;
in 2019 this is a pretty big deal since her mom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.400
is bedridden in a hospital she desperately needs a&nbsp;
phone to communicate as she looks through her old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.640
house she finds a cordless phone plugs it in and&nbsp;
calls her lost cell phone the people who answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.400
and found the phone aren't much helpful and demand&nbsp;
a reward just before they hang up it doesn't take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.600
long and the phone rings the first time when she&nbsp;
picks up the voice on the other side mentions in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.440
much distress how her mom is insane and that she&nbsp;
got locked up in her room both conclude the caller&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.800
must have dialed the wrong number wrong number&nbsp;
or not that is a pretty weird call to receive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.880
but it gets even crazier after Seo-Yeon comes back&nbsp;
from visiting her father's grave the phone rings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.120
again this time the caller mentions how her mom is&nbsp;
trying to kill her and that somebody must help her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.360
at best it's a terrible joke and at worst somebody&nbsp;
is about to die either way you are the only one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.440
aware and therefore the only one with the power to&nbsp;
do something if i received a call like that i'd be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.720
pretty stressed out i would at least call the&nbsp;
cops and let them know about the content of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.520
weird calls i'm receiving even if it's just to put&nbsp;
my mind at ease she goes for a nap instead this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.440
woman must have a pretty healthy sleep pattern if&nbsp;
i spend some quality time in this creepy old villa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.880
and received frequent calls like that i would&nbsp;
probably reach out for some xanax or just leave

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.880
yeah that's the last thing i would want to happen&nbsp;
i see two options here you either go check it out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.960
which you should if you plan on continue sleeping&nbsp;
or you pack your stuff and leave if you decide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.360
to check it out at least arm yourself chances are&nbsp;
pretty high that that was coming from an intruder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.720
according to the state of this house it looks&nbsp;
like nobody has lived in it for quite some time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.640
if i were homeless a serial killer or someone on&nbsp;
the run estates like this one would be my first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.800
choice of hideout but of course she ignores the&nbsp;
rationales and goes to have a look barehandedly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.080
turns out it was just a portrait that fell down&nbsp;
lucky this time but something still doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.840
seem right when she tries hanging it back on she&nbsp;
figures out that there is a hidden part behind the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.000
wall i don't know about you all but if i found a&nbsp;
secret part of my house i'd be pretty freaked out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.240
if this is a house in which you have lived&nbsp;
for several years but never noticed this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.320
secret part existed it could very well mean that&nbsp;
somebody built it in after you abandoned the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:32.480
if that's the case then you probably don't want&nbsp;
to go check it out on your own when she goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.760
checking out the hidden part against all logic&nbsp;
she finds a box with some creepy content in it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.680
among items straight from the exorcist she&nbsp;
finds a diary that explains the daily tortures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.920
the owner had to go through next to the diary she&nbsp;
finds a photo of a woman about the same age as her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.920
that was shot 20 years ago exactly one day&nbsp;
before our main character's father died&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.080
coincidence i don't think so after receiving&nbsp;
another call our character concludes that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.560
caller is the owner of the diary and the same girl&nbsp;
that was tortured 20 years ago what seems to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.880
impossible at first turns out to be true after our&nbsp;
main character successfully predicts future events&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.560
that are about to happen to the caller in the past&nbsp;
it is easy to think that this whole story is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.640
pretty cool thing to experience both have their&nbsp;
fair share of problems both share the same age&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.480
it's a perfect combination to cope with each&nbsp;
other's difficulties in life but playing with time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.480
is a very dangerous thing and the person who is&nbsp;
in the future is the person with the least power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.160
if you are able to talk to a person in the past&nbsp;
then you hold all the power until the point where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.000
you start sharing information even the most basic&nbsp;
things like names carry a lot of weight with them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.480
the future person cannot change the past yet the&nbsp;
person in the past can freely change the future so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.960
both are in similar position until information is&nbsp;
shared but once information is shared the person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.800
in the past starts to grow in power with each new&nbsp;
bit received everything you share with the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.880
can and will be used against you so you must be&nbsp;
very careful on what you say the most important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.960
thing therefore for our main character would be to&nbsp;
take a minute and think carefully it isn't a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.360
difficult concept to grasp and she seems to be a&nbsp;
rather bright person if i were in her position i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.360
sure would enjoy the scenario as well but for the&nbsp;
sake of my families and my safety i would take use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.120
of an alias and make up a fake story about myself&nbsp;
until i have figured out more about the person i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.120
talking to because if this person is messing up&nbsp;
my past it will automatically affect my present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.480
but she doesn't give it a second thought i&nbsp;
assume she too was so socially hungry that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.240
just ignored all the red flags and just enjoyed&nbsp;
being of value to someone else and let's be honest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.520
being able to predict the future makes you a&nbsp;
pretty cool person it doesn't take long until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.600
our characters have this stupid idea to prevent&nbsp;
our main character's father from dying in the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.720
causing her to skip over to an entirely different&nbsp;
timeline where the father is still alive

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.240
while nobody around here seems to have noticed&nbsp;
a change she seems to remember everything from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.760
before but later more to that the single&nbsp;
best thing to do after this timeline switch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.120
would be to destroy the phone and never look back&nbsp;
this would cause this timeline to remain until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.520
the end but of course it isn't that simple after&nbsp;
all a complete stranger from the past just saved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:47.360
your father from dying naturally you feel very&nbsp;
thankful and unfortunately very indebted what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:54.000
happens next is pretty insane our main character's&nbsp;
life turns all flowery and beautiful she eats with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.520
both parents goes shopping with them and just&nbsp;
enjoys the wholesome nature of an ordinary family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.840
through the pure bliss she's experiencing&nbsp;
she starts to neglect the relationship she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.600
has formed with the caller from the past the big&nbsp;
problem is if she could bring back your father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.040
she definitely has the power to take him away&nbsp;
again too sure preventing someone from dying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.960
and taking someone's life or two very different&nbsp;
things for that you must be a resentful psychopath

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.440
yeah i'm not sure if you want to keep this&nbsp;
friendship alive a friend who cannot partake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.960
in your happiness isn't the friend to begin with&nbsp;
and someone you probably want to stay away from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.720
but to be fair while our main character is&nbsp;
wearing fancy clothes and shiny nail polish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.640
the girl in the past is still being&nbsp;
tortured and fed pet food daily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:53.280
i'd probably grow pretty resentful too if the only&nbsp;
thing i get to eat is raw grass while watching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:59.680
chicken commercials the big problem here is making&nbsp;
the stranger from the past to save her dead is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.680
causing a big moral dilemma the contrast between&nbsp;
each character's life has shifted dramatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:11.600
while one is in heaven the other one is in hell&nbsp;
the only rational thing the main character can do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.320
is to help the caller from the past and&nbsp;
tell her how to escape her mother's insanity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:22.160
and pay back her debts to be fair this is a&nbsp;
thing every single person in her shoes would do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.800
fact is you owe your whole life to her&nbsp;
and this person is living through hell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.560
every single day with no means to escape apart&nbsp;
from the possibility of your intervention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.600
even if you disregarded that person completely&nbsp;
and destroyed the phone instead it would hunt your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.480
conscience until the end of time the best thing&nbsp;
she could have done before instructing the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:48.720
from the past on how to escape would have been to&nbsp;
consult as many people as possible that knew her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.840
chances are they would have mentioned that she&nbsp;
was sick and a threat to society but even knowing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.880
all of that would you really leave that girl back&nbsp;
in hell after she has made your life the happiest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:04.160
you've ever experienced our main character can&nbsp;
bear the emotional dilemma and tells the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:10.240
from the past about the impending death she will&nbsp;
face with this information she successfully dodges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.200
the attack of her mother during the following&nbsp;
night causing in the mother's death instead we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:21.840
don't know yet for sure but it seems like an&nbsp;
animal has been freed with no way of return

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:31.120
in the following events the local strawberry&nbsp;
farmer pays a visit to both families at the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:37.200
time 20 years apart unfortunately he discovers&nbsp;
the body parts of the murdered mother inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:44.000
the fridge case proven this girl is officially a&nbsp;
psychopath murdering someone out of self-defense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.960
is acceptable but chopping that person up and&nbsp;
stuff it into your fridge next to your veggies and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:54.640
kimchi is freaky and makes me want to skip my next&nbsp;
meal she inevitably has to get rid of the farmer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:00.560
causing him to have never existed in the future&nbsp;
oddly enough nobody seems to remember him apart&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:06.080
from seijon proving that it's her consciousness&nbsp;
that is moving through different timelines other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:11.760
than people vanishing or appearing like the movie&nbsp;
wants us to believe our main character naturally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.800
concludes that something must have happened&nbsp;
to the friendly farmer and for once she starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.080
out pretty smart she inquires around the whole&nbsp;
neighborhood and finds out that he was murdered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:28.560
by her time war bff she gets to see confidential&nbsp;
police notes she reads the newspaper of the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.800
and she even directly talks to a woman in the&nbsp;
neighborhood that was assaulted by the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.840
from the past in her childhood and everyone is&nbsp;
telling her the same thing that she is dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.600
even though she has all this information she&nbsp;
is stupid enough to perform the dumbest move&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.400
of the century when she is receiving the&nbsp;
next call she freely shares her concerns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.760
look first of all you have never even met&nbsp;
this person plus you had at least three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.640
sources telling you back to back that this girl&nbsp;
is a murdering psychopath and yet you still had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.160
to confront her directly i am not sure she has&nbsp;
understood that she is connected to the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.280
if she thought just a second or two about the&nbsp;
events of the past week that caused her whole life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:14.560
to turn downside up and added one and one together&nbsp;
she would have realized to never touch that phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.840
ever again every change that has happened&nbsp;
so far in this movie was orchestrated by her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.600
giving information to the past but i somehow&nbsp;
understand how she wants to confront her directly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.400
after all she must feel pretty guilty but the&nbsp;
best thing she could do without effing things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.600
further up is to pay her a visit at the prison&nbsp;
where she's held captive in the present that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:41.280
way she can freely express her emotions without&nbsp;
causing any further damage the girl from the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:47.120
isn't the brightest girl but she definitely knows&nbsp;
about the power she holds even the dumbest person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.480
becomes god-like when knowing the future she&nbsp;
pressures our main character in giving her more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:58.000
information about how she got caught logically&nbsp;
the most important bits of information are what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.040
the evidence is as well as the date of her&nbsp;
capture our main character realized that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:09.120
this phone call was a very bad idea and rips out&nbsp;
all the cables so she can't be reached anymore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.040
smart move but a bit too late what she should have&nbsp;
done instead was buying time everything is about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:20.800
time right now the easiest way to do that is to&nbsp;
give false information to the past that can't be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.920
figured out easily i would have told the girl&nbsp;
from the past to give me two hours so i can go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.520
to the local police station and gather as much&nbsp;
evidence-based information about her capture as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.360
possible this is a believable story that buys you&nbsp;
a lot of time plus makes you sound like a powerful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:43.040
and reliable ally during those two hours i would&nbsp;
script the perfect story that promises the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:49.280
from the past false security hopefully causing&nbsp;
her to lower her guard here's how i would do that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.560
firstly i would tell her a later date than when&nbsp;
she was captured causing her to feel less under&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:00.560
pressure secondly i would go through each case&nbsp;
covering the murders of the mother as well as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:06.080
strawberry farmer and make up a believable story&nbsp;
without sharing the crucial bits of information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:12.160
that caused her capture the best way to do that&nbsp;
is sharing real information to make you believable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.920
but use information that holds no relevance in her&nbsp;
capture that way you earn trust while you plot a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:23.680
lethal strike at the same time unfortunately&nbsp;
our character does nothing of the like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:29.440
but is visibly worried and she should be because&nbsp;
there is a psychopath targeting her right now as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:35.680
we speak and there is no chance to interfere in&nbsp;
any physical way the only power she holds would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:42.000
be the power of deception but she doesn't seem to&nbsp;
be aware of it and at the same time this happens

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.480
terrible timing for a visit and again the&nbsp;
following events were completely avoidable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.200
if she answered the phone call from before&nbsp;
with a strategy in mind which would have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.080
possible if she at one point thought about&nbsp;
what it means to be able to talk to the past&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:06.400
she jumps into a new timeline where no happy life&nbsp;
seems to be found when she's rushing back home she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.680
finds an abandoned house implying she has never&nbsp;
lived here in the first place naturally she gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:17.440
emotional but this isn't the time for any more&nbsp;
stupid decisions but what our main character does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.560
is generally a very smart idea and in accordance&nbsp;
with the method i have mapped out before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:27.680
she tries to lure the girl from the past into a&nbsp;
trap through giving her false information what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:33.200
she's trying to do is sending her to a place where&nbsp;
there will be a gas leak explosion hoping she will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:38.400
die in that accident in order to lure her over&nbsp;
she tells her that she will be able to retrieve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:43.840
the evidence there that would normally cause her&nbsp;
capture what seems to be a very smart idea is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:49.600
carried out terribly wrong there was one crucial&nbsp;
detail that she didn't consider she actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:55.360
mentions what the evidence was that made the&nbsp;
capture possible which is a big mistake because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:01.200
that means if for some reason her plan fails and&nbsp;
the girl in the past doesn't die the fight will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:07.200
be over pretty quickly since the girl in the past&nbsp;
now exactly knows what she needs to find in order&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.880
to avoid her capture and unfortunately this is&nbsp;
exactly what happens causing another timeline&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.920
switch where the psychopathic girl from the past&nbsp;
was never imprisoned and still lives in this house

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.640
at this point our main character has&nbsp;
already committed so many mistakes by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:34.240
trying to change the past in her favor it becomes&nbsp;
increasingly difficult to save the situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.600
up until now every time she tried to set things&nbsp;
straight she messed things further up making the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:45.760
situation much more complicated and causing me a&nbsp;
very serious headache at this point in the movie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:51.120
the single best thing she can do is to visit the&nbsp;
cops and report everything she knows about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.240
murders the girl from the past has committed she&nbsp;
just needs to pay attention to not sound like she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:01.920
is crazy if she does it right chances are very&nbsp;
high that cops would investigate and discover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:07.280
countless evidence helping to finally convict the&nbsp;
psychopath and at least set that part of the story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:13.440
straight again but before she can do that there is&nbsp;
one last important thing that must be done first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:19.200
destroy the phone because as long as a future&nbsp;
psychopath has the ability to talk to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:25.280
past self she is in control of pretty much&nbsp;
everything making it impossible or at least&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.680
very difficult to catch her while it&nbsp;
might be too late for a happy ending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:35.280
if things are done correctly from here on it can&nbsp;
still turn out acceptable as opposed to what will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:43.680
happen if she tries to save the situation&nbsp;
one more time like she does in the movie
