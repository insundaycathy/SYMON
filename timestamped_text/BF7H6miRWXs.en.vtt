00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.410
In the starting of the movie, we see an old
lady named "Sarah".

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.380
She was living abroad.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.180
Now she was coming back to her country.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.400
To visit her old house, she takes her granddaughter
with her.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.530
She loved this house.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.270
Because she had many memories associated with
this house.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.910
But some people wanted to purchase it.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.289
She wasn't happy with this.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.370
Then we are shown the past when Sarah was
17 years of age.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.029
A man used to live in this house before them.

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.079
He kept a lot of wolves and dogs in a locked
room.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.809
One day, this man was going to give them their
daily feed.

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.710
As he opens the last lock of the door, he
dies.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.789
After some days, Sarah's family shifted here.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.550
It consisted of her mother, her younger sister,
and Sarah herself.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.129
They came to this deserted place because Sarah
had a lung problem.

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.299
Due to this, she also skipped school.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.719
Before it, Sarah's family lived at her father's
friend's son's home.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.960
He was a bad guy.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.909
Sarah also disliked her.

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.170
No one befriended her therefore, she stayed
sad.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.299
One day, she was weeping in her room when
she feels that someone is outside.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.679
She tries to make her mother and sister awake
but they don't get up.

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:26.939
The place where that man had kept the animals,
the noise was coming from there.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.149
Sarah reaches the same door scaring.

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.929
As she opens the door, someone pushes her
and vanishes.

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.090
She was unable to see it.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.050
Hearing her scream, her mother and sister
also come there.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.490
The next day, villagers tell them that there
are many wolves.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.850
So, there's no need to worry.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.509
Just be careful.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.240
On the same day, when Sarah was working on
the ground,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.960
she feels someone watching her behind the
bushes.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.250
Sarah's mother shakes the bushes in fear.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.270
A boy of 18 or 19 years comes out of it.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.229
He wasn't acting like a human being.

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.900
He was walking like the animals.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.440
He was staring at the potatoes laying there
because he was hungry.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.860
Sarah's mother gives her a potato and he starts
eating it wildly.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.880
After eating all the potatoes, he still doesn't
go away.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.610
Then Sarah's mother calls all the villagers
and the police try to capture him.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.890
He starts growling.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.959
Noone including the police agrees to take
him with them.

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.650
So, Sarah's mother adopts him.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.250
Getting home, she bathes him and feeds him
the food.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.580
She names him "Chul-Soo".

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.459
Sarah was upset because of his arrival.

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.300
She asks her mother that when he'll go?

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.939
Sarah's mother tells her that as someone will
come to bring him, we'll let him go.

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.380
In the night when Chul-soo was sitting in
his room,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.439
he starts looking at the moon through his
window.

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.549
He starts howling like the wolves.

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.150
Sarah's mother comes and scolds him so that
he may sleep.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.709
The next morning, Sarah was taking out her
books from some boxes.

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.129
But she was unable to move these boxes.

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.040
Chul-Soo was seeing this.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.349
He moves forward to her.

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.420
But Sarah gets scared that he might hurt her.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.860
She starts crying and pulls his hair.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.900
But Chul-Soo came there to help her.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.220
He lifts up the boxes so that Sarah could
take her book.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.560
Here, she acknowledges that he was helping
her.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.890
At the same time, that bad guy (son of their
family friend) also comes there.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.450
He says; What you have done to this house?

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.470
You people can't do anything.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.719
Let me lift it up.

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:48.829
As he says this, he tries to lift a bo up
but it doesn't even move.

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.730
It was one of the boxes that Chul-soo lifted
up easily.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.860
That bad guy comes forward to Sarah and asks,
What will you do after getting an education?

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.740
Eventually, you'll get married to me.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.459
You will only do my work.

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.040
Saying this, he grabs Sarah's hand harshly.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.390
Chul-soo comes there and on the contrary,
he grabs his hand so harshly that he goes

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.780
away getting scared.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.200
At first, Sarah didn't like Chul-soo but seeing
him doing this, she thanks him.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.940
When Sarah was checking her books, she finds
a book for dog training.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.970
She knocks on an idea seeing this.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.100
She thinks that Chul-soo acts like animals.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.170
So why not I learn the ways from this book
to train him?

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.510
Because they all were upset because of his
habits.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.730
When everyone was eating, Chul-soo used to
eat their food as well.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.640
The next day, Sarah boils some potatoes and
takes them to Chul-soo.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.760
She tells him the way to eat it.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.000
Now Chul-soo also started to follow her command.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.690
He started acting the same as Sarah told him
to do.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.510
On dinner, he eats according to Sarah's commands.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.670
When Sarah asks him to stop, he stops and
when she asks him to eat, he starts eating.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.230
The next day, Sarah gives him a haircut.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.440
Teaches him to brush his teeth and ties his
shoes.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.230
Then they all go to the market together.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.880
When they are standing outside a shop, a huge
iron piece was about to fall on them.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.930
before it could harm anyone, Chul-soo saves
all of them.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.160
And that iron piece falls on him.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.840
But amazingly, it doesn't harm him.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.530
Then they get home.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.330
Sarah started becoming happy.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.130
At first, she felt alone but now she had a
friend.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.010
They ate together and used to play together.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.350
When Sarah used to go to her room to sleep,
Chul-soo also used to sleep in front of her

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.350
door.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.060
Sarah teaches him to read and write.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.010
Chul-soo was also very happy with this.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.540
Then the scene changes and we are shown that
bad guy again.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.350
He was going with her friend in a car somewhere.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.820
He was intoxicated.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.080
Many goats were in front of him.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.490
His car hits a goat which causes its death.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.280
Chul-soo comes there and places this goat
in front of his owner.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.470
He doesn't say anything to Chul-soo because
he knew that Chul-soo didn't do it.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.810
The next day, that bad guy comes to Sarah's
house.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.110
He asks Sarah to go to dinner with him.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.240
But Sarah refuses it.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.510
He holds her hand harshly and asks her to
go with him.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.500
His three friends also come out of the car.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.690
He grabs her hand more forcefully.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.880
Sarah bites his hand so he throws her away.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.590
Chul-soo was seeing this scene.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.140
Here we see that his body is transforming
into a werewolf.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.570
His hair, his nails, his teeth, all were becoming
like wolves.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.000
He moves forward and injures that guy's all
friends.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.950
He was about to kill that guy too, but Sarah
stops him.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.450
So, he stops.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.780
The next morning, that boy comes to their
house with the police.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:14.030
He asks Sarah to tell them about Chul-soo's
transformation from human to wolf.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.030
Sarah says I didn't see anything like this.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.560
Rather you were forcing me.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.930
He shows the keys to the police and says why
would I enter my house forcefully?

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.980
He blackmails Sarah that one of You or that
boy will stay in this house.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.870
Sarah sighs and says Yes what else can you
do except doing worse with us?

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.500
My father started a business with your father.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.980
You took over it after my father died.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:45.850
Sarah's mother calms her down and says keep
silent, we have no choice but to stay here.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.640
Sarah goes to Chul-soo and asks the reason
behind everything.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:55.400
She asks him to tell the truth but he stays
quiet because he was unable to speak yet.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.340
Police arrest him and take him with them.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.480
Sarah becomes upset but her mother asks her
not to get worried as everything will get

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.480
alright.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.670
As the police had no evidence against Chul-soo
so they free him.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:12.850
The next day, Sarah and her mother were cleaning
that room.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.180
Chul-soo is kept there.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.240
Then that bad guy comes and says you have
to marry me.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.790
Therefore you'll have to act upon my words.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.060
This boy will not step out of this room.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.390
Sarah's mother brings some items outside the
house.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.410
It belonged to the previous house owner.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:36.899
From a letter in these items, that bad guy
reads his address and goes to meet him.

00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:41.490
On the other hand, we are shown Chul-soo and
Sarah playing on a hill.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:46.670
As she ran, Sarah's health began to decline
because she had lung disease.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.709
Chul-soo doesn't get anything and he takes
her to the home on his shoulders.

00:08:50.709 --> 00:08:52.569
But no one was around.

00:08:52.569 --> 00:08:55.860
So, Chul-soo takes her to the forest with
him.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.709
As the night falls everyone was worried that
where Sarah went.

00:08:59.709 --> 00:09:03.079
They head to the forest in order to search
for her.

00:09:03.079 --> 00:09:08.949
As they reach the forest, they see Chul-soo
and fainted Sarah lying there.

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:11.509
Chul-soo and Sarah are brought home from there.

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:14.910
Chul-soo is tied in that room in a harsh way.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:20.339
On the other side, that prideful boy met a
man when he went to meet the house owner.

00:09:20.339 --> 00:09:22.149
He was the friend of the house owner.

00:09:22.149 --> 00:09:27.680
He said that they did an experiment in a result
to which, this beast was made.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.819
If we hadn't arrived on time, it would have
eaten Sarah.

00:09:31.819 --> 00:09:34.889
Therefore, we want to take him with us.

00:09:34.889 --> 00:09:38.730
But the police say No! we will keep him under
our observation.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:43.600
If he transforms again, we'll shoot him immediately.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.690
Sarah's family gets upset due to this.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:50.730
Police were having an eye on him and takes
his blood samples.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:56.319
When reports come in, it turns out that his
body temperature is higher than that of a

00:09:56.319 --> 00:09:57.319
human.

00:09:57.319 --> 00:09:59.000
His muscles are strong as an elephant.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.660
He was kept under observation.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:05.089
Then we see that Sarah goes to him and embraces
him.

00:10:05.089 --> 00:10:10.439
Police and that house owner say that certainly,
he didn't live in human beings.

00:10:10.439 --> 00:10:13.230
But he wants to adapt their feelings and habits.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.709
For how long we'll keep him here?

00:10:15.709 --> 00:10:17.490
So, we set him free.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:22.860
That proudful guy comes and says that it can
never happen.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.410
He says that Chul-soo killed a goat.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.430
He takes the police to her friend, with whom
he was that day.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:34.040
She also tells a lie that she has also seen
Chul-soo killing that goat.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.800
Then that man is called whose goat died.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.149
He confesses that his goat died but says that
he didn't see Chul-soo doing this.

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:47.220
That bad guy becomes angry at him and says
I'm saying that I've seen him.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.889
Police say that we'll check that place later.

00:10:49.889 --> 00:10:52.889
Goat owner goes to that prideful boy.

00:10:52.889 --> 00:10:57.069
He says that I didn't find any scar on my
goat rather her ribs were broken.

00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:59.740
I'll like to see your car too.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.009
So bring your car with you.

00:11:02.009 --> 00:11:03.879
He leaves after saying this.

00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:07.310
But that boy pursues him and kills him.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:12.139
Afterward, he goes to Sarah's house and destroys
the fuse.

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:15.430
The light turns out and security cameras turn
off.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:20.350
Later, he goes to Chul-soo's room who was
making a sketch of a guitar.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:24.610
He goes to him and says that he is sorry for
his mistake.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.589
He says that Sarah wants to sing on a guitar
but someone broke her guitar.

00:11:28.589 --> 00:11:32.870
In fact, it is at the house of that goat owner.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:38.089
In fact, he's the one who broke the guitar
and left it on his house.

00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:41.320
Chul-soo goes to find the guitar in his house.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.379
But as the light comes, the police don't find
him there.

00:11:45.379 --> 00:11:49.930
Suddenly that bad guy comes and claims that
Chul-soo has escaped.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.880
He also killed a police officer.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.620
But in fact, he was the killer himself.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.190
He says that he went to eat goat's meat there.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:02.149
They all reach his house and asks Chul-soo
to surrender.

00:12:02.149 --> 00:12:06.459
But Chul-soo shows them the sketch that he
came here to find the guitar.

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:10.481
But that bad guy points his gun on him.

00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:12.370
But Sarah covers him.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:16.470
He says if you didn't take aside, I'll shoot
in reality.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.839
Then he starts the countdown.

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:21.420
That boy was about to hit Sarah.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.100
He starts hitting him brutally.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.639
Chul-soo doesn't tolerate this and he again
transforms into a werewolf.

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:31.259
He jumps on that boy and kills him.

00:12:31.259 --> 00:12:33.460
Everyone starts shooting him.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.790
But he runs to the forest with Sarah.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.759
Sarah says that she believes him

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:41.199
and then she faints.

00:12:41.199 --> 00:12:43.459
Chul-soo covers her and lets her sleep.

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:49.319
The next morning, when she wakes up, she hears
somebody calling her name.

00:12:49.319 --> 00:12:52.050
Because her family was searching for her.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.029
Sarah was going but Chul-soo follows her.

00:12:55.029 --> 00:12:57.559
But Sarah slaps him and asks him not to follow
her.

00:12:57.559 --> 00:13:03.050
At the same time, she starts weeping and says
sorry to him.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:07.050
Here Chul-soo speaks for the first time, Don't
go!

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:11.040
But Sarah didn't want him to come otherwise
police would kill him.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.570
Therefore, she leaves him there and goes.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.259
And Chul-soo keeps watching her go.

00:13:17.259 --> 00:13:20.779
Sarah goes to them and they wanted to keep
this case hidden.

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:25.180
So they decide to leave this place before
the reporters come.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.050
Chul-soo is left alone there.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:30.879
Later, we are shown Sarah's family leaving
from there.

00:13:30.879 --> 00:13:35.649
Then Sarah leaves a note in Chul-soo's room
that I'll come someday.

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:38.240
Because she knew that Chul-soo loved her a
lot.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.449
They had become great friends.

00:13:40.449 --> 00:13:43.360
After it, they leave.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.050
Now many years later, the present time is
shown.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.890
She has become an old lady now and she's standing
in front of this house.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.829
Sarah says that she wants to spend a night
here.

00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:58.119
She goes to sleep inside with her granddaughter.

00:13:58.119 --> 00:14:01.279
She hears the same voice again as she heard
the first time.

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:07.879
When she goes outside and goes to that room,
she sees that Chul-soo was also there.

00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:09.850
He gives her a note.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.460
Sarah embraces her and sleeps.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:16.199
The next morning old Sarah leaves the house
with her granddaughter.

00:14:16.199 --> 00:14:20.629
She receives a call from that buyer but she
refuses and says that we don't wanna sell

00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:21.800
it.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.829
Then we are shown Chul-soo was standing at
a distance watching all this.

00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:28.550
He knew that Sarah came here.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:33.180
He starts building a snowman as they both
used to build in their childhood.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.550
The movie ends here.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.110
Thank you for watching. :)
