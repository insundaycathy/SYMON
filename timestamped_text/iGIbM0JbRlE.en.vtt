00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.930
If you turned the lights off to go to bed,
and a shadowy figure appeared, what would

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.930
you do?

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.860
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
a haunted family, see if we can make better

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.260
decisions, and ultimately attempt to beat
the SHADOW WITCH in, LIGHTS OUT.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.789
If you think you have a better way to beat
it, let me know in the comments!

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.949

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.410
We start out by following Paul, the manager
of a textile shop.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.890
I don’t know about y'all, but I wouldn’t
have mannequins placed around my office like

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.890
that.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.419
Especially if I worked at night by myself.

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.290
Bare minimum everytime you walk into your
office you have to double check that it isn’t

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.770
a friend standing still trying to prank you.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.750
At least put them in front of your desk.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.030
The best case scenario is that the mannequin
is a highly attractive cursed peasant girl

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.200
that comes to life and falls in love with
you.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.470
Paul’s about to find out what the worst
case scenario is.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.010
He tells his employee to finish up the rounds
and head out for the night.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.671
Why is the lighting so poor in this building,
and how the heck can you do inventory in near

00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:57.671
complete darkness.

00:00:57.671 --> 00:01:02.390
Oh great, not only does the poor lighting
make it impossible to do the job, but he also

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.860
has them hooked up to a motion sensor, so
if you stand still and actually try to do

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.810
your job the lights shut off.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.810
I don’t think this business has a bright
future.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.469
She handwaves the lights back on, and clothes
next to her rattle.

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.570
I would just check mark everything on the
list and head out.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:45.149
If the manager got mad that anything was wrong,
I’d just blame it on the poor lighting.

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.909
Maybe try turning it off and on one more time.

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.600
Esther tries to tell her manager that something
was in the backroom, but he’s too preoccupied

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.399
talking to a psychiatrist about his wife’s
declining mental condition.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.850
After blowing off his disturbed employee’s
warnings, he finishes up his work and heads

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.979
home.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:13.270
Sure, he initially dismissed his employee,
but hearing a strange noise coupled with his

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.290
employee saying something was back there should
trigger a little red flag to pop up in his

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.830
brain, or dare I say, a lightbulb.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.560
Look, it’s either a rat, in which case you
won’t be able to catch it.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.770
It’s just the air currents causing something
to make noise, in which case there’s nothing

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.770
to worry about.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.300
It’s a robber or mugger, in which case you're
screwed because they have the element of surprise

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.410
and you don’t have any weapons.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.890
Or it’s a supernatural entity in which case
you couldn’t fight it even if you did have

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.890
a weapon.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.330
There is no benefit to checking this noise
out right now.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.840
It’s the evil jelly bean trail, with something
baiting you into its grasp.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.361
Hell, most people would think nothing of a
noise like that and just walk out, especially

00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:54.580
if you’re so preoccupied with your family.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.530
Or they’d do the opposite of checking it
out and leave as quickly as possible.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.980
Oh man, that was optimistic.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.690
Bet you wish you didn’t cheap out on motion
sensor lighting now.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.960
Paul sees that the ghost is stopped by the
light, and considering the lights can go out

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.120
at any time, he makes a break for it.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.050
When he passes through the darkness between
lights, the ghost lashes his legs.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.320
Well, he couldn’t have realized that this
thing is impossibly fast either, still, running

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.620
was his best and only shot.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.590
He makes it back to his office, locks the
door and turns the lights on.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.910
Seems like he’s safe for now.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.080
Or not, as apparently this entity has control
over the electricity.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.220
That’s not really fair, but okay.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:45.690
Paul didn’t stand a chance, this thing is
like a ninja assassin.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.790
Meanwhile, Paul’s stepdaughter, Rebecca,
and her boyfriend, Bret, are in disagreement

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.930
over Bret’s desire to keep his socks at
her apartment.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.970
As fascinating as that storyline is, we cut
over to Rebecca’s brother, Martin.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.980
Martin finds his mom talking to someone else
in her room.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.150
Earlier in the movie he FaceTimed his dad,
Paul, complaining that his mom was talking

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.150
to herself.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.990
I think there should be a distinction made
between talking to yourself, which is actually

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.420
good for you to an extent, and talking to
an imaginary friend, which is called Schizophrenia.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.930
The mom, Sophie, is exhibiting the latter.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.009
Okay, time to go sleep over at your friends
house.

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.620
Martin goes back to bed and turns around to
see the ghost's creepy fingers.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.950
After seeing that you’re going to sit in
your bed for the next 8 hours.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.950
Nope.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.910
I don’t know how the kid survived the night.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.960
I would have opened the window, aimed for
the bushes, and figured out a different living

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.960
situation.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.870
The next day the school calls child services
on Martin because he's been passing out in

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.979
class everyday for the past week.

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.849
A symptom of a developing problem with Martin’s
dad being recently murdered, and his mom being

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.090
diagnosed with depressions and schizophrenia.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.900
Yah, I can see how it’d be hard to pay attention
in social studies if that was the case.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.860
The fact that this has been going on for at
least a week now and Martin hasn’t ran away

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.430
yet is crazy.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.900
They call his rebel half-sister to see how
she can help.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.889
Surprise surprise, sk8r girl just wants to
take him back to the psycho mom.

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.360
Do they not have an aunt, uncle, cousin, anyone
else?

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.449
Seems like keeping a kid in a home with a
manic and depressed mom would be very damaging

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:26.389
and unhealthy.

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.129
Seems like a chill dude, i’m sure he’ll
die horrifically soon enough.

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.430
When they show up at Martin's home, he tells
Rebecca that someone named Diana is living

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.430
with them.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.300
There's some spooky music and her eyes light
up, Rebecca obviously knows who Diana is too.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.160
The kid packs his bag, but wait, he hears
a strange noise in the room next door and

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:54.669
is somehow compelled to go check it out, as
if he doesn’t know what it is already.

00:05:54.669 --> 00:06:04.719
I wonder how many more times people are going
to, check it out, I bet a lot.

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:07.659
The kid moves in with the sis for a few days
to get his bearings.

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:11.770
They’re going to have to figure this situation
out one way or another, but for now he needs

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.749
to get some sleep so he can think clearly.

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:17.039
He makes sure to pack his flashlight just
in case.

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.210
It should be clear that Diana can short out
the lights somehow, a flashlight should be

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.560
more reliable, but I wouldn’t risk only
having that.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.740
The flashlight also only produces a beam of
light, which is effective and better than

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.340
nothing, but you really need something that
floods light in every direction.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.029
You also need to watch your back, shining
a beam of light in front of you ain't gonna

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:39.270
stop Diana from ripping your spine out from
behind you.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.759
I think the most tactically sound option is
light armor, like armor made of light.

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:45.759
AKA.

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:50.099
Wrap christmas tree lights around you and
plug into a handheld battery.

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:51.479
Your move, Diana.

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:55.319
I'd also light enough candles in my room to
look like a prayer ceremony.

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:58.960
And not just some off-brand, found in your
mom's kitchen cupboard candles.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.830
I’m talking survival, smokeless, wind-proof
candles that won’t get blown out if someone

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.490
opens the door too fast.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.870
They go to sleep for the night, and nobody
lights a freaking candle.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.259
You both know about Diana, you both know that
it comes in the darkness.

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:15.509
Why aren’t you taking any precautions?

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:38.919
Diana takes advantage of their ineptitude,
and starts scratching the floorboard?

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:41.569
She easily could have killed them before they
even woke up.

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:51.139
I guess you gotta season the prey with fear.

00:07:51.139 --> 00:08:00.319
I think you made mommy's ghost friend mad.

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:05.330
Rebecca defeats Diana with the flip of a light
switch, and finds Martin hiding in the bathtub

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.370
with his flashlight on.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.560
Initially I didn’t understand why he chose
the bathtub, but it kind of makes sense.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.849
This thing can get you wherever it’s dark.

00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:18.139
That includes under the bed, where she could
grab your feet once you stepped down.

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:22.220
Maybe back in his mom’s house earlier in
the movie he experienced her creeping under

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.240
his bed at night.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.070
They survive the night, not from their intelligence
or wits, but because Diana doesn’t seem

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.650
to want to kill them, or she just sucks at
it.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.800
Maybe she’s trying to scare Martin and Rebecca
away to keep Sophie to herself, but why attack

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.710
them at the apartment if that was the case,
you already accomplished your goal.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:44.380
The child services lady shows up and gives
her a breakdown of why Rebecca can’t house

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.850
Martin, and that he needs to go back to his
mother according to the law.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:52.750
Martin could continuously run away, but the
Police and courts will get involved, and Martin

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.320
and Rebecca could find themselves in detainment
without the means to defend themselves.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.600
Much like the kid in Polaroid.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:12.870
Didn’t end well for him.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.880
Rebecca and Martin both know the danger they
are in, and need to stay together and watch

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.279
each other’s backs.

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:22.769
While Martin hasn’t been harmed in the past
weeks of Diana haunting him, he’s obviously

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:23.769
in danger.

00:09:23.769 --> 00:09:29.100
Rebecca is also in danger herself, so it doesn’t
make sense to stay at her apartment alone.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.140
Running isn’t an option anymore, it’s
clear Diana wants to do harm.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:39.910
I’d suggest that Rebecca moves back in at
home to help Martin, set up proper defenses,

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.060
and sort this out.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.399
The mom nor the Police will have a problem
with it.

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:48.250
Rebecca has a flashback to when she was little,
coloring a stick figure fam picture, and when

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.860
she was first confronted by Diana, who crossed
the dad out and drew herself in.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.750
Apparently it just now dawns on her that Diana
is a real entity that is somehow connected

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.300
with the mom’s behavior.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.970
She heads back home to confront her mom about
Diana.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.860
I’m completely onboard with this, but can
you at least stop by a store and pick up some

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.110
flashlights and lighting equipment.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.690
Like in I Am Legend, you gotta get those Pitch
Black light tube backpacks.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:15.160
It’d also be a good idea to either clue
Bret in on the situation or at least keep

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:33.300
him by your side so you can guide him around
safely.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.240
How many times are people going to be baited
into obvious traps like this.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.810
Rebecca finds a picture of Sophie and Diana.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:45.750
Diana is her mom's friend who was real, and
had Xeroderma Pigmentosum, a horrific condition

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.779
in which you’re highly susceptible to UV
light and you pretty much can’t go outside

00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:51.630
without a full protective suit.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.649
Now that I think of it, that’s kind of what
the I Am Legend Darkseekers had.

00:10:55.649 --> 00:10:59.921
She finds more medical records and recordings
of Diana’s condition and therapy, which

00:10:59.921 --> 00:11:02.230
are kept in this house for some reason?

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.459
Isn’t that against confidentiality.

00:11:04.459 --> 00:11:08.810
Diana was a Heliotherapy patient at the psychiatric
ward Sophie was in.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:13.940
Sophie got better, but Diana’s condition
worsened and she became aggressive and unstable.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.600
To combat her increasing sensitivity to light,
the doctors strapped her into a chair and

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.649
blasted her with multiple 1200 Watt UV lights.

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:54.140
Surprisingly, instead of healing her, it turned
her into a nuke shadow.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.760
In real life, there are no cures for this
condition, just some drugs that may help.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:04.450
But absolutely no form of heliotherapy would
ever be used experimentally for Xeroderma

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.450
pigmentosum.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:09.790
That’s like standing in front of a firing
squad in an attempt to develop an immunity

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:10.790
to bullets.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.410
Or trying to callus your hands with a belt
sander.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.910
If you were even going to attempt this, you’d
start with extremely low doses to see how

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.730
the body reacts before going nuclear with
the 1200 watt UV lights.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.199
Wait, so Diana made a noise that baited her
into finding this information, that seems

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:23.199
counterproductive..

00:12:23.199 --> 00:12:26.930
After reviewing the medical records, she has
a kick of nostalgia and visits her childhood

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:27.930
room.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.320
I’d be cognizant of where your sources of
light are and how they could fail.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.790
The only source of light right now is that
door, if Diana can somehow close it Rebecca

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:50.629
is screwed.

00:12:50.629 --> 00:13:04.980
Yep.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.210
Seems that Diana is just trying to scare them
away from the mom.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.339
That’s probably why their dad, Paul, died.

00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:12.889
He was trying to get Sophie better.

00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:17.540
Wait, why did Diana attack Esther, what did
she do to deserve that.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.260
Bret saves the day and they take the evidence
back to her apartment.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.019
Martin and his mom return home, and she has
a great idea.

00:13:24.019 --> 00:13:27.769
A fun popcorn night with just the 3 of them.

00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:28.769
Ooh.

00:13:28.769 --> 00:13:32.910
When Martin mentions that he wants it to be
just the two of them, Sophie looks visibly

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:33.910
scared.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:38.360
If I didn’t know any better, I’d say Diana
is holding Sophie hostage, much like MaRina

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.860
and Laura.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.980
So far it seems that throughout Rebecca’s
and Martin’s childhood, Diana has appeared

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:54.350
and disappeared in correlation with the moms
mental state.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:58.480
What he’s trying to say is, go confront
your psycho ghost friend that’s trying to

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.480
kill me.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.089
Can I also just say, I hate that cliche face
your fear nonsense.

00:14:03.089 --> 00:14:05.259
Fear isn’t inherently irrational.

00:14:05.259 --> 00:14:08.439
It’s an emotional response to a perceived
threat.

00:14:08.439 --> 00:14:12.310
If the perceived threat isn’t real, then
yah face it and get over it.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:16.850
If the threat is real, like Diana, then just
‘facing it’ can get you killed.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.291
If you fear certain parts of town at night
because of the high chance you’re going

00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:35.380
to get mugged, facing those fears is freaking
stupid and will get you mugged.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.110
This kid was acting all tough about facing
fears, then when the lights get turned off

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.160
he starts crying like a bitch.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.320
Since Diana is a real threat, facing it turned
out about how you’d expect.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.879
Seems like there’s some Stockholm Syndrome
going on.

00:14:47.879 --> 00:14:53.199
Sophie is so tormented by Diana that she tries
to protect her at the expense of Martin.

00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:57.319
The mom going psycho is why I wanted Rebecca
to move back in and help.

00:14:57.319 --> 00:15:01.040
Martin bolts back to the sisters' place where
she’s trying to piece together what's going

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.800
on with chill bro in the back taking it all
in.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.560
Nobody fills him in on the threat and they
send him off to shop for food at night, when

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.560
he’s completely unaware.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.709
Bret’s been a clear accomplice to Martin
and Rebecca in trying to fight Diana, so he’s

00:15:12.709 --> 00:15:14.259
undoubtedly a target too.

00:15:14.259 --> 00:15:17.860
I’m going to be very surprised if this dude
comes back alive.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:24.509
Rebecca shows Martin her findings in a dark
room with one weak-ass lamp nearby.

00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:28.819
According to the records, Diana was found
locked up in a basement when she was 13, with

00:15:28.819 --> 00:15:33.629
her father allegedly having killed himself
with blood writing on the wall saying, “She

00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:34.839
is in my head.”

00:15:34.839 --> 00:15:39.649
Since she had a very unstable mental condition,
she was taken to a psychiatric hospital where

00:15:39.649 --> 00:15:41.079
Diana met Sophie.

00:15:41.079 --> 00:15:45.870
It was said that Diana was evil, and could
get inside people’s heads and change them.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:49.579
To be honest, that sounds like what asshole
kids would make up to bully a girl with a

00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:51.069
horrifying skin condition.

00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:55.139
I don’t think Diana’s mental instability
helped with the bullying either.

00:15:55.139 --> 00:16:00.040
However, it did turn out to be true, because
a freaking ghost witch is trying to kill them.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:05.040
Rebecca thinks that Diana got inside Sophie’s
head when Diana got torched, and her imprint

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.600
on Sophie survived.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.399
She also thinks that Diana only shows up when
her mom is at her worst mentally.

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:11.569
Here’s where I'm stuck.

00:16:11.569 --> 00:16:16.600
When Rebecca was younger, Diana had crossed
the dad out of her drawing, which to me indicates

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.689
that Diana murdered the husband.

00:16:18.689 --> 00:16:22.000
But how, since she had to have appeared when
things were good at home?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.990
This suggests that Diana can appear when Sophie
is feeling down for whatever reason, not just

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.689
when she is mentally crippled.

00:16:28.689 --> 00:16:33.430
For example, if they had a dog and the dog
died, that would open Sophie up to where Diana

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.320
could show up and start swinging.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.379
This makes Sophie incredibly volatile and
dangerous.

00:16:38.379 --> 00:16:40.880
I think we all know what needs to be done.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.129
Rebecca and Martin need to kill their mom.

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:47.810
Instead of doing what needs to be done, they
propose that the mom just needs to get her

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.149
mind strong again in order to break the connection.

00:16:51.149 --> 00:16:55.350
That sounds warm and fuzzy, but the second
something bad happens to the mom, Diana is

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.220
going to come back with a vengeance,

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:02.120
You could heavily medicate or sedate the mom,
but turning Sophie into a zombie isn’t proven

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.829
to work, nor is it a dependable solution.

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:07.020
Martin and I are in agreement.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.790
Improving the mom is not only futile, but
dangerous.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.959
Diana will try to kill you the entire time
you're working with the mom to rehabilitate

00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:14.959
her.

00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:18.390
It’s much easier to just give her a different
kind of pill that makes the mom go sleepy

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.740
sleep forever.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:33.820
They hear some knocking on the door, what’re
the chances that it’s not Bret.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.650
What do you have to gain by checking it out,
absolutely nothing.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:56.440
You know it’s Diana just trying to bait
you into an area where she can kill you.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.529
Clever move, distracting Rebecca to snatch
Martin.

00:17:59.529 --> 00:18:03.660
This could have been prevented if Martin had
some fresh ass light up kicks or a frameless

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.660
bed.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.010
But yah, you can’t be standing next to dark
areas like that.

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:12.380
Realizing this has to be stopped asap, the
crew heads to Sophie's house to sort this

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.380
situation out.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:18.230
I guess they chose the rehabilitation options
instead of killing her, at least for now.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:22.279
While they are fighting about the moms ghost
friend tormenting them, unaware Bret’s over

00:18:22.279 --> 00:18:23.659
there spinning his fork.

00:18:23.659 --> 00:18:25.809
Poor dude’s just trying to get with Rebecca.

00:18:25.809 --> 00:18:32.460
There’s a saying called don’t stick your..
knife in an outlet..

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.980
The mom storms off to have her sleepover with
Diana, and the crew makes a montage of their

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.390
piss-poor defenses.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:43.049
Rebecca duct tapes the lights on, which is
probably more to prevent them or the mom from

00:18:43.049 --> 00:18:45.150
accidentally turning a light off.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:49.690
Martin hides a flashlight, which I don’t
understand at all, don’t you want easy access

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:50.690
to it?

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:51.690
Those flashlights have too narrow of a beam
anyways, but it’s better than nothing.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.159
They open the curtains, which won’t help
until sunrise in 6-8 hours, but why not.

00:18:55.159 --> 00:18:59.690
Bret grabs spares light bulbs, which is like
a tertiary support system where if you knock

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:04.010
a lamp over or a bulb goes out you can change
it, but you ain't gonna be swapping bulbs

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.590
when under attack.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:06.659
Finally some freaking candles.

00:19:06.659 --> 00:19:09.630
Overall, it’s a pretty weak defense.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.630
3/10.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.510
They had ample time to go to a store.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:17.559
For first layer defense i’d buy a bunch
of flashlights, headlamps, flood lamps, batteries,

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:22.330
wind-up lights, every socket filled with sensor
night lights, and christmas lights to make

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.930
some 360 degree light armor.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:30.640
I’d be inclined to try UV lights as well,
because of her initial vulnerability to sunlight.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:36.710
Second layer defense would be those survival
candles and propane lanterns so if the electricity

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.090
goes you still have light.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.870
Since it’s practically a full moon outside,
there’s plenty of light outside which can

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:43.790
add a third layer of defense.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:48.020
They should pack some sammy’s and do some
backyard camping around a bonfire in addition

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.679
to the lights and candles.

00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:52.480
This gives you three levels of redundancy.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.930
Outside is also a good idea, because there
are less places for Diana to grab you from,

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.240
like under the bed.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.850
Inside the house also introduces verticality,
where Diana can attack you from above.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:07.470
It should go without saying that they should
stick together, butttt, no.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.299
Martin goes off to sleep in his bedroom by
himself.

00:20:10.299 --> 00:20:12.580
What the actual f.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:17.540
He brought one candle, isolated himself, and
is making himself vulnerable to attack from

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.540
under the bed.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:22.930
Hell, I'd be worried about Diana showing up
under the covers like the Onryo in The Grudge.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:27.250
And he’s also making himself vulnerable
to the mom’s psycho shenanigans.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:32.210
Sophie could walk into his room and blow his
candle out and boom, Martin’s toast.

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.480
Martin asks her to sleep in his room tonight.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.960
Okay, how about you all just chill in the
living room where all your defenses are at.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:39.960
Jesus.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.460
While it doesn’t seem like Diana needs to
physically do anything to turn off lights,

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:48.840
it wouldn’t be a bad idea to leave a light
source illuminating the main electrical panel

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:58.169
to the house, which could shut off all power
at the throw of a switch.

00:20:58.169 --> 00:21:08.610
Why, that’s all i’ll say.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:13.280
Bret is one persevering SOB, and all for the
bottom drawer at her place.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:17.720
He hasn’t had any actual experience with
Diana, only what he’s heard.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.080
Still, all this stuff is pretty creepy, I
don’t think i’d want to sleep alone at

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.300
my place until I knew what was going on better.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:27.810
Rebecca tries to make amends with her mom,
and as they part ways for the night, her mom

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:33.480
passes her a secret message before being pulled
back into the dark room by Diana.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.539
“I need help.”

00:21:38.539 --> 00:21:42.809
Who could have foresaw that your stay would
be perceived as an attack on Diana, and she

00:21:42.809 --> 00:21:45.460
would retaliate by shutting all the lights
off as she’s done in the past to try to

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.460
kill you.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:49.560
This is also why you all group up in one room.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.440
Multiple people with intersecting fields of
flashlight beams, the candles work better

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.940
when combined in one room versus having only
a couple candles in each room, and now you

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.720
have to find each other in the dark since
you split up.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.740
And still, nobody has filled Bret in on the
situation, so there’s a good chance he gets

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:06.740
killed.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.470
Going to the basement does not compute, it’s
the darkest spot in the house.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:14.570
And why not wake Martin up, she just left
him in a dark room alone.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:18.840
When he wakes up hes gonna be freaked that
your gone and probably do something stupid.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.360
Zero teamwork here guys.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.390
Rebecca attempts to turn the power back on
at the main electrical panel, but at this

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:28.490
point turning it on is more dangerous than
just getting everyone and going outside with

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:29.909
your lights and candles.

00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:34.590
Diana doesn’t seem to even need to physically
turn the power off anyways, even if she did,

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:38.260
she’s probably destroyed the panel making
it impossible to turn back on.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:42.580
If you’re going to do it, at least position
the flashlight so it illuminates the room

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:43.830
behind you.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:59.490
Martin inevitably wakes up and starts wandering
around with his cheap POS candle to find her.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:15.480
He links up with Rebecca, and low and behold
the electrical panel is completely useless.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:20.260
Diana shuts them in and locks the basement
door so she can deal with Bret.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.160
Holy crap, Bret is a quick witted badass.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.179
First with the phone, busting out of the home
into the moonlight, then using his car keys

00:23:27.179 --> 00:23:29.039
to vanquish the ghost witch.

00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:31.370
He then hops into the car and peels out.

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.679
I’m not sure why, that poses unnecessary
risks.

00:23:34.679 --> 00:23:38.309
He could just keep the headlights on and stand
in front of it and in the moonlight while

00:23:38.309 --> 00:23:39.840
calling 911.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.480
Getting into the car is dangerous in the same
way the bed is, Diana could snatch your leg

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.480
while you're getting in.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.470
You’d have to make sure the overhead lights
are on before you get in so you don't find

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.130
Diana chillin in your backseat.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:55.100
You’d also have to worry that Diana could
appear under your car while you’re driving,

00:23:55.100 --> 00:24:09.360
and pop your tires leaving you crashed in
a ditch.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.669
Now's not the time to be a smartass Martin.

00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:15.279
And stop huddling around the flashlight with
your back to the darkness.

00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:19.360
Sophie tries to pop some pills in order to
soothe her mind and break the connection Diana

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.850
has to the world, but fails.

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:25.990
Instead of having a bonfire outside where
it’s safe, Rebecca and Martin are having

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:27.440
one in the basement.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.540
Martin rummages through some old boxes and
luckily finds a giant battery powered UV light.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:37.130
Rebecca takes it to go ‘take inventory’,
or whatever the hell that means.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.600
She finds a room in the basement filled with
Diana’s creepy blood writings and mannequins

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.390
she plays torture with.

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.960
Inevitably, one of them turns out to be Diana.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.870
But this time Diana doesn’t disappear in
the light.

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:52.980
The UV rays seem to prevent her from disappearing,
and injure her.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.580
So her pre-heliotherapy weakness is still
in effect.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:02.380
This whole time Diana appears to be corporeal,
which means she has a physical body that occupies

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.380
space.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.410
She might not just be a shadow ghost.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:09.600
It’s just that her physical presence can
only exist in the dark.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.380
Meaning that you might be able to kill her
with something like a knife or bow.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:17.490
Unsurpressed, close range firearms won’t
work because the muzzle flash will disappear

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:19.549
Diana before the bullet can hit.

00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:21.909
It’s worth a shot, but it might not work.

00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:26.490
Diana could be similar to the entity in Polaroid,
where they can physically interact with the

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:31.420
environment, but weapons are ineffective because
they kind of phase in and out of existence.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:36.000
The UV light works in the same way taking
a picture of the entity in Polaroid did, it

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.730
captures their spirit in the physical world.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:40.820
The UV light clearly damaged her.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.799
You can finally go on the attack now.

00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:47.820
Regroup with others, ensure their safety,
get UV lights and physical weapons, then corner

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:53.140
Diana with the lights, burning her and preventing
her from leaving, then start hacking and slashing.

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.299
Homeboy brought the fuzz, which really isn’t
the smartest idea.

00:25:56.299 --> 00:26:00.070
They aren’t going to believe a thing you
say and their weapons are ineffective.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.360
You’re condemning them to death.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.870
It also risks Rebecca and Martin’s lives
by getting shot by the cops if there’s a

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.409
misunderstanding or they get caught in the
crossfire.

00:26:09.409 --> 00:26:14.399
He should have gone to a nearby store and
gotten a shitload of flashlights and batteries

00:26:14.399 --> 00:26:25.409
instead.

00:26:25.409 --> 00:26:29.980
The police officers start getting dismantled
since their pistols muzzle flashes ruin the

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:31.799
effectiveness of their guns.

00:26:31.799 --> 00:26:34.880
Good going Bret, you just fed lambs to the
slaughter.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:39.830
Rebecca and Bret want to just leave the house
for now, but Martin refuses, insisting that

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.250
they help their mom.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:45.890
I kind of get that, but it’s clear that
Diana won’t harm her, only continue to influence

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.330
and weaken her mind.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:50.280
Sophie has been dealing with Diana for basically
ever.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.830
I think she can hold out for 1 more day.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:56.529
You know Diana’s weakness, be smart.

00:26:56.529 --> 00:27:01.460
If you absolutely feel compelled to, at least
check the battery on the UV lamp and grab

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.730
some weapons.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.559
Police cars usually are stocked with shotguns
or AR15’s.

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:10.380
Grab those, get the UV light on Diana, then
pump her full of lead.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:23.760
A little heliotherapy and lead therapy.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:32.029
I hate when villains just throw people around
instead of immediately killing them, but Sophie

00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:37.450
might lose it and off herself if Diana kills
her daughter.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.850
Sophie shows up and starts blasting.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:44.270
Like the police officers, she realizes she
can’t kill Diana with the pistol.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:49.590
In order to stop Diana, Sophie breaks the
mental tether she has to the world by shooting

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:53.740
herself in the head.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:28:06.529
I 

00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:11.460
know this was my initial strategy, but that
was before Rebecca found out about the UV

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.460
light.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:16.350
She should have told her mom that UV light
stops Diana, then scrambled 10 feet behind

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:19.510
her, grabbed the UV light, then had Sophie
gun Diana down.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:23.470
I bet the police are going to have a lot of
questions now that any evidence of Diana is

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:24.470
gone.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.799
The lights on the ambulance wanes and flickers.

00:28:26.799 --> 00:28:29.850
Coincidence, or did Diana somehow survive.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:33.919
Either way, I'm not sleeping with the lights
off, or going anywhere in the dark without

00:28:33.919 --> 00:28:36.120
a flashlight for the rest of my life.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.620
I’d check the records to make sure there
weren’t any stones unturned.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:44.770
Maybe Diana was able to get inside other patients'
heads, or inside their heads and create another

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:48.540
connection that could manifest if they ever
became mentally weak in the future.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:53.269
I’d invest in a suppressed pistol with a
UV light attachment in case Diana ever made

00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:54.700
her way back into this world.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.990
If I was Rebecca, I'd make sure to maintain
connection with Bret and Martin, so if they

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.380
ever got depressed or things started getting
weird again, everyone would be aware.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.380
Well yah, that’s easy to say now that you
are older and a freaking ghost isn’t haunting

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.380
you, killing your parents, and turning your
mom into a depressed lunatic.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.380
You had a legitimate reason to leave before
when you were a teenager and unable to deal

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:06.380
with that situation.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.380
Lets recap how things could have gone down
differently, and see who would be alive or

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.380
dead.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.870
Literally none of this would have happened
if the doctors weren’t insanely stupid and

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.390
negligent.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:16.299
Heliotherapy for Xeroderma Pigmentosum is
preposterous.

00:29:16.299 --> 00:29:21.510
It’s easy to say that Sophie should have
gotten help earlier on when Diana was manifesting,

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:25.950
but it’s not that easy, especially when
an evil spirit is attacking your mind.

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:28.380
Both the husband’s deaths were inevitable.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:32.340
Bret shouldn’t have called the police, there
was no way they’d know what they were up

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.340
against.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.730
If Bret had just stayed outside, or gone to
get more flashlights, the police wouldn’t

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:37.730
have died.

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:41.899
By the time Sophie confronted Diana with the
pistol, Rebecca knew Diana’s weakness and

00:29:41.899 --> 00:29:43.909
had the UV light right next to her.

00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:48.460
She should have told Sophie about Diana’s
weakness, shined the UV light on Diana, and

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:49.580
had Sophie shoot her.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:53.970
It’s not clear that this would 100% work,
but it seems highly probable.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.740
This would have prevented Sophie’s death.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.970
I’d say we could have beat the Shadow Witch
from Lights Out with less lives lost.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:06.280
Thanks for watching, and remember, you can't
cure Xeroderma Pigmentosum with intense UV

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.320
light.
