Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:07.680
Today I'm going to explain a drama, horror,
mystery, and thriller film called "The Orphanage"

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.160
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.520
Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:17.750
In 1975 Spain, a girl named Laura resides
at an orphanage and soon gets adopted.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.660
Thirty years later, she lives with her husband
Carlos, and their son, Simón, who is seven

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.900
years old.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.920
She decides to reopen the orphanage and turn
it into a facility for children with special

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.970
needs.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.040
One day as Simón plays around their home,
he talks to his parents about his two invisible

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.570
friends, Watson and Pepe, but Laura and Carlos
are passive about it.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.450
Later, Laura accompanies Simón to the nearby
beach where a big cave is located.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.400
Claiming that the cave is a chamber for keeping
special treasures, Laura lets her son leave

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.820
one of his belongings inside while she waits
by the entrance.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.460
It takes the boy some time to return, so Laura
calls him and enters the cave after not receiving

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.809
a response.

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.410
She sees Simón talking alone, but he claims
that he was conversing with a new friend.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.890
When she checks, she sees nothing but tiny
footprints that lead to a dead end.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.690
During a rainy day at their home, Benigna
Escobedo arrives and identifies herself as

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.250
a social worker.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.970
Laura welcomes her inside, and they both talk
about how the orphanage will operate.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.369
Benigna reveals that she stopped by the house
as she is Simón's adoption consultant, revealing

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.150
that the couple adopted him.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.869
The elderly lady questions Laura about the
boy's health because he has a preexisting

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.729
illness, but Laura gets mad about her intrusion
and sends her away.

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.490
While examining Simón's files, she finds
out that her adoptive son is HIV positive,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.400
raising concerns about the little boy.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.460
At nightfall, Laura is awakened by noises
outside, where she spots Benigna in a shed

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.020
snooping around as if she is looking for something
important.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.909
Before she can confront her, the elderly lady
rushes out of the property.

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.530
Laura wakes Carlos up to look for the lady
but soon discovers that she is gone.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.240
The following day, Laura opens the front door
and sees a pile of seashells just outside

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.900
her door, but she does not pay much mind to
it, thinking that Simón may be behind it.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.179
In their living room, Simón tells his mother
that he has six new friends in total and claims

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.669
that he will just be like them.

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:15.730
He also adds that he won't grow old and that
he will stay with them.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.620
Shortly after, Laura sees a sketch of the
six friends that Simón claims to have and

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.930
confronts him about the drawing.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.689
According to him, his invisible friends steal
treasures, and the owner has to find them

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.910
by following clues, and if successful, they
grant a wish in return.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.609
He tells his mother that he has agreed to
play with his friends, prompting a scavenger

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:34.629
hunt game.

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.579
It involves finding clues around their home
to retrieve the coins that his invisible friends

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:39.579
hid.

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.139
The two of them spend a significant amount
of time rummaging around their home—from

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.559
Simón's room to the garden, to the chapel,
and finally, to the kitchen where his adoption

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:48.779
file is.

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:52.540
With a key, Simón unlocks a drawer where
he finds his coins hidden between the pages

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.090
of his file before telling Laura that he knows
he is adopted.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.069
Enraged by this, Laura asks him who told him,
to which he replies that Tomás, one of his

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.120
invisible friends, did.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.540
With agitation, Simón tells Laura that he
knows he will die soon, which puts his mother

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.590
in a state of confusion.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.620
After the incident, Laura and Carlos decide
to have a serious conversation with Simón

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.489
to explain their family situation, inviting
him to ask questions.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.900
First, he asks what will happen to him if
he stops taking the medication that his parents

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.439
provide, raising concerns about his health.

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.589
However, his parents assure him that he is
perfectly fine and will always be there for

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:30.209
him if he gets sick.

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.169
During the preparation for the reopening of
the orphanage, Simón and Laura get into an

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.169
argument.

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:40.189
Simón wants to visit his friend, but his
mother is just too busy to entertain his requests.

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:44.669
Laura explains that she does not have time
for it, causing her son to have a tantrum.

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.819
Because of his insistent manner of seeing
Tomás' house, Laura slaps Simón, which she

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.540
immediately regrets.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.639
The party's theme is an animal masquerade,
which requires the guests to wear masks that

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.650
resemble any kind of animal.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.560
Among the guests is the kid who looks exactly
like the one in Simón's drawing, whom he

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.849
calls Tomás.

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.239
Laura enters the house to make amends with
Simón and let him join the party, but Tomás

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.989
follows her along the hallways.

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.310
In a sinister way, he approaches Laura and
shoves her into the bathroom, locking her

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.790
inside, so she calls out for help.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.669
As she gets out with the help of Carlos and
other guests, she looks for Simón in a small

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.829
room, but construction scaffoldings are scattered.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.759
She rearranges it and realizes that Simón
is missing after looking for him in and out

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.039
of the house.

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.580
She runs to the beach, attempting to enter
the cave, but Carlos saves her from the crashing

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.580
waves.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.270
Instead, they put everything in the hands
of the authorities while Laura seeks medical

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.680
attention at a nearby hospital.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.550
Carlos informs Laura that Simón was not found
inside the cave, but she is insistent on seeing

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.550
someone.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.819
He is backed up by Pilar, the head police
psychologist, who explains that Laura must

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.110
have imagined it.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.370
Pilar is part of the investigation team on
Simón's whereabouts; according to her, he

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.480
might have been kidnapped by a relative, also
given that they had an intruder in the past

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.480
days.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.680
When Laura tells Pilar about Benigna, the
psychologist reveals that no social worker

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.800
is registered under that name, hinting that
she may be their son's captor.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.111
The devastated Laura is currently bound to
a wheelchair after an injury in the sea, so

00:05:13.111 --> 00:05:16.949
Carlos entrusts his medallion to her as an
expression of comfort.

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.090
That night, Laura dreams of swimming in the
ocean and wakes up to mysterious noises from

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.300
the hallway.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.050
The noises lead her to Simón's room, where
she finds a doll under his sheets.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.169
After six months, Simón's parents feel more
and more forsaken as there is no progress

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.979
on tracking him down.

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.789
Laura and Carlos have extracted all their
means to reunite with their son but to no

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:37.840
avail.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.629
As a means of coping, they join a support
group, where Laura shares about Simón's imaginary

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:43.629
friends.

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:47.449
The members explain that it is normal to see
visions of loved ones after their death, but

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.599
Laura is confident that her son is still alive.

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.970
On a snowy day, the couple spots Benigna,
who crosses the street while pushing a baby

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.790
carriage downtown.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.810
After Laura recognizes her, she immediately
gets out of the car in hopes of finding Simón.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.360
The elderly lady gets fatally hit by a speeding
ambulance out of nowhere, as Laura and other

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.020
people watch in horror.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.750
Laura rushes under the ambulance where the
carriage is, only to find a doll that looks

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.740
exactly like Tomás.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.080
Before they could extract any information,
Benigna sadly dies on the cold street.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.289
Laura approaches to look at her familiar face,
but when she touches her necklace, the old

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.669
woman comes back to life for a second.

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:29.990
Her deformed face and bloody appearance terrify
not only Laura but the rest of the witnesses.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.379
After the tragic incident, Pilar gathers pictures
and film reels from Benigna's house to investigate.

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.810
It is then revealed that Benigna used to work
at the orphanage where Laura used to live.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.939
Unknown to many, she had a son named Tomás,
who was kept hidden because of his deformities.

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:48.719
While showing news articles about Tomás'
disappearance, Pilar informs Laura that the

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:51.189
boy vanished shortly after her adoption.

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:54.849
Furthermore, they find out that the other
orphans played a trick on him by stealing

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:57.650
his mask while at the cave to see if he would
come out.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.790
The embarrassed boy never emerged from his
hiding place, and was drowned by the rising

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:02.790
tides.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.720
After being convinced that she saw Tomás,
Laura plays Benigna's film reels that show

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.129
what Tomás' real face looked like.

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:12.180
It shows that he is deformed and different
from the rest.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.250
That night, Laura feels her husband cuddle
up in bed with her, and she recalls precious

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.219
moments they had with Simón.

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:22.770
Amid the fond memories, Laura hears the doorknob
move, revealing that Carlos was not the one

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.090
in bed with her.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:29.090
At this moment, it is indisputable that something
or someone is haunting her once peaceful life.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.240
Desperate for answers, Laura seeks assistance
from a parapsychology expert named Professor

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.779
Leo Balaban.

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:39.629
She expresses the strange things that have
happened since Simón vanished, even providing

00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:41.779
a piece of Benigna's clothing.

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:47.580
After examining the item, Professor Balaban
puts Laura in contact with Aurora, a medium

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.309
who is a good friend of his.

00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:54.879
During their first meeting, Aurora tags along
her sound technician named Enrique as part

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:56.340
of the procedure.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.789
While Aurora summons the spirit using a doll,
the rest watch from a separate room.

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:05.819
As the seance progresses, Aurora walks around
the orphanage while Enrique traces her steps,

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:08.490
hoping that it might give a clue to help find
Simón.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:12.749
In a secluded room, Aurora hears the cries
of the orphans desperately crying for help

00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:14.979
and sees them in such a dire state.

00:08:14.979 --> 00:08:18.509
The others could also hear the children's
spirits with the sound machine while Professor

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:22.120
Balaban instructs Aurora what to say, do,
or ask.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.440
She claims to see five children in the room,
but after she asks if Simón is with them,

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.999
the power lines are cut off, ending the seance
abruptly.

00:08:29.999 --> 00:08:34.330
Aurora describes her visions back in the living
room in great detail but apologizes for not

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.950
gaining a clue on Simón's whereabouts.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:41.909
Meanwhile, Carlos and Pilar remain unconvinced
about paranormal matters, remaining skeptical

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.479
on the subject.

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:47.540
Before leaving, Aurora tells Laura that she
is nearing death, and so is her ability to

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.910
see the dead.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:53.740
Both of them also reveal wounds on their arms
caused by the spirits circling the orphanage.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.320
Laura sinks deeper into depression and explores
the contents of the orphanage on her own.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.670
A window suddenly falls into a window seat
in a room, where she uncovers dolls just beneath

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.670
it.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.990
As a clue, she sees a picture of her and Simón,
which prompts her into conducting a scavenger

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.360
hunt—Simón's favorite game.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.320
Laura starts by browsing through her son's
childhood pictures, where she sees a dried

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.130
rose in one of the albums.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.250
To continue, she comes to the garden, where
she sees a piece of cloth that resembles one

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.680
of their blankets.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.880
Laura rummages through their closet to find
the blanket and uncovers a candy packet, giving

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.220
away that the next clue is inside Simón's
memory box.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:34.019
Inside, Laura sees a doorknob, and as a means
to get the next clue, she searches for an

00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:36.839
empty knob inside the house but finds nothing.

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:40.860
After failed attempts, she opts to go to the
coal shed, where she finds Benigna's locket

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.610
near a coal chamber.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.350
Thinking that it might be a clue, she breaks
the door open and retrieves sacks from inside

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.279
the small and cramped chamber.

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:53.149
To her surprise, there happen to be five human
carcasses that terrify her beyond belief.

00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:59.519
Devastated, she finds out that the bodies
belonged to her childhood friends: Martin,

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:06.360
Rita, Alicia, Guillermo, and Victor.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.279
Benigna poisoned their meals to avenge Tomás'
death and came to the shed after three decades

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:12.279
to recover the bodies.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:17.010
Laura explains her theory to Carlos, who cannot
grasp the situation, making him leave in the

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.630
middle of the overwhelming situation.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:24.170
Despite his pleas that they stay together,
Laura decides to stay at the orphanage alone.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:28.050
She makes the place look as it did three decades
ago by rearranging the furniture and other

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:29.709
functions of the house.

00:10:29.709 --> 00:10:33.770
To make it more convincing, she even dresses
as an employee before taking an excessive

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.330
amount of sedatives.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.130
The high dosage will put her into a state
of near-death, making her more receptive to

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.870
the spirits' messages.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.790
With the doorknob in her hand, she begins
to contact the spirits, but they completely

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.089
disregard her.

00:10:46.089 --> 00:10:50.351
A bright idea comes to mind when she remembers
one of her favorite games from before, where

00:10:50.351 --> 00:10:54.040
a player knocks three times as the other players
come from behind.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.769
Laura knocks enough times for the children
to come at a close distance before she could

00:10:57.769 --> 00:10:59.800
chase them along the dark halls.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.470
The children lead her to a small room where
construction materials are at, hinting Simón's

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.470
whereabouts.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.500
The distressed Laura tears down the wallpaper
and inserts the knob into a door, which leads

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.259
to an underground room.

00:11:11.259 --> 00:11:15.250
She descends to the stairs where an empty
room which used to be Tomás' abode.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:20.370
From a corner, Laura sees Simón silently
lying down and embraces her son at that instant.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.630
Simón seems perfectly calm and well despite
being away for such a long time, relieving

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.800
all of his mother's worries.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.080
While Laura clings to her son and gives him
words of comfort, she realizes that Simón's

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.550
weight becomes lighter.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:37.280
Not long after, she realizes that she is only
holding a piece of cloth, and Simón's body

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.920
lies on the cold floor in another corner.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.820
She finds her son's corpse and shrieks out
of grief, realizing what really caused his

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:44.820
death.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.959
While looking for Simón on the night of his
disappearance, Laura arranged pieces of construction

00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:52.230
scaffolding, which blocked the entrance to
the secret room.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.110
The mysterious and crashing noises that night
were actually caused by Simón trying to get

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.110
out.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:01.279
In his desperate attempt, he fell down the
stairs and fatally broke his neck.

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:04.899
Dramatically, Laura brings her son to the
bedroom before taking an excessive amount

00:12:04.899 --> 00:12:06.670
of sleeping medication.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.690
She holds Simón close just as she does with
Carlos' medallion, slowly letting out her

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.470
final breath.

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:16.639
After some time, the mother and son wake up
in a room full of orphans, even reuniting

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:18.449
with her childhood friends.

00:12:18.449 --> 00:12:22.470
They all happily gather together and immediately
see Laura as their motherly figure.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:27.000
At that moment, she tells them a story just
before bedtime, and the children are comforted

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.829
by her loving presence.

00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:33.100
Time has passed, and Carlos visits a gravestone
just outside the orphanage before he enters

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.279
the house.

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:38.709
In their old bedroom, he finds the medallion
he entrusted to Laura and can't help but recall

00:12:38.709 --> 00:12:40.269
their fond memories.

00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:52.799
The door opens just before him, and in a comforted
manner, he smiles.
