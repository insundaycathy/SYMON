Welcome to Cinema Summary,
ladies and gentlemen

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.140
genetic engineering is a field of science and technology

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.000
that could be so very beneficial for all mankind and

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.770
even animals but what happens when it
all goes terribly wrong?

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.880
This is SPLICE (2009)

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.410
So the movie starts off with
us witnessing a birth from the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.029
first-person perspective and we meet our
protagonists Clive Nicoli

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.180
and Elsa Kast played by Adrian Brody and
Sarah Polley respectively doctors who

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.280
observe the fruits of their labor: Fred and
Ginger; two genetically engineered life

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.110
forms who seem to get along with each
other much to the relief of their team

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.129
these two doctors are superstars in the
field of genetic engineering and they

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.969
work for a company called it Newstead
that conducts experimentation in the

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.489
fields of genetics splicing in DNA from
different species into a new life form

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.110
of which Melvin and Ginger are the
sum achievement of and that hopefully

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.880
are going to be used to produce
medicinal proteins for life stock with a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.410
more advanced splicing technique used
for Fred; Clive and Elsa predict that

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.929
they can use it on humans
it's exciting since if applied a lot of

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:26.000
incurable conditions like Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's for example could be cured

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.440
though they might have to hold their
horses on human experimentation since

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.819
the board of directors want to be able
to replicate and eventually sell the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.440
proteins produced by Ginger and Fred
without the use of genetic splicing labs

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.640
which are going to be shut down and
retooled since human experimentation

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.819
will lead to scrutiny and bad publicity
and bad publicity for the company it's a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:55.099
risk that the company can't take so the
two continue in secret on their human

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:01.190
DNA splicing experiments but they
undergo failure after failure until they

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.110
do it. At their apartment Elsa and Clive
discuss moving places and even more

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.310
about having children before they're
interrupted by an alert they head down

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.150
to the embryo to find it ready to come
out and although a lot of things go

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.959
wrong during this birthing sequence
the human hybrid is born

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.129
a birth that sits heavy for the both of
them with Clive considering that they

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:30.239
destroy it though Elsa insists that they
keep it but Clive won't be dissuaded but

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.370
when they go to it they find that it's
dead and Clive goes out of the OR

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:43.069
as Elsa stays to look at their hybrid
only to discover that it's empty

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.740
and is actually this weird chicken rat
looking thing that "imprints" on Elsa

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.210
they knock it out and begin to study it
closely, finding out that it's able to

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.980
excrete venom even though there was no
predatory DNA although it's the DNA

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.780
that's concerning since beyond random
junk DNA and overall weirdness the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.240
hybrid is undergoing accelerated aging
due to its genes and later that night

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.740
Clive meets his Barlow a higher-up a
Newstead who tells him straight out that

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.690
everything is leaning on Phase 2
succeeding if they can't sell the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.610
medicinal proteins from the transgenics,
 Ginger and Fred, Newstead is going under

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.470
and it's going to be on Clive and Else's
heads if such a thing occurs a month

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.550
passes and the hybrid child has grown
immensely exhibiting a human-like

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.000
intelligence and resembling a toddler of
sorts. A toddler that Elsa dotes on and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.260
teaches much to Elsa's delight and
Clive's worry since Elsa has been

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.850
getting a little too into raising this
child: letting the 'child' out of its

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.140
containment area and taking the cover
off the hybrid stinger and even going so

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.290
far as to name it! Calling it "Dren"
the word nerd spelled backwards

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.280
It's this whimsical treatment of Dren that leads
to an argument since this wing of the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.910
lab is going to be renovated so how are
they going to hide their crime against nature?

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.260
That's when Gavin, Clive's brother
and lab associate, sneaks into the room

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.000
to eavesdrop and find out more about the
mysterious experiment that Clive and

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.343
Elsa have been hiding and runs into Dren

00:04:18.343 --> 00:04:20.850
so now they got a deal with it

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.460
their plan is genius, not really of
course, but their plan is genius so to

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.540
speak: sneak Dren out in a cardboard box
keep her hidden within storage area

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.200
which isn't great since Dredd has a
really high fever

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.310
so they put on a cold water bath which
leads to Elsa freaking out and with

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.230
little option and a little righteous
indignation

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.180
Clive holds Dren under the water and
they find out that she has amphibious

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.850
lungs. That night Elsa dotes and babies
Dren giving the hybrid a Barbie doll

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.900
that Elsa explains that she had to hide
from a mother when she was younger a

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.830
small tidbit of information that is
going to explain Elsa psychology

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.139
and her actions but there's still more
to know though something to note is that Dren is

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.720
significantly older now looking more
human with an actual nose and as Elsa

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.789
and Clive get freaky on a couch, Dren
watches on with piqued curiosity

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.750
The next day Clive and Elsa present Ginger
and Fred to the public but things go

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.099
horribly wrong as the two transgenics
fight each other to the death knocking

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:28.050
their container over and spilling blood
quite literally in the aftermath of the

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.060
presentation Clive and Elsa explained that
Ginger transformed into a male of her

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.710
species and they don't know how that
happened with the renovation soon to be

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.940
done, Dren is moved from the Newstead
storage area to a farm that Alice's

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.520
mother once owned, a mother who Elsa
described as crazy, let's hope that

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.060
doesn't run in the family though when
they get to the farm Dren runs off after

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.190
being taken outta the van to find some food
and after setting up Dren's room in the

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.469
barn the couple head into Elsa's old house

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:04.800
and we get a very clear look into Elsa's
pass Exhibit A: her old bedroom left just

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.777
the way she had it before she
left clear signs of abuse

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.900
meanwhile Dren has been getting
restless with only a cat for company

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.680
with her parents gone for work

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:21.240
and begins her rebellious phase which
Elsa does not take well while Clive is

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:26.580
surprisingly receptive being nicer than
his crankier wife and so to keep Dren

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.310
company Elsa stays home and
gives Dren the things

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.080
Elsa's mother wouldn't let her have like
makeup and jewelry and when Elsa checks

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.090
the makeup table she finds the portraits
of Clive but none of her which gets Dren

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:45.900
skittish running away to pet a cat which
Elsa takes away snidely telling Dren you

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.430
can't always get what you want that's a
part of growing up when Clive returns he

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.169
finds Dren heartbroken and tries to
comfort her with a little music and dance

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:57.449
which leads to Clive feeling things he
shouldn't have

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:04.110
since he has Elsa and then Clive has a
sudden and horrid realization and

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:10.030
confronts his wife about her decision to
use her DNA in the experiment

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:15.820
calling her out on her BS excuse to do the
experiment out of some noble pursuit of

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.830
science instead of what it actually is
after Clive leaves Elsa gives a now

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.300
older and taller Dren a gift that cat
from earlier which Dren promptly

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:31.150
punctures fatally with her stinger
shocked Elsa smacks Dren which leads to

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.720
her pouncing on to Elsa to steal the
barn door keys to unlock the door and

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.510
escape only to get knocked out and wake
up strapped to an operating table where

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.050
Elsa has gone back to being a scientist
and separating herself from the

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:49.030
experiment referring to Dren by her
designation: H-50 and begins

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:54.340
dehumanizing the hybrid removing Dren's
clothes, jewelry, and makeup in due to

00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:00.669
Dren's violent behavior Elsa removes
the hybrid's stinger when Clive arrives

00:08:00.669 --> 00:08:05.680
Elsa leaves taking with her the cutoff
stinger back to the Newstead lab to find

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.790
the proteins since by design Dren has
everything that Fred and Ginger had

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:14.440
which leads to Elsa synthesizing the
protein Newstead's been looking for the

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.790
next day Clive goes to the barn to find
Elsa but is ambushed by Dren who comes

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:24.760
on to him very aggressively and then
things get freaky because not only are

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.150
they doing it. Not only does Dren's stinger grow back but

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:34.300
Elsa finds them! Coitus interruptus
ensues and Elsa drives off back to their

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.780
old apartment and there they have an
argument which gets to the crux of the

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.890
issues: Elsa only wanted to create a
child instead of simply having a child

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:47.050
because deep inside she never wanted to
lose control of said child a side effect

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.280
of her abusive childhood, plus with the whole
creating life and raising it in humanely

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.930
and treating it poorly they've crossed a
lot of lines supposedly in the name of

00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:01.380
science and there's no going back but
maybe they can put an end to all of this

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:07.510
so they go back to the barn to find Dren
is dying and so they bury her, burn her

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:13.600
things and as Elsa is moving her
things she finds drawings of herself and

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.510
that's when company arrives Gavin and
Barlow are here to see H-50 and that's

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:24.940
when Dren comes back to life now as
assuming a more masculine form and picks

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:31.930
off the men on the farm: First Barlow
then Gavin and finally Clive before Dren

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:37.540
chases after Elsa and things get freaky
and that's when Clive sneaks up and

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.500
Spears Dren with a a branch only for 
himself gets stabbed by Dren leading

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:47.410
to Elsa taking Dren out with a rock in
the aftermath of all of this Elsa

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.520
continues working for Newstead who has
given the green light to continue her

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:57.400
research into proteins that were found
and Dren's body with Elsa now pregnant

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.380
so that was a pretty
straightforward movie wasn't it?

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.120
a married couple of scientists

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.350
go ahead and play God in doing so
creating a child that grows up, gets

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.279
impregnated by the male part of the
couple before impregnating the female

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:11.940
part of me couple after turning into a male.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.279
Right. Right? So at first when I

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:18.680
watched this movie I was pretty sure that
it was all very straightforward

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.990
Dren had to have been the one to impregnate Elsa
that's why she's pregnant at the end of

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.740
the movie and why her boss is bending
over backwards for her they want

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.790
whatever genetic goodness is inside the
chimera human hybrid whose father is or

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:35.440
was the daughter of Elsa technically
speaking or something like that but

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.029
remember that earlier in the film Clive
and Elsa get freaky and although I

00:10:40.029 --> 00:10:44.110
didn't say it the characters explicitly
mentioned that they are not using

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:48.160
protection before they get down to it
this along with the fact that the movie

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.970
occurs over a period of at least a month
or two implies that there's a

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:56.050
possibility that Elsa is pregnant with
Clive's child but with everything that's

00:10:56.050 --> 00:11:00.670
messed up in the film: the ethics, the
relationships, the experiment itself plus

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:04.660
with the dialogue at the end of the movie
it is heavily implied that Elsa is

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:10.209
carrying Dren's baby for the sake of a
big paycheck and a career how exactly a

00:11:10.209 --> 00:11:15.490
fertilized egg has its DNA overridden
with Dren's DNA, I'm not too sure

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:20.110
but I assume that it's a result of a mutation
caused by the junk DNA that's inside

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:24.700
Dren as noted earlier in the film by
Clive as being something he's never seen

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.810
before which is speculated to allow Dren
the ability to have body parts that she

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:33.430
shouldn't have like the stinger though I'm
not a biologist so take my soft serve

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.779
science thoughts with a grain of salt
and let me know what you think was

00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:42.399
Elsa's baby Dren's or Clive's? Would you
sign up to sell your chimera baby for

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:46.149
some fat stacks of cash? And did you hear
about that Chinese scientist who was

00:11:46.149 --> 00:11:49.029
working on designer babies who just
disappeared one day and no one's seen

00:11:49.029 --> 00:11:52.329
him since? Tell me what you know and what you
think in the comments down below and

00:11:52.329 --> 00:11:56.079
