00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.500
Hey Guys, welcome back to our movie recap
channel. Today we will be watching the movie

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.260
“Gerald’s Game”. Please turn the subtitles
on and spoilers ahead.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.480
At the start of the movie, we see a woman
packing her clothes into a bag. Then, a man

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.140
can be seen doing the same, but he also packs
a handcuff in his bag. They are Gerald and

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.150
Jessie, a married couple who are going out
for a vacation. Their relationship hasn’t

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.230
been the strongest in recent years, So Gerald
had this trip planned to possibly save the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.520
marriage and spice up their sex life.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.930
On their way, they get stopped by a dog which
is eating a dead mouse. Jessie feels bad for

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.250
the starving dog. Gerald honks at the dog,
which steps aside and they move on.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.660
They reach their vacation house, which is
very far from the city. Jessie seems happy

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.250
to see the beautiful place. After opening
the fridge, Jessie cuts a few slices of meat

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.720
and takes it outside. She starts calling for
the dog that they had encountered earlier.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.460
Meanwhile, Gerald takes a blue pill, or we
can say a viagra, as he has something planned.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.079
Soon, the stray dog appears and Jessie takes
the meat closer to him. But, Gerald comes

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.910
out, and the dog gets scared and runs away.
Gerald takes Jessie inside the house and they

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.970
don’t even bother to close the door.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.320
Jessie gets ready in her new night dress and
starts to pose seductively. Gerald then comes

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.760
out with the handcuffs in his hands. Jessie
seems excited by his idea. Gerald cuffs Jessie’s

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.950
hands to the bed, and takes one more pill.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.930
They start to get intimate, and Gerald suggests
that Jessie can shout if she wants, cause

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.810
no one will hear them. He says that Jessie
should yell “Help”. This seems to be a

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.970
fantasy of Gerald’s and Jessie plays along.
She calls out for Help. Gerald starts to get

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.210
rough with her, which quickly turns off Jessie.
She says that she’s not comfortable with

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.430
what Gerald was asking from her. But Gerald
doesn’t listen to her, which makes Jessie

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.020
mad. She shouts at him and tells him to uncuff
her hands.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.170
After this, the couple get into an argument.
Gerald says that he wants to bring some change

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.540
to their relationship and to save them from
growing apart. But, Jessie is sad to find

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.450
out that he had such fantasies. She asks Gerald
to let her out of the handcuffs. But, Gerald

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.560
denies to do so. He comes close to Jessie,
and gets bitten by her. Once again, they get

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.030
into an argument. Gerald starts to feel something
in his shoulder. Something is definitely wrong,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.219
and Jessie sees it too. Gerald starts getting
a heart attack due to the two pills he took

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:15.540
earlier. Jessie thinks he is joking with her,
but Gerald’s condition gets worse and he

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.519
falls on Jessie’s body.

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.469
Jessie uses her legs to get Gerald off of
her body. But Gerald’s body falls out of

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:26.230
the bed. Jessie calls out to him, but gets
no response. She tries to get the cuffs off

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.689
from her hands, but she is helpless. She tells
Gerald that she will let him do anything,

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.239
hoping that this all is a joke. But, she notices
the blood flowing on the floor, and realizes

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.329
that this wasn’t a joke after all.

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.511
She yells out “Help”, for real this time.
But no one is there to listen to her. They

00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:45.919
were miles away from any home in the area.
Hours pass by, but Jessie is still cuffed

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.209
to the bed. She hears something outside the
window. She calls out hoping that there is

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.299
a person. But, it is the stray dog that Jessie
was trying to feed earlier. The dog gets closer

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.879
to Gerald’s body, and Jessie tries to scare
it away. But, the dog bites a chunk of meat

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.810
from Gerald’s hand and starts eating it.
Jessie can do nothing but cry. All of a sudden,

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.529
Gerald gets up. Jessie finally seems relieved,
but she notices that Gerald’s body was still

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:13.790
lying on the ground. Gerald was actually dead,
and the one that was standing in front of

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.819
her was nothing but her hallucination.

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.900
In her hallucination, Gerald starts to talk
about their failing marriage, and his problems

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.939
with not getting excited in their relationship.
Jessie doesn’t know what to make out of

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:28.760
all this. Gerald reminds Jessie that since
his death, Jessie had wasted 5 hours doing

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.339
nothing. He even calls her stupid. Gerald
reminds her that her life support system was

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:38.049
running out. She was getting dehydrated, and
her energy level was falling down. The staff

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.269
were told not to disturb them for a whole
week, so no one was going to save her. If

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.459
she doesn't do anything to save her life,
she will soon die.

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.510
Jessie tries harder to get her wrist out of
the cuff, and she succeeds. She breaks the

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.450
bed handle and completely gets herself free.
She steps forward and breathes a sigh of relief.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.329
But, it was her hallucination again. She is
still cuffed to the bed.

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.019
The imaginary Jessie tries to motivate the
real one by saying that she cannot give up

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.450
on her life. The sun was already down and
Jessie looks at her phone. If she manages

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.449
to get her phone, she can call for help. Jessie
tries to reach to the phone, but she cannot.

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:15.949
The imaginary Jessie tells her to remain alive
until she can get help. Gerald asks her how

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.519
long she can survive without drinking water.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.240
The imaginary Jessie and Gerald both remind
her of the glass of water that was above her

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.880
bed. Jessie tries to get to the water. She
lifts the one end of the bed top, and lifts

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.229
it to slide the glass towards her other hand.
She successfully manages to grab the glass,

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.370
but her hand doesn't reach her mouth. The
imaginary Jessie tells her to put the glass

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.210
back where it was. She does the exact same.
Then, Gerald asks her about the night dress

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.069
she had brought with her. It was a brand new
night dress, and the tag that came with it

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:48.590
was above the bed. Jessie takes the tag and
rolls it to make a straw. She successfully

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.340
manages to put it in her mouth. She grabs
the drink back, and finally manages to drink

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.819
the water. Her imaginary self tells her to
save some water for later. Meanwhile, the

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.520
dog was still feasting on Gerald’s flesh.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.750
With all that Jessie had gone through, she
gets tired and falls asleep. Soon, a noise

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.069
is heard in the house, which scares the dog
away. Jessie notices a tall figure in the

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:13.400
corner of the room. The figure comes closer
to Jessie, and it is a really scary being,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.330
that’s not a human at all. It shows Jessie
a bag full of human bones and some jewellery.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.800
Jessie tells herself that it was nothing but
her hallucination. She closes her eyes, but

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.110
Gerald tells her that it was there to take
her. It was her death. Jessie replies that

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.409
it was just her hallucination, and not her
death. But Gerald asks her, if that was not

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.699
her death, then why did the dog run away.

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.039
Jessie opens her eyes, and Gerald starts calling
her a mouse, which triggers her into thinking

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.039
about her past.

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.789
12 years ago, Jessie is out with her family
to spend their vacation. Jessie doesn’t

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.000
want to ride the boat, so her father stays
to keep her company. But everyone else rides

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.750
the boat. Jessie was planning to watch the
solar eclipse that day. Her father says that

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.909
when she was a child, she used to sit on his
lap. He also calls her by the nickname “Mouse”.

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:02.259
Jessis says that she still is a child, and
sits on her father’s lap. But, her father

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:03.759
starts to molest her.

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:08.300
Jessie wakes up from her sleep. And her whole
body is in pain, due to the irregular circulation

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.900
of blood in her body, She starts to scream
in pain. After a few minutes of screaming,

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.499
She grabs the water and starts drinking it.
Imaginary Gerald asks her why she didn’t

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:22.270
tell him about her father. Jessie had told
no one about what happened with her father.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.229
Imaginary Jessie tells her that she married
a man just like her father. Jessie starts

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.870
crying, and Gerald reminds her about the tall
figure she had seen last night. He shows her

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.960
the footprint on the floor. He tells her that
the tall figure was real, and that it will

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.400
come again tonight.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.530
In the past, Jessie’s father comes to her
and apologizes. He says that they should tell

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.090
everything to her mother, and starts crying.
At the end, however, he manipulates Jessie

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.660
into not telling anyone about that incident.
And Jessie also promises that she will not

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.860
tell anyone.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.729
At present time, the stray dog is still taking
bites off Gerald’s body. Gerald asks Jessie

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:00.180
what will happen to her after she dies. He
tells her that when people find their body,

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.010
they won’t know how they died. He again
reminds her of the tall figure, and says that

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.919
it will visit her tonight as well.

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:10.699
In the past, after their family trip, Jessie’s
father touches the pregnant womb of her mother.

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:15.259
Seeing this, Jessie breaks a glass in her
hands. Her father tapes her injured hand.

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:19.629
And at present, Jessie wakes up and plans
to cut her hand to get out of the handcuffs.

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:23.639
Imaginary Jessie tells her that whatever she
is planning to do, she has to hurry, as she

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:25.020
was dehydrating.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.819
She grabs the glass and breaks it. With the
broken piece of glass, Jessie cuts her wrist.

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:33.529
She knew that the blood was slippery. She
uses the blood and finally gets her hand out

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:38.250
of the handcuff. She grabs the key of the
handcuff and frees herself completely. She

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.830
starts drinking water, and covers her injured
wrist with bandages. She takes the car key,

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.999
but faints because she has no energy left.
When she wakes up, she finds that the dog

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:49.300
had eaten chunks out of Gerald’s face.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.069
Suddenly, the dog runs away. She sees the
tall figure and steps forward. She gives her

00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:58.300
wedding ring to the dark figure, possibly
to bargain for her life. She then starts the

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.960
car and sees imaginary Gerald waving at her.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.599
Due to lack of energy and stress, Jessie cannot
keep control of the car. She hits the car

00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:08.469
onto a tree, but manages to survive the hit.

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:13.190
She sees a house near where her accident took
place. She sees two people with torch lights,

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.759
She honks the car to get their attention.
She walks out of the car, and is finally saved.

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:22.229
6 months after this incident, Jessie writes
a letter to her younger self. Her hand was

00:08:22.229 --> 00:08:24.689
still in pain from the cut, but she could
write.

00:08:24.689 --> 00:08:28.669
Jessie was interrogated about the incident
that took place that day. But she doesn’t

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:31.060
tell the truth, and says that she remembers
nothing.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.750
It gets proven that Gerald’s death was due
to a heart attack. So, Jessie gets lots of

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:40.089
money from the life insurance of Gerald. And
with that money, she opens a foundation to

00:08:40.089 --> 00:08:42.589
help young girls who were victims of abuse.

00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:46.730
But every night in her sleep, she sees the
tall dark figure in her room. The police also

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.470
never found Jessie’s ring inside the house.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.399
One day when reading the newspaper, she finds
out that the police had captured a man named

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:58.100
Raymond Andrew. Andrew was convicted of stealing
jewellery from the graveyards. Andrew was

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.399
also captured because he used to cut and eat
the body parts of dead humans. He suffered

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:06.910
from a rare disease which gave him the appearance
that he had. Jessie figures out that what

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.089
she saw that night wasn’t her hallucination,
but a reality.

00:09:10.089 --> 00:09:14.910
Jessie goes to the court hearing of Raymond
Andrew and sees him in day light. Seeing Jessie,

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.050
Andrew breaks the ties from his hands. Jessie
isn’t afraid of him, she steps close to

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.980
him and sees her father and Gerald in him.
They were all monsters.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.120
She cracks a smile and says that he was smaller
than she thought. Jessie was finally free

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.019
of the trauma she suffered as a child and
from when she was trapped in the house.

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:35.450
