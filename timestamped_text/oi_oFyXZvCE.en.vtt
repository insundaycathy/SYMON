00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.440
Hi, Mystery Recapped here. Today I’m going&nbsp;
to explain a South Korean space Western film&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.920
called “Space Sweepers,” Spoilers&nbsp;
ahead! Watch out and take care! 
&nbsp;

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.360
In the year 2098, the fading of sunlight&nbsp;
and acidic soil has caused all the plants to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.800
disappear. The earth has run out of fertile land,&nbsp;
forests have vanished, and deserts are widespread.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.400
In such conditions, the end of humanity seemed&nbsp;
near. But a company called the UTS Corporation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.080
came to mankind’s aid and built a new orbiting&nbsp;
home for humanity that mimics natural processes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.680
on Earth. It is a mass of land, a little far&nbsp;
away from earth, that orbits with it. 
&nbsp;

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.560
However, the UTS was not competent enough to&nbsp;
build a home that can accommodate everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.440
from the earth. Only a chosen few who have&nbsp;
enough money to pay for the UTS services&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.440
can ascend to the new orbiting&nbsp;
home to become the UTS citizens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.080
while 95% of the human population remains on the&nbsp;
dying earth. In addition, some humans called the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.240
space sweepers live on several less developed&nbsp;
constellation colonies called the orbits. Space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.360
sweepers put their lives in danger to collect&nbsp;
unwanted trash from space, like abandoned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.280
satellites and space vehicles. They sell such&nbsp;
debris to the UTS warehouse for their living.
&nbsp;

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.880
The CEO of UTS, James Sullivan, claims that&nbsp;
he cares about the people on the earth but
&nbsp;

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.440
cannot do anything about it. He is also&nbsp;
planning to create a civilization on Mars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.640
making it the new earth.
At the beginning of the movie,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.560
a space sweeper named Kim Taeho arrives at the&nbsp;
UTS lost and found warehouse where things and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.440
people who have been found in orbit are kept. He&nbsp;
is there to have a look at a seven-year-old girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.040
who was recently found dead. After paying with&nbsp;
his magnetic shoes, he gets to see the girl, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.640
he is disheartened to see she isn’t the one he is&nbsp;
looking for. Taeho then ascends back to space and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.360
to his orbit ship called the victory. Taeho’s crew&nbsp;
consists of a former drug dealer named Tiger Park,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.680
an android called Bubs, and is led by captain&nbsp;
Jang. The crew get on the ship Victory and fly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.280
to intercept an abandoned spaceship that had&nbsp;
been floating in space. The victory is late,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.080
as they see other space sweepers competing&nbsp;
to claim the ship as their own. But,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.800
under the captainship of Jang, they impressively&nbsp;
manage to get their hands on the spaceship. 
&nbsp;

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.360
The crew brings the ship to a waste management&nbsp;
factory only to find that the damage they had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.640
caused while capturing it is more expensive than&nbsp;
the ship itself. The crew plans to fix the damage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.440
themselves to get the money, but while they are&nbsp;
at it, they discover something strange inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.880
The spacecraft has a living little girl in a&nbsp;
spacesuit. The shocked crew, get her out and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.200
bring her with them to their ship. They plan&nbsp;
to get an award from the girl’s parents for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.000
bringing her back. As they deliberate on the&nbsp;
plan, the news shows the picture of the girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.600
It says that the girl is an android named Dorothy&nbsp;
who has a weapon of mass destruction inside her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.120
created by the terrorist group Black Fox. Hearing&nbsp;
that the girl is dangerous, the group gets away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.400
from her while planning about getting rid of her.&nbsp;
Taeho sees several missed calls from a man named&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.960
Hyun-Woo Kang on Dorothy’s phone. He recognizes&nbsp;
the man as a UTS employee and a doctor. 
&nbsp;

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.400
Taeho calls Kang and demands two million dollars&nbsp;
to give Dorothy back to him. Kang accepts the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.840
deal, which makes the group jump in happiness.&nbsp;
They decide to meet in the 32 commercial district.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.840
However, both the groups are unaware of the CEO&nbsp;
James listening to their conversation from afar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.200
James wants the little girl Dorothy for himself&nbsp;
because, according to him, only she can help him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.040
execute his plan to colonize Mars. James then&nbsp;
sends off his men to get the girl. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.560
Taeho and the crew meet doctor Kang to hand him&nbsp;
the girl only to find out that she is missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.520
The little girl somehow ends up in a club where&nbsp;
everyone recognizes her and starts to panic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.600
They run away from the girl in fear as&nbsp;
she stays still on the dance floor. 
&nbsp;

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.240
Just then, Doctor Kang finds her and runs&nbsp;
to get the girl but is dragged away by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.400
panicking crowd. The space guards sent by James&nbsp;
are also there. They fire at Taeho, but Dorothy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.440
with her supernatural powers, creates a shield&nbsp;
to protect him. The crew somehow escapes with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.560
Dorothy on their ship. Now, everyone is at a&nbsp;
loss for what they should do with the girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.320
Tiger begins to open up to the girl,&nbsp;
playing with her to keep her occupied.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.560
At the same time, Captain Jang sees a&nbsp;
drawing of her that Dorothy had made.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.160
The crew starts to feel affectionate towards her&nbsp;
as time goes by. The following day, captain Jang&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.280
notices that a tomato plant has grown in their&nbsp;
ship, which they had failed to take care of. 
&nbsp;

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.400
Later, the android Bubs tells Dorothy about the&nbsp;
crew’s past. It turns out that all of the crew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.920
members once used to be wealthy and good people.&nbsp;
Taeho was a Commander of the Space Guards and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:58.160
first-ever UTS Genius. He worked closely with&nbsp;
CEO James back then. In one of his missions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.120
he found a human baby that he was supposed to send&nbsp;
back to the earth. But Taeho chose to take care of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.560
the little girl instead. He named the girl Suni&nbsp;
and treated her as his own child. After being her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.800
dad, Taeho could not kill people anymore, so James&nbsp;
labeled him useless and threw him out of the UTS.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.480
Taeho was demoted to a slum orbit colony where&nbsp;
he stayed without a home for a year. One day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.120
the orbit was hit by space debris, and during&nbsp;
the chaos, he got separated from his daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.480
Since then, he has been trying to accumulate&nbsp;
money to conduct a search party for her. 
&nbsp;

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.000
Later, they get a call from a person who wants to&nbsp;
take Dorothy for a lot of money. Taeho prepares to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.080
hand her to them, but Tiger is worried about&nbsp;
what the people will do to the little girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.440
Taeho reminds him that he needs to look for&nbsp;
his daughter Suni at any cost. As they talk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.120
someone kidnaps Dorothy from the&nbsp;
bathroom. The crew soon realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.080
and chases the abductor. They get the little&nbsp;
girl and defeat the abductor and his group.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.640
When the team reveals the abductor’s face, they&nbsp;
are surprised to see that he is Karum, the manager&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.520
of the garbage disposal facility they sell the&nbsp;
space debris to. Captain Jang interrogates the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.160
abductors and finds out that Dorothy is&nbsp;
actually a human and not an android. 
&nbsp;

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.240
She was born with congenital disease&nbsp;
and couldn’t move. So, her father,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.080
doctor Kang injected her with nanobots found in&nbsp;
space debris as a last resort to save her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.040
The nanobots not only saved Dorothy but also&nbsp;
gave her unique powers. She could communicate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.240
with other nanobots and heal and protect things;&nbsp;
like, the tomato plant that had grown in the ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.400
James found this and used little Dorothy to turn&nbsp;
Mars into a healthy, green planet. But, now, since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.000
her job for him is done, he wants to kill her. He&nbsp;
knows that Dorothy has powers to heal the earth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.760
and make it fertile, but if she does that, humans&nbsp;
won’t need him, and UTS would be out of power. 
&nbsp;

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.000
So to end the problem as a whole, James created a&nbsp;
hydrogen bomb and labeled Dorothy to be dangerous.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.040
He plans to explode the bomb that will kill all&nbsp;
humans on the earth, making Mars the only viable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.280
option for all other humans. The crew finds out&nbsp;
that Karum and his friends are called black Fox.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.840
They are an environmentalist group, but James&nbsp;
has mislabeled them as terrorists and plans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.440
to blame the hydrogen bomb attack on earth on&nbsp;
them. The group is surprised at the revelation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.800
As they process the information, space guards sent&nbsp;
by James arrive in their orbit. The crew narrowly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.920
manages to escape the orbit in their ship but are&nbsp;
pursued by the soldiers. While trying to flee,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.440
they enter a danger zone filled with millions of&nbsp;
nanobots. Dorothy uses her power to communicate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.320
with the nanobots and saves the ship from&nbsp;
malfunctioning. However, she falls unconscious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:42.080
right after. Tiger performs CPR on the little girl&nbsp;
and finally manages to bring her back. Everyone in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.040
the crew sighs in relief and laughs with her. 
They communicate with the black fox group and plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.160
to reunite Dorthy with her father, doctor Kang.&nbsp;
The two ships meet, and the little girl finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.600
gets to meet her father. Everyone is delighted to&nbsp;
see them hug. But the happiness doesn’t last long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:03.040
when suddenly, they are attacked by the space&nbsp;
guards. They barge in and kill Kang and all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.880
of the Black Fox group. James is there too, he&nbsp;
hands Taeho and the crew four million dollars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.920
for keeping the girl safe and leave with&nbsp;
Dorothy. James also orders his soldiers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.040
keep an eye on the victory ship and the crew. 
After everyone is gone, Tiger tells the crew that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.000
they will have to rescue Dorothy, but Taeho wants&nbsp;
to take the money to save his own daughter. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.360
get into a fight which ends after captain Jang&nbsp;
asks Taeho to continue with saving his daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.240
but the other crew will be on a mission to save&nbsp;
Dorothy. The crew prepares for their missions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:40.320
as Taeho reminisces about Suni. To the crew’s&nbsp;
delight, he decides to join them to save Dorothy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.120
All of them take their respective positions,&nbsp;
ready for the mission. With all their skills, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.240
manage to keep up with the space guards who fire&nbsp;
at them repeatedly. The Victory manages to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.440
away from the guards and finally reaches the place&nbsp;
where Dorothy is located. They discover the little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.720
girl scared and tied to a chair with the hydrogen&nbsp;
bomb. Captain Jang figures out that the bomb can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.920
destroy everything within the 5000 kilometers&nbsp;
radius. They have to fly away as soon as they can,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.800
but the group feels responsible for the bomb that&nbsp;
is about to kill billions of people on earth. 
&nbsp;

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.840
They cannot leave when they have a chance to&nbsp;
save so many lives. So, the crew contacts all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.160
their fellow space sweepers and asks for their&nbsp;
help to escape the space guards who are waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.280
for them outside. With their help, they manage&nbsp;
to get away from the facility and fly far away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.000
The space sweepers and Guards get into a battle,&nbsp;
but the guards are soon defeated. Only one guard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.600
ship remains, which is piloted by James himself.&nbsp;
Captain Jang figures out a way to broadcast all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:41.200
James’s doings to the whole world. Now, everyone&nbsp;
knows about his plan to destroy the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:47.120
The Victory finally reaches 5000 kilometers away&nbsp;
from the earth. Just then, James’s ship latches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.400
itself onto the Victory. He expects to see Dorothy&nbsp;
inside but instead is surprised to come across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.120
the hydrogen bomb. It turns out that the crew&nbsp;
had put the hydrogen bomb into their own ship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.720
and sent Dorothy off with the other space sweepers&nbsp;
before fleeing. They have decided to sacrifice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:09.040
their own life and take the bomb away from the&nbsp;
earth. Now, finally, the bomb explodes, taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.920
James and the whole of the ship Victory with&nbsp;
it but ensuring that everyone else is safe. 
&nbsp;

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:19.120
As the dust from the explosion settles, we see&nbsp;
the victory ship had been protected by nanobots,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.512
thanks to Dorothy. All the crew members are happy&nbsp;
and grateful to the little girl. After some time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.512 --> 00:10:24.560
we see that the android Bubs has changed her&nbsp;
appearance to look like a human, the world has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:30.000
started to heal, and fertile lands are coming&nbsp;
back with the help of Dorothy’s powers. Dorothy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.520
also helps Taeho reunite with his daughter Suni&nbsp;
using her abilities. The group returns to their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:41.200
job as space sweepers, now with an upgraded ship,&nbsp;
more money, and Dorothy added to their team.
