00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.940
After divorcing his wife, a billionaire with
a successful career lives a simple but boring

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.719
rich life alone and does nothing except for
earning money every day, Until one day, he

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.129
received a special birthday gift, which has
made his life changed dramatically, and even

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.509
faced the end of life, What kind of gift is
it?

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.529
FILM TIME, a movie recapping channel brings
a classic thriller movie, The Game

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.050
The main character, Nick, is a billionaire
but lives alone, Today’s his 48th birthday,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.840
and his brother, Sean, whom he hasn’t met
for a long time, sends Nick a membership card

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.880
to a game company as a birthday gift, He mysteriously
told his brother that the card will definitely

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.111
make him feel good, This year's birthday,
Nick is actually very irritable inside, because

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:49.000
his father jumped off the building to commit
suicide on his 48th birthday, This incident

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.731
has become a psychological shadow for half
of Nick's life, He had talent and power, but

00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:58.600
was mean and indifferent and did not even
have a friend around, and one day when he

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.110
died, perhaps his brother Sean would be the
only one to come to collect his body, Thinking

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.420
of this, Nick was even sadder,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.100
Later, Nick took his membership card to the
headquarters of the game company, the salesman

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.560
who served him was named Jim, Jim asked a
bunch of nonsense questions and did a whole

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.290
day of mental and physical tests on Nick,
which made Nick very impatient, When everything

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.310
was done, he went to a bar alone for a drink,
only to accidentally overhear two men at the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.150
next table discussing a game designed by this
game company, Nick is curious and tries to

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.570
ask what is going on, but the two men only
tell him to enjoy, The next day he received

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.270
a call from the game company, Due to the failure
of the mental and physical tests, his game

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.020
was canceled,

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.290
He returned home slightly frustrated and found
a lying corpse in front of his villa in the

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.130
exact same position as when his father jumped
to his death, Nick carefully went up to check

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.380
and realized that it was not a real corpse,
but a clown puppet dressed in clothes,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.490
He dragged the clown home and pulled out a
key in the interface with the word game company

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.550
printed on it, Just then, the news anchor
on TV suddenly tells Nick: Brother, the game

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.039
has officially begun, Nick is a bit confused,
but he soon discovers the mystery,

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.189
It turns out that the clown's eyes are equipped
with cameras, so the news anchor can talk

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:19.230
to him through the TV, The anchor finally
told Nick mysteriously: Brother, do not pursue

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.330
the meaning of the game, the meaning is to
find out the meaning behind it,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.579
The next day, Nick had to fire an old supervisor
of the branch, The old supervisor had caused

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.370
the company's stock to plummet because of
bad decisions, which made Nick furious, The

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.450
supervisor bagged Nick to give himself another
chance, but Nick immediately asked him to

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.930
sign the termination contract, However, the
suitcase containing the contract could not

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.519
be opened, Nick pulled out the key obtained
from the mouth of the clown, but still couldn’t

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.170
open the suitcase, The matter of layoff can
only be discussed next time,

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.930
At the dinner, Nick got splashed with red
wine by a waitress, The waitress, Nana, had

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.400
just come to work at the restaurant, and Nick,
who was in a bad mood, could not help but

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.080
scolded her, The restaurant manager, to please
Nick, fired Nana on the spot and said this

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.500
meal can be free of charge, Who knows after
the manager just left another waiter handed

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.180
over a bill, Nick felt puzzled, but after
reading the bill, he panicked and rushed out

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.629
to catch up with Nana, He asked what the bill
was about, but Nana was even more baffled

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.340
and didn't want to talk to Nick,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.309
Just as the two walked to the intersection,
an old man suddenly fell in front of them

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:32.129
both, Nick, though thought something was abnormal,
still called the emergency number, a police

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:37.469
car happened to pass by, Nick rushed forward
to stop it; the ambulance also then arrived,

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.739
the police let Nick and Nana get into the
car, accompanied the old man to the hospital,

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.069
They also needed to make a simple statement,

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.170
Nick took out the bill to explain why he had
chased Nana, It turns out the bill says to

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.739
let Nana go as well, which she guesses is
part of the game, Nana blanks Nick for being

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.159
downright old-fashioned in this way of finding
girls to pick up, Soon they arrived at the

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.550
hospital’s parking lot and the old man is
transferred into the emergency room, Just

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.029
as Nick and Nana are ready to leave, the garage
suddenly lost power and all the medical staff

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:13.849
and police around them instantly disappeared,
plunging the large space into total darkness,

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.599
It seems like the game company is behind it
again so Nick told Nana about his participation

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.519
in the live game, Nana doubted it,

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.840
Nick saw a keyhole on the elevator, and once
again pulled out the key on his body, and

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.319
it really worked, The elevator suddenly got
stuck halfway through, and they had to climb

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.610
out through the skylight to find out that
this was the headquarters of the game company,

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.430
Nick was so annoyed and couldn't help to curse,
The security guards did not say anything,

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.430
directly let the dog bite them, the two rushed
over the fence and jumped into a dumpster

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.539
to escape safely, Seeing Nana being innocently
involved in because of him, and he also made

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.430
a mess, Nick felt quite sorry, He invited
her to his company's lounge to clean up before

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.750
going home, After Nana took a shower, Nick
thoughtfully called a cab for her, Surprisingly,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.090
Nana frankly told Nick that someone paid her
to splash red wine on him, Nick laughed at

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.199
this,

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.699
The next day, Nick woke up and received a
call from a hotel, telling him that his bank

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.520
card was left in the hotel, Nick was confused
and came to the front desk of the hotel to

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.720
get his card, politely said that the room
had been opened for him, Nick did not remember

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.810
opening a room at all, but after in the pockets,
he found a room card and decided to see it,

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.050
Nick found the room extremely messy, There
was some unknown white powder and a bunch

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.949
of racy photos of women, The woman in the
photos did not show her face, Nick panicked

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.030
and flushed the white powder into the toilet,
and put all the photos into the briefcase

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.470
next to it, He suspected that this incident
was the work of the old supervisor who was

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.599
going to be fired, This guy, even faked Nick's
sex scandal to threaten him, Nick drove out

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:50.919
of the hotel in a hurry to get his revenge,

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.740
Nick was followed on the way and lead the
stalker into an alley and found his personal

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.031
information and a pistol in the car, Nick
asked him if he was sent to follow him, but

00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:03.620
the person left the car and escaped, Distracted,
Nick went to the old supervisor to get his

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.990
revenge but found that the supervisior already
resigned and even signed the termination contract,

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.909
It seems that the matter was again made by
the game company, and Nick has had enough

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:18.169
of this inexplicable game, He went back to
the company and flipped out the game and signed

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.110
the option letter before he started,

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.960
Because the game company promised that the
player could terminate the game at any time,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.550
however Nick found the contrack is blank,
It seems that the words on it written in invisible

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.860
ink which will disappear without a trace once
the time was up, Nick also found a wrench

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.960
in the envelope and he put the wrench in his
pocket, As Nick thought back carefully what

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.780
he encountered on the day's, he suddenly remembered
the woman in those racy photos, even though

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.470
he couldn't see her face, the red underwear
is still very eyecatching, and Nick accidentally

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.389
saw Nana wearing the same underwear while
she was taking a shower in the lounge,

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:57.319
Thinking of this, he asked his subordinates
to call the cab company to find out Nana's

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:02.030
home address, At night, Nick returned to his
house and found The power had been cut off

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.759
and the walls were painted, and The clown
had a picture of his father's death scene

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:10.909
stuffed in his mouth, and a note writing “As
my father did, I choose to sleep long,”

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:15.720
This is not only rubbing salt in Nick's wounds
but also abetting his committed suicide, he

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:21.249
immediately called the police, and his brother
Sean suddenly appeared before the situation

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:26.689
was completely described, Sean looked terrified,
invited Nick to get into the car and apologized

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:31.520
that he shouldn’t have let his brother play
such a real-life game, He himself also participated

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.379
in this game, but it led him to a mental breakdown,
He tried to spend money to end it all, but

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:41.550
it simply did not work, the company asked
him to keep playing, The real purpose is unknown,

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:46.639
Just now, the car suddenly blew a tire, They
stopped at the side of the road,

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:50.840
Nick then find a tool to get out of the car
to replace the spare tire, As soon as they

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.330
open the locker, a lot of keys all printed
with the name of the company fell out, This

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.030
time, Sean can no longer calm down, he actually
suspected that the brother is also from the

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:04.999
game company, Nick rushed to catch up, but
Sean excitedly stopped to rebuke, hoping Nick

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:09.800
not to meddle and mind his own business, Nick
is usually very controlling which Sean has

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:15.949
long been dissatisfied with this, then, Sean
ran away again, Nick, Physically and mentally

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:20.469
exhausted, just stopped a cab to go home,
but the driver gradually deviated from the

00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:25.159
route and drove directly into the river, Nick
then realized that the driver was also from

00:08:25.159 --> 00:08:29.789
the game company, and the driver locked all
the doors before jumping out of the car, Nick

00:08:29.789 --> 00:08:31.330
followed the car into the river,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.670
At the critical moment, he found a wrench
in his pocket and eventually used it to open

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:40.460
the car door and escape, After getting out
of danger, Nick called the police again, But

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:45.370
the game company headquarters has already
been empty, the police did not find any clues,

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:50.330
and were not willing to intervene in the investigation,
After all, all Nick encountered are the result

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:55.040
of his own boredom, he can no longer count
on the police, Luckily, his assistant’s

00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.570
side soon found out Nana's address, Nick came
to Nana's house, when Nana went to the bathroom

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.890
he looked around and found that the room was
not right, the label on the table lamp hadn't

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.410
been removed, even the books on the shelves
were empty shells, The pictures of Nana as

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:14.160
a child were actually cut out from random
newspapers, Nick directly asked Nana about

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.130
what was going on, Nana whispered to remind
him that there were cameras on the roof of

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.760
the fire sprinkler, Nick smashed the cameras
in anger,

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.410
Sudden someone shot from outside, a group
of masked killers directly killed over, Nick

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:30.830
and Nana panicked drove to escape, On the
way, Nana finally confessed that she was an

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:35.020
ordinary employee of a game company, This
company specializes in recruiting wealthy

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.200
members in the name of the game, with the
aim of extracting wealth from the players,

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.750
They will drive players crazy step by step
through the game and finally kill them, Nana

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.440
also reminded Nick to check his bank balance,
Nick did not believe this, he thought his

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.260
account was very safe, but Nana went on to
remind him if he had done a lot of tests and

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:58.080
signed a lot of papers before the game started,
This is how the game company deduces the player's

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.450
account number and password and imitates the
player's signature, then, they take away all

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:07.450
the deposits, It was the only point that made
Nick panic, At Nana's prompt, he dialed the

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:11.770
bank and reported her account and password,
The bank staff told Nick that his account

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:16.180
does not have a penny, it seems that some
companies really have a conspiracy,

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:21.370
Nick drove Nana to his country house, Nana
made hot tea for Nick, A few time later, Nick

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:26.170
passed out then, It seems that Nana had put
drugs in the tea, The game company speculated

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:30.190
that the player account number and password
are all bullshit, Why they asked Nick to call

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:34.860
to check the accounts is to get the password
and account, When Nick woke up, he found himself

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:40.460
lying in a broken coffin, After he struggled
to climb out, he realize that he was in Mexico,

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:46.300
He was penniless and had no passport, but
luckily, he still had a watch in his hand,

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.680
This was a gift from his father before he
died, Nick cherished it very much, but now

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.890
he has had no choice, so he had to sell the
watch and take a stolen car back,

00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:00.320
As soon as he arrived in the United States,
he returned home, Nick got the news that his

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.930
brother Sean was put in a mental hospital,
and his own big villa was seized, Nick took

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:09.020
a hot shower and then found a pistol as a
weapon, With his brother Sean locked up in

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:13.250
a mental hospital, Nick suddenly realizes
that there is no one else in the world who

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:18.130
can help him, He used to think he was rich
and powerful, but now he realizes he actually

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:23.930
has nothing, Finally, Nick thinks of his ex-wife,
she lent Nick her car despite the past, Deep

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:28.390
inside the heart, Nick felt infinite guilt
towards his ex-wife, and he wanted to say

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:33.640
sorry to her, Just then, a commercial actor
on TV caught Nick's attention, This person

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.810
was actually the receptionist of the game
company Jim, Jim's turned out to be an actor,According

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:43.570
to this clue, Nick soon found Jim, he directly
pulled out a pistol to coerce Jim to take

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:48.130
himself to find the person behind the crime,
Jim took Nick to the headquarters of the game

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:52.550
company, and they found the entire building
is the property of the game company,

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.810
The company's new headquarters is full of
people, they wear the costumes of all lifes

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:01.440
as if they’re ready to act, Nick saw Nana
in a corner, and he quietly went over and

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.050
directly took Nana as hostage with a gun,
With the discovery of the security guards,

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:10.470
regardless of Nana's death, raise the gun
to shoot Nick, Nick took Nana all the way

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:15.070
to the rooftop, and then locked the door to
the rooftop, Now he is taking his revenge

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:20.230
with Nana; Nana once again claimed that everything
was really just a game, Nick's money was still

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.690
in the account, all the shootings were all
blanks and firecrackers faked out for special

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:29.320
effects, everything was an elaborate design
by the company, And Nick's brother and colleagues

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.560
have prepared him for a birthday party, How
could Nick ever believe in this?

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:38.190
Just then, the people inside began to cut
the door lock with a chainsaw, Nick suspected

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:42.180
that behind the door was a group of loaded
killers, and he turned his gun to prepare

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:47.010
for the last wave, Nana was completely panicked,
She reassures Nick while telling the people

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.980
behind the door through the walkie-talkie
in her hand not to act rashly because Nick

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:56.140
has a real gun in his hand, but it's too late,
The door opened at the same time, Nick also

00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:01.510
pulled the trigger, and after a gunshot, Sean,
who was surrounded by the crowd, fell to the

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.440
ground dead from the gunshot,

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.850
the only family member actually died under
Nick’s own gun, Nick was heart-broken, In

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:12.610
a daze, he went the rooftop and jumped from
the roof, just like what his father did, In

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:17.140
the few seconds he fell, his mind recalled
his childhood, He remembered his father's

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.530
smiling arms around himself, remembered his
open arms hugging his brother who was still

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:27.500
a baby, A few seconds later, Nick fell heavily
but he didn't die, Instead of a hard floor,

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.810
he was greeted by a soft, giant air cushion,
In front of him was a lively party scene,

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:37.400
and it was his own birthday party, This is
exactly his own birthday party, Sean came

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.800
through the crowd and sincerely offered birthday
wishes to his brother, It seems that the brother's

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.110
fake death and Nick's jump were both game
sessions designed by the game company, He

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:50.971
was not angry when he learned the final truth,
and when he jumped down, he was reborn, The

00:13:50.971 --> 00:13:55.870
shadow of his father's suicide seemed to have
dissipated in his mind, and he began to realize

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.260
that earning money is not the only thing in
life,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:03.240
Perhaps the relationship between people is
the code for long-term happiness, This is

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.861
probably the breakdown therapy in the mental
theroy, At the end of the story, the brother

00:14:07.861 --> 00:14:12.330
pays a huge amount of money for Nick to end
this thrilling psychological game, Nick also

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:17.010
catches up with Nana, who is ready to leave
at the last minute, to extend an invitation

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.260
to her for a date, and new life has just begun,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.770
After shooting Seven, director David Fincher
became a legend and has launched The Game,

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:30.181
Fight Club, Panic Room, Zodiac, and many other
classic suspense thrillers, However, some

00:14:30.181 --> 00:14:34.740
fans believe that the final reversal of this
film seems redundant, It would have felt better

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.220
if it had ended with a sad ending of Nick
jumping to his death,

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.220
Okay!
