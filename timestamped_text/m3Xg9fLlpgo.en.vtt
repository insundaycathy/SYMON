00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.160
if you were trapped in the house hunted&nbsp;
down by a blind special forces killer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.720
and you can't make a sound what would you do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.680
the characters in this movie thought robbing&nbsp;
a blind man would be an easy job only for it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.480
to turn into a brutal trap that takes a shocking&nbsp;
turn towards the end i'm going to break down the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.600
mistakes made what you should do and explain&nbsp;
how to beat the blind soldier in don't breathe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.800
rocky is a small-time burglar who's trying to make&nbsp;
as much money as she can to leave detroit and head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.440
to california with her sister she finds out from&nbsp;
her partner there's a house in skid row where a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.400
veteran lives alone and a whole lot of cash is&nbsp;
sitting around inside she doesn't have a clue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.280
that this will be the last robbery of her life&nbsp;
the burglars scattered the veterans neighborhood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.240
and spot him outside of walking his dog and they&nbsp;
notice he has a cane this man is blind as a bat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.480
the job appears have gotten a whole lot easier&nbsp;
but if they took him more seriously they would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.920
have seen a few red flags they noticed the cane&nbsp;
but not that he was extremely fit for his age that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.680
means he's exercising inactive this guy is a war&nbsp;
veteran with a killer instinct and a body to match&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.400
he probably even sleeps with a gun and his&nbsp;
rottweiler already has it in for you so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.360
maybe not as easy as they all think later that&nbsp;
night the team begins their robbery they slip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.480
the guard dog some sedatives but find that the&nbsp;
front door has several locks they can't open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.080
wait this doesn't make sense they have the key for&nbsp;
the man's home security company why would he have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.680
extra locks so far they've been smart about&nbsp;
this thorough research 24-hour recording of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.880
neighborhood activity but this is a bad start four&nbsp;
locks is a sign that he's not going to make things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.680
easy for you especially since he's a military man&nbsp;
i would bring brass knuckles or other self-defense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.800
weapons so that we have a better chance at a&nbsp;
confrontation nothing they try works the side into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.160
the house is locked shut and so is the cellar door&nbsp;
but rocky spots a window above them and clambers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.200
of the side she breaks in through the bathroom&nbsp;
window and sneaks as fast as she can to shut off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.560
the burglar alarm before it goes off this girl&nbsp;
knows what she's doing the problem is he's blind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.480
not deaf cracking glass of a rock is noisy and&nbsp;
stomping around a boots is going to wake him up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.200
the blind developed enhanced hearing and the&nbsp;
ability to track movement also the statistical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.880
majority of u.s soldiers experienced terrible&nbsp;
insomnia and he just lost his daughter he would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.200
definitely be a light sleeper considering who&nbsp;
they're up against being silent here could save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.600
you for this they could have used duct tape it&nbsp;
pads the sound it keeps most of the glass shards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.800
intact and while taking your shoes off is smart&nbsp;
it's another loose end with everyone inside they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.360
begin searching the house for the cash one of the&nbsp;
guys enters the veteran's bedroom where he's about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.720
to fill it with sleeping gas the soldier suddenly&nbsp;
gets up it's time to acknowledge that this man is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.320
crazy alert just puncturing a plastic bottle wakes&nbsp;
him up if that doesn't change your strategy then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.640
you might as well write your will and testament&nbsp;
but it's a lot of money if you've gone this far&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.600
i wouldn't call it quits just yet what you should&nbsp;
do now is lock him in this could be done by tying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.240
the knob to a heavy piece of furniture or using&nbsp;
a specialized security bar to force it shut&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.040
none of them have found any money but they&nbsp;
do find this door with some crazy locks on it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.440
they try forcing an open of a pry bar and when&nbsp;
that doesn't work one of the burglars pulls out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.960
a gun and shoots the lock off alex here begins&nbsp;
to realize this can only end badly for them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.760
so far they broke into his house damaged his&nbsp;
property and brought a gun into the home of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.240
veteran with superior skill and knowledge&nbsp;
and firearms castle law dictates this guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.560
could defend his home and if you think shooting&nbsp;
into a plastic bottle is going to keep it quiet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.680
you're dead wrong the best homemade silencer would&nbsp;
be a modified oil filter it might be bulky but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.800
it's going to do the job alex decides enough is&nbsp;
enough and leaves and he's the only one thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.760
straight because things are about to go terribly&nbsp;
wrong as a blind man suddenly appears behind them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.400
and they're definitely underestimating how much&nbsp;
this golf war vet can do the burglar tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.120
he just stumbled and drunk but the vet steps&nbsp;
on the broken bolt lock and knows exactly what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.120
it is he threatens him with his gun shooting a&nbsp;
warning shot which alerts alex outside he moves in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.120
grabs the gun and disarms it it's officially&nbsp;
time to freak out they're completely outmatched&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.760
he slammed the gun to his neck asking&nbsp;
one simple question who else is with you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.080
in this moment we need to take stock of some&nbsp;
important facts you won't overpower him you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.800
can't sneak up on him you can't find the money&nbsp;
and there's no way to save your friend if you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.080
the first to bolt you might get away heartless&nbsp;
i know but that's the life of a criminal he will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.160
definitely shoot if he hears you running so i'd&nbsp;
throw something as a diversion stay low to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.200
ground and sprint for the door if i'm still alive&nbsp;
i can make new friends and never mention this to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.640
anyone instead they all panic in solidarity the&nbsp;
burglar tells him that he came alone and gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.720
promptly shot horrified rocky hides herself in a&nbsp;
closet as alex comes back in and finds the blind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.000
guy he's locking things down literally locking&nbsp;
the door shut and boarding up the broken window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.200
this is terrifying but he has a shot here the&nbsp;
gun is near the sink within arm's reach i would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.160
grab it and shoot him dead wipe the prince and&nbsp;
place it in the hands of my dead friend that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.480
at least what i'd like to do but i'm way too much&nbsp;
of a coward for that let's just close our eyes and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.000
hope this all goes away from the closet rocky sees&nbsp;
the veteran open as safe and input the pin code&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.840
a simple four digit combo that's going to pay off&nbsp;
big alex finds her and together they discover that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.600
into the safe are bundles of cash now they got&nbsp;
what they came for but how are they going to leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.080
remembering that there is a storm seller outside&nbsp;
they head for the door only to find the veteran&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.520
blocking their only escape plan he begins to drag&nbsp;
the dead body out but as they slowly back away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.760
he hears the floorboard wood floors are impossible&nbsp;
to beat it's too late for wd-40 your only option&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.400
is to cover your mouth and stay breathless and&nbsp;
emotionless until he leaves the room that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.280
what i would do but the truth is it might get me&nbsp;
killed just as quickly when your heart is racing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.400
it's using up your body's oxygen reserves making&nbsp;
it very difficult to hold your breath for long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.240
the right strategy is to breathe through your&nbsp;
mouth slowly as it's less noisy because it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.120
a wider air passage the burglar's phone goes&nbsp;
off and he shoots at it it's a distraction that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.560
saves their life if i'm seeing this i'm losing&nbsp;
all hope his aim was incredible for a blind man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.880
he definitely makes running for an exit a bad&nbsp;
strategy he continues carrying the body out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.200
the room giving them the chance to find a way out&nbsp;
but they're about to find a horrifying surprise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.000
awaiting them in the basement they can barely see&nbsp;
anything they're stumbling around with no accident&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.080
in sight when out of nowhere a woman leaps at&nbsp;
them she's gagged tied up and chained to a wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:36.080
this just got way more intense killing an art to&nbsp;
burglar is one thing but this is insane they now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.960
understand who they're dealing with a psycho&nbsp;
killer who plays by his own rules and upstairs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.600
he just figured out that these guys are still in&nbsp;
the house i told you those shoes were a bad idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.000
rocky goes to rescue her and realizes that she's&nbsp;
the girl who killed the blind man's daughter this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.200
is his revenge she directs them to a shape and&nbsp;
lucky for them to use the same combo inside they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.000
find keys and use them to free her not realizing&nbsp;
this kind of act was their biggest mistake of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.280
night now it's good to help people but right now&nbsp;
it's not smart escape gets a lot harder with three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.160
people let alone two and it's strange they never&nbsp;
think to take off her gag she might have told us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.240
about the bell she's rigged with and from there&nbsp;
an ambush can be planned by luring him down with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.880
it as long as we stay silent we have a chance to&nbsp;
knock him out and lock him in but let's not kid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.720
ourselves this is a gamble because if you have to&nbsp;
fight him you've already lost the cellar door gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.000
unlocked and the man starts firing grazing alex&nbsp;
shooting at rocky as she breaks her phone and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.960
accidentally killing the girl they were trying to&nbsp;
rescue taking cover they retreat into the basement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.000
the man cautiously steps down and slips in blood&nbsp;
realizing the woman is dead and begins crying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.280
this is not what you'd expect if she killed his&nbsp;
daughter there might be more to this than it seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.280
they watch in the shadows as the blind man&nbsp;
locks the door and breaks the key in the hole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.160
guaranteeing no escape the burglar's only plan&nbsp;
left is to make a break for the other room and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.360
get to the front door but suddenly all the lights&nbsp;
in the basement go off it's pitch black and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.680
have to reach out to find their way around while&nbsp;
the veteran is literally sprinting through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.800
dark corridors it's the perfect death trap for&nbsp;
a blind man he starts firing at them and taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.320
cover the two split up as they try to navigate the&nbsp;
basement rocky moves along a shelf and has no idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.480
that she's about to bump into the veteran she's&nbsp;
practically breathing on him and is only saved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.520
by alex's calls luring the blind man towards&nbsp;
him the veteran somehow finds alex and grabs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.800
him shoving a gun against his head but realizing&nbsp;
the gun is empty he starts strangling him luckily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.120
he's able to knock a shelf onto the veteran before&nbsp;
running away to get the girl we've lost her single&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:41.040
advantage over him sight how do we escape you can&nbsp;
start by confirming where he is draw him in with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.680
noise and hide on a lower shelf to hear him walk&nbsp;
by effectively mapping part of the room for you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.560
to run in the opposite direction he has the whole&nbsp;
place memorized but he will follow what he hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.480
once he's distracted make your way towards&nbsp;
the light quickly they scramble to get out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.600
of the basement and jam the doors shut but find&nbsp;
themselves staring down a massive rottweiler rocky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.040
goes to unlock the front door while alex tries&nbsp;
his best to keep the dog calm he nearly succeeds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.760
until the veteran tries to break down the basement&nbsp;
door sending the dog into attack mode and forcing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.200
them upstairs they barricade themselves in one of&nbsp;
the bedrooms and try to escape through the windows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.560
but they're barred it's a bad situation that only&nbsp;
gets worse as a veteran starts breaking through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.280
the door alex suggests pressing the panic button&nbsp;
on his remote making the point that the cops will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.000
overlook their robbery when they discover that&nbsp;
this man is a murdering psychopath and he's right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.720
this lets them live but not keep the&nbsp;
cash something rocky isn't willing to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.640
the vet is still pushing through and they're&nbsp;
running out of time but they suddenly spot an air&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.600
vent above that's big enough for one of them to&nbsp;
slip through rocky squeezes into the crawl space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.640
just as the dog rams alex knocking him out of the&nbsp;
window and on the skylight below as if that wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.440
enough the psycho dog then climbs its way into the&nbsp;
shaft and makes its way towards rocky to finish&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.960
the job with no other option she throws herself&nbsp;
down the shaft head first slamming into the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.000
alex is dangerously suspended on the skylight he&nbsp;
tries rolling slowly as the glass cracks under him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.320
but looks up only to see the blind man shoot the&nbsp;
glass holding him up sending him falling to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.120
ground hurt from the fall he walks through the&nbsp;
house trying to use his remote to activate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:20.240
burglar alarm now it's risky but we now have an&nbsp;
open path outside i might have tried going back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:25.120
out to the skylight we'd be wearing gloves so we&nbsp;
wouldn't get cut too badly and judging by their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.760
height it's possible to jump up to but it's too&nbsp;
late because the blind man finds him first and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.880
fires his revolver forcing him to hide in this&nbsp;
laundry room right next to his friend's corpse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.880
the veteran tracks into the room but gets ambushed&nbsp;
and disarmed but he should have gone straight for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:44.080
his head because he grabs alex who quickly gets&nbsp;
overpowered and beats the snot out of him but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:49.200
the washing machines turn on disorienting the man&nbsp;
alex takes his chance and reaches for the gun on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.240
the floor now if i was in this situation with my&nbsp;
honed abilities as a coward i would have run out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.120
of the door but kicked the gun out with me get out&nbsp;
of the closed space because it forces you to fight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:04.000
him and you will win them the veteran manages to&nbsp;
turn off the washing machines and stop alex from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.880
grabbing the gun throwing punch after punch before&nbsp;
finishing the burglar off with garden shears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.120
recovering from her fall rocky struggles&nbsp;
to reach the end of the ventilation shaft&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.360
that leads straight out of the house she's able&nbsp;
to turn herself around and kick out the grate but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.960
it's too late she's ripped out of the crawl space&nbsp;
by the veteran and gets knocked out she wakes up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.360
locked into the same harness as the woman before&nbsp;
her the veteran very clearly tells her he won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.160
let her go after what she's done and it tends&nbsp;
to keep her as a replacement for what exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.840
a baby maker he was using the woman to make a new&nbsp;
daughter for him to replace the one she had killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:43.040
rocky is gonna stay with him for the next nine&nbsp;
months it's almost impossible to escape from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.000
this unless you're prepared in advance handcuffs&nbsp;
have a universal one-fits-all lock if you're a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.480
criminal they'll likely come in handy you can tuck&nbsp;
it in your waistband to access when you're cuffed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.280
it's looking hopeless for her the blind man has&nbsp;
won and there's nothing she can do but upstairs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.760
alex gets up from the floor he's still alive&nbsp;
because the other burglar's body was stabbed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.560
instead of his now he has his best chance to&nbsp;
escape with some quick thinking he's able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.720
trick and lock the dog inside the laundry room&nbsp;
giving him time to unlock and open the front door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.560
he needs to leave it's not about money anymore&nbsp;
this is pure survival if both of you are caught&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:22.240
it won't help anyone he's had the drop on you at&nbsp;
every turn and without even being able to see get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.760
out and get help back in the basement the veteran&nbsp;
disposes of the girl's corpse and hoists up rocky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:33.520
to prepare her for what's to come now he's not&nbsp;
going to force itself on her oh no it's way worse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.800
he grabs his bottle of frozen goo from a fridge&nbsp;
gets it nice and warm and fills a turkey baster&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.760
with it it's an absolutely horrifying moment for&nbsp;
rocky who tries to rip her way out of the harness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.880
but there's no escape this is going to happen just&nbsp;
as she's given up all hope blood splatters on her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:54.480
face and the blimey gets knocked away by alex he&nbsp;
came back to set her free taking the cuffs off and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.520
placing them on him she swears that she'll get the&nbsp;
veteran arrested but alex points out that it would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:05.120
end badly they've broken into his house stolen his&nbsp;
money and assaulted him it would be child's play&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.600
for the guy to turn the cops against them they&nbsp;
have to let him go if they want to get away it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.880
appears to be over but just as they make it back&nbsp;
upstairs and open the front door alex gets killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.600
by the blind man leaving rocky the sole survivor&nbsp;
who makes it out of the house it seems like she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.400
safe but then his dog comes bolting out of the&nbsp;
house you can't outrun a rottweiler it's not going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:29.360
to happen if you're being chased by a dog standing&nbsp;
still and slowly walking away will usually work in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.920
this situation but this dog might be related&nbsp;
to cujo so i can't blame her for running but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.840
she might have had a better chance to run around&nbsp;
the back of the house where there's more cover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.160
and more obstacles to put as much between&nbsp;
yourself and its crazy canine as you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.560
it chases her all the way back to her car and&nbsp;
snags a hold of the money bag leaving her stuck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.040
inside did that make matters worse she dropped&nbsp;
the money outside the car the keys are nowhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:56.480
to be found she's trapped but she comes up with an&nbsp;
ingenious plan that would have made macgyver proud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.040
she opens up the trunk to lure the dog inside and&nbsp;
then yanks on the rope she attached to trap him in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:06.000
while at the same time pushing the passenger seats&nbsp;
back into place effectively caging the dog at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.320
least for a moment before it rips its way out man&nbsp;
this dog has no chill it gets so close that it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.640
almost able to bite her and this gives her the&nbsp;
chance to hook the release latch onto the dog's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.920
collar pulling it back and giving her the space to&nbsp;
get out and grab the bag now if only she was a bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.520
more careful she would have gotten away drag back&nbsp;
to the house and drop right next to alex's corpse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:33.200
it's utterly hopeless but maybe she's got one last&nbsp;
trick up her sleeve she grabs alex's remote and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.840
activates the panic button alarms start blaring&nbsp;
throughout the house and overwhelm the veteran&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.720
rocky picks up a pry bar and blitzes the blind man&nbsp;
hitting him as she cleverly takes advantage of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:48.080
confusion but just as she's about to land one more&nbsp;
blow the alarm shuts off the veteran hears the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:53.920
floorboard creek behind him and he turns but he's&nbsp;
too slow on the draw and gets sent flying knocked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.880
into the basement floor where his gun goes off&nbsp;
shooting a leaky hole to himself during the fall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.760
she takes a breath as if for the first time all&nbsp;
night with the money in hand at the veteran dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.240
rocky leaves the house just in time before&nbsp;
the police arrive later as she and her sister&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.400
are waiting at a train station she sees a news&nbsp;
report about the robbery there's no mention of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:18.480
her or any money being stolen but the veteran is&nbsp;
still alive covering the hospital he hasn't told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:25.840
anyone about what really happened but who&nbsp;
knows what he'll do once he's finally out

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.380
you
