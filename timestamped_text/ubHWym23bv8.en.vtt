THE POSSESSION OF HANNAH GRACE (2018)

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.360
Today I will show you a&nbsp;
horror mystery film from 2018,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.680
titled The Possession of Hannah Grace.
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.920
Inside an abandoned church, a girl is restrained&nbsp;
on a bed. There are 3 men with her there, two are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.920
priests, one is her father. The older priest is&nbsp;
performing an exorcism on the girl - Hannah. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.960
comes closer to see if she's still breathing and&nbsp;
she awakens, the demon controlling her body. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.160
other priest sprays her with holy water, as the&nbsp;
older one continues with the exorcism. The girls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.960
convulses and her father comes closer begging her&nbsp;
to fight. The demon pretends it's the girl for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.080
moment, changing its eyes to her eye color, but&nbsp;
laughs as it tricks the father. It takes control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.360
of the older priest as well and flings him across&nbsp;
the room, killing him. Then, it starts suffocating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.000
the younger priest. Seeing what's happening,&nbsp;
the father takes a pillow and kills the girl,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.080
which releases the other priest from the&nbsp;
hold of the demon. The girls fingers move.&nbsp;

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.800
3 months later, Megan walks into a hospital for a&nbsp;
job interview and is immediately joined by Lisa.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.960
They can be seen drinking coffee, as Lisa&nbsp;
tells Megan that she will be there to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.240
Next, Megan is walking to the facility with&nbsp;
Doctor Lewis, who's explaining her new job to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.880
He asks her about her issues at her previous job&nbsp;
as a cop, but she says she's much better now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.200
saying she can handle the job. They enter&nbsp;
an elevator and the doctor says that after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.160
a while people get creeped out by the job, their&nbsp;
imaginations running wild. She doesn't think that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.560
will happen to her. As they're going deeper&nbsp;
inside the basement area, he tells her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.960
the night shift can only get in and out of&nbsp;
the facility by swiping their security card.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.200
He keeps showing her around the facility and takes&nbsp;
her to the intake bay, telling her that while on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.440
duty she can never leave the premises. After&nbsp;
the intake bay she is to take the bodies to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.760
receiving room, where she is to take pictures&nbsp;
of them as well as scan their finger prints.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.120
They finally enter the facility's&nbsp;
freezers and he welcomes her to the team.&nbsp;

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.400
The next night, Megan walks into the dark hospital&nbsp;
and talks to security in the reception area.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.200
One of the guards introduces himself as&nbsp;
Dave and welcomes her to the night shift.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.680
Megan goes down to the resting home.&nbsp;
Later, she's seen working on the computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.880
when the lights go out. She turns them back&nbsp;
on, when a body arrives at the intake bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.720
Her and an ambulance worker transfer the&nbsp;
body to the receiving area, as they talk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.560
Next, she's capturing images of the body, then&nbsp;
scanning its fingerprints. She puts the body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.640
in the freezer, but Dave jumps out and scares&nbsp;
her. He follows her around, apologizing. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.960
Megan continues with her work, goes to the&nbsp;
restroom and when she comes back, she has a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.160
vision of a man standing in the hallway. Upset,&nbsp;
she goes to take some pills, but stops herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.360
Next, she's seen in a AA meeting, sitting&nbsp;
next to Lisa, telling the group about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.080
man she saw previously. He was someone she was&nbsp;
about to arrest when she was a police officer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.880
but he shot her partner before she did anything.&nbsp;
She shares that when she remembers the incident,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.400
she wants alcohol and pills. That day, someone&nbsp;
wakes her up knocking on her door. It's her cop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.360
ex-boyfriend Andrew, who's there to get the rest&nbsp;
of his things. She tells him about her new job,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.000
but he doesn't think it's the best idea to be&nbsp;
spending that much time alone. Megan tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.080
that it was Lisa's idea, who's her sponsor,&nbsp;
and that the night shift worked great for her.&nbsp;

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.840
The next night, she's at work and the alarm for&nbsp;
the intake bay comes on. Megan goes to check but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.400
there's no one there at first. Suddenly a homeless&nbsp;
guy jumps out at her asking her to let him in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.600
She doesn't do it and calls security to inform&nbsp;
them about the man, when an actual body is ready&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.120
at the intake bay. The ambulance driver, Randy,&nbsp;
asks her to come out and help him with the body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.000
because he can't move it alone. She reluctantly&nbsp;
steps out, knowing that's against regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.280
As they're moving the body, the homeless man walks&nbsp;
inside the facility and takes the elevator, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.000
Megan doesn't see him. Randy is much chattier than&nbsp;
the previous driver and starts telling her about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.280
the body, as they're transferring it. The body&nbsp;
was found in an ally and the perpetrator escaped,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.560
with no clue of who he is. The body is&nbsp;
Hannah. Randy keeps talking about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.360
saying whoever killed her, also tried&nbsp;
to burn her body. Megan escorts him out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.160
The lights on the other end of the hallway come&nbsp;
on, as she walks inside to process the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.240
The first image she tries to capture&nbsp;
fails. She tries again with no result.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.240
Megan moves the camera and tries to take&nbsp;
another photo when she hurts herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.360
She decides to move on to the fingerprints.&nbsp;
She takes them and starts scanning them in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.400
when the computer fails too. Not sure of what to&nbsp;
do, Megan places Hannah's body in the freezer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.200
but as she's pushing it inside, one of the&nbsp;
tables starts shaking and a few vials fall down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.120
shattering. She goes to pick them up and&nbsp;
cuts her hand. Returning to the push the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.320
body fully inside the freezer, a drop of her&nbsp;
blood falls on it. Still in the freezer room,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.840
she dresses her wound and suddenly the freezer&nbsp;
door opens. She checks and closes it. Next, she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.880
goes to her computer and uses Andrew's password&nbsp;
to check on Hannah's case. She prints out her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.320
file and goes to check on the body again. The eye&nbsp;
color in the file isn't the same one as the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.120
All of a sudden one fly appears on the body and&nbsp;
then a whole swarm of them, frightening Megan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.480
She takes another look, but the flies aren't there&nbsp;
anymore. Megan puts Hannah back inside and returns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.000
to her computer. Suddenly, she hears a noise and&nbsp;
she goes to investigate, only to find out that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.200
body is gone. She takes a step outside and sees&nbsp;
someone dragging the body away, so she follows.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.080
Suddenly, the homeless man attacks her, but&nbsp;
she fights him off and when she goes to grab&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.640
his knife, he's gone. Leaving the body in&nbsp;
the hallway, she calls security and tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.960
them to call the police. Megan runs back&nbsp;
to the hallway, but the body isn't there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.280
She walks into the burning room and finds&nbsp;
the man getting ready to burn the body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.320
so she tries reasoning with him. Suddenly security&nbsp;
runs in and tackles him, but as they're taking him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.280
away, it's clear that it's Hannah's father. He&nbsp;
tells Megan to destroy the body, saying that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.400
she's not dead. Later, he's arrested and Megan is&nbsp;
putting away the body, when she hears something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.400
strange. She closes the freezer, regardless and&nbsp;
walks away, but the doors open again. Megan is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.760
nervous to walk back, though she still takes the&nbsp;
body out and opens the bag. Suddenly, her phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.680
rings. It's Andrew checking up on her, but as she&nbsp;
turns the body moves. Megan takes a closer look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.800
it and it exhales. She wraps it up in a panic and&nbsp;
leaves the room, when Lisa shows up at the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.400
She tells her that she can find someone to cover&nbsp;
her shift, but Megan insists to stay. She tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.600
Lisa that she heard the body exhale, but she tells&nbsp;
her that bodies expunging air is a normal thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.920
Later, they're sitting in her office, talking&nbsp;
about the attack and the night her partner got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.040
shot, when Dave walks in and tells her there's a&nbsp;
cop that wants to talk to her. Lisa and Megan walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.240
out and Dave stays in the facility. The door of&nbsp;
the freezer opens again. The cop waiting for her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.520
is Andrew. He asks her how she is, but then starts&nbsp;
asking her about a bottle of pills that have gone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.160
missing from his stuff. She gets angry with him,&nbsp;
but before he leaves asks him to help her with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.960
something. Megan goes back down at the resting&nbsp;
home and grabs Hannah's fingerprints. She gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.960
them to Andrew, says that there's something&nbsp;
odd about it and asks him to check it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.280
Dave plays around in the facility while he waits,&nbsp;
but he hears something strange and walks into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.480
freezer room. Something is moving inside the&nbsp;
freezer, so he opens the door and looks inside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.960
when a hand gabs and then pushes him out. It&nbsp;
controls his body like it did the priest and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.000
drags him back into the freezer. Megan comes back&nbsp;
in the facility and goes to the restroom. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.560
sends an apology text to Andrew and suddenly hears&nbsp;
someone come inside the restroom, thinking it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.200
Dave. Her rubber band ball is rolled to her and&nbsp;
she hunches over to see who it is, when a burned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.720
hand grabs it from the floor. Megan is terrified,&nbsp;
but comes out of the stall. There's nothing there.&nbsp;

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.280
Later, Andrew calls her back and tells her&nbsp;
that Hannah has been dead for 3 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.320
Megan searches for Hannah online and finds an&nbsp;
article about her, saying she was possessed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.960
a demon. She goes to investigate the body&nbsp;
again and notices that a huge wound that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.680
was on it previously isn't there anymore. The&nbsp;
other security guard is looking for Dave too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.520
when she walks to the reception desk. She asks for&nbsp;
the security footage. Back at her office, she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.920
going through the footage and finds a glitch that&nbsp;
looks like the body is in the hallway. Frightened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.720
by that, she wants to take some pills again, but&nbsp;
doesn't do it and instead goes to find Lisa and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.680
get her opinion about the footage. They're both&nbsp;
in the facility, looking at the footage, but Lisa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.640
doesn't see the same thing Megan does. However,&nbsp;
she does see the pills on a counter, while Megan&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.040
is telling her about what the man was saying about&nbsp;
the body in the burning room. Lisa confronts her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.760
about the drugs and doesn't quite believe her when&nbsp;
she says she didn't take any. Her sponsor thinks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.480
that the visions she's been having are caused by&nbsp;
stress. Lisa leaves the facility and goes to light&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.360
a cigarette in a stairwell. She hears some noise&nbsp;
upstairs and thinking it's Dave, runs up toward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.480
them. As she reaches a corner and sees Dave in the&nbsp;
shadows, the body jumps out of the darkness and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.840
starts chasing after her. Lisa goes to the roof,&nbsp;
but it follows her there and slowly kills her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:47.040
Back inside the facility, there's another intake.&nbsp;
It's Randy again, but this time Megan won't come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.360
out to help him. She tells him about what has&nbsp;
happened and takes him inside to ask him about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.640
wound on the body. He says that he saw it too, as&nbsp;
well as her arm, that was burned when it arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.840
Megan tells him that it looks like the body is&nbsp;
healing herself. Megan is left alone again and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.800
calls Andrew to tell him that she kept his pills,&nbsp;
because she was feeling anxious. She wanted to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:12.480
honest with him. Before she hangs up, the body is&nbsp;
seen crawling behind her, but she doesn't see it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.520
It is in the elevator, fixing itself. Randy&nbsp;
is driving out of the hospital parking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.000
when he suddenly hits something. He goes out to&nbsp;
check what it was, but his phone rings and as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.880
he answers, he hears a strange noise behind him.&nbsp;
He investigates what it was and looks through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.840
back of the ambulance. The body is crawling&nbsp;
behind him. He turns around and it's there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.600
He runs, but it pins him between two ambulances&nbsp;
and is coming to get him too. It crawls up to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.960
and kills him. Simultaneously, Megan is checking&nbsp;
the footage from a few moments before and sees the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:48.000
same glitch in the elevator first, then the body&nbsp;
crawling inside. She runs out thinking Randy's in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.480
danger. Even though she's not supposed to, she&nbsp;
goes into the parking lot and finds him dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.400
Andrew calls her, telling her that the man from&nbsp;
the burning room escaped. Suddenly, he appears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.840
behind her and grabs her, taking her hostage. He&nbsp;
tells her to get the body out of the freezer. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.600
he opens the bag, the body has changed again. He&nbsp;
says that she heals herself by killing people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.880
The man asks why it hasn't killed her too. Megan&nbsp;
says that she believes him, so he starts telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.720
her about Hannah, that the demon inside of her&nbsp;
doesn't want to leave and that the blue eye is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.840
its mark. He explains that he killed her during&nbsp;
the last exorcism to save the lives of others, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:29.040
when they went to bury the body it wasn't there&nbsp;
anymore. It killed 4 people in the funeral home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.040
They go to the burning room, as he tells Megan&nbsp;
that the only way to destroy the demon is to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.400
burn the body. As she looks at the fire, the demon&nbsp;
incapacitates Hannah's father and goes after her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.760
next, but the man attacks it and saves Megan, only&nbsp;
to end up burnt himself. She runs and the body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.200
crawls after her. Meanwhile, Andrew arrives at the&nbsp;
hospital and finds her phone as well as Randy's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.320
body. Megan keeps running away from the walking&nbsp;
body, but it just keeps catching up to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.600
It crawls up to her, as Andrew enters the&nbsp;
facility. He looks for Megan inside, but the body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:04.480
just drags her inside the freezer, where she sees&nbsp;
the rest of the bodies. Andrew runs into the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.880
security guard, who tells him that everything&nbsp;
is down in the hospital. They hear the noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.600
Megan makes in the freezer room and go toward&nbsp;
it, finding Megan on the floor. The guard sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.800
the body and runs away, but it eventually catches&nbsp;
up to him and kills him. The body heals its last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.040
wound and goes after Andrew, when Megan suddenly&nbsp;
finds the courage to start shooting at it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.600
She keeps shooting and finally incapacitates&nbsp;
the demon, long enough to get her ex out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.680
the facility. She tells him to get help and&nbsp;
goes back to pick up the body and take it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.480
the burning room. It wakes up again and struggles&nbsp;
with her as it gets burned, but Megan eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.200
manages to burn it. The police finds her sitting&nbsp;
on the floor, playing with the rubber band ball.&nbsp;

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.320
In the final image of the film, Megan is&nbsp;
looking at herself in the mirror. One of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.960
eyes is covered by her hair. A fly appears out&nbsp;
of nowhere and she squishes it on the mirror.
