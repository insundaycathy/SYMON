two other men in matching black cold weather&nbsp;
uniforms approach the scientist he leads them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.280
to an excavation site which is easily the size&nbsp;
of a football field at the center of the site&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.880
appears to be a giant wing and fuselage the black&nbsp;

door blasts open one of the caretakers is killed&nbsp;
in the blast nazis pay no attention to the old man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.120
but instead open the building's crips one by one&nbsp;
a dark figure appears in the exploded entryway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.520
johann schmidt a high-ranking nazi and leader&nbsp;
of the hydra sect nonchalantly enters he crosses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.880
the room comes to the difficult to open&nbsp;
sarcophagus and easily pushes the lid free&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.320
with it he finds the skeletal remains of an&nbsp;
old viking clutching a glass cube the tesseract&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.680
schmidt scoffs and tells how this cube would be&nbsp;
the jewel of adan's treasury if it weren't to fake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.760
and goes to the caretaker asking where the real&nbsp;
cube is hidden the caretaker initially refuses but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.960
under threat of harm to his family he relents&nbsp;
gesturing to a hidden drawer across the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.400
part of an ancient carving the size of the wall&nbsp;
schmidt pries the drawer open and finds the real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.800
doctor gives a once-over to steve's medical file&nbsp;
which reads like that of a 90-year-old man and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.480
rejects steve's application as the military 4f&nbsp;
as this is his fourth failed attempt to enlist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.360
distraught steve heads to the movies he envies&nbsp;
the enlisted man featured in the pre-show newsreel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.200
and watches as other audience members tear up a&nbsp;
loud-mouthed impatient moviegoer begins yelling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.120
at the screen start the movie i didn't pay to&nbsp;
see this crap steve tells the man to shut up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.960
and is surprised as the man turns around stands&nbsp;
up in towers above him in the alley behind the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.200
theater the bully savagely beats the scrunny steve&nbsp;
who bravely fights back but is easily overpowered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.480
when his opponent asks him why he won't simply&nbsp;
give up the bloodied steve says i can do this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.120
all day james bucky barnes steve's best friend&nbsp;
comes running to the alley he swiftly kicks the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.120
bully away and tends to steve who is annoyed the&nbsp;
bucky showed up and got rid of the bully just as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.760
steve got his second wind bucky is now an enlisted&nbsp;
man his application was accepted and he's been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.560
assigned to the 107th infantry in a celebratory&nbsp;
mood bucky invites steve to go dancing with a pair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.760
of girls on a double date bashfully steve tags&nbsp;
along the forehead to the world's fair in queens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.440
while bucky canoodles with his dates steve watches&nbsp;
as playboy inventor howard stark unsuccessfully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.360
demonstrates a flying car steve breaks away from&nbsp;
the group and goes to another recruiting station&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.120
bucky catches up with him and asks how steve&nbsp;
intends to forge his application this time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.240
unbeknownst to them both dr abraham&nbsp;
erskine while passing by eavesdrops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.080
on their conversation he is fascinated by the&nbsp;
gumption of steve bucky wishes steve good luck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.800
on his latest application and steve heads into&nbsp;
the recruiting station for his fifth physical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.800
inside steve sits on an examination table&nbsp;
and grows nervous when an mp enters the room&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.880
and is soon followed by doctor or skin dr erskine&nbsp;
has all of steve's prior applications on file&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.520
concerned by steve's failed applications erskine&nbsp;
tests his character by asking if his insistence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.840
on applying for military service is driven purely&nbsp;
by a desire to kill nazis the young man sincerely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.120
reveals that he is not a killer at heart but&nbsp;
does not like bullies regardless of their origin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.920
he also shows little concern when erxine&nbsp;
reveals that he is german by birth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.600
won over by steve strong will and unwavering&nbsp;
conviction irkseen accepts his latest application&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.200
in a secret military installation high in the&nbsp;
alps johann schmidt brings the glowing cube&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.680
to dr arnamzola his hydra weapons specialist the&nbsp;
cube's seemingly limitless power enables schmidt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.080
and dr zola to power unstoppable energy guns&nbsp;
and cannons meanwhile steve has been enlisted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.600
into basic training under the careful watch of dr&nbsp;
erskine and colonel chester phillips he and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.120
platoon are told that they are candidates for the&nbsp;
government's latest super soldier program phillips&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.120
is unimpressed with steve then is vexed by dr&nbsp;
erskine's interest in him during basic training&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.360
steve meets a beautiful but driven british officer&nbsp;
peggy carter who seems to pity him despite being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.960
the smallest and weakest of the platoon steve&nbsp;
demonstrates the greatest spirit selflessness and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.040
ingenuity especially when his platoon are charged&nbsp;
with retrieving a flag from the top of a tall pole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.880
as the other more fit men in the company fail the&nbsp;
task one by one as they try to climb up the pole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.000
steve casually pulls the pin holding it up taking&nbsp;
the flag when the pole crashes to the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.800
phillips still unconvinced tosses a grenade into&nbsp;
the group during calisthenics and they all scatter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.240
phillips is surprised when steve alone leaps on&nbsp;
top of it willing to sacrifice himself to save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.240
the others before discovering that the grenade was&nbsp;
a dummy phillips concedes to erskine's decision&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.560
that evening dr erskine speaks with steve&nbsp;
the two bond over a bottle of schnapps and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.520
dr erskine reveals that this is not his&nbsp;
first time performing this experiment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:53.520
he tells a story of how prior to his emigration to&nbsp;
the u.s he was ordered by johann schmidt to create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:59.520
a serum that would give a man god-like strength dr&nbsp;
erskine created an early version of the serum he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.520
intends to use on steve only when schmidt injected&nbsp;
himself his body's skin corroded away leaving him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.360
as a sinewy red skeleton undeterred by the risk&nbsp;
steve agrees to follow through with the procedure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.120
the following morning steve and peggy win their&nbsp;
way through brooklyn for the procedure along the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.800
way steve points out various parts in brooklyn&nbsp;
where he's been beaten up she asks him why he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.960
never ran away he responds that running away&nbsp;
in his mind was an invitation for further abuse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.240
the two enter the antique shop exchange&nbsp;
passcodes with an old woman manning the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.880
register and descend into a secret&nbsp;
military bunker concealed within&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.000
peggy leads steve to the heart of the bunker where&nbsp;
they find dr erskine preparing a medical capsule&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.880
along with howard stark and colonel phillips&nbsp;
rubbing elbows with senators and dignitaries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:55.120
steve is told to remove his shirt and sit in the&nbsp;
capsule stark describes that the procedure will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.920
first mean injecting muscle regenerators into&nbsp;
roger's major muscle groups which will then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.920
be bombarded with vita rays er skin has made no&nbsp;
secret of the pain steve will endure but promises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:12.160
he'll come out stronger carter bid steve goodluck&nbsp;
and joins phillips in the overhead viewing chamber&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:18.400
erskine serum is injected into steve's muscles&nbsp;
and steve is enclosed within the vita ray capsule&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.560
the capsule glows brightly steve yells in pain&nbsp;
but also tells them to continue and the procedure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.400
is quickly completed when the capsule is shut&nbsp;
down steve comes out a foot taller and a hundred&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:36.000
pounds heavier with solid muscle which is just the&nbsp;
most superficial aspects of his body artificially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.560
raised to the maximum human potential everybody&nbsp;
including phillips celebrates the success of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:48.480
procedure and descends from the viewing chamber&nbsp;
to congratulate your skin alone dignitary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:54.720
in actuality a german spy named heinz krueger&nbsp;
stays behind placing a small satchel on a chair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:01.440
moments later the viewing gallery explodes krueger&nbsp;
descends the stairs and fatally shoots dr erskine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:08.080
twice he swiftly kills the guards and flees onto&nbsp;
the streets with peggy in hot pursuit steve tends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.920
to a dying doctor skin who has just enough energy&nbsp;
to point to steve's heart before he dies in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:20.400
street peggy pursues kruger and easily kills his&nbsp;
getaway driver krueger steals a taxi and aims to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:26.720
run over peggy steve arrives in the nick of time&nbsp;
saving her from being killed by the oncoming taxi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.040
steve pursues the taxi on foot running faster than&nbsp;
a normal human can and not suffering the fatigue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.720
even a healthy man would displaying superhuman&nbsp;
agility he leaps onto the roof of the taxi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.320
dodges krueger's gunfire and the two come to a&nbsp;
crashing stop at the brooklyn docks krueger shoots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.680
at steve who holds the star imprinted door of the&nbsp;
wrecked cab in front of him as a shield krueger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:56.560
flees to his hydra sub which dives underwater just&nbsp;
as steve arrives steve dives after the sub punches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:02.000
a hole through the cockpit's glass and yanks&nbsp;
krueger to the surface krueger tells steve that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.400
he is the first of many that rogers can cut off&nbsp;
one head but two more take its place he then kills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:14.320
himself with a cyanide capsule hidden in a fake&nbsp;
tooth letting out one last hylhydra before dying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.720
meanwhile schmidt and dr zolo are visited by&nbsp;
a trio of hitler's top commanders tasked with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:26.640
inspecting schmidt's operation they're ridiculed&nbsp;
schmidt saying that the nazi party no longer takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:32.080
him and hydra seriously due to his obsession with&nbsp;
magic and the occult and playfully refer to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.600
as the red skull a name that infuriates schmidt&nbsp;
schmidt takes the three to his weapons lab where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:43.840
they are shown his unstoppable energy weapons and&nbsp;
a strategic map of europe dotted with targets one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:49.360
of the three notices a target hovering over berlin&nbsp;
and confronts schmidt schmidt quickly vaporizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:55.680
the three nazi officers schmidt announces that&nbsp;
hydra has disbanded from the nazi party and is now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:02.000
enemies with the world the following day phillips&nbsp;
and carter pick up the remains of dr erskine's lap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.440
both are despondent because the only person&nbsp;
capable of producing the serum was erskine himself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.400
steve is eager to go the front lines of the&nbsp;
european theater but phillips would rather he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:18.080
be a lab rat than a soldier in his army steve is&nbsp;
approached by a senator holding a newspaper of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.440
prior day's events emblazoned with a front-page&nbsp;
photo of steve chasing down hines krueger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.040
steve has become an overnight celebrity and&nbsp;
the senator has an idea that will be mutually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:36.000
beneficial steve is enlisted in the uso united&nbsp;
service organizations and travels around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.240
midwest promoting war bonds and performing musical&nbsp;
numbers in a shoddy red white and blue costume&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.920
while carrying a triangle-shaped shield bearing&nbsp;
the stars and stripes he takes on the name captain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:53.680
america and the show includes a theme song written&nbsp;
specifically for him features dancing girls and a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:59.840
short segment where he punches out hitler played&nbsp;
by an actor captain america becomes an overnight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:06.240
success spawning comic books and black and white&nbsp;
movies his antics drum up revenue for the uso&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.920
steve is soon taken overseas to italy where&nbsp;
he is to continue entertaining the troops&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:18.080
upon his arrival the surly and war-torn&nbsp;
men tease him and tell him to get lost he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:23.680
is soon met by carter who along with phillips&nbsp;
is overseeing european theater of the war she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:30.000
tells him that the men are unhappy because many&nbsp;
men from their division the 107th infantry have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.400
been killed in battle steve realizes that this is&nbsp;
bucky's division and quickly runs to see phillips&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.600
phillips is unable to find bucky's name on his&nbsp;
casualty list and tell steve to go back to his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:48.400
job as a movie star and a cheerleader steve asks&nbsp;
carter where the men and bucky are being held she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:55.040
shows him a map and a known hydra weapons factory&nbsp;
30 to 40 miles behind enemy lines steve hastily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:00.720
pulls on a pair of army trousers and leather&nbsp;
jacket over his captain america costume he aims to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:07.520
steal a jeep and drive into hydra's backyard but&nbsp;
she has a better idea howard stark flies them both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:13.760
over the battlefield in his private plane steve&nbsp;
surmises that stark and carter have a relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:19.120
and bashfully withholds his feelings for&nbsp;
her just as anti-aircraft guns from hydra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:25.040
begin firing on stark's plane steve parachutes&nbsp;
in while the other two escape back to safety&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:31.920
inside schmidt and zolo are manufacturing enough&nbsp;
weapons to wipe out every capital in the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.680
steve stealthily makes his way into the hydra&nbsp;
base taking out numerous guards in the process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:44.320
steve makes his way to the holding cells where&nbsp;
he sees some of the imprisoned men from the 107th&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.920
he frees the men and tells them to make a messy&nbsp;
exit under the leadership of the howling commandos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:55.840
the prisoners managed to overpower their captors&nbsp;
steal guns and tanks and escape from the facility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:02.240
destroying much of it schmidt watches steve by&nbsp;
cctv and quickly realizes that he must be your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:09.360
skin's man he quickly activates several explosive&nbsp;
charges that will level the base steve makes his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.560
way through the facility and happens across with&nbsp;
bucky who is tied down to an operating table&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:20.720
and has quite obviously been tortured steve also&nbsp;
notices an oversized tactical map mounted on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:27.680
wall with various marked installations steve frees&nbsp;
bucky who is surprised to see that steve is taller&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:33.520
than him and commits the map to memory the two&nbsp;
head up the catwalks and find themselves face to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:39.840
face with schmidt on a retractable bridge rogers&nbsp;
punches schmidt who surprisingly stands his ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:45.680
schmidt plays with his face which has apparently&nbsp;
come free from his skull and quickly peels it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:51.920
away as a mask the red skull stares back at&nbsp;
rogers and bucky and swiftly enters an elevator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:57.360
in the elevator the red skull tells arnhem zola&nbsp;
to meet him at another one of hydra's bases and to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:03.440
take his car the red skull escapes the exploding&nbsp;
facility in a strangely designed private plane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.800
while zola sneaks away in schmidt's roadster&nbsp;
inside steve and bucky have a huge divide&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:14.560
to cross to their freedom bucky crosses a&nbsp;
trembling buckling support beam and manages to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:20.480
cross to safety moments before the beam plummets&nbsp;
into the fire below left with no other option&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:27.520
steve backs up as far as he can and leaps over&nbsp;
the burning chasm back at the 107th base camp&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:33.360
phillips dictates a letter to his typist telling&nbsp;
how rogers disappeared the prior night and likely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.880
perished during the battle at that phillips&nbsp;
berates agent carter for causing this loss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:44.560
and notes that unlike the indispensable stark&nbsp;
she herself can be punished carter attempts to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:50.800
justify her actions but phillips bluntly dismisses&nbsp;
her opinions considering that the loss of rogers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:56.800
the only successful test subject of project&nbsp;
rebirth would be ample justification to close&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:04.240
down their organization just then rogers arrives&nbsp;
with nearly 400 survivors of the 107th carrying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.840
samples of the red skulls technology including&nbsp;
some combat vehicles leaving the base in a fervor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.680
rogers submits himself to phillips for&nbsp;
disciplinary action for going out in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:20.160
direct violation of orders but is forgiven at&nbsp;
this success bucky calls for cheers for rogers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:26.240
who has truly become captain america the news&nbsp;
of captain america's success on the battlefield&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.800
has swept over the world but rogers does&nbsp;
not appear for his medal from congress&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.080
the reason for that absence is in london&nbsp;
where steve gives phillips and carter his best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:41.920
recollection of the hydra base map and tells them&nbsp;
that he intends to go to those bases and destroy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:47.360
them one by one and wishes to recruit a team&nbsp;
of men made up of those he liberated in italy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.480
steve meets the howling commandos in a bar and&nbsp;
they eagerly accept the offer while they're all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:58.080
the men are surprised as peggy enters dressed&nbsp;
in a form-fitting cocktail dress she ignores&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:03.440
all the men including bucky and flirts with steve&nbsp;
telling him that she'd love to have a dance with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:09.520
him someday the next day steve is summoned to&nbsp;
the brooklyn bunker to see phillips and stark&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.320
steve is approached by a beautiful female officer&nbsp;
who wishes to thank him for his service the best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:20.320
way she knows how peggy walks in on steve kissing&nbsp;
the enlisted woman and angrily storms away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:26.480
steve apologetically follows her to stark's lab&nbsp;
insisting that he gets nervous around women and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:32.480
asks why he should apologize if carter and stark&nbsp;
have a thing going stark quickly shoots down the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:38.160
rumored relationship and takes steve to his&nbsp;
weapons engineering lab he remarks that rogers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:44.000
has become attached to the triangular shield&nbsp;
which steve says is a handy tool in the field&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.600
on a table are several prototype shields with&nbsp;
sophisticated components however steve finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:55.600
a plain circular shield on the lower shelf stark&nbsp;
explains that the shield is made of a metal called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:02.000
vibranium which is lighter than steel and is&nbsp;
vibration resistant and will absorb heavy impacts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
he holds the shield in front of him and asks peggy&nbsp;
for his opinion she playfully scornfully fires a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.640
clip from a .45 pistol at the shield which steve&nbsp;
ducks behind the shield passes the improvised test&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:22.160
admirably as she walks off steve passes a sketch&nbsp;
of a uniform to stark steve dresses in red white&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.840
and blue fatigues dons a blue form-fitting helmet&nbsp;
and stows the newly colored shield onto his back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:34.320
captain america and his soldiers including bucky&nbsp;
make their way across europe flattening hydra's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:40.240
bases one by one with rogers becoming quite&nbsp;
skilled at using the shield as a projectile weapon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:45.520
and also discovering that it can ricochet off&nbsp;
several surfaces and not lose any velocity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:51.920
news of his exploits reach the red skull and&nbsp;
zola the skull is furious referring to rogers as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:57.040
a simpleton with a shield and murders the last&nbsp;
man alive at one of his destroyed facilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.880
high in the alps steve and his men have&nbsp;
a mission to capture zola in his personal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:10.160
train three members of the team cap bucky and&nbsp;
gabe jones zipline across a massive chasm and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:16.640
storm the train car by car soon cap and bucky&nbsp;
are cornered by heavily armed hydra soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:22.400
they narrowly defeat the soldiers however bucky&nbsp;
is tossed from the train and plummets into an icy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:30.000
river below but zola is apprehended zola while&nbsp;
in a prison cell is visited by colonel phillips&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.840
who brings him a steak dinner zola rejects&nbsp;
the meal convinced that it must be poisoned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:42.160
phillips shrugs and eats it himself he tells zola&nbsp;
that he broadcast an easily decipherable message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:48.160
which has certainly been intercepted by hydra&nbsp;
saying that zola had defected he also knows that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:53.040
zola is easy to bargain with since he's the sole&nbsp;
hydra agent they've captured who hasn't taken his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:59.040
cyanide capsule to avoid disclosing information&nbsp;
zola fearing that the lie will result in his death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:04.560
by the red skull gives in to phillips and tells&nbsp;
him information of the red skull's only remaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:10.640
hydra base rogers selves in a war-ravaged&nbsp;
bar carter arrives and comforts steve over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:17.040
the loss of his best friend steve realizes that&nbsp;
dr erskine's serum rapidly regrows dead cells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.400
making it impossible for him to get drunk the&nbsp;
two flirt a bit and talk about having a dance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:28.720
once again rogers and his team prepare a battle&nbsp;
plan to take down red skull at his headquarters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:35.680
rogers dressed in a new uniform mounts a harley&nbsp;
and charges the base he easily dodges hydra&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:42.000
soldiers and tanks and finds himself within the&nbsp;
base surrounded by a hydra army he is taken into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.840
custody and led to the red skull's private weapons&nbsp;
lab red skull asks what makes steve so special&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.920
steve says nothing i'm just a kid from&nbsp;
brooklyn moments before members of his team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:53.920 --> 00:21:00.560
zip line into red skull's office a climatic&nbsp;
fire fight ensues as hundreds of soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:05.280
under the direction of phillips and carter&nbsp;
storm the base killing many hydra soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:11.680
red skull flees to his private hangar in which&nbsp;
a gigantic flying wing powered by the tesseract&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:17.680
is preparing for takeoff steve attempts to&nbsp;
catch up with the plane on foot but is unable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:23.120
phillips and carter arrive in the skulls roadster&nbsp;
and the three take off after the plane just as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:28.480
steve is about to leap onto the plane peggy&nbsp;
stops him and kisses him steve leaps from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:34.160
roadster onto one of the plane's massive wheels&nbsp;
he sneaks into the craft where he finds dozens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:40.240
of kamikaze planes missiles each labeled with&nbsp;
a different major american city hydra soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:46.480
soon enter the room and steve battles them taking&nbsp;
out numerous men in tiny planes one of the planes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:53.440
labeled new york drops free steve takes off after&nbsp;
it and manages to commandeer the craft and crashes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.840
it back into the flying wing after throwing the&nbsp;
pilot through its rearward mounted propeller&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:04.320
inside the large cockpit captain america&nbsp;
and red skull have a fisticuffs battle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:10.400
red skull fires his cube energy pistol at steve&nbsp;
who easily deflects the shots using his shield&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:16.160
a shot is deflected into one of the cockpit center&nbsp;
consoles which contains the glowing blue cube&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:21.600
the console is damaged and skull lifts the&nbsp;
cube into the air suddenly a portal opens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:28.160
above him showing starry space the red skull&nbsp;
glows brightly and is seemingly disintegrated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:34.160
his remains are swept up into the cosmos the&nbsp;
cube still glowing brightly drops to the ground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:39.440
and burns its way down through the plains hall&nbsp;
before plummeting into the ocean below steve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:45.040
mans the plane's controls and radios carter he&nbsp;
tells her that the plane is on a flight path&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.480
that will take them to the eastern seaboard he&nbsp;
tells her that their dance will have to wait&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:56.560
he pushes the plane into a dive and crashes it&nbsp;
into a glacier below peggy can only hear static&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:03.920
steve awakens in a 1940s hospital an old-fashioned&nbsp;
radio transmits the play-by-play of a brooklyn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:09.440
dodgers game he gets up looks out the windows&nbsp;
and watches as the hospital door opens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.080
a young nurse who bears a striking resemblance to&nbsp;
peggy enters she waits for a response from steve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:23.040
who looks her over suspiciously he asks why the&nbsp;
radio is playing a game from may 1941 specifically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:28.960
a game that he knows he attended he flees the&nbsp;
building and finds himself in times square&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:36.560
circa 2011 nick fury appears and carefully speaks&nbsp;
to steve he tells him that he's been asleep in ice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:42.960
for 70 years in a state of suspended animation the&nbsp;
hospital set was meant to gradually introduce him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:49.440
to modern society still perplexed steve breathes&nbsp;
heavily and sadly tells fury that he had a date&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:54.480
as he realizes everyone else he used to know&nbsp;
in the 1940s is long dead or very old now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:00.800
in a post-credits scene steve is in an&nbsp;
old-fashioned gym he pummels a punching bag so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:06.720
hard that he knocks it off its chain and sends&nbsp;
it flying across the room fury enters the gym&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:12.960
and asks steve if he's had trouble sleeping steve&nbsp;
cynically asks if fury has come with another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:18.880
mission fury replies that it is affirmative&nbsp;
suddenly we see images of all the superheroes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:24.880
who include steve or captain america thor&nbsp;
tony stark or iron man hawkeye black widow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:30.640
bruce banner the incredible hulk and other shield&nbsp;
agents preparing for battle fury tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:36.320
they're up his personal mission to build an army&nbsp;
of superheroes is complete previewing the avengers
