00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.020
Welcome Back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.400
Today I will show you a horror, mystery film
from 2019, titled Midsommar.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.420
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.320
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.509
Dani is worried about her parents who aren't
picking up their phone.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.930
She sits at her computer, rereading her sister's
ominous message, suspicious about what she

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.160
means by it.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.720
Unsure of what to do, Dani calls her boyfriend
for reassurance.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.460
He tells her that she's putting too much thought
into her sister's email and that it's probably

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.390
another grab for attention.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.949
She's a little upset because it sounds like
he doesn't understand that her sister is bipolar.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.530
Even though Dani is in tears, she still agrees
with his opinion.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.050
After that call, she paces around her apartment,
talking to a friend about her boyfriend.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.340
She's worried that she's being too needy,
but her friend tells her that if he feels

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.789
that way than maybe he's not the right one.

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.030
During the call, she sends another email to
her sister.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.220
Suddenly she gets a second call from an unknown
number.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.870
Meanwhile, Dani's boyfriend Christian is out
with his friends, talking to them about her.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.440
They suggest that he should leave her because
she's too overbearing, but he worries that

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.630
if he does that he might regret it later.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.120
He suddenly gets another call from her and
leaves the table to answer.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.450
Christian picks up the phone, only to hear
her screaming and crying on the other side

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.619
of the line.

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.200
He walks to her apartment and later he's seen
comforting her, as she continues to cry uncontrollably

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.500
because her entire family died.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.940
Simultaneously, firemen are seen breaking
into her parents house.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.130
They find them dead in their own bed.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.880
Her sister has killed herself and taken them
with her.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.750
A while later, Dani is lying on her bed, depressed.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.290
Christian comes in and tells her that he'll
go to a party.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.420
She says that she'll join him, even though
he's not particularly eager about that.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.610
At the party, Dani's interest is sparked by
a conversation her boyfriend and his friends

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.820
Pelle, Josh and Mark are having about the
summer trip to Sweden the group had been planning.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.570
It's the first time she's hearing about it
and the trip is in 2 weeks.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.329
Back at her apartment, she confronts him,
asking why he didn't tell her.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.400
He tries to weasel around the issue, but Dani
doesn't understand why Christian wasn't open

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.409
with her.

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.979
She doesn't have a problem with him going
on the trip.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.530
He says he's sorry and she tells him that
she doesn't need an apology, just openness.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.090
Dani softens, worried that he'll leave, then
asks if he'll be going because of his thesis.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.229
He still doesn't know what that will be.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.930
Some time after, Christian is hanging out
with his friends and they're talking about

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:14.930
Sweden.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.750
Dani calls him, to say that she'll be up in
a moment.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.330
While waiting, Christian tells them that he
invited her on the trip, but that she won't

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.350
go, even though she said yes.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.120
They're upset with him, but promise to act
as if they knew about the invitation and as

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.710
they don't have a problem with it.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.160
Dani arrives and they all greet her nicely,
but act super awkward toward her.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.650
Mark asks Christian to join him in the other
room.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.010
Pelle chats with Dani, while Josh completely
ignores her.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.500
She asks about the week he had planned for
the group in his village, because her birthday

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.000
will be on the same day that they'll be arriving.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.090
He tells her that it's actually a 9 day festival
held by his small community.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.930
Pelle shows her some photos of previous festivities
and she's very impressed.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.500
Suddenly, he turns to her and says, with all
honesty, that he's very glad that she'll be

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.550
coming with them.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.380
He also tells her that he's very sorry about
her parents and that he can empathize, because

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.379
he had also lost his own.

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.620
Dani gets upset and runs to the bathroom.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.360
On the plane to Europe, Dani cries in the
toilet.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.770
They arrive to Sweden and drive to Pelle's
village located somewhere in the north of

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:13.780
the country.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.930
The group stops in a field where all the other
young people coming back home have gathered.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.670
Pelle is greeted by his brother Ingmar, who
introduces them to his friends Simon and Connie.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.450
Ingmar gives them some shrooms and they all
take it, even though Dani is reluctant at

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.450
first.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.650
Later, they sit under a tree and feel the
effects of the drug.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.490
Mark is not having a good time.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.470
Pelle guides them through the experience,
talking about the nature surrounding them.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.830
Dani hears distant singing and freaks out.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.610
She walks by a group of people and they all
laugh at her.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.160
Ingmar tries to calm her, but she runs to
the bathroom.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.440
Inside she has some kind of horrible hallucination,
then she dreams about her family.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.550
She wakes up and Christian tells her that
they've been waiting for her to wake up for

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.580
6 hours.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.769
The entire group of young people walk through
the woods and eventually arrive at the village,

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.939
where the people from the community welcome
them.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.250
They are already wearing their festival clothes
and playing music.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.760
Dani enjoys the serene atmosphere of the place,
smiling and taking it all in.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.760
Pelle greets one of the elders, who welcomes
them eagerly.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.000
He tells them that the official festivities
will begin the next day.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.480
Suddenly, their attention is drawn by music,
leading them to the center of the village.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.490
The elder Siv welcomes all of them to the
festival and wishes them a happy Midsommar.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.340
She says that it had been 90 years since their
last feast and that it will be 90 more until

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.380
the next one.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.490
They raise they're glasses and cheer.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.410
Simultaneously, a disabled child is shown
drawing and not participating in the ceremony.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.500
Siv passes a torch to an older woman and then
a second one to an older man, proclaiming

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.900
something to the heavens.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.580
Meanwhile, Maya is seen getting ready in a
washroom.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.070
Music starts outside and she joins the celebration.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.730
She sees the group sitting on the sidelines
as the villagers dance around them.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.919
Later, Maya kicks Christian's bottom as she
passes by him during the dance.

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.770
Him and Josh go to join in.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.259
Pelle gives Dani a gift for her birthday and
she tells him that Christian forgot about

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:00.259
it.

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:01.780
She thanks him for the portrait.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.889
After a while, Pelle gives the group a tour
around the village and answers Josh's questions

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.310
about the community.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.410
They see a few children having a lesson in
the grass and he tells them that they are

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.660
learning about the power of the ancient runes.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.139
Coney asks Dani and Christian how long they've
been together and they give a different answer.

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.870
During the tour Christian spots a building
in the distance.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.850
It's a sacred temple, which no one is allowed
to enter.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.570
The group splits up in two.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.320
Ingmar and his guests pass by a caged bear.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.190
He shows them a long parchment that tells
a love story.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.919
Pelle takes his friends to their accommodation
in a beautifully decorated cabin, which is

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.560
shared by all of the people of the community.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.229
Dani goes to look around the building and
finds a wall of photos with the May queens.

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.889
Meanwhile, Pelle tells Christian that he forgot
her birthday.

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.470
Dani asks about the wall, prompting the whole
group to come over.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.040
Christian calls her outside and starts singing
happy birthday to her, while trying to light

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.370
a birthday candle.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.470
He lies to her first, saying that he didn't
forget but got messed up because of the constant

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.470
daylight.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.440
But when she sees through him, he apologizes
and she blows out the candle.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.060
That night, everyone is preparing for bed
and Pelle tells them that the first day of

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.130
the festival is very important.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.090
Josh knows why, but neither him nor Pelle
share that with the rest of them.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.800
Christian wants to search for it, but has
no cell service.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.220
The next day, the celebration for the first
day of the festival is under way.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.930
Everyone joins the community table in front
of the sacred temple, as young girls are seen

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.110
picking flowers.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.780
Christian asks how long they will have to
stand and Pelle tells him that they'll stand

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.610
until it's right to sit.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.259
Dani comes over and gives him flowers, then
a boy rings a bell and the old couple that

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:35.390
received the torches the previous day arrive
at the table.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.260
The two of them sit down and everyone follows.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.970
Josh asks if they are the ones and Pelle confirms
it.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.080
The couple begins eating and all the others
follow again.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.070
Marks spots a girl he likes on the other side
of the table.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.180
Dani talks to one of the women who tells her
that the babies there are raised by everyone.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.300
The couple stands up and performs some kind
of ritual.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.360
Everyone stands and drinks in their honor.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.000
Then the two of them get carried away on their
chairs.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.169
All of the people follow them again, except
Mark.

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:05.090
Everyone is gathered around a large cliff,
looking up at it.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.300
They're waiting to witness the sacred custom.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.550
The couple gets carried on top of the cliff
and the distant sounds of a horn can be heard.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.169
Josh stands next to Pelle, asking if he can
read the scrolls that one of the elders is

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:16.330
reading out off.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.729
The old man and woman get their hands sliced
open and they paint their blood over some

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:21.040
ancient runes.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.520
The woman appears on the top of the cliff
first.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.770
She jumps and crashes on the ground.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.330
Dani is completely shocked.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.069
Ingmar tries to calm Simon and Connie, who
are beside themselves.

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:33.250
Then the man appears on the cliff as well.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.199
He jumps, but falls on his feet and doesn't
die.

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:38.450
He gets beaten to death with a wooden hammer.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.789
The foreigners are freaking out and Siv explains
the custom to them.

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:45.139
She wants the to understand that it as a great
joy for them and that when it's her turn it

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:47.289
will be a great joy for her too.

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:50.379
Siv says that they give their life away before
it can spoil.

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:54.169
Then she turns to Dani and says that it is
not good to dodge the inevitable, since it

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:55.660
corrupts the spirit.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.220
The community is walking back to the village
and the foreigners are running up front, with

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.410
Dani ready to fall apart.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:05.419
Christian comes back to the cabin and finds
Josh there, working on his thesis.

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:09.139
He tells him that he's decided to make his
thesis on the village as well.

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:13.289
Josh is angry because Christian already knew
he was going to write his thesis on the Midsommar

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:14.289
festival.

00:08:14.289 --> 00:08:17.300
He tells him to find his own subject and passion,
not take his.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.700
But Christian is adamant, he offers him to
collaborate on the thesis or do separate ones

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.250
on the same subject.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.950
Josh goes to talk to Pelle immediately, but
he tells him that it doesn't matter what either

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.599
of them want to write about because the elders
are very protective of their rituals and they

00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:32.870
won't allow them to write about the village.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.159
He tells him that he'll talk to the elders
to get him off his back.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:40.330
Meanwhile, Dani is packing franticly, but
Pelle comes over to talk to her.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.540
He apologizes, saying that he wanted to share
this experience with his friends.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.430
She tells him that she doesn't understand
anything and Pelle says that he was most excited

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.710
for her to come.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.290
He tells her that he understands what she's
been going through, because he lost his parents

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:54.740
in a fire when he was young.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.709
Yet he found a new family in the community
and he wants to give that to her, because

00:08:58.709 --> 00:09:00.550
she deserves a real family.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.980
Later that day, the bodies of the old couple
get disposed off in a ritual way.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.140
Christian checks on Dani, but she asks if
he was even disturbed by what they saw.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.770
He says that he was, but that it's a matter
of cultural differences and that they should

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.390
try to acclimate to the ways of the community.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.570
That night she asks Josh for a sleeping pill,
but she still gest woken up by noises in the

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.920
middle of the night.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.050
All of the beds around her are empty, so she
follows a few people outside.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.410
Then she sees Christian and his friends leave.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.820
She screams and images from the ritual appear
in her mind, one after the other, until an

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.670
image of her family appears in the foot of
the cliff.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.500
She's actually having a nightmare.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.360
Maya is actually awake.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.670
She goes over to Christian's bed and places
something under it.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.110
Josh sees her do that.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.820
On the second day of the festival, Dani is
the only one to sleep late.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.460
Pelle is gardening when Mark and Josh approach
him.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.480
He tells Josh that he can write his thesis,
but that he can't use any real names or the

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.500
location.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.790
He also has to collaborate with Christian.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.529
Josh asks him about the thing that Maya left
underneath Christian's bed and Pelle tells

00:10:00.529 --> 00:10:02.250
him that it's a love rune.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.680
Christian joins them and Pelle gives him the
news about the thesis and tells him that Maya

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.190
seems to like him.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.550
Suddenly, they hear a man screaming and running
toward Mark, who's taking a piss over a dead

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:12.550
tree.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:17.070
The man goes after him, but the others stop
him, as Pelle takes Mark to the side and explains

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.459
that he peed on the ancestral tree that has
a lot of meaning for them.

00:10:20.459 --> 00:10:24.070
Connie runs into the cabin and tells Dani
that her and Simon are leaving.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:27.540
One of the elders comes over and tells her
that her fiancée has already left and that

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.399
he'll meet her on the train station.

00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:32.550
She can't believe that he would leave her
and gets horribly upset.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:36.640
Dani tells Christian about Simon, but he doesn't
seem terribly concerned and continues his

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.740
conversation about approval of mates within
the community.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.390
The man tells him that they often need to
invite people from the outside.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.070
Dani gets invited by one of the women to cook
with them.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.019
She gives her an apron and they tell her that
they are making meat tarts.

00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:51.170
Maya makes a special one.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.310
Meanwhile, Josh has a conversation with one
of the elders about their sacred scrolls.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:59.540
The scrolls always have blank pages near the
end, because they are ever changing.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.360
Their last iteration is written by the disabled
child.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.320
He draws on the blank pages and the elders
interpret it.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.860
The elder tells him that all of their oracles
are deliberate products of inbreeding, so

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.760
that they have unclouded minds open for the
source.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.579
Mark lurks around the sacred temple, looking
for the girl he likes, when a child calls

00:11:15.579 --> 00:11:16.850
him for dinner.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.680
They get served meat pies.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.510
Dani asks if anyone has seen Connie and one
of the villagers tells her that he drove her

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.519
to meet Simon at the station.

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:27.810
Dani doesn't understand how he could've left
her like that and comments that she could

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.440
see Christian doing that.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.070
The man that got upset about Mark pissing
on the tree is still angry about it.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.060
Josh and Christian argue as well.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:39.269
He takes a bite out of the pie and finds a
pubic hair in it, then looks at Maya.

00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:41.710
Mark gets called away by the girl that he
likes.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.850
That night, Danni asks Josh for another sleeping
pill.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:48.690
Later, he runs over to the cabin where the
scroll is kept and starts taking pictures

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:49.710
of it.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:53.600
Mark catches him doing it, but as Josh moves
closer to him he sees that there is something

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.600
wrong.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.610
Suddenly, he gets hit over the head.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:00.230
The disabled child approaches the unconscious
Josh wearing Mark's face.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.889
Christian wakes up the next day and sees that
Josh is gone from his bed.

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:08.610
At breakfast Dani asks about Mark and Josh,
but he says that he's not too concerned.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.310
One of the elders proclaims that the scroll
had been stolen and asks that it gets returned

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.310
safely.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:17.310
After breakfast, two of the elders approach
Christian and Dani, saying that it's suspicious

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.899
that two of their friends ended up missing
the same day.

00:12:19.899 --> 00:12:24.410
Christian throws Josh under the bus, but Pelle
says that he feels responsible.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.010
Dani is sent off with the other women and
Christian has to go to meet with Siv.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:32.230
A special tea gets prepared for the young
women of the village, which Dani drinks as

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:33.230
well.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.800
The ritual which they call the competition
is about to begin, when Dani realizes that

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.070
the tea probably had mushrooms in it.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.620
An older woman proclaims the beginning of
the competition and the women start dancing

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.670
in a circle.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:48.019
Meanwhile, Christian is at Siv's home looking
at the iconography on her walls.

00:12:48.019 --> 00:12:51.720
They sit opposite one another and she immediately
tells him that he had been approved to mate

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.860
with Maya.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.329
The women continue dancing and one by one
drop down and out of the competition.

00:12:57.329 --> 00:13:00.220
Christian joins the crowd that watches the
dance and one of the women gives him some

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.709
of the mushroom tea.

00:13:01.709 --> 00:13:03.730
He glances at Maya and drinks it.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:08.710
Meanwhile, Dani keeps getting dizzy while
dancing, but she doesn't stop or fall over.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.450
Only three of them are left, when she suddenly
starts speaking in Swedish with one of the

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:13.480
other girls.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.829
As they laugh and dance, the other two run
into each other.

00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:18.820
Dani is the only one left.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.519
Everyone stands up and circles her.

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:22.839
The older woman crowns her as the May queen.

00:13:22.839 --> 00:13:27.230
She gets her picture taken and as they walk
her away, Pelle comes over and kisses her.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.890
They lift her in the air and take her to the
table.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.899
Dani sits at the head and everyone follows
her every move.

00:13:32.899 --> 00:13:37.020
When Christian sits down, she begins to eat
and everyone else does as well.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.680
He doesn't understand what's happening and
starts feeling the effects of the tea.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.139
The entire village cheers for the May queen.

00:13:43.139 --> 00:13:45.410
They tell her that she's part of the family
now.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:49.010
Maya calls Christian to follow her into the
barn and Dani notices that there's something

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:50.200
happening.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.699
Siv tells Dani that she has to bless their
crops as the queen and doesn't allow Christian

00:13:53.699 --> 00:13:55.029
to come with her.

00:13:55.029 --> 00:13:58.850
She enters a carriage, being pulled by some
of the young women from the village.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.820
As she's driven away, Christian gets asked
to go to the barn again as the rest of he

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.399
villagers stand for him.

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:08.389
Dani blesses the crops in a traditional ritual,
while Christian is being prepared by the elders

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:09.899
to mate with Maya.

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:13.269
They drug him again and lead him in, where
the girl is waiting for him together with

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:14.550
other women.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.130
Dani is still performing the blessing ritual.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.820
Christian makes love to Maya as the other
women sing to her and to him as well.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:24.540
The May queen comes back to the village and
one of the women tells her that Siv is expecting

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:25.540
her.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.589
She hears something happening in the barn
and goes to check what it is, regardless of

00:14:28.589 --> 00:14:30.570
the woman's pleads not to.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:35.020
Dani peaks inside and sees what is happening,
the goes outside and starts screaming.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.570
The women take her away and get her to her
bed.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:40.949
She freaks out and the other women start mimicking
her cries.

00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:44.320
Christian is done with his part of the ritual
and storms out of the barn.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.670
He gets confused and disoriented, trying to
run away, when he sees a foot planted in the

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:49.820
garden.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.519
Christian hides in a shed where he finds Simon's
dead body.

00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:55.260
An elder sneaks up on him and drugs him again.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.760
He gets woken up by a woman who tells him
that he can't speak or move.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.279
The final Midsommar ritual begins, with Dani
at its head.

00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:06.880
Siv proclaims that 9 sacrifices will be made
to the village - 4 of their own, 4 foreigners

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.860
and one chosen by the queen.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.550
Two of their own have already given their
lives and two have volunteered, one of which

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.769
is Ingmar.

00:15:13.769 --> 00:15:16.160
Pelle is honored for bringing them new blood.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.360
Dani has to choose the last of the nine.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.470
It is between a local and Christian.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.850
She makes her choice.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:25.380
The bodies are being taken to the sacred temple
at the foot of the village and are carefully

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.750
placed inside.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.870
The final is being prepared by the elders
and a few children.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:33.769
They open up the bear's body and place Christian
inside of it, still alive.

00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:36.860
The elders bless the offering and give the
two villagers drugs.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.880
The temple is ritually set on fire as the
entire community is gathered outside witnessing

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.190
the offering.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:46.040
Everything inside gets burned away and the
villagers convulse and cry, feeling the pain

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:52.690
of their people inside.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:57.090
The May queen looks onto the burning temple
and cracks a final grin.
