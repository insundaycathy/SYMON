00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.220
In an abandoned house, there are two drunk
homeless men arguing about their miserable

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.220
life.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.590
All of a sudden, the ground becomes shaking.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.160
A human in a radiation suit comes up as the
floor splits out, saying “I come in peace”.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.580
The two men are shocked and stunned.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.210
Who is that man?

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.830
Why does he come from the underground?

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.160
This is Movie Shortens.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
Follow us to the movie titled: Blast from
the past.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.980
Beware, there are spoilers.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.189
Now, let’s begin!

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.200
As the Soviet Union approaches, every household
in the United States is encouraged to construct

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.809
a secret fallout shelter during the year 1962.

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.890
Dr Calvin Webber is one of them.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.480
He built a bomb shelter in the backyard.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.739
During the Cuban missile crisis, he believes
that the issues are going to escalate.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.270
He then takes his pregnant wife, Helen, into
the shelter.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.989
At that moment, the pilot of a plane flying
overhead loses control, and the plane crashes

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.329
into their home.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.160
Calvin assumes the bombing has come exactly
as he estimated.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.180
The shelter's locks, which were designed not
to open for 35 years, are activated automatically

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.479
soon after that.

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.920
Calvin decides to spend the next 35 years
in this steel bunker to wait out the half-life

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.220
of radioactive contamination.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.960
The authorities and neighbors believe that
the Webbers were killed in the crash.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.560
Meanwhile underground, Calvin assists Helen
in giving birth to their baby boy Adam in

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.630
the shelter.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.590
He applies the knowledge he has self-prepared
in advance.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.049
Calvin is a genius because he transformed
the base into a fully functional area.

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.259
They have everything from electricity, TV
reruns, even plants.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.320
There is also a huge mall and a fish tank
in the shelter, offering the family enough

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.840
food for years.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.850
Adam is nursed in the love of his parents
day by day.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.850
In 1965, a cafe is built above the shelter.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.360
Meanwhile, Adam starts to dream about life
on the surface.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.890
Calvin teaches him science, martial arts,
sports and even politics.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.710
Helen, on the other hand, shares more social
skills to the boy including dancing, gentle

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.770
manners, and appealing girls.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.920
In 1975, the cafe is turned into a pizzeria.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.340
Down the ground, Calvin teaches Adam about
stock markets and different languages.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.319
Adam appears to be a prodigy with a great
sense of humor.

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.280
Calvin gives Adam his baseball cards, which
apparently are limited back in the time.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.110
Finally, the year of 1997 has come after 35
year hidden.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.410
The shelter facility experience dramatically
degraded.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.660
The auto-lock mode is also switched off.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.660
The family shares the great moment together
after all these years, getting ready to go

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.330
up on the surface.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.409
On a normal day on the surface, the ground
suddenly becomes shaking.

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.140
The two homeless men think of it as another
Earthquake.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.900
However, Calvin comes up as planned from the
ground in a radiation suit.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.810
His arrival shocks the homeless men.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.360
Calvin can’t believe his house has changed
to an abandoned bar.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.930
He sees in the present world strangely alters
to something he can’t imagine before.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.250
He encounters many questionable people and
events as he returns to the surface.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.580
Later at the base, Calvin tells Helen and
Adam that the humans were irradiated mutants.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.610
The ground world is still dangerous to risk
coming back.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.909
Calvin decides to stay in the bunker.

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.489
This turns Helen crazy.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.610
She strongly objects to staying in the shelter
any longer.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.660
Calvin suddenly has a heart attack and becomes
seriously ill.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.159
At the same time, the supplies are running
out.

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.400
Helen thinks it is better to send Adam to
the ground and buy everything they need.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.730
Adam packs everything to leave the shelter
for the very first time.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.379
Calvin reminds Adam not to visit the adult
bookstore because it contains unseen toxic

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.379
gas.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.070
Adam comes up in the homeless man’s surprise
again.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.790
Adam is very excited to see the real sky for
the very first time.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.660
When passing the adult store, Adam gets panicked
and quickly stays away from it, thinking it

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.150
toxic as told.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.980
On the bus, Adam continues to speak from his
taught knowledge, but that obviously doesn't

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.379
seem normal to the present life.

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.600
People think he's crazy and give him an irritated
look.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.879
Adam finally arrives at the grocery store.

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.560
A butcher who thinks that if Adam places a
large order, he can deliver it to Adam’s

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.560
house.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.159
At this point, Adam realizes that he has forgotten
the way home.

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:08.860
Adam gets lost in the city.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.709
He keeps looking for the abandoned house where
his shelter is located.

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.290
As running out of cash, Adam thinks it is
a good idea to sell his father's classic baseball

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.290
cards.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.350
The shop owner learns Adam is a silly man
who offers the valuable cards for a surprisingly

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.820
cheap price.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.060
Adam meets Eva, a shop’s assistant.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.750
Eva helps Adam to expose the cheat owner.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:35.970
She tells Adam that each of his cards costs
at least $6000, not $500 for the whole box.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.100
Adam soon has a crush on Eva.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.820
Eva then takes Adam out of the store and quits
her boring job.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.850
When talking with Adam, he tells Eva that
he comes from Alaska.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.670
Unaware of the value of money, Adam offers
two rare cards so Eva can drive him to the

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.320
hotel, where his mother told him to stay.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.660
The following day, Eva decides to return the
cards to Adam, feeling guilty.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.770
Adam asks Eva to help him buy supplies in
two weeks.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.160
She’ll earn $1000/week.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.110
Adam quickly has strong chemistry with Eva,
but she keeps ignoring him.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.870
Everyday, Eva and Adam purchase the goods
as Helen listed.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.030
Adam is supposed to store the supplies for
two years.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.030
He also asks Eve to help him find a wife.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.560
That woman should be in Pasadena, California,
and based on his mother's advice, a Pasadena’s

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.560
woman is not a mutation.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.200
To get a wife, Adam is taught to drive a car.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.030
Eva also asks her gay friend called Troy to
provide Adam advice about fashion for makeover.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.610
Eva and Troy take Adam out for the skating,
which Adam has been longing for in the shelter.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.440
Next, Adam has a chance to swim in the sea
for the first time.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.560
He also watches a real baseball game in reality.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.080
Even a rain seems to be a miracle to Adam.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.930
When Eve agrees to be his first best friend,
Adam embraces her with appreciation.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.510
At night, Eva and Troy take Adam to a disco
where Adam is supposed to get a wife.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.840
Charming Adam soon finds a woman and starts
to chit-chat with her in French.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.880
This irritates Eva although she keeps a distance
with Adam so far.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.300
Adam wows the crowd with his dancing talent.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.780
Jealous, Eve reunites with ex-boyfriend Cliff.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.850
Adam interrupts the two which provokes Cliff
to attack Adam.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.770
Now Adam has a chance to show his boxing skills,
which he was trained by his father every day.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.520
Cliff gives up and leaves.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.860
Later, she abandons Adam at the bar to go
home.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.670
When Troy arrives home without Adam, Eva becomes
worried.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.780
She rushes out to look for Adam, thinking
that he might get lost again.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.430
However, Adam appears and scares Eva, making
her hurt in the knee.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.000
While taking care of Eva’s injury, the two
confess their feelings to each other.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.690
Adam tells Eva that he politely rejected those
women's requests because he could only think

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:45.930
of Eva.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.000
Adam has his first kiss in life.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.600
He decides to reveal his true identity to
Eva, telling her about his family and their

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.220
life in the shelter.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.990
Adam hopes to take Eva to the bomb shelter
and live with his family.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.670
However, Eva thinks Adam makes up the story
like a mad man.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.270
She sends Adam to the hotel after that.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.860
The day after, Adam finally finds the abandoned
bar where his shelter bases.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.800
He quickly arrives at Eva's house to let her
know.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.590
Here, Eva introduces Adam to a psychological
doctor, thinking Adam is under a mental problem.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.090
Adam sadly says goodbye to Eva and Troy.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:25.190
However, Adam quickly escapes from the doctors,
asking Eve and Troy to collect his belongings

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.240
and pay the hotel bill.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.710
Adam reunites with his parents in the bunker
after two weeks away.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.830
The homeless man follows him, saying that
he would help Adam to load the supplies down

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:35.830
in the shelter.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.380
Later, other homeless people join in to carry
the goods down before Adam gets caught to

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.390
the mental center.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:46.140
At Adam’s hotel room, Troy and Eva realize
Adam is not a crazy man.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.150
They find his things are actually from the
60s.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.790
Troy also finds valuable stock certificates
from IBM.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.410
The true values are millions in the present.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.760
Adam was telling the truth the whole time.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.580
Troy takes Eva to the place where Adam passed
by this morning, hoping to meet Adam again.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.080
However, they can’t find him.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.820
When leaving, Eva accidentally sees Adam again,
who is rushing to the shelter.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.660
They embrace and kiss.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.360
At the moment, Calvin prepares to lock his
family inside again for 10 more years.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.680
Adam takes Eva to see his parents.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.450
Eva soon gets along well with Adam’s family.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.550
Adam tells his parents that he needs to arrange
things with Eva before coming back to the

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.550
underground.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.540
Calvin and Helen agree to let the shelter
lock for two months.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.260
During this time, Adam and Eve sell his father’s
stocks.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.180
Later, he builds his parents a new home in
the country.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:40.990
It is identical to their house that was destroyed
in 1962.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.580
Adam reveals there was never an atomic war.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:47.280
There wasn't any bombing and instead was a
plane that had crashed into their house, and

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.150
the Soviet Union actually collapsed.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:54.180
However, being unconvinced, Calvin plans to
build a new fallout shelter while Eve watches

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.470
him and plays with her engagement ring.
