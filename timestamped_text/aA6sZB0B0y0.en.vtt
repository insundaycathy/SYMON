00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.720
Welcome to the breakdown where we breakdown
all the messed-up shit!

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.051
Today we are looking at Pulse released in
2001 directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa.

00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:20.050
Kurosawa brings us a ghost story in which
two young and lonely individuals are contacted

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.180
and haunted by spiritual phenomena that uses
the internet or technology in general as an

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.180
outlet!

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.860
Now honestly this isn't the kind of disturbing
that we usually dive into, but it's a little

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.910
disturbing in its own way.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.760
Another reason we are talking about Pulse
today is because we are doing our first collaboration

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.930
with another channel!

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.650
We are lucky enough to be able to cover Pulse
alongside Cinema Nippon, the channel that

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.850
creates critical reviews of various Japanese
films.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
We would both love it if after you see this
video, you could check out their installment

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.690
of Pulse to view an excellent explanation
of Kiyoshi Kurosawa, the film and what Kurosawa

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.110
was communicating beneath the frames.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.930
So, Pulse is a ghost horror story contemplating
eternal loneliness!

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.979
As usual, if you want to see what happens,
including all the messed-up parts, stay tuned

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.820
for the breakdown!

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.391
Pulse begins with people on a ship!

00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:30.780
A storm seems to be on the way, but this girl
here stares blankly in the distance.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.870
Let's start from the beginning with what she
is contemplating.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.420
That girl is named Kudo Michi, and she works
alongside Sasano Junko and Toshio Yabe.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.950
They work with someone else too, but he didn't
come to work today!

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.390
Or in the past week!

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.430
He's been taking some time off, and Junko
is quite worried!

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.870
Their coworker Taguchi is working on a computer
disk and they need it soon, so our main girl

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.350
Michi decides to roll up to his apartment
to check on him!

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.900
Pretty empty bus, and environment in general!

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.800
Fine ass Michi walks up on Taguchi's door
but looks like the entire room needs to be

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.800
restarted!

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.950
No answer, so she finds his spare key and
lets herself in and gathers evidence for the

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.549
upcoming class trial.

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:19.099
I mean she's looking for the computer disk
and her coworker but looks like he's cryptically

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.879
taking a view out the window!

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.769
Other than being a little awkward, he seems
to be just fine and lets her know the computer

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.349
disk is on the desk over there, but where
did he go this time?

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.609
Michi fine ass seems to have some good intuition
to know things is pretty weird around her

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:35.609
all the time!

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.660
She looks around for Taguchi again, but this
time she finds him...hanging!

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.150
He killed himself pretty quick and without
resistance.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.439
Of course the police are called!

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.489
Probably hoping this isn't another Suicide
Club in the making!

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.169
Actually, this came out before that movie!

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:57.909
Despite their coworker killing himself, things
go back to normal for everybody but Michi.

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.279
They all decide to take a look at the computer
disc that Taguchi was working on.

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:05.999
They find a image of him standing...eerily!

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:10.919
On his monitor is a exact copy of the picture
they are looking at, and in the monitor on

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.680
the left is a face but I'm surprised they
even saw that.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.680
Look!

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.790
The main point is that something strange is
going on!

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.920
It seems to follow Michi's fine ass all the
way to her flat!

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.809
Causing her TV to glitch..

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:27.779
She was pretty exhausted from turning it off
though!

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:32.669
Look, we can see things are going weird for
Michi and her coworkers regarding Taguchi's

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.859
suicide and that computer disc, but that's
not the only ghostly thing going on!

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:42.170
Elsewhere, a economics major named Ryosuke
Kawashima is signing up for a new internet

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.170
service!

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.120
Once he's all signed up, instead of possibly
connecting with others or whatever, his screen

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.339
goes black.

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:52.870
It again shows some random footage that he
can skip through.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.719
It then asks him if he would like to meet
a ghost!

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:58.540
Kawashima's response is surprising though!

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.479
I thought he would be like, "Well why not!".

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:06.419
While sleeping, his computer turns itself
on and shows footage of someone sitting in

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.419
a mask.

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.809
Seems like a lot of those story-time videos
are like this.

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:16.470
So Kawashima is not comfortable with computers,
so he goes to the computer science department

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.630
to see what's going on!

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.799
I'm surprised he cared that much.

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.900
A post grad student named Harue Karasawa decides
to tell him how to save the web-page where

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.880
the video popped up either by bookmarking
it or print screen capture.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.310
Since her last name is pretty similar to Kawashima,
I'll just call her by her first name Harue.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.790
Now, back to Michi and her friends.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.370
Yabe was the other guy who worked along side
Michi.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.880
One day he gets a call.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.280
A disembodied voice asking for help!

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.750
On his phone is the same image that he saw
on the computer disc, so he takes part in

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.470
the same trip Michi did and goes to Taguchi's
room, the guy who killed himself.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.950
He finds a crumpled-up note saying The Forbidden
Room.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.791
He also sees a black shadow mark where Taguchi's
body was, which also becomes Taguchi for a

00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:08.950
split second.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.160
When he leaves, he comes across a room sealed
off by red tape.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.260
I'd say that these rooms could possibly be
a portal in some ways to the other realm.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.360
Now listen, Yabe comes cross a creepy spirit
in black.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.200
You see I would have been down the block by
now and probably would have missed her undulate

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.040
and move like that!

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.090
Hiding from the ghost isn't exactly the smartest
decision to make in this situation and it

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.090
supposedly grabs a hold of Yabe.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:44.290
He survives, but he becomes pretty withdrawn
and distant from going into that closed off

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:53.340
room.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.260
Speaking of, Michi sees some random lady in
red taping down a door.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.760
Maybe those are the Forbidden Rooms.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.870
So now lets go back to Kawashima's experience.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.930
If you remember, his computer is plaguing
him with random footage.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.350
He tries to bookmark the page and screen capture
but nothing works out!

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.542
He angrily and fearfully unplugs his computer
when the figure in the videos begins to take

00:06:17.542 --> 00:06:18.930
his mask off.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.310
He goes back to the computer science department
to ask for help and runs into his favorite

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.310
girl.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.100
Harue offers to come to his place to check
it out.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.700
Man you really should have picked up your
room before she came in.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:36.130
Now as soon as she checks out his computer,
she starts getting cryptic.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.280
She thinks that Kawashima got on the internet
to connect with others!

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:48.690
However she believes that individuals don't
really connect, and are most often separate

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.720
from others.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.800
Okay again, we are back with Michi.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.750
Pretend we are switching characters like GTA
5.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:04.620
Michi is having trouble trying to talk to
Yabe after he visited the sealed off room.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.730
He's quite withdrawn and lost the will to
live after encountering the ghost.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:15.650
One crazy part though is that while just walking
home, Michi sees the lady in red who was taping

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.830
up a door.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:22.130
The lady jumps from a silo all the way to
her loud smack death!

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.980
She handled that pretty well.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.139
I would have probably vomited or something.

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:32.730
Alright we gotta switch characters again "(GTA
Sound Effects).

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.500
Oh look Kawashima is at a library.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:42.200
He's never been in hear before, cant even
find the exit.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.600
He must be looking for his crush Harue.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.110
She's reading a book about phantoms though?

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.650
She drags him to the computer science lab
to show him a program a grad student worked

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.650
on.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.970
Well she showed him before but this time the
dots are acting more weird and ghostly.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:04.210
One thing for sure is that the haunted website
and the program seems to be related.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:11.290
Look how hard Kawashima is blushing when Harue
gives him her number.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:15.730
I don't even recall him asking I think he
just got it like that.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.670
When being weird and awkward works out!

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:19.670
Still!

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.650
He goes back to the library to see what she
was reading a phantom book, but right after

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.280
closing it, he sees a dark apparition!

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.880
A grad student, the same one who made that
program, tells Kawashima that this is a normal

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.970
occurrence.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.159
Dark ghosts are just all around!

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.120
The grad student has a theory.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.289
Spirits are becoming apparent in our human
world, because their spirit world has a finite

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:43.879
amount of space.

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:49.680
Therefore, spirits are overflowing into the
human realm through various mediums, such

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.029
as technology!

00:08:51.029 --> 00:08:53.540
We don't see the grad student again really.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.809
Okay we are switching characters again.

00:08:57.809 --> 00:09:03.949
Now if you remember Michi's situation, her
coworker Yabe lost his will to live, and various

00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:06.260
people around are going missing.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.040
At one point, Michi gets a phone call asking
for help.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.899
It's Yabe's spirit voice, but that must also
mean he has died.

00:09:14.899 --> 00:09:18.379
It seems as if he literally just became the
black stain.

00:09:18.379 --> 00:09:23.269
Doesn't look like he actually killed himself
with anything other than just willing himself

00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:24.269
away.

00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:31.290
Now Michi only has one coworker left, Junko,
but she already succumbs to the desire to

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.839
check out the sealed off rooms.

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:38.800
Michi runs in to save her from seeing a spirit,
but Junko pushes her away and gets a strong

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.660
whiff of ghost in her system.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.720
Regardless, Michi drags her friend out of
that room!

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.310
However, just like the other two Junko becomes
withdrawn and hopeless.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.110
Michi has to take care of her and even feed
her.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:57.820
At one moment she goes to the corner store
on West Shichifuku street to buy some snacks.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.600
Y'all wont get that reference, but its very
empty.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.629
It's like people are just vanishing in thin
air, now that's disturbing.

00:10:03.629 --> 00:10:06.589
Missing cases like those are very spooky.

00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:11.079
The store didn't seem to have any employees
in it, unless you count this demon hiding

00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:12.350
behind!

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.680
Michi was so scared that she shoplifted and
ran all the way back home.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.949
Honestly that was pretty hilarious.

00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:21.610
You said you didn't want to switch characters
so soon?

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.649
Too bad'.

00:10:22.649 --> 00:10:27.389
Back with Kawashima, he decided to hit Harue
up but she didn't answer.

00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:29.290
So instead he goes straight to the lab.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.139
Looks like its been vandalized though!

00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:34.470
Possibly by some mean ass spirits.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:40.050
Anyway he tries her apartment next, but really
she was acting weird in the rain.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:46.379
She's very crazed and concerned about "Them
Disappearing" . Kawashima helps dry her off

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:48.860
and get her to calm down and relax!

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:54.240
She also confides with him an idea about life
after death.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.459
Most people would like to think that once
you die, you possibly get to spend the afterlife

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:05.149
with your past relationships who are gone
too, like family and friends.

00:11:05.149 --> 00:11:08.189
Most people don't consider that ghosts are
lonely too, that they don't actually get to

00:11:08.189 --> 00:11:09.189
be with who they lived with.

00:11:09.189 --> 00:11:13.949
This is the idea that Harue is pondering and
it literally makes the afterlife seem almost

00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:16.869
as hopeless as no afterlife at all.

00:11:16.869 --> 00:11:21.720
Well maybe that is pushing it, but I'm guessing
my thinking is that the afterlife must be

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:27.230
dark and barren in this film, and the only
thing ghosts can do is overflow and affect

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.779
people's thoughts.

00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:32.240
Now Kawashima is naively disregarding all
that.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.139
He doesn't want to think about death and afterlife
and loneliness in afterlife.

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:40.689
He even suggests that in 10 years, they will
have a pill that makes us all immortal.

00:11:40.689 --> 00:11:41.689
Ha!

00:11:41.689 --> 00:11:45.709
It's been twenty years and we still gotta
teach grown people how to wash their hands.

00:11:45.709 --> 00:11:51.019
Back with Michi, she's having a hard time
helping Junko, her coworker who walked into

00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:52.910
the ghostly portal room.

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:56.329
She asks, "Am I going to die like this?".

00:11:56.329 --> 00:12:02.610
Honestly, she looks pretty dead already, but
she states that she'll just keep on living

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:03.610
then.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:07.769
Well that doesn't look like living to me,
but what's the difference since we are both

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:10.930
so lonely apparently.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:16.870
Her stain becomes particles that spread all
around the room and eventually exit, and this

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.970
leaves Michi all by herself.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:23.330
Michi calls her mother to confide in her,
but she doesn't answer!

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.259
She takes the initiative again and runs towards
her mom.

00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:31.899
Now elsewhere, Kawashima is all alone at some
game place.

00:12:31.899 --> 00:12:35.389
It's empty except for a few dark ghosts here
and there.

00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:38.350
Maybe the ghosts and the humans should link
up and go bar hopping.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:42.999
Soon he comes across Harue trashing plants
and pottery for no reason.

00:12:42.999 --> 00:12:47.889
She's still pretty weird now but he gets through
to her by saying that we should go somewhere

00:12:47.889 --> 00:12:49.399
far away!

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:51.220
Like literally far away.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:56.470
The subway is the quickest way
As usual there isn't anybody else around...but

00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:00.189
he reminds her that he is right there with
her.

00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:02.639
That she isn't alone.

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:16.679
It was a little cute, but soon the entire
train stops in the middle of nowhere.

00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:22.589
Harue gets the strong compulsion to run all
the way back home and she leaves Kawashima

00:13:22.589 --> 00:13:24.610
looking all over for her.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.079
Somehow she made it back in some unknown amount
of time.

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:32.139
She gets a front row seat to that video Kawashima
was watching.

00:13:32.139 --> 00:13:37.129
She see's somebody take off the mask, and
then shooting themselves in the head.

00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:42.010
Then quickly on the other monitor she can
clearly see she's being projected.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:50.339
She seems to see the recorder but we don't,
and she speaks to them saying that she is

00:13:50.339 --> 00:13:53.300
not alone!

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:58.360
Pretty soon Kawashima breaks in to find her,
but of course she isn't there at all!

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.459
On the news, an announcer reads off several
names of people gone missing all over the

00:14:02.459 --> 00:14:03.589
Kanto region!

00:14:03.589 --> 00:14:06.629
It's pretty dead and broken all over Tokyo.

00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:13.600
At one point Kawashima is just roaming around
when he see's a car that died.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.519
In the car is...guess who...

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:16.519
It's Michi!

00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:18.939
So our two individuals meet for the first
time.

00:14:18.939 --> 00:14:23.320
They hit it off pretty well and he helps fix
her car.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.300
They seem to be the only ones in the whole
city!

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:31.949
So regarding this whole loneliness thing,
Michi asks Kawashima to ride along with her!

00:14:31.949 --> 00:14:36.839
She even helps him find the missing Harue
at her flat but she isn't there.

00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:41.259
Michi however looks out the window and notices
an abandoned factory and they both decide

00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:42.259
to check it out.

00:14:42.259 --> 00:14:46.480
That's pretty interesting!

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.759
So they actually do randomly find Harue at
the warehouse but she has a bag over her head

00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:54.309
like the ghostly people in those videos!

00:14:54.309 --> 00:14:56.850
She doesn't look like she plans on killing
herself!

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:05.129
Oops, look like I spoke to soon, and so Harue
is gone.

00:15:05.129 --> 00:15:08.589
It leaves Kawashima and Michi alone together.

00:15:08.589 --> 00:15:10.769
Until they run out of gas.

00:15:10.769 --> 00:15:17.939
Kawashima is then compelled to go in a Forbidden
Room when getting the gas, and he sees a ghost

00:15:17.939 --> 00:15:19.339
like all the others.

00:15:19.339 --> 00:15:25.060
The thing about Kawashima though is that he
rejects seeing the ghost and the isolation

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.819
it projects, but that fails very quickly.

00:15:27.819 --> 00:15:33.019
Unlike Michi's last two coworkers though,
Kawashima exits the room by himself and Michi

00:15:33.019 --> 00:15:35.589
finds him knowing he went in there.

00:15:35.589 --> 00:15:40.179
She finds him crouched on the ground in front
of a black stain, and drags him back to the

00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:41.179
car.

00:15:41.179 --> 00:15:43.160
They make their way through an abandoned city!

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.059
It looks like a whole invasion happened.

00:15:46.059 --> 00:15:51.029
I guess the underworld have dipped into the
human realm extremely by this point in the

00:15:51.029 --> 00:15:52.029
film.

00:15:52.029 --> 00:15:56.429
They both have this goal of getting as far
away from Japan as possible and drive to the

00:15:56.429 --> 00:16:00.670
pier to get into a random boat that so happens
to be there.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:06.459
When getting keys for the boat, we see how
lots of people probably died!

00:16:06.459 --> 00:16:12.740
This special will to die due to contact from
the Isolated energies beyond this world.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:18.489
Also a US Plane is crashing for some reason.

00:16:18.489 --> 00:16:21.870
Anyway they get in the boat and drive away.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:25.619
Kawashima is willing despite being depressed
and hopeless.

00:16:25.619 --> 00:16:30.339
And so that is how we get to this point at
the beginning of the movie.

00:16:30.339 --> 00:16:36.049
Michi and Kawashima were picked up by a ship
going all the way to Latin America.

00:16:36.049 --> 00:16:42.690
The movie ends as Michi sits with Kawashima
in his last moments, in which he slowly becomes

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.290
a black stain like the others.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:50.300
This time was different though, and Michi
feels as if she has done the right thing...and

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.519
has finally found some happiness!

00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:55.239
The end credits song slaps too!

00:16:55.239 --> 00:16:56.239
Anyway that was our first ghost film, which
follows that trend of other ghosts films like

00:16:56.239 --> 00:16:59.720
RIngu..I really love these early 2000's Japanese
horror films.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:05.549
Anyway, now that we felt the Pulse, lets talk
about the most disturbed moment and most enjoyed

00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:13.041
moment in that Spooky Stuff, cue the Gohan!

00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:15.559
Okay to be honest I'm sort of speechless.

00:17:15.559 --> 00:17:21.230
I'm asking myself what to make of this movie
and its themes of eternal loneliness and the

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.589
role of the internet in drifting us apart.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:28.790
Still, whether it was Michi's experiences
surrounding the Forbidden Room's or Kawashima's

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:33.890
experience surrounding the internet, it still
begs to question how important connections

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.920
are and the necessity they carry.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:42.210
The folks over at Cinema Nippon will dive
deep into that abstract question, so make

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:46.110
sure you check out their video in the I at
the top right.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.750
So lets get into it.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:53.610
The most disturbed moment is quite seriously
maybe when that lady in red fell down.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:58.700
Other than that the whole depression cases
just from viewing ghost is kind of alarming

00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.700
too.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.590
At the same time, this film isn't trying to
unnerve us in that extreme kind of way.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:10.780
Most enjoyed moment is usually picked during
a break from all the sad and hectic things.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:16.610
That break was seen at the end when Michi
found some kind of solace at the end.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:20.150
Other than that the credits song slapped pretty
good!

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:21.150
And that's it.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.930
I hope you guys enjoyed this video.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:28.410
Me and Cinema Nippon were organizing and communicating
about this video for a couple months and they

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:32.690
worked pretty hard on their take, so if you
want to truly dive into this film and see

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:38.240
their excellent understanding of this abstract
film, make sure you click on that video right

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.240
here!

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:46.200
They also cover plenty Japanese films regardless
of genre so you should check them out!

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:53.660
Again, thank's for watching, SPOOKY OUT!
