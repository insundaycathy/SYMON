instead<00:09:51.519><c> of</c><00:09:51.760><c> forced</c><00:09:52.640><c> you</c><00:09:52.800><c> could</c><00:09:52.959><c> easily</c><00:09:53.279><c> take</c>

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
instead of forced you could easily take
 

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:55.430 align:start position:0%
instead of forced you could easily take
it<00:09:53.600><c> that</c><00:09:53.760><c> omega</c><00:09:54.240><c> is</c><00:09:54.320><c> force</c><00:09:54.640><c> sensitive</c>

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
