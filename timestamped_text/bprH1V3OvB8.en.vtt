00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.880
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain a Fantasy film called "Enter the Void."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.120
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.520
A junkie named Oscar has been staying in Tokyo&nbsp;
for some time, but he refuses to get a real job,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.440
so he has turned to drug dealing to sustain his&nbsp;
addiction. The illicit trade has also allowed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.080
him to save up some money to buy his sister,&nbsp;
Linda, a plane ticket to join him in Japan.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.400
While observing the sky from their apartment's&nbsp;
balcony, Oscar suddenly wonders what it would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.160
like to view Tokyo from above. Linda tells him&nbsp;
that she doesn't want to think about it because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.640
she fears falling to death. As Linda gets ready to&nbsp;
leave for work, Oscar shows her the Tibetan Book&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.920
of the Dead, which he borrowed from his friend,&nbsp;
Alex. After taking a brief look at the book,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.320
Linda warns Oscar that Alex will turn him into&nbsp;
a junkie and eventually convert him to Buddhism.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.400
After Linda leaves, Oscar lights up a pipe&nbsp;
while denying that he's turned into a junkie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.680
As he is tripping, his friend Victor calls him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.760
asking Oscar to bring his share of the pills to&nbsp;
him at a bar called The Void. Still on the high,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.600
Oscar asks Victor if he could come over to his&nbsp;
apartment instead, but Victor insists on meeting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.360
at the bar. Victor hangs up before Oscar could&nbsp;
tell him that he'd rather wait for him at home.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.800
As Oscar tries to sober up to meet up with Victor,&nbsp;
Alex arrives at the apartment. Alex tells Oscar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.000
that he saw his sister with a guy named Mario.&nbsp;
Oscar confesses that he hates the man and swears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.760
that he would kill the baby if Linda ever gets&nbsp;
pregnant with him. Alex says he'd like to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.520
Linda, so Oscar tells him that they can visit&nbsp;
her, but they'll have to stop by The Void first.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.320
Alex tells him that he doesn't like the place,&nbsp;
so he'll just wait for him outside. Alex sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.360
the amount of drugs Oscar is bringing,&nbsp;
so he warns him that he's carrying too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.880
much. Alex advises him to ask Victor&nbsp;
to pick up the pills at the apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.400
but Oscar discloses that Victor refuses to&nbsp;
come because of what happened with his mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.320
As they are heading out, Oscar asks Alex&nbsp;
if their drug dealer, Bruno, has something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.960
more potent than D.M.T. Alex warns him that the&nbsp;
substance will fry his brains. He advises Oscar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.120
to finish the Book of the Dead instead and wait&nbsp;
for his big trip when he dies. Oscar confesses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.720
that he's still confused by the book, so Alex&nbsp;
starts explaining it as they walk to The Void.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.120
Alex asserts that people who die will get to watch&nbsp;
the moments of their life reflected in a magic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.280
mirror. Afterward, they'll float like a ghost with&nbsp;
the ability to see and hear everything happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.040
around them, but they won't be able to communicate&nbsp;
with living people. Alex explains that there will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.200
be doorways to higher planes of existence, but&nbsp;
most people refuse to leave. Those who stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.480
will start having a bad trip, and their only&nbsp;
option to get out will be to get reincarnated.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.920
When Oscar asks him what happens&nbsp;
when people experience a bad trip,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.800
Alex stresses that people will start&nbsp;
having nightmares, and all their fears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.000
will be manifested until they wish they&nbsp;
never died. They'll have an opportunity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.920
to escape their predicament when they see dark&nbsp;
yellow lights representing couples making love.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.440
When they take a closer look, they'll get a vision&nbsp;
of a possible future life with them, and they'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.320
be allowed to choose the kind of life that would&nbsp;
suit them best. Finally, they'll end up in a womb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.160
and get reincarnated. Alex explains that the cycle&nbsp;
will repeat until they manage to break out of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.440
Oscar is somewhat disappointed to hear that&nbsp;
the afterlife holds nothing better for people.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.920
As they get closer to the bar, Alex tells&nbsp;
Oscar that he can't wait to see Linda.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.760
He tells Oscar to take good care of her, warning&nbsp;
him that he's posing a danger to her because he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.400
turning into a drug dealer. Oscar reminds Alex&nbsp;
that he's the one who introduced him to Bruno.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.800
Despite that, Alex is still quite concerned&nbsp;
about Oscar, so he advises him to get a real job,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.040
suggesting that he could work as a bartender or a&nbsp;
D.J. Alex also chides Oscar about his affair with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.320
an older woman, pointing out that there's&nbsp;
a lot of younger Japanese women in Tokyo.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.640
When they arrive at The Void, Alex tells him that&nbsp;
he doesn't want to watch him dealing drugs with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.600
Victor, so he'll just wait outside. As Oscar walks&nbsp;
to the bar entrance, he tells himself that Alex is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.520
a bigger junkie than him. When he sees Victor,&nbsp;
Oscar tells him that he brought his share of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.400
drugs, but he's puzzled when Victor apologizes to&nbsp;
him. Before he could ask him why he apologized,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.440
the police burst into the room. Oscar immediately&nbsp;
runs to the toilet and tries to flush the drugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.960
They keep banging on the door, so Oscar tells them&nbsp;
that he's got a gun and he'll shoot if they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.280
leave. Soon, one of the cops fires his weapon&nbsp;
through the door, hitting Oscar in the chest.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.920
As he drops down to the ground, he starts to&nbsp;
wonder if he's dying. He fears that they'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.280
send him to jail if he survives because&nbsp;
he still has some drugs on his system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.880
While watching the police check his vital&nbsp;
signs, Oscar tries to convince himself that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.560
he's still tripping on D.M.T. He starts to worry&nbsp;
about his sister as his heartbeat slows down.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.160
Soon, Oscar sees his dead body lying on the floor&nbsp;
as the police search his pockets for more drugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.600
When he flies out of the bar, Oscar sees&nbsp;
Victor getting hysterical while the police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.120
drag him to their car. Alex tries to find&nbsp;
out from the authorities what happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.240
but they only tell him there was&nbsp;
an accident. When Alex asks Victor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.520
he learns that they shot Oscar and killed&nbsp;
him. Alex runs away when the police try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.160
arrest him. He tries to enter a strip club,&nbsp;
but the guards stop him, saying it's private.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.680
When Oscar wanders inside the club,&nbsp;
he finds Linda dancing on the stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.760
After the dance, she goes to the dressing&nbsp;
room and fools around with Mario, her manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.560
When her cellphone rings, she tries to answer it,&nbsp;
but Mario puts it down. Alex leaves her a message&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.000
telling her that the cops killed her brother&nbsp;
at The Void while bringing drugs to Victor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.360
Alex advises her to find out what happened&nbsp;
for herself because the cops are after him.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.680
Back inside the club, Oscar watches&nbsp;
Linda as she gets intimate with Mario.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.640
When Mario finally leaves her, Linda&nbsp;
listens to the message and starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.800
crying after hearing what happened to her brother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.480
Oscar starts recalling the moments with his&nbsp;
sister and their parents when they were children.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.240
He soon relives when their parents died in a car&nbsp;
crash while they were on their way to a trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.320
As the police investigate the accident, Oscar&nbsp;
tries to comfort Linda as she cries for their mom.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.960
Sometime after the tragedy, Oscar and Linda&nbsp;
make a pact never to leave each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.000
They seal their promise by cutting&nbsp;
their thumbs and putting them together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.160
However, the authorities soon take them and&nbsp;
send them to separate foster homes. As the Child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.320
Protective Services agent takes Linda away, she&nbsp;
calls out to Oscar, reminding him of their pact.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.800
Later on, Oscar is taken back to the&nbsp;
time before Linda joined him in Tokyo.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.720
When Alex advises him to bring his sister to&nbsp;
Japan, Oscar tells him that he doesn't have enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.800
money. He asserts that he could start dealing&nbsp;
drugs, but Alex tells him that it's too dangerous.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.040
When Victor invites him to have dinner at&nbsp;
their home, he learns that Victor's mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:37.200
Suzy, once made money by dancing at a strip club.&nbsp;
After dinner, Suzy offers to lend Oscar some money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.160
to bring Linda to Japan. Sometime later, Suzy&nbsp;
visits him in his apartment and sleeps with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.280
While he gets intimate with Suzy, Oscar&nbsp;
recalls being nursed by his mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.680
Later on, Oscar remembers his mother promising&nbsp;
to watch over him from the sky when she dies.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.000
As the days go by, Oscar starts offering&nbsp;
drugs to every local woman that he meets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.640
Soon, Oscar calls Linda and tells her that&nbsp;
he now has enough money for a plane ticket.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.600
When Linda asks how he got the money,&nbsp;
he just tells her that he has a job.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.800
Oscar soon revisits the day Alex introduced&nbsp;
him to Bruno. Alex warns him to be careful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.480
about taking drugs at Bruno's place because he&nbsp;
does nasty things to people when they're high.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.480
When they get inside Bruno's flat, he buys some&nbsp;
acid and asks the dealer if he has D.M.T. On&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.840
their way out of the apartment, Alex tells&nbsp;
him that D.M.T. only lasts for six minutes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.760
but it seems like an eternity. Alex explains&nbsp;
that it's the same chemical that is released&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.360
in the brain when a person dies. He surmises&nbsp;
that dying would be the ultimate trip.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.480
Alex lends Oscar The Tibetan Book of the&nbsp;
Dead and tells him to read it before he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.920
tries D.M.T. Alex reveals that he&nbsp;
once had an out-of-body experience,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.360
but he got scared that he wouldn't be able to get&nbsp;
back to his body when he saw himself from above.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.920
Soon, Oscar fetches his sister from the&nbsp;
airport and takes her to an amusement park.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.280
On the rollercoaster ride, he recalls&nbsp;
the accident that killed their parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.680
They were left to their grandparents&nbsp;
after the internment, but they couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.200
stay with them for long. Child Protective&nbsp;
Services had to take them away because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.080
their grandmother cannot take care&nbsp;
of them due to her health problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.000
Not long after Linda arrived in Japan, Oscar&nbsp;
tells her that he dreamt about the accident again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.360
She tells him that it doesn't matter because&nbsp;
they'll be living like a family again.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.560
One night, Oscar invites Linda to a club and&nbsp;
asks her to try a drug. After taking the pill,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.360
Linda starts dancing sensually and invites Alex&nbsp;
to join her. When Alex refuses, Mario approaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.840
Linda and gives her a card. Linda and Mario spend&nbsp;
some time together drinking as Oscar talks with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.160
Victor about scoring some drugs. When he takes&nbsp;
Linda home, he notices that she got very drunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.720
She tells Oscar that she's delighted to be with&nbsp;
him again. She pleads to Oscar not to leave her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.840
hinting that they should die together.&nbsp;
Oscar tells her that they’d never die.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.280
When they get home, Linda asks her if he wants to&nbsp;
find a real job. Oscar refuses and tells her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.080
people who work are slaves. Alex soon learns that&nbsp;
Mario offered her sister a job at a strip club.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.360
Since his sister is new to Japan,&nbsp;
Oscar feels very protective of her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.200
so he visits her at work and tells&nbsp;
Mario not to touch her. Mario, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.440
brushes him off and tells him&nbsp;
not to act like a bad brother.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.120
While scoring some pills from Bruno, Oscar&nbsp;
suddenly mentions that he's sharing them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.440
with Victor. Bruno, who’s very paranoid about&nbsp;
getting caught, dissuades Oscar from mentioning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.280
his friend to him or telling his friend about&nbsp;
him. In the strip club, Oscar offers some drugs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.760
to the girls inside the dressing room. Not long,&nbsp;
Mario arrives and castigates Oscar for selling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.920
pills to the dancers. Mario threatens to kill&nbsp;
Oscar if he ever sees him inside the club again.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.680
Oscar gets furious with Linda when&nbsp;
she fails to come home one night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.920
He asks Linda to inform him whenever she&nbsp;
spends time with Mario. Linda, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.680
insists that she was not with him. She then&nbsp;
asks Oscar if he’s jealous of her boss.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.160
Bruno meets with Oscar outside to give him some&nbsp;
ecstasy and tell him that he has some D.M.T. After&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.480
getting the pills, Oscar stops by Victor's house&nbsp;
and tries to flirt with Suzy, but Victor arrives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.720
and sees them. As Victor tries the drugs in&nbsp;
Oscar's apartment, he asks Oscar if he slept with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.760
his mother. He tries to deny it, but Victor asks&nbsp;
him again, so he admits it. Victor gets angry and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.720
smashes a bottle on his head. Victor runs away, so&nbsp;
Oscar chases after him, but he cannot catch up to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.360
him. The following day, he receives a call from&nbsp;
Suzy, telling him that Victor did not come home.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.480
Later, he tells Linda about the fight he had with&nbsp;
Victor. When Linda leaves for work, he trips on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.480
the drugs that Bruno sold him. Not long, he&nbsp;
receives a call from Victor, telling him to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.560
meet him at The Void. As soon as he meets Victor,&nbsp;
the police arrive and shoot him in the bathroom.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.600
After floating out of his body, Oscar watches&nbsp;
his sister identify his corpse at the morgue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.000
Later on, he witnesses his body entering&nbsp;
the cremation chamber. When Linda gets home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.920
she burns all of Oscar's drugs. She tells Alex's&nbsp;
friend, Saki, that the police refuse to conduct&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.480
an autopsy on Oscar. While she talks with Saki&nbsp;
on the phone, Oscar flies to Alex's apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.720
while the police search for clues about his&nbsp;
location. After the search, the cops interrogate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.840
Victor and threaten him with jail time if he&nbsp;
doesn't tell them what he knows about Alex.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.240
A few days later, Linda takes a&nbsp;
pregnancy test and asks Alex's friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.040
Saki, to read the result because it's in Japanese.&nbsp;
After taking a look, Saki reluctantly tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.160
that it's positive. At the strip club, Mario meets&nbsp;
with Bruno and asks for some coke. Bruno tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.680
that he got rid of all his drugs because he fears&nbsp;
Victor might have mentioned him to the police.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.160
Oscar floats to Victor's home and finds&nbsp;
Suzy berating Victor for calling the cops.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.920
As the argument escalates, Victor tells his&nbsp;
father that Suzy slept with his best friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.560
Victor's dad hits him and tells&nbsp;
him to get out of the house.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.840
When Oscar flies back to the club, he hears a&nbsp;
dancer telling Mario that Linda is just using him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.400
By that time, Linda is at a clinic to terminate&nbsp;
her pregnancy. Back at the club, Mario tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.320
the dancer that he likes Linda. He claims that&nbsp;
Linda told him she wants to have a baby with him.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.040
On the streets, Oscar sees Alex calling a&nbsp;
friend to ask for some money and a jacket.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.200
He tells his friend to visit his roommate, Tito,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.320
but he warns him against calling him because&nbsp;
the police might be tapping their phones.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.320
In Alex's apartment, Linda tells Saki&nbsp;
that he regrets going out with Mario&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.000
and says she should've dated Alex instead.&nbsp;
Saki lets her know that Alex has called to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.160
tell them he's okay. Meanwhile, Oscar sees&nbsp;
Alex scavenging for food in the dumpsters.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.000
When Linda meets up with Mario, she learns&nbsp;
that she was fired from the club because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.440
boss didn't like how she dances. Mario&nbsp;
tells her that he'll take care of her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.640
but Linda tells him that she would've taken&nbsp;
her own life already if she only didn't get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.240
the feeling that Oscar wasn't watching over&nbsp;
her. She wishes that Oscar would come back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:48.400
life. Mario tells Linda to stop hurting herself&nbsp;
and accept the fact that her brother is dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.920
When Oscar enters Linda's head, he&nbsp;
finds himself waking up in the morgue.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.800
The mortician notices that he's&nbsp;
awake, so he informs the police.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.680
As they prepare to take Oscar home, a detective&nbsp;
asks Linda to let the police know if Oscar can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.560
speak. Inside the car, Linda tells Mario that the&nbsp;
man who woke up at the morgue is not her brother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.760
When Oscar tries to touch Linda, she&nbsp;
freaks out, so Mario punches him.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.000
When he checks himself in the mirror at&nbsp;
home, he sees a different face for a moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.280
But things appear to be normal when he&nbsp;
briefly closes his eyes and opens them again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.080
Later, he finds Alex in the tunnels writing&nbsp;
some graffiti on the walls. Alex notices him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.320
and reminds him that he was cremated days ago.&nbsp;
When he remembers, Oscar ends up back in their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.240
apartment observing Linda and Mario. Linda&nbsp;
wakes up and tells Mario that she dreamed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.240
that her brother was brought back to life in the&nbsp;
morgue. She confesses that she feels uneasy having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.160
Oscar's remains in the box, so she says goodbye&nbsp;
to him and dumps his ashes on the kitchen sink.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.360
Tito soon meets up with Alex to bring him a jacket&nbsp;
and inform him that Linda wants to see him. Oscar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.760
flies to the apartment and sees Victor apologizing&nbsp;
to Linda for Oscar's death. When she tells Victor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.640
to kill himself, he tries to explain why he turned&nbsp;
Oscar over to the police. Victor claims that Oscar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.640
started dealing drugs because Linda was hanging&nbsp;
out with sleazy people. She gets enraged that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.480
he's somehow blaming her for what happened to&nbsp;
Oscar, so she tells him to leave the apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.160
Mario tries to console Linda as she gets&nbsp;
hysterical, but she asks him to leave as well.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.520
Later on, Linda meets up with Alex and rides a&nbsp;
taxi with him. As Oscar observes them inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.320
vehicle, he recalls the accident that took their&nbsp;
parents. Soon, Alex and Linda get out of the taxi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.560
after stopping at the love hotel. After observing&nbsp;
several couples getting intimate in other rooms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.520
he soon finds Linda and Alex making love. After a&nbsp;
while, Oscar sees a couple taking care of a child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.920
in bed. Inside the room, he sees a little&nbsp;
girl walking around carrying a stuffed toy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.240
As Linda and Alex begin to climax, Oscar enters&nbsp;
Linda's body and watches her get impregnated.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.160
Soon, Oscar hears the cries of&nbsp;
a woman as he exits her womb.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.200
Oscar observes the woman with his blurred&nbsp;
vision as she gathers her breath from giving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.800
birth. The baby cries uncontrollably&nbsp;
after someone cuts the umbilical cord.
