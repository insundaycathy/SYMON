00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.600
Story Recapped here. Today,&nbsp;
I’m going to explain a drama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.400
mystery, sci-fi film called "The Prestige."&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.880
Robert Angier invites members of his audience&nbsp;
to examine the machine for his next act. One man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.840
from the audience, Alfred Borden, heads below&nbsp;
the stage and waits as Angier's act continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.080
Angier walks into the machine as bolts of&nbsp;
electricity envelop him. With the audience blinded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.800
by the light, a trap door opens, dropping Angier&nbsp;
into a water tank in front of Borden. The lock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.840
traps him inside. Before the stage, the audience&nbsp;
is left confused at Angier's disappearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.760
Unbeknownst to them, Angier is trapped in the&nbsp;
water tank, begging Borden for help as he drowns.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.200
Days after the performance,&nbsp;
stage engineer John Cutter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.480
stands before the jury. Cutter testifies that&nbsp;
the water tank was used for Angier's first trick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.160
then was taken off stage. Having seen&nbsp;
Borden making his way below the stage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.320
he accuses him of setting up the water tank under&nbsp;
the trap door where Angier fell to his death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.240
Unconvinced with his testimony, the jury demands&nbsp;
Cutter explains the method to Angier's illusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.520
called The Real Transported Man. Cutter&nbsp;
admits that revealing it would make the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.200
act worthless. The judge suggests Cutter&nbsp;
divulge the secrets to him in private to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.240
make his decision with complete information&nbsp;
without revealing the trick to the public.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.560
Weeks later, Borden is imprisoned and put&nbsp;
under high security due to his skills as an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.440
escape artist. A solicitor named Owens&nbsp;
visits Borden, representing an amateur&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.360
magician named Lord Caldlow who wishes to&nbsp;
buy The Original Transported Man's methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.560
With the court ordering Borden's daughter&nbsp;
to be removed from his friend's custody,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.400
Owens offers to have Lord Caldlow raise&nbsp;
the child in exchange for Borden's secrets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.680
As a symbol of good faith, Owens hands&nbsp;
him Angier's diary before leaving.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.840
In his cell, Borden reads Angier's&nbsp;
travels to Colorado in his diary.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.000
In a flashback two years prior, Angier arrives&nbsp;
at Colorado Springs, where the whole town has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.960
access to electricity. He heads to the mountains&nbsp;
to meet Nikola Tesla but is blocked by an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.480
electrified fence. Tesla's assistant, Alley,&nbsp;
recognizes him but refuses to let him meet the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.800
scientist. Unfazed, Angier tells Alley to find&nbsp;
him at the hotel if they change their minds.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.360
At the hotel, Angier reads Borden's journal,&nbsp;
reminiscing when they were merely stagehands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.480
for a magician named Milton. During a show,&nbsp;
Angier and Borden pretend to be audience members&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.000
chosen to bind Milton's assistant, Julia. While&nbsp;
he's tying her legs, Angier kisses Julia's leg,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.080
earning a smile from her. Julia is dropped into&nbsp;
a water tank before the curtains fall, hiding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.400
the tank from the audience's view. The curtains&nbsp;
rise, revealing Julia safely out of the tank.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.640
After the show, Borden complains&nbsp;
about Milton's dull tricks backstage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.880
He claims to know a trick no other magician can&nbsp;
do but refuses to reveal it. Cutter challenges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.200
Borden and Angier to figure out Chung Ling Soo's&nbsp;
goldfish bowl trick, promising a chance to perform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.760
for the top theatrical agent, Mr. Ackerman if&nbsp;
they do. Before they leave, Cutter scolds Borden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.600
for tying the Langford double on Julia's wrists&nbsp;
on the show that could've put her in danger.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.680
Borden insists that his knot is better. With&nbsp;
Borden gone, Cutter then scolds Angier for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.040
kissing Julia's legs on stage, which could&nbsp;
reveal to the audience that she's his wife.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.600
At the Tenley, Borden and Angier watch Chung&nbsp;
Ling Soo's show where he conjures objects,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.840
including a fishbowl, out of thin air. Borden&nbsp;
guesses that Chung Ling Soo is pretending to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.320
old to hide his props under baggy clothes and a&nbsp;
hunched posture. That evening, Angier tries the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.000
trick Borden claimed but finds it difficult&nbsp;
to walk with a fishbowl under his clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.960
Angier can't fathom the idea of living a lie, as&nbsp;
Borden assumed Chung Ling Soo does. Angier claims&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.560
he only changed his name to spare his family&nbsp;
from embarrassment with his theatrical career.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.960
While assisting at a small show,&nbsp;
Borden meets Sarah and her nephew,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.200
who cries for the bird that disappears in the&nbsp;
act. Even when the bird is magically returned,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.520
the boy is convinced the original bird is dead.&nbsp;
After the show, Borden returns the living bird&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.200
with the others. He opens the pedestal where&nbsp;
the first bird disappeared and was killed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.160
just as the boy said. He meets with Sarah and the&nbsp;
boy outside, praising the boy's perceptiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.000
After having lunch with them, Borden walks Sarah&nbsp;
to her apartment, but she refuses to let him in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.600
He leaves as she enters her home, only&nbsp;
to magically appear in her kitchen.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.920
At the present time, Cutter shows the judge&nbsp;
the machine used during Angier's last show and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.400
the water tank where he drowned. The water tank's&nbsp;
trick lock was replaced by a real one, preventing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.360
Angier's escape. This water tank, Cutter explains,&nbsp;
has a history with both Borden and Angier.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.120
In another flashback years before,&nbsp;
during another one of Milton's shows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.440
Angier and Borden tie up Julia for the water&nbsp;
tank trick. Borden and Julia share a look,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.080
agreeing to use the Langford double. Julia is&nbsp;
lifted over the tank then dropped. Cutter stands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.000
on the side, ax in hand just in case. When&nbsp;
the curtains aren't lifted after a minute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.960
everyone gets worried. Cutter pulls the curtains&nbsp;
down, revealing Julia still stuck inside the tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.760
Cutter breaks the glass to save Julia, but he's&nbsp;
too late. Julia has drowned inside the water tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.680
Days after her death, Angier plunges his face&nbsp;
in the water, hoping to feel how she felt in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.600
her last moments. At her funeral, Angier&nbsp;
demands what knot Borden tied around his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.200
wife's wrist, and Borden lies, saying that&nbsp;
he forgot before leaving with an apology.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.120
Weeks later, Sarah finds Borden&nbsp;
with a strange man, Mr. Fallon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.840
in her apartment. Borden gleefully announces&nbsp;
that Fallon has provided the equipment he needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.480
for his first show. Sarah worries about their&nbsp;
finances, revealing that she's pregnant. Borden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.160
shares his bullet catch trick with Sarah, showing&nbsp;
that the bullet is not in the gun when fired.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.120
Borden's show, however, is filled with boos&nbsp;
from the audience. Tired of their complaints,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.760
Borden aims a gun at them, silencing the room.&nbsp;
He chooses a volunteer to shoot him with the gun,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.920
not noticing the man putting another bullet&nbsp;
inside. The man is Angier, still grieving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.640
under his disguise. The tension stretches out with&nbsp;
Angier demanding which knot he tied his wife with.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.320
Fallon attempts to take the gun from Angier,&nbsp;
but he accidentally pulls the trigger.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.120
Borden is shot in the hand,&nbsp;
screaming in pain as Angier leaves.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.000
According to Borden's journal, he told Angier&nbsp;
the truth that night. Angier is enraged,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.280
still unconvinced that Borden doesn't know&nbsp;
which knot he used the night of Julia's death.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.320
Days later, Sarah tends to Borden's wound, which&nbsp;
has barely healed. With two fingers missing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.760
he can't perform many tricks other than what he's&nbsp;
been keeping, the one he'll be remembered for.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.400
Meanwhile, Cutter and Angier work together,&nbsp;
gathering materials for their show and hiring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.880
Olivia Wenscombe as Angier's assistant.&nbsp;
Cutter invents a contraption that makes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.400
dove disappear without harming the bird.&nbsp;
They present the trick to Mr. Merrit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.680
who owns the theater where their first show will&nbsp;
be held. On Angier's show, he wows the audience by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.520
switching two people's handkerchieves from their&nbsp;
pockets. But Angier isn't satisfied with their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.640
reaction. After the intermission, Angier presents&nbsp;
the dove to the audience, who become disappointed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.960
assuming that it'll be the usual trick. Angier&nbsp;
takes two volunteers to hold the birdcage, and to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.000
his surprise, one of them is Borden. The two lock&nbsp;
eyes as Borden triggers the cage's trap too early,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.200
killing the dove inside and breaking&nbsp;
the other audience member's fingers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.400
The incident leaves Mr. Merrit&nbsp;
angry, canceling their show for good.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.320
With their show gone, Cutter suggests visiting&nbsp;
a science exhibit to inspire their new act.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.800
In Colorado Springs, Angier deciphers&nbsp;
Borden's journal when Alley joins him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.600
Angier claims to have discovered the&nbsp;
secret to Borden's greatest trick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.760
a machine made by Tesla which he hopes to&nbsp;
acquire. Curious, Alley takes Angier to show&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.480
their experiment. Up in the mountain, Angier sees&nbsp;
the whole town's lights go out. Tesla provided the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.560
town with electricity in exchange for using the&nbsp;
generators whenever his experiments required it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.640
such as this night. All around them, the field&nbsp;
illuminates numerous wireless light bulbs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.120
which harness power from the&nbsp;
generators fifteen miles away.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.240
Months before this, Angier first witnessed Nikola&nbsp;
Tesla's technology during his science exhibit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.520
Here is when Angier first sees Alley,&nbsp;
who insists on the safety of Tesla's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.120
works despite Thomas Edison's smear&nbsp;
campaign. Among the audience is Borden&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.400
gazing at the lightning strikes inside&nbsp;
the hall while the others cower away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.160
Angier follows him outside the exhibit and&nbsp;
discovers Borden’s wife and baby daughter, Jess.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.960
Jealousy filled him, seeing the family he&nbsp;
could've had with Julia. But when he reads&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.480
Borden's stolen journal, he reads that Borden&nbsp;
craved freedom despite the family he built.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.840
At the prison, Jess, now a&nbsp;
little girl, visits her father.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.760
Borden confirms from Fallon that the&nbsp;
court intends to take Jess from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.160
Learning this, Borden decides to accept Owen's&nbsp;
offer. Later that day, a guard taunts Borden that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.160
his skills aren't enough to escape prison. Borden&nbsp;
distracts the guard with a ball which clumsily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.400
rolls off his hand. The guard mocks him, not&nbsp;
noticing Borden chaining his foot to the table.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.480
Two years before, Angier is finally&nbsp;
allowed into Tesla's laboratory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.840
where electricity loudly arcs within&nbsp;
a platform. Walking through the raging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.920
bolts emerges Nikola Tesla. He shakes&nbsp;
Angier's hand while Alley puts a lightbulb&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.720
on Angier's free hand. The bulb illuminates in&nbsp;
his palm, conducting energy from their bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.760
During lunch, Tesla recognizes Angier's obsession,&nbsp;
advising him to go home and forget his ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.920
When Angier refuses, Tesla relents as&nbsp;
he'd already begun building the machine.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.200
Months before this, Angier sees&nbsp;
Borden's success in the newspaper.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.120
Olivia warns him about his obsessive&nbsp;
vengeance against Borden. But Angier argues,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.040
unable to accept that the man responsible for&nbsp;
his wife's death is living the life he wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.640
That evening, Angier recounts Borden's newest&nbsp;
trick that astonished him, where he enters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.640
one closet and immediately exits another.&nbsp;
Angier is determined to learn how it's done,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.920
knowing that he can sell it better.&nbsp;
Cutter insists Borden uses a double,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.800
but Angier is convinced it's not that simple. With&nbsp;
no other options, Angier agrees to find a double.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.160
Olivia introduces them to Gerald Root,&nbsp;
a drunk ex-actor who looks like Angier.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.000
Angier is disappointed in the actor, but&nbsp;
Cutter promises that he could make it work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.920
A month later, while they're practicing the&nbsp;
trick, Olivia and Angier flirt and kiss,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.560
excited for their big show. Cutter presents them&nbsp;
the reformed Root, who walks to the stage drunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.000
But when he's performing, Root can&nbsp;
still move as elegantly as Angier.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.520
That evening, Angier presents the&nbsp;
audience with The New Transported Man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.880
Angier tosses his hat over the air, then&nbsp;
enters one door on the stage and comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.240
out to catch it on the opposite door.&nbsp;
With the real Angier under the stage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.520
Root relishes the crowd's applause,&nbsp;
kissing Olivia, which earns more cheers.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.960
After the show, Angier expresses frustration&nbsp;
over being below the stage once the crowd cheers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.000
He wonders if he and Root can switch&nbsp;
before the performance, but Cutter doubts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.240
if Root can mimic his showmanship to draw the&nbsp;
audience's anticipation. Finding Root drunk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.440
Cutter shoves him out, fearing someone would&nbsp;
see him, which would destroy their act.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.520
Alone, Olivia kisses Angier, hoping&nbsp;
to celebrate with him properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.320
But Angier is distracted, still finding the act&nbsp;
unsatisfying. Hoping to learn how Borden does it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.480
Angier asks Olivia to spy on Borden, suggesting&nbsp;
that she tell the truth to earn his trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.040
Olivia is against the idea, dodging Angier when&nbsp;
he leans for a kiss. But she agrees anyway.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.320
Years after this, Tesla presents his invention&nbsp;
to Angier. Using his hat, the machine produces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.840
electricity until it explodes in light.&nbsp;
But the hat remains as if nothing happened.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.800
Two years ago, when Olivia visits Borden in his&nbsp;
workshop, she confesses that Angier sent her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.120
learn his secrets. Olivia claims she's had enough&nbsp;
of Angier's attitude and truly wishes to change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:56.000
sides. Meanwhile, just before another show,&nbsp;
Root demands more money to continue the act.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.760
Not wanting to risk their show, Angier agrees&nbsp;
to pay him more until they get Borden's secrets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.600
One night, however, Root deliberately&nbsp;
delays appearing on stage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.080
ruining their performance. He gets this idea from&nbsp;
a man he met at a bar, who hinted how the double&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.240
hired for the performance has more power over&nbsp;
the magician. The man at the bar was Borden.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.560
On another show, when Angier steps into the&nbsp;
trapdoor, the cushion under the stage is removed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.040
causing his fall to break his leg. Instead&nbsp;
of Root at the platform, he finds Borden.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.200
Borden emerges onto the stage, giving the&nbsp;
audience a laugh. In the middle of the stage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.240
the drunk Root is presented, bound&nbsp;
and gagged, as the crowd laughs at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.640
him. Borden walks down the stage, mocking&nbsp;
Angier and earning the audience's applause.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.720
Furious, Angier confronts Olivia, believing&nbsp;
that she helped Borden sabotage him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.960
Olivia claims she only did what he asked her&nbsp;
to. Olivia is sure that Borden has a double,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.440
but Angier is still not convinced. To prove&nbsp;
her loyalty, Olivia gives him Borden's journal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.040
but she needs to bring it back the next day.&nbsp;
When Olivia reminds him that his wife will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.120
never return, Angier lets it slip that he&nbsp;
only cares about uncovering Borden's secret.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.240
The statement surprises even himself,&nbsp;
seeing the man he's turned into.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.600
To save Olivia the trouble, he&nbsp;
breaks into Borden's workshop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.920
making it seem that he stole the journal from&nbsp;
there. One evening, after a successful show,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.800
Borden finds Angier stalking him. Fallon gets&nbsp;
worried and follows them as well. To get ahead,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.440
Angier cuts into the alley where Fallon follows&nbsp;
him. As Fallon climbs up the stairs, it breaks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.760
and he falls into a large box where Cutter&nbsp;
traps him inside. Holding Fallon as a hostage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:23.120
Angier demands Borden's method for the Transported&nbsp;
Man. Instead, Borden writes him a clue. Angier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.560
takes the clue and directs Borden to a shovel,&nbsp;
telling him to dig to save Fallon's life.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.760
At the hospital, Angier and Cutter check the&nbsp;
note, seeing the word Tesla. Angier beams,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.720
excited to discover Borden's&nbsp;
secrets. But Cutter is tired of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.520
being a pawn in Angier's obsession,&nbsp;
deciding to leave the magician.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.040
At dinner, Sarah is surprised to see Borden bring&nbsp;
along Fallon and Olivia. Borden celebrates as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.720
he's come up with a new trick: to bury&nbsp;
himself alive every night. Unimpressed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.360
Sarah suggests Fallon and Olivia leave, which&nbsp;
they do. Alone with her husband, Sarah listens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.720
to Borden rant about nearly losing something&nbsp;
dear to him, but he wouldn't share what it is.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.520
After witnessing Tesla's machine fail in Colorado,&nbsp;
Angier reads the part in Borden's journal when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.760
Olivia first came to him. Olivia was angry to&nbsp;
be sent to Borden, feeling used and betrayed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.000
by Angier. As the days went by, Borden knows&nbsp;
he couldn't trust Olivia but fell in love with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.400
her nonetheless. The journal reveals that Olivia&nbsp;
directed Borden to Root, then planted the journal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.200
to lead Angier into a wild goose chase. Borden, in&nbsp;
his journal, mocks Angier for thinking that he'd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.680
reveal his secrets in writing. Angier clutches&nbsp;
the notebook in his hand, his eyes red in anger.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.480
Angier marches to the laboratory, accusing Tesla&nbsp;
of taking his money to fund his own experiment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.640
not to build his machine. He threatens to bring&nbsp;
Edison's men to them, but Tesla assures him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.040
he did build the machine; it just hasn't operated&nbsp;
as intended. Hoping to get a different result,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.440
Tesla uses Alley's cat on the machine. The cat&nbsp;
meows as bolts of electricity surround it, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:44.960
nothing happens. Disappointed, Angier leaves, the&nbsp;
cat running to the exit with him. Outside, Angier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.720
hears the cat screeching in the field. He follows&nbsp;
the sound and finds dozens of his hats scattered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:53.600
around. Alley's cat chases after another cat that&nbsp;
looks just like it. Tesla successfully created&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:59.040
clones. This means his machine works. With this&nbsp;
discovery, Tesla promises Angier to perfect it.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.960
Meanwhile, Borden finds Sarah&nbsp;
pouring a drink to drown her sorrows.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.120
Borden promises his love to only her and&nbsp;
Jess, but Sarah doesn't believe him. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.120
Borden meets with Fallon at the park. Borden&nbsp;
suggests Fallon take Jess to the zoo instead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.440
and begs him to convince Sarah that he loves her.&nbsp;
Then, Borden visits Olivia, who greets him with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.840
a kiss. Seeing his face, however, she reminds&nbsp;
him to forget his family while he's with her.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.200
In Colorado, Angier finds Tesla's laboratory in&nbsp;
ruins. Thinking that his investment is ruined,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.920
Angier checks out from the hotel. But the hotel&nbsp;
manager shows him the package Tesla sent. In&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.320
his letter, Tesla explains how he fled after&nbsp;
Edison's men came to burn down his laboratory.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.680
He assures him that the machine will work but&nbsp;
advises him not to use it, as it will only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.080
bring him misery. His warning is ignored,&nbsp;
however. Angier eagerly tests the machine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.600
taking precautions in case there are&nbsp;
still kinks in the process. He activates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.880
the machine and steps inside, allowing&nbsp;
the electricity to fill him with sparks.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.800
In the present, Borden reaches the end&nbsp;
of Angier's diary, where he mocks him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.040
knowing that he's reading the diary while in&nbsp;
prison. The next day, Borden confronts Owens,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.480
who assures him that the diary is&nbsp;
real. Borden hands Owens his notes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.480
but they're incomplete. He demands to say goodbye&nbsp;
to Jess before giving them the complete notes.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.400
Months before, Borden's marriage falls&nbsp;
apart due to his affair with Olivia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.120
Sarah is tired of Borden's lies and secrets.&nbsp;
She demands to know the truth to prove his love&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.760
for her, but he refuses, confessing that he did&nbsp;
not love her at that moment. Sick of his lies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.920
Sarah hangs herself in the&nbsp;
middle of Borden's workshop.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.520
Meanwhile, Cutter meets with&nbsp;
Angier in an abandoned theater.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.520
Angier reveals The Real Transported Man,&nbsp;
which he intends to perform for a show.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.400
With Cutter's help, Angier presents the act to&nbsp;
Mr. Ackerman. Angier enters the cage, surrounded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.280
by crackling bolts of lightning. He disappears&nbsp;
before their eyes only to appear behind Ackerman.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.000
The presentation astonishes Ackerman&nbsp;
into agreeing to fund their show.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.080
One afternoon, Olivia confesses that&nbsp;
Sarah wanted to meet her the day before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.800
she died. Sarah wanted to reveal something&nbsp;
to Olivia, but Olivia was afraid to face her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.200
Now, Olivia asks Borden what Sarah would have&nbsp;
said. Borden claims that he never loved Sarah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.520
at least not wholly. He claims to love&nbsp;
Olivia instead, but she isn't satisfied.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.120
Before she leaves, Olivia informs him&nbsp;
of Angier's return, troubling Borden.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.160
On the first night of Angier's show, Borden joins&nbsp;
the audience. Angier unveils Tesla's machine that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.640
fills the stage with lighting, leaving them in&nbsp;
awe. Angier walks inside and disappears before the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.440
audience's eyes. He appears at the balcony behind&nbsp;
the audience, earning him a standing ovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.320
Borden panics at this, angrily demanding Fallon&nbsp;
to outsmart Angier. Fallon stalks Angier's blind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.480
assistants as they transport equipment out of the&nbsp;
theater. Still, they can't figure out his trick.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.400
On the night of Angier's death, Borden examines&nbsp;
the machine along with the audience then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.960
infiltrates the set. He heads under the stage&nbsp;
and witnesses Angier drop into the water tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.800
Borden tries to break it open with a wrench,&nbsp;
but he's too late. Cutter intervenes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.040
finding Angier dead. These events lead to Borden&nbsp;
being sentenced to death for Angier's murder.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.920
In prison, Borden is delighted to see Jess,&nbsp;
uninterested in her new guardian at first.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.240
When he raises his eyes to Lord Caldlow, he's&nbsp;
stunned to see Angier's face staring back at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.480
Angier smiles, blaming Borden's obsession that&nbsp;
led him there. Borden threatens to leave Jess&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.720
out of their battle, which Angier disregards, now&nbsp;
that he can take away someone precious to Borden.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.640
Borden bargains with his secret for the&nbsp;
Transported Man, but Angier tears the note apart,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.040
uninterested. Borden begs for his and his&nbsp;
daughter's life, but it falls on deaf ears.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.080
Angier takes Jess to his manor,&nbsp;
where Cutter waits for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.200
In disbelief and fury, Cutter demands&nbsp;
answers on how he's still alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.000
Cutter turns his back on Angier, guilty of helping&nbsp;
send Borden, an innocent man, to be hanged while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.400
his daughter ends up with the man who sent him&nbsp;
there. Sarcastically, Cutter asks Angier where he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.640
wants to take the Tesla machine. Angier promises&nbsp;
to make sure the machine is never used again.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.760
In prison, Borden apologizes to Fallon for&nbsp;
going too far and for what he'd done to Sarah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.200
Borden tells Fallon to live his life for both&nbsp;
of them, tossing his rubber ball to his friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.600
as he says goodbye. Over the next few days,&nbsp;
Cutter visits Jess in the manor, then delivers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.760
the machine back to the abandoned theater. Borden&nbsp;
walks his last steps to be executed for the crimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.800
he didn't commit. At the same time, the machine is&nbsp;
lowered under the old theater's stage. Cutter and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.040
Angier push it away into a dark room. Meanwhile,&nbsp;
Borden is prepped for his hanging as his last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.520
rites are read to him. As his last words, Borden&nbsp;
says "Abracadabra" before the trapdoor is pulled.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.440
After Cutter leaves the theater,&nbsp;
Angier hears someone else in the dark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.920
A rubber ball bounces to his hand, distracting him&nbsp;
from the man who shoots him on the chest. The ball&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.400
rolls back to the shooter, revealing Borden's face&nbsp;
under the hat. The truth slowly dawns on Angier.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.800
Borden has a twin brother disguised as Fallon.&nbsp;
The twins switched between the roles of Fallon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.320
and Borden, taking turns for their magic act&nbsp;
and going as far as breaking off fingers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:22.560
match the brother that Angier shot at. This&nbsp;
way, each of them gets to live half a life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.880
One of the brothers, the one in front of Angier&nbsp;
now, loved Sarah while the other loved Olivia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.000
They've sacrificed living half of each&nbsp;
other's life for their performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.080
Bleeding out, Angier reveals how he created&nbsp;
duplicates of himself using Tesla's machine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.480
killing them every time. But Borden no longer&nbsp;
cares, seeing all of Angier's sacrifice is for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.280
nothing. Angier reveals he only wanted to see the&nbsp;
audience's awe upon his show in his dying breath.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.640
Angier falls back, succumbing to his&nbsp;
wound and finally dying once and for all.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.680
With Angier and Lord Caldlow gone, Cutter takes&nbsp;
Jess into his custody, showing her the birdcage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.480
trick. The living Borden, who has lost half his&nbsp;
life, his fingers, his wife, and his brother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.080
embraces his deceptive nature and finds his&nbsp;
way back to his daughter, reuniting with her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.480
and fulfilling the promise he made to his brother.&nbsp;
A dark contrast to his twin brother and Angier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.320
who were consumed by the cost of their deception&nbsp;
and their obsession with fame and fortune.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.360
This has literally cost them their&nbsp;
lives. Borden’s twin hanging in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.160
gallows and Angier, abandoned in&nbsp;
the darkness beneath the stage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.680
surrounded by the dozens of water tanks&nbsp;
serving as coffins to his numerous duplicates.
