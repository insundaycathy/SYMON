00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.149
I'm going to explain a drama-romance film
called,

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:06.149
"Malena."

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:07.149
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:08.780
Watch out and take care.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.040
Renato, a thirteen-year-old boy from Castelcuto,
Italy, recalls the day Il Duce, Mussolini,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.450
spoke to the nation and announced that he
was declaring

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.930
war against France and Great Britain.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.600
That same day, Renato received his first bike.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.869
Excited, Renato rides back to his friends
as Mussolini's

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.800
announcement plays on from speakers throughout
the city.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.320
When he arrives, they commend his new bike
before sitting down on the side, mesmerized,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.320
as they watch Malena walk down the street.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.309
Malena is the daughter of their Latin teacher,
Professor

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.239
Bonsignore, and as she moves past them, the
group speeds away on their bikes multiple

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.640
times, trying to keep their eyes on her.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.339
Admiring her beauty, Renato stares intensely
at her every

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:47.339
chance he gets.

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.570
Later on, the group of friends heads to their
Latin class.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.050
Renato contemplates the whole day, still in
awe at Malena's beauty.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.760
The next day, the group of friends hangs out
by

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.479
a cliff, measuring their manhood, as they
talk about Malena.

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.120
Renato's friend mentions an encounter he had
with Malena, annoying

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.560
Renato and prompting him to tease his friend.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.880
Afterwards, Renato skips school and rides
for Malena's

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.960
house, where he daydreams about Malena, calling
out to him and asking for cigarettes.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.119
However, his daydream is cut short as he stares
at Malena's house with the doors closed.

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.700
At home, his father is furious at him for
skipping school,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.590
getting teased by his friends, and getting
his pants altered.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.630
Later that night, Renato sneaks out of his
room and goes to Malena's house

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.630
again.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.630
Climbing a tree, he peeks through a hole in
the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.390
window and looks inside the house, finding
Malena lying down on a couch.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.179
Curious, he watches Malena walk around, listening
to the radio before

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.579
he spots a photo of her husband, Nino Scordia.

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.909
In a barbershop the following day, the men
inside talk about Malena and how she arrived

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.939
in their town through Nino, who's currently
fighting

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.070
in the war.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.950
When Renato's number is called, he complains
to the barber, asking him why

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.399
he can't sit at the adult's chair.

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.659
Of course, the barber simply tells him that
he's still

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:54.659
too young.

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.970
After his haircut, Renato goes back to Malena's
house, spying on her with a telescope

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.509
and watching her as she dries herself by her
garden.

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.140
Later on, Renato climbs to the window, peeking
through a hole to watch her work with her

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.140
sewing machine.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.300
As he watches, Renato is surprised to see
Malena's dress slightly falling off,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.300
revealing a part of her body.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.730
Later on, she starts dancing with a picture
of Nino

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:30.850
while a song plays in the background until
it's time for her to return to her room.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.820
The following morning, Renato heads to a music
store and asks for a copy of the song playing

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.820
in Malena's house.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.760
Once home, he plays the song while looking
at crude photos of women,

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.390
and he imagines them all as Malena as he falls
asleep.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:58.360
The next day, Renato returns to the cliff
he and his friends hung out in, and he tries

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.920
writing Malena a letter.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.890
There, he professes that he doesn't listen
to the town's gossip

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.450
and that he's the only man for her after her
husband.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:17.890
Renato then rejoins his friends as they race
to try and find Malena again.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:27.500
Then, he makes up an excuse to leave his friends
before catching up to Malena.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.020
When he sees her, the men from the town are
watching her walk

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.600
along the road.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:43.520
The men greet her, but she keeps walking along
while blankly staring at the ground.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:55.690
One man greets her, kissing her hand repeatedly,
and all the other men watch with jealousy.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:08.420
Moving on, Malena stares at Lieutenant Cadei
standing by a balcony before quickly removing

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.520
her gaze from him.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:23.190
As she arrives at her destination, Renato
sees her catching a key for a door

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.740
leading to an apartment.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.470
Later on in Latin class, some of the students
make crude jokes about Malena, disgusting

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.470
Renato.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.470
As the students leave, Renato watches the
students

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.180
walk down the stairs to spit on them.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.670
After this, Renato heads to a repairman to
fix his bike,

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.680
and from there, he spots Malena again.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.530
Renato could only watch her while the women
in town gossip

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.530
with each other, sickened by Malena's presence.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.270
One of the women compares her to Gina, an
escort in the town.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.190
Malena heads for the apartment again, with
Renato still following her.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.670
He then climbs the gate nearby to see who
Malena is seeing,

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.340
revealing it to be her father.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:07.720
Later in the night, Renato is at home, touching
himself as he listens

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.090
to the song again, thinking of Malena all
the way.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:22.820
The next day, during their morning exercises,
one of Renato's friends informs him that Nino

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.720
Scordia has died in battle.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.870
Later, Renato attends a memorial for Nino.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:43.540
During the memorial, two girls get giddy as
they stare at Lieutenant Cadei,

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.500
talking about how handsome he is.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:56.820
After leaving, Renato returns to Professor
Bonsignore's apartment

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:11.370
and sees Malena in bed, crying in grief over
the loss of her husband.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.340
In Renato's imagination, he goes to Malena's
side, comforting and assuring

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.190
her that he'll be there for her before Malena
hugs him.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:27.500
Later, during Nino's funeral procession, Malena
poses as the Virgin Mary,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:34.400
looking dreadful while a very concerned Renato
watches her from below.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.540
After the procession, he overhears some of
the townspeople gossiping

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:59.440
and slandering Malena yet again, angering
Renato and spurring him to spit in

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.520
their drinks and urinate in their bags.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:10.470
Renato then leaves for a church and prays
to a saint,

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:19.220
asking him to protect Malena from the townspeople.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:36.090
Leaving the theater, Renato heads out, and
he soon spots Malena leave a store.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:54.960
The men from the store talk about her crudely,
and when Renato overhears this, he throws

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:02.540
a rock at the store, breaking the window then
riding

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.540
away.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:08.530
After that, Renato sits close to Malena's
house,

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:18.690
and a battalion of German soldiers walk by.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:26.320
When Malena enters her home, Renato walks
over to her

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:41.499
yard and grabs a pair of her underwear before
running back to his bike to head home.

00:08:41.499 --> 00:08:55.480
Back in his room, Renato touches himself again,
holding

00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:05.199
Malena's underwear close to him and imagining
the two of them together until he falls asleep.

00:09:05.199 --> 00:09:07.740
The next day, Renato's father walks into Renato's
room and finds him still asleep with the underwear

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.740
draped over his head.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.449
His father throws a fit, telling Renato that
he's ashamed of him while

00:09:12.449 --> 00:09:13.449
the rest of Renato's family catches on.

00:09:13.449 --> 00:09:14.449
After scolding him, Renato's father locks
him inside his room while Renato's mother

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:16.040
burns the underwear as she cries in shame.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.819
Three days pass, and Renato's mother is concerned
for her son,

00:09:18.819 --> 00:09:19.819
who hasn't eaten yet.

00:09:19.819 --> 00:09:20.819
Then, she complains about how the fascists
treat them.

00:09:20.819 --> 00:09:21.819
The following day, a doctor visits Renato
to check on him, and

00:09:21.819 --> 00:09:23.260
he informs his family that he needs to get
out.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:31.240
Afterwards, Renato rides his bike to Malena's
house again, and the streets are now filled

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:38.800
with more people and vehicles.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:47.029
Arriving there, he sees Lieutenant Cadei,
along with other men,

00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:48.910
staring at Malena's house.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:56.800
As the day goes by, Renato is in the middle
of a report in

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:07.290
class when suddenly, a man comes in and hands
a letter to Professor Bonsignore.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:17.720
In the letter, someone wrote that the Professor
is dishonored

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:36.640
as his daughter's been sleeping with the whole
town.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:54.699
Heartbroken, the Professor leaves his class,
and the students are left to gossip about

00:10:54.699 --> 00:10:55.699
the letter.

00:10:55.699 --> 00:10:57.860
Insulted, Renato fights one of the students,
all while imagining himself as a gladiator

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.860
for Malena.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:10:59.860
At night, Renato returns to Malena's home
and finds Lieutenant Cadei inside,

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.860
speaking to her.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.860
Renato is angered by what he sees, especially
when Lieutenant Cadei kisses

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.860
Malena before saying goodbye.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.860
On his way out, the Lieutenant bumps into
the dentist,

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.860
Doctor Cusimano.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.860
The dentist berates him for pestering Malena,
who he calls his fiance.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.860
Cusimano slaps Lieutenant Cadei first, and
though the Lieutenant initially refused to

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:07.860
retaliate, he fights back when he gets slapped
a second

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.860
time.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:09.860
The two fight, and it isn't long until Doctor
Cusimano's wife arrives with the police

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:10.860
in tow.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:11.860
She furiously calls her husband an adulterer,
and while the police try to break up the men's

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:12.860
fight, she goes in front of Malena's house,
cursing her and telling her to steal husbands

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.860
from her own village instead.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.860
Meanwhile, Renato can only watch with an incredulous
look on

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.860
his face as the police start arresting the
two fools.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.860
The following day, the townspeople gossip
about last night's incident,

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:17.860
arguing over who was at fault.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:18.860
Many express their shock over Malena supposedly
having two lovers,

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.420
and they mention that the Professor's already
quit his teaching position in disgrace.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:21.420
The people also point out that Malena should
go to court for

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.420
luring a married man.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.420
Renato overhears this as he walks by, then
starts looking for Malena

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.420
again.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.420
Back in her father's apartment, Malena tries
to unlock the door, but the key doesn't

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.420
fit.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.420
Renato, watching from the side, realizes that
the

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.420
Professor has given up on his daughter, and
he just stares at Malena with a worried look.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.420
Later on, Malena walks to Attorney Centorbi's
office,

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.420
asking for counsel, before proceeding to court.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.420
Inside the busy courtroom, Renato watches
while Malena is put to trial.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.420
The judge proceeds to ask Malena questions
about the dentist and

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.420
their relationship.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.420
Malena tells the judge that Doctor Cusimano
only visited her once to give medicine

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.420
for her father and that he lied about being
her

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.420
fiancé.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.420
When the judge asks about Lieutenant Cadei,
Malena tells him that their relationship

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.420
is no concern of the law.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.420
However, the judge informs Malena that because
of the incident,

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.420
Lieutenant Cadei was questioned in a judicial
inquiry before being transferred to Albania.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.420
With that, he asks his clerk to report Lieutenant
Cadei's statement.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.420
Disappointed, Malena listens while the clerk
informs everyone that Lieutenant

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.420
Cadei had a casual view of his relationship
with

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.420
Malena, and he claims that they were only
friends.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.420
Attorney Centorbi then starts speaking passionately,
defending Malena and blaming

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.209
Doctor Cusimano as he makes a case that Malena's
only sin is her beauty and that she

00:11:47.209 --> 00:11:48.209
only wants to live a new life after her loss.

00:11:48.209 --> 00:11:49.209
When the court is dismissed, Malena and Attorney
Centorbi head back to her house,

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:50.209
and they dance while Renato watches from the
window.

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:51.660
Malena and Centorbi talk for a while before
Centorbi makes his move on her, telling

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.660
her that the only payment he wants is Malena
herself.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.639
Renato watches in horror as Centorbi forces
himself on Malena,

00:11:54.639 --> 00:11:55.639
trying to make her love him.

00:11:55.639 --> 00:12:07.559
In an attempt to get a better view, Renato
moves to another branch,

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:15.550
but it breaks, making the boy fall.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:57.920
The next day, Renato returns to the church
and talks to the saint, telling him

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:05.259
that he forgives Malena for what she did last
night.

00:13:05.259 --> 00:13:09.189
He then tells the saint that he didn't protect
Malena, so he breaks the saint's arm to make

00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:10.189
them even.

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:13.730
In class, Renato continues to think about
Malena, and he writes a letter to her,

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.540
professing his love for her and how she doesn't
deserve a man like Centorbi.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:27.920
Renato then imagines his Professor as Malena
but is cut off when

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:37.329
his Professor scolds him for doing the wrong
activity.

00:13:37.329 --> 00:13:53.839
Renato storms out of the class, and he pushes
a statue, making it fall off and break.

00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:56.900
Afterwards, Renato is with his family in the
tailor.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.900
While Renato has long pants fit for him, his
father listens to the radio, where there

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:58.900
are talks of the continuous Allied bombings.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.900
Leaving the tailor, Renato then spies on Centorbi,
who is visiting his mother.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:00.900
Renato watches and laughs when his mother
hits him, screaming at him in disapproval

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:01.900
of Malena.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.900
After that, Renato follows Centorbi and finds
him together with a teary-eyed Malena, and

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.900
there, they end their relationship.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:11.050
This fills Renato with relief, and he goes
ahead to the barbershop.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.050
After this, Renato continues to follow Malena
while she's being pestered by men along the

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.050
streets.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.050
She passes through an alley to avoid attention,
and all of a sudden, she slows down.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:15.050
When Renato sees this, he thinks that Malena
is walking towards him, so he slows down as

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.050
well.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.050
To his disappointment, Malena walks past him
and approaches Antonio, a man who gives her

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.050
food.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:19.050
As Renato watches on, he suddenly hears loud
engines, signalling the arrival of the Allied

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.050
planes and making Renato run to his bike to
escape while the Allies start bombing parts

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.050
of the town.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:22.050
After the bombing run, Renato runs to one
of the destroyed buildings, where soldiers

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.050
pull Professor Bonsignore's body.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.050
Shortly after, Malena, together with her father's
students,

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.050
join the funeral procession for the Professor.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.050
As he is put to rest, dozens of men line up
to

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.050
Malena, offering their condolences.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.050
Renato lines up as well, only to be cut off
by an older man,

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.050
and he eventually moves away when he sees
more men whispering into Malena's ear.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.050
After the funeral, Malena returns home and
starts cutting her

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.050
hair and washing up while Renato helplessly
watches from the door.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.050
A car suddenly drives up to Malena's house,
making Renato hide.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.050
Antonio's friend Salvatore exits the car and
knocks

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.050
on Malena's door.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:35.050
After greeting him, she welcomes him inside.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.050
From the hole in the window, Renato is in
tears as he watches Salvatore immediately

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.050
force himself on Malena.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.050
While Salvatore pleasures himself, Malena
stares coldly at the ceiling,

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:39.050
leaving Renato to storm back home in his rage.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:40.050
The day after, more Germans occupy the town
while

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.050
Renato walks along the streets before seeing
Malena.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.050
The sight completely transfixes him as Malena
now has red hair, and she's wearing

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:43.050
revealing clothes.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.050
The men around her look in amazement, and
the women look at her with

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.050
complete disgust while she makes her way to
a table.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.050
Blank-faced, Malena gets out a cigarette,
and all the men around her offer a lighter.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:47.050
Renato watches disappointedly.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.050
The next morning, Renato listens and watches
as men inside the barbershop see Malena

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:49.050
with blonde hair now.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.050
She's with the escort Gina, and together,
they serve the Germans there.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.050
Because of this, Renato imagines the atrocities
Malena and Gina do with the Germans in their

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.050
hotel before eventually passing out.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:53.050
Renato's parents pick him up from the barbershop,
and they take him to the church where they

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:54.050
have him exorcised as his mother believes
that

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.050
he is possessed by the devil.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.050
Afterwards, they take him to a house by the
sea for some rituals.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.050
Outside, Renato's father cries in disapproval,
believing that Renato only needs to sleep

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.050
with a woman to cure him of his foolishness.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.050
After the rituals, Renato's father takes him
to a brothel,

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.050
and inside, Renato carefully chooses before
settling with a dark-haired escort.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.050
The two then move up to a room where they
begin hooking up.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:02.050
Later on, the Allies now enter the town, freeing
Castelcuto of German influence.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:03.050
Renato celebrates, and he happily rides one
of the American jeeps.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.050
Suddenly, a group of women storms a building,
and they pull out Malena.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:05.050
The women start beating her on the streets,
and they tear off her clothes,

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:06.050
publicly humiliating her.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.050
Horrified, Renato couldn't do a thing as the
women cut her

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:08.050
hair and curse her for sleeping with their
husbands.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:09.050
Once they were done, Malena is left helpless
and bloodied, crying out in

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.050
pain and humiliation before the women cast
her out of town.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:11.050
Shortly after, Renato rides to the train station
and sees Malena boarding.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.050
Without ever speaking with the woman he yearns
for the most, Renato

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.050
watches her leave.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:13.062
In the cliff where he and his friends hang
out, a miserable-looking
