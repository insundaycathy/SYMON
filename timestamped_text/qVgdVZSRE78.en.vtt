00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.179
Hi, Mystery Recapped here.

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.891
Today, I'm going to explain a dystopian science-fiction
action-thriller film called "What Happened

00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:08.050
to Monday."

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.050
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.789
Watch out and take care!

00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:18.407
In 2043, the population of the Earth has multiplied
many folds.

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.369
There is a massive shortage of resources of
all kinds.

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.970
The world opts for genetically modified crops
which get fast-tracked around the globe.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.859
But this leads to a staggering spike in multiple
births across the world.

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.239
The solution is now feeding the problem.

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.030
No one knows what to do.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.170
Political activist and renowned conservation
biologist Dr. Nicolette Cayman has prompted

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.640
the Federation to institute a “one child
per family” policy.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.309
A bureau called Child Allocation Bureau (C.A.B)
is formed to enforce this policy.

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.989
All citizens are required to wear a Bureau-issued
identity bracelet.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.040
This bracelet could be scanned in order to
identify people at various checkpoints throughout cities

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.469
When scanned, the bracelets present data that
states if you have a sibling or not.

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.300
If another sibling is present, police are
informed and, upon arrival, take the child.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.830
These children are put into cryosleep and
they will be woken up when the crisis the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.800
world is going through is handled.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.940
They will awaken in a better world.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.660
That year, a woman named Karen Settman has
Septuplets, thanks to the genetically modified

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.660
food.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.897
Karen dies.

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:26.280
The twins' grandfather, Terrence doesn’t announce the 7 siblings
to the authorities.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.901
He names them each by one day of the week.

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:32.950
He decides that all 7 of them will live in
secrecy in a place that has hidden areas (which

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.080
he builds).

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.340
He trains them all to take on the identity
of Karen Settman.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.930
Each of them gets one day of the week to go
out and be Karen.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.430
Sunday will get to go outside on Sunday, Monday
on Monday, Tuesday on Tuesday, and so on.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.930
They grow up sharing the identity of Karen.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.030
When each of them comes back home, they explain
to the others how their day was.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.540
This step is important as it allows the next
girl to go out and continue being Karen.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.040
They are all fitted with electronic bracelets
that are hacked by Terrence so that they could

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.850
all be identified as Karen Settman.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.740
These bracelets are also fitted with GPS so
that their location could be known when they

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.299
are out of the house.

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.620
Terrence also makes a hiding place that they
could use when someone comes to the apartment.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.010
One Saturday, Saturday is attending a ballet
contest, but Thursday decides to sneak out

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.170
and skate.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.530
So when Saturday comes back, Thursday is still
missing.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.420
Terrence is very worried....suddenly they
hear a knock on the door and they all immediately

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.200
hide in their hiding place except Saturday.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.420
Terrence immediately takes a gun and carefully
opens the door, it turns out that the person

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.810
is Thursday who has returned ... but tragically
Thursday gets her index finger cut off because

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.680
she fell off the skateboard.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.560
Since all of the girls need to look the same,
Terrence cuts the index fingers off all the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.409
other girls starting from Monday.

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.040
30 years later, when they are adults, their
grandfather has died and they also have different

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.129
characteristics and appearances.

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.609
Monday is the firstborn, and she’s the good
girl, the golden child, the A-type personality

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.650
— and she, of all the sisters, embraced
the collective identity.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.379
Tuesday is the paranoid pothead — a little
bit of a loose cannon.

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.689
Wednesday is the athletic one, the fighter
of the bunch.

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.389
Thursday is the bad girl — she’s the rebel,
and she craves her own identity and autonomy.

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.840
Friday is the smart one, the computer geek,
and the sisters only have their life, their

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.780
career, their success, because of Friday.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.140
Saturday gets to hang out on Saturday, be
home-schooled, and never went to work probably

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.489
a day in her life: so she’s the wild child,
she’s the lucky one, she gets to party her

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:29.779
face off.

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:33.889
And Sunday is the caregiver: she goes to church
on Sunday and is supposed to be the believer

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:35.170
of the bunch.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.499
As they have different appearances, The sisters
use wigs and makeup to cover any identifying

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:40.700
features.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.849
On one Monday, it's time for Monday to go
out of the house, but she is too nervous because

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.890
that day, Karen Sethman is going to give a
presentation at the office to get a promotion.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.720
Monday prepares her disguise.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.739
On her way to the office, at a checkpoint,
Monday runs into Adrian, a C.A.B. agent.

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.079
He is checking her identity and talks to her.

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.230
Arriving at work, Monday meets Jerry in the
elevator..who is also eyeing for the promotion.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.889
Jerry tells Karen that he knows her secret
and blackmails her to get the promotion.

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.879
At night, the sisters are waiting for Monday
who hasn't returned home, they track the GPS

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.180
location of Monday's bracelet, but strangely
her whereabouts cannot be traced.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.550
The sisters freak out and assume something
happened to Monday.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.860
Next day, Tuesday heads out to work and tries
to act normal.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.510
Tuesday learns that Monday got the promotion
and met Jerry at a bar.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.910
Before she can investigate further, C.A.B.
agents detain her and cut off her communications.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.530
In the C.A.B. facility, Adrian sees Tuesday
escorted to a cell, where she meets Nicolette

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.130
Cayman, head of the C.A.B.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.861
Cayman reveals that she knows that Tuesday
has many siblings...and she knows there are

00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:47.660
still 5 of her twins living in her apartment.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.240
Then a CAB agent named Joe grabs Tuesday and
points a knife at her.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.850
In the apartment, the 5 remaining sisters
begin to panic.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.420
Not long after, CAB agents come and enter
their apartment with Karen’s eye to bypass

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.850
a retinal scanner.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.200
A fight ensues between the CAB agents and
the sisters.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.490
The sisters manage to defeat the agents, but
Sunday is shot and she dies.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.560
The remaining 4 sisters are crying over Sunday's
death and getting more depressed.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.130
At the apartment, Friday learns that the eye
is Tuesday's, and the sisters suspect Jerry

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.670
may have sold them out.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.010
The next day, Wednesday leaves without disguising
herself and confronts Jerry.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.760
However, it turns out that Jerry doesn’t
know anything about Karen’s identity as

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.470
one of seven people.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.890
All he knows is that Karen has a contract
with Nicolette Cayman.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.530
He reveals that "Karen" got the promotion
when she sent millions of euros to Cayman

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.120
to fund her campaign.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.190
He doesn’t know any other detail.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.440
Not long after, a C.A.B.sniper kills Jerry,
so Wednesday immediately flees his apartment,

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.590
but unfortunately, a CAB Agent , Joe manages
to corner Wednesday and finally shots her

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.590
dead.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.400
In the twins' apartment, someone knocks on
their door.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.470
Only Saturday, Friday, and Thursday are remaining
in the apartment.....Friday and Thursday immediately

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:07.640
hide and Saturday opens the door....it turns
out that the person is Adrian, a CAB agent.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.000
Adrian flirts with Saturday, however, Saturday
doesn't recognize this person.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.960
Saturday finally realizes...Adrian has a romantic
relationship with one of them.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.530
, Adrian invites Saturday to go to his apartment.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.030
She asks for a time-out and goes in to meet
with her sisters.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.990
Thursday tells Saturday to go with Adrian
because Adrian is a CAB agent so they might

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.340
get a clue about Monday's whereabouts.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.030
Friday also tells Saturday to secretly sync
her bracelet with Andrian’s to be able to

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.140
hack into the CAB server.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.370
Saturday finally agrees and goes with Adrian
to his apartment.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.310
At his apartment, Saturday digs information
from Adrian.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.770
It turns out that Monday was the one who had
been seeing Adrian.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.250
Then Saturday secretly syncs her bracelet
with Adrian's, as Friday suggested.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.470
This allows Friday to get access into C.A.B's
servers.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.740
On a video feed, the sisters believe they
have found Monday in a holding cell.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.080
After Adrian left his apartment, Saturday
immediately tells Friday and Thursday that

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.250
Monday was the one who had been secretly dating
Adrian.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.240
At the same time, CAB agents arrive and kill
Saturday in front of her sisters' eyes...

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.890
Not long after, Karen's apartment is raided
by CAB agents led by Joe.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:19.330
Friday sacrifices herself by blowing up their
apartment to allow Thursday to escape and

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.330
rescue Monday..

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.310
Now, only two twins remain, Thursday...and
Monday, who are still locked up...

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.650
Adrian hears about the explosion at Karen's
Apartment and goes straight to the apartment.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.160
There, he meets Thursday who directly confronts
him in his car, Thursday assumes that Adrian

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.190
was the one who had reported Karen.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.860
However, Adrian does not know anything about
these seven twins.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.740
Adrian now realizes that Karen is actually
a septuplet and he claims that he loves Monday.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.010
He finally agrees to help Thursday to rescue
Monday.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.740
Adrian sneaks Thursday into CAB headquarters
with a body bag.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.800
She is brought into the cryosleep room.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.730
There, she secretly records a child undergoing
cryosleep.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.900
Instead of being frozen, the child is incinerated.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.680
When it is Thurday's turn, Thursday immediately
kicks the officer and put her in cryosleep.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.920
Adrian helps Thursday to get out of the cryosleep
room...and they find the cell where Monday

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.110
is locked up..

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.630
But it turns out that Tuesday is the one in
the cell with one of her eyes removed.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:19.990
Finally, Adrian and Tuesday are assigned to
hack a video operator and show a shocking

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:24.370
video about cryosleep at a fundraising event
being held by the Cayman.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.640
Meanwhile, Thursday search for Monday.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.450
Finally Thursday meets Monday in a restroom.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:34.360
Monday looks fine... it turns out that Monday
is the one who betrays the sisters.. she wants

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.360
to be the one and only Karen and reported
her twins to Cayman.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.930
Monday also sends large sums of money to Caymans
as bribes...

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:47.339
Thursday and Monday fight in the restroom,
and eventually, Thursday accidentally shoots Monday

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.620
Thursday then disguises as Monday at the fundraising
event and Cayman doesn’t realize this.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:58.830
Meanwhile, Tuesday and Adrian broadcast Thursday's
video footage of the child's incineration,

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.939
leaving everyone at the event shocked.

00:09:00.939 --> 00:09:04.829
At that moment, Cayman realizes that Thursday
is in disguise.

00:09:04.829 --> 00:09:07.459
She angrily confronts Thursday, choking her.

00:09:07.459 --> 00:09:12.240
Monday, who is severely injured, gets out
of the toilet, pointing a gun at Thursday.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.519
Joe shoots Monday, thinking she intends to
kill Cayman, and Adrian kills Joe.

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:21.630
As the crowd flees, Monday reveals to Thursday
that she betrayed them because she is pregnant

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.459
with Adrian's children...

00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:25.220
Unfortunately, twins.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.860
Which means one of her children will be taken
away.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.040
For the sake of her children, she makes a
deal with Cayman.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.079
She secretly compromises the knowledge and
location of her six sisters in return for

00:09:35.079 --> 00:09:38.170
her to be free and live her life normally
as Karen.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.370
Not long after, Monday dies from her wounds.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:46.430
In the end of the story, the one-child policy
is abolished, and Cayman faces the death penalty.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:50.000
Thursday, Adrian, and Tuesday are the ones
that remain alive.

00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:55.540
Monday's and Adrian's twins develop in an
artificial womb. As the camera dollies out,

00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:00.240
hundreds of babies are seen crying in one
enormous ward, as nursing staff care for them.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.190
And that's the ending of the movie “WHAT
HAPPENED TO MONDAY”
