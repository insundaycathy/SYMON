00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.440
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.&nbsp;
Today I will show you a Drama,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.520
Mystery, Sci-fi film from 2018, titled A Breath&nbsp;
Away. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.720
The movie starts with a dream: it shows an&nbsp;
ultrasound, then a newborn baby and a girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.200
running on an open field. We suddenly cut to&nbsp;
our protagonist, Mathieu, who is waking up from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.760
this dream in a plan currently in the process of&nbsp;
landing in France. On his way out of the airport,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.240
he calls his twelve-year-old daughter, Sarah, to&nbsp;
check on her and tell her he'll be there soon.&nbsp;

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.080
After a quick drive through the highway, he&nbsp;
arrives at his apartment, where he gets a call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.720
from Sarah through the walkie-talkie. She asks&nbsp;
him to come over to her mom's place. After taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.880
a box out of his bag, he leaves his apartment and&nbsp;
crosses the street to enter a different building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.600
as one of the neighbors, Mr. Belkacem, who is&nbsp;
also making his way inside. Mathieu helps him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.240
with his oxygen tank then quickly goes upstairs&nbsp;
and knocks on her wife Anna's door. She welcomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.160
him with a kiss and tells him she's in the middle&nbsp;
of teaching an online class, so while waiting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.960
Mathieu goes to see his daughter in another room.&nbsp;
Sarah is living in a hermetically sealed capsule&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.360
that filters her air because she has a total&nbsp;
allergy auto-immune syndrome. After saying hi to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.080
her and asking her about her crush, he gives her&nbsp;
the box he's brought as a gift. Sarah opens it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.400
finds natural scents from Canada, which is weird&nbsp;
because her dad supposedly went to Marseille:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.560
Mathieu asks her to check under the bottles,&nbsp;
and when she does, she finds an SD card that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.200
she quickly moves to put in her virtual reality&nbsp;
set. Mathieu recorded the Rocky Mountains for her.&nbsp;

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.240
We next cut to Anna, who is finishing her&nbsp;
online class. Mathieu comes to talk to her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.080
then - he tells her he didn't go to Marseille&nbsp;
for an interview, he went to Canada because a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.480
new treatment has been discovered and they have&nbsp;
room for Sarah. Anna is skeptical since she never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.720
heard of it from their doctor, Mathieu explains&nbsp;
it's new and it hasn't been published yet. They'd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.440
just need to move to Canada, which Anna doesn't&nbsp;
like. She thinks Mathieu is complicating things,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.200
they've already been lucky enough to get&nbsp;
Sarah out of the hospital and she has a life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.280
But Mathieu doesn't think that's a life.
Meanwhile, Sarah is having a videocall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.280
with some friends that have the same condition as&nbsp;
here, including a girl named Charlotte and Sarah's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.560
crush, NoÃ©, who refers to their little group as&nbsp;
"goldfishes in a tank". Back to Mathieu and Anna,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.560
they're still discussing this new treatment.&nbsp;
Mathieu wants Anna to think about it, Anna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.720
says they can go when there are real results,&nbsp;
but Mathieu replies it must be decided now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.400
He wants these doctors to get Sarah out&nbsp;
of the capsule so he can finally hug her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.160
Anna asks for more time, so Mathieu leaves&nbsp;
the apartment and returns to his own.&nbsp;

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.560
While Sarah continues to chat with her&nbsp;
friends, the tv shows important news:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.640
an earthquake of a magnitude never seen&nbsp;
before has isolated Sweden and Denmark.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.320
Mathieu hears this from the shower, and it's&nbsp;
at that exact moment that an earthquake hits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.120
Paris as well. The power suddenly goes out&nbsp;
and Sarah's capsule changes to battery mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.040
She calls her dad, who is hurrying to&nbsp;
get dressed, to ask what's going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.440
Mathieu tells her he'll be over soon. When he&nbsp;
makes out he hears alarms and sees people running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.480
on the streets. Sarah tries to contact him again,&nbsp;
he tells her she and her mom should stay put.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.640
He walks down the street and, after noticing&nbsp;
a flock of birds desperately flying away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.560
he finally finds the problem: there is a thick&nbsp;
mist coming out of the ground and killing anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.120
that breathes it. It is expanding and taking&nbsp;
over the city, so Mathieu immediately starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.320
running back to his family. Once inside, he finds&nbsp;
Anna by the window so he quickly drags her away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.400
telling her not to breathe the mist. To Sarah,&nbsp;
he says that they'll have to leave her there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.560
but promises they'll come back for her soon.
As the mist also makes its way up inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.640
building, Mathieu and Anna rush upstairs until&nbsp;
they make it to the highest apartment where an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.960
elderly couple, Lucien and Colette, live.&nbsp;
Lucien lets them in and Mathieu runs to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.520
the window to check on the fog: it has stopped&nbsp;
at roof level. Mathieu then asks for some rags&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.160
which he uses to cover the spacer under the door&nbsp;
while Anna contacts Sarah with the walkie-talkie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.480
Sarah tells them the fog has invaded her room&nbsp;
but she's fine because the capsule protects her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.800
Afterward, both couples go out to the balcony to&nbsp;
look at the city, which is now completely covered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.760
by the mist, leaving only the rooftops visible.&nbsp;
Colette gets scared, so her husband comforts her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.320
by saying their son is fine and takes her back&nbsp;
inside. Mathieu and Anna wonder if the fog is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.040
toxic and where it came from, and they see two&nbsp;
helicopters fly by. They decide to also return&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.920
inside before the fog kills them. In the capsule,&nbsp;
Sarah watches the fog get thicker around her.&nbsp;

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.160
Back in the apartment, Lucien and Colette&nbsp;
are checking their food while Anna looks at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.360
the capsule battery on her phone app. There are&nbsp;
four bars left, which Sarah confirms on her side.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.240
This means she still has ten hours of battery.&nbsp;
While they chat, Mathieu finds some binoculars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.760
which he hangs on his shoulder as he goes out&nbsp;
to the balcony and climbs the wall to reach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.200
the rooftop. There he uses the binoculars to look&nbsp;
farther at the city: the mist truly is everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.240
He returns to the balcony to find&nbsp;
Lucien trying to use his phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.400
but there is still no signal. His son&nbsp;
lives two blocks from there on a low floor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.720
but he's smart so Lucien is sure he's safe.&nbsp;
Colette shows up then, saying they should go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.000
visit their son, and Lucien has to remind her&nbsp;
of the mist. She has memory problems. They all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.240
go back inside and after she ends her talk&nbsp;
with Sarah, Anna asks Mathieu for an update,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.960
but he hasn't seen any rescue teams. Anna&nbsp;
is worried about the capsule battery life.&nbsp;

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.600
Meanwhile, Lucien searches his closet to find&nbsp;
an old radio and brings it over to the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.880
While the others take a look at it, Lucien&nbsp;
goes out to the hallway to check the fog.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.000
He puts his hand in it and nothing happens, he&nbsp;
sniffs his fingers after but there's no smell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.480
He decides to go back inside, where Anna is&nbsp;
working on the radio because it doesn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.320
Mathieu wants to go check on Sarah, Anna points&nbsp;
out he wouldn't be able to hold his breath for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.120
so long. An idea comes to Mathieu then: he&nbsp;
remembers Mr. Belkacem and his oxygen tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.880
He could hold his breath long enough to&nbsp;
get the tank then visit Sarah freely,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.400
since he is only living one floor&nbsp;
under it. Mathieu opens the window,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.080
gets a hammer and flashlight from Lucien&nbsp;
and some tape from a drawer and climbs out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.800
taking a deep breath before entering the fog.
When he makes it to Mr. Belkacem's, he enters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.560
it after breaking the window with the hammer&nbsp;
and starts looking around with the flashlight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.720
First he finds Mr. Belkacem's body on the floor,&nbsp;
and his search thankfully comes to end quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.040
when he finds the oxygen tank a moment later.&nbsp;
He puts the mask on and covers the holes with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.360
the tape and when hears his wife calling out, he&nbsp;
peeks out the window to tell her he's fine. While&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.440
grabbing a bag to put the tank in and carry it on&nbsp;
his back, he hears some noises coming from another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.720
room: when he opens it, a puppy runs out, and&nbsp;
Mathieu notices the body of the dog parent inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.840
He leaves the apartment and goes to see Sarah, who&nbsp;
is scared. Mathieu leaves her food, a flashlight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.600
and some batteries for the walkie-talkie&nbsp;
before changing the battery of the capsule.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.520
When he's done, he tells Sarah rescue will come&nbsp;
soon but she still must make the food last.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.120
He leaves after promising he'll return soon.
Instead of going up, he decides to go outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.360
where he finds bodies everywhere on the streets.&nbsp;
He's in the middle of taking the batteries from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.440
various cars when he hears a whistle and goes&nbsp;
to check where it comes from: he's surprised to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.160
find some soldiers leading a group of survivors,&nbsp;
everyone is wearing masks. When he asks what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.320
going on, the soldier tells him they're taking the&nbsp;
people to Montmartre, which is a hill so the fog&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.200
hasn't reached it. He also says they don't know&nbsp;
where it comes from or how far it reaches either.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.640
After giving Mathieu one of his masks,&nbsp;
the soldier tries to take him with him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.600
but Mathieu turns down the offer, explaining his&nbsp;
family situation and asking for one extra mask.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.080
The soldier gives it to him before leaving.
In the meantime, Sarah and Anna chat through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.200
the walkie-talkies. Sarah is worried about her&nbsp;
dad, Anna tells her to do her exercises and starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.600
guiding her through them when Mathieu arrives. As&nbsp;
the elders come closer, he tells everyone about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.760
what he found and informs them they'll have to&nbsp;
spend the night there. He also asks Anna if she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.720
wants to go see Sarah, but she's against the idea:&nbsp;
she'd rather save the oxygen for an emergency.&nbsp;

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.560
Later at night, Anna continues to work on&nbsp;
the radio while Lucien and Colette ask her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.240
questions about Sarah's illness, remembering the&nbsp;
day the family arrived at the building with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.040
big capsule. Meanwhile, Mathieu goes out to the&nbsp;
hallway once again to check on the fog and notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.920
it's raising. He makes a mark on the wall with the&nbsp;
time to keep track of it. He goes back inside as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.800
the elders are leaving for bed, and after Anna&nbsp;
asks, he tells her about the mist going up. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.520
realized services aren't coming back soon and&nbsp;
it'll only get worse from now on. Mathieu goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.640
to sleep, but Anna can't. So she decides to visit&nbsp;
a sleeping Sarah after all, and takes the chance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.800
to change the capsule battery before leaving.
We cut to the dream of a girl running through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.280
an open field again, which is interrupted when&nbsp;
Mathieu wakes up in the morning. He finds Anna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.200
working on the radio with tools she's brought&nbsp;
from her place and she finally manages to fix it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.520
but all the channels are transmitting the same&nbsp;
emergency recording on repeat. Suddenly they hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.840
an exploding noise from outside, so Mathieu and&nbsp;
Anna go out to the roof to see what's going on:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.320
there's fire on Montmartre, the riots have&nbsp;
started. Once they return to the apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.680
Anna says they should go to stay at Charlotte's&nbsp;
because they live on a hill and Sarah could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.080
share her friend's capsule. Lucien thinks Sarah&nbsp;
shouldn't leave her capsule, but Mathieu explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.400
there are special suits they can use to move her,&nbsp;
but they're in a lab in the middle of Paris. Anna&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.400
says it's easy to get lost to reach that place&nbsp;
so she should go because she's been there before,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.040
Mathieu decides to go with her to protect her.
They stop by Sarah's first, to tell her of their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.600
plan and that they left the walkie-talkie with&nbsp;
Lucien in case she need anything. Sarah asks them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:35.200
to check on NoÃ©, who lives nearby. A moment later,&nbsp;
Mathieu and Anna are out on the streets, and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.080
quickly reach NoÃ©'s building. They aren't able to&nbsp;
make it inside though, because an angry dog shows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.320
up and starts chasing them. They start running&nbsp;
away and after some blocks, accidentally get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.280
separated while dodging cars. Anna's calls for his&nbsp;
husband distract Mathieu, who ends up falling into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.480
the Seine river. Anna manages to hide behind a car&nbsp;
at first, but when she accidentally makes a noise,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.440
the dog finds her again and resumes the chase.&nbsp;
Desperate and afraid, Anna gets on a bus and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.400
dog closely follows her, but its leash gets stuck&nbsp;
on a suitcase which stops him from moving farther.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.000
Anna takes the chance to escape through a window&nbsp;
and runs to the bridge to look at the river&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.520
to find Mathieu, but he isn't anywhere&nbsp;
in sight so she goes back to the streets.&nbsp;

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.080
Turns out Mathieu has swum to a set of stairs&nbsp;
that allows him to get out of the river.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.080
While Anna checks the city map, Mathieu takes&nbsp;
off his wet jacket and puts on a dry one he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.760
taken from a random body. He also notices there's&nbsp;
a hazmat suit inside a fallen van. Back to Anna,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.240
she's finally reached the lab and when she's about&nbsp;
to enter, she finds Mathieu running toward her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.360
After checking on each other, they get inside.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Sarah is playing battleship with Lucien&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.640
through the walkie-talkie, and Lucien is cheating.
Inside the lab, Mathieu and Anna find more bodies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.480
and a small fire in one of the rooms, but they&nbsp;
keep going until they find a suitcase with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.520
suit they need. On their way out, they pass by&nbsp;
the room on fire again but this time it explodes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.920
pushing them back against the wall.&nbsp;
They survive, but Mathieu is on fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.400
Anna searches for an extinguisher and puts it&nbsp;
off. When he checks on his husband she realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.400
he's having trouble breathing and they soon find&nbsp;
the cause: the explosion broke the oxygen tube&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.720
of his tank. Mathieu takes his mask off and&nbsp;
Anna starts sharing her own oxygen with him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.120
as they go upstairs to find a room that fog&nbsp;
hasn't invaded yet. Once they make it to one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.120
they discover Mathieu has a nasty burn on the&nbsp;
side of his body, so while he takes off his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.680
jacket and throws some water on it, Anna searches&nbsp;
for a first aid kit. She takes it to Mathieu as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.280
soon as she finds it and carefully bandages&nbsp;
the wound while teasing him for his tattoo.&nbsp;

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.320
When it's time to go, they realize the tank&nbsp;
doesn't have enough oxygen left for both of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.120
Mathieu tells Anna to go with it, he'll find a&nbsp;
way by his own, like maybe taking the rooftops. At&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.440
first Anna refuses, but Mathieu reminds her Sarah&nbsp;
needs her and that he trusts her girls to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.840
some oxygen later with the help of the suit. The&nbsp;
couple shares a passionate kiss before separating.&nbsp;

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.720
While Anna runs through the streets with the&nbsp;
suitcase, Mathieu makes his way through the roofs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.040
Anna's tank is running out of oxygen, so she has&nbsp;
to take the mask off before entering the building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.800
She manages to hold her breath long&nbsp;
enough to return to Lucien's place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.040
where she discovers the explosion has damaged&nbsp;
the suitcase and its contents. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.760
Mathieu finds some provisions and a rope on one of&nbsp;
the rooftops. After giving the rope a tug to test&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.480
it, he climbs it to reach the roof of a parking&nbsp;
lot. In there, he finds more bags with supplies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.720
and a trail of blood that takes him to the body&nbsp;
of a cop. Then he enters the building and finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.880
a little camp that holds an oxygen tank and a&nbsp;
rifle. He takes the tank for himself and when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.360
he's about to leave, a different cop shows up that&nbsp;
tells him the fog is rising faster by the hour and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.760
asks him to put down the mask. The cop takes out&nbsp;
his gun to kill him as he did with the other guy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.240
but Mathieu puts on the mask and pushes him off&nbsp;
the edge of the platform. They fall on top of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.640
car and struggle for control, the officer tries&nbsp;
to get off Mathieu to reach his gun but Mathieu&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.720
grabs him from behind and keeps him with him long&nbsp;
enough for the fog to have its effect on him.&nbsp;

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.040
Back in the apartment, Sarah and Anna are once&nbsp;
again chatting through the walkie-talkies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.280
Sarah asks if there's anything after death and&nbsp;
that she believes things can't just end here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.040
Anna mentions she's a scientist so she&nbsp;
can't believe the fog is divine or magic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.360
it must be a reaction to something. Their talk is&nbsp;
interrupted when Anna's phone alerts her that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.440
capsule battery is running out. After a quick&nbsp;
look at Mathieu running through the streets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.040
we see Anna getting ready to go change the&nbsp;
capsule battery, which is dangerous but she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.520
has no other choice since there are only ten&nbsp;
minutes left. Lucien offers to go himself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.080
since he thinks it's fine if a man his age doesn't&nbsp;
make it back, but Anna refuses. After another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.240
short talk with Sarah where his daughter confesses&nbsp;
her crush, Anna rushes out of the apartment and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.720
into the capsule room, where the battery has&nbsp;
already died. Sarah notices her mother isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.800
wearing a mask and worries, but Anna concentrates&nbsp;
on changing the battery and getting the capsule&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.680
running again before leaving. A short moment later&nbsp;
Mathieu arrives and Sarah tells him what happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.720
he wastes no time climbing the stairs&nbsp;
only to find his wife couldn't make it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.440
Sarah hears him cry out in agony and calls him on&nbsp;
the walkie-talkie as he returns to the apartment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.560
he takes the conversation to the balcony&nbsp;
to privately tell her the bad news.&nbsp;

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.000
Sometime later, the adults are passing time in the&nbsp;
apartment when another earthquake shakes Paris.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.320
Mathieu goes to the balcony and confirms the fog&nbsp;
is finally reaching their floor, they can't stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.040
there any longer. He remembers the hazmat suit&nbsp;
he saw in a van and intends to go retrieve it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:00.000
fix Sarah's, he also wants to bring oxygen for&nbsp;
Lucien and his wife, but Lucien turns it down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.080
He and his wife had a good life and don't want to&nbsp;
continue living without their son, so they'll stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.480
there and let the mist take them. After offering&nbsp;
some words of sympathy, he leaves the place and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.280
checks on Sarah, who ignores him until he mentions&nbsp;
he's leaving. Sarah gets angry because she thinks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.440
he'll end up like her mother, but he explains this&nbsp;
is the only option and promises he'll come back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.240
Back in the apartment, the elderly couple lays&nbsp;
down on the bed, holding hands and reassuring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.680
each other that they're happy with the life&nbsp;
they've lived together. Then they close their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:30.800
eyes as the mist makes its way into their room.
Outside, Mathieu has no trouble finding the van&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.360
with the suit. After retrieving it, he starts&nbsp;
running back and on the way, he finds a scooter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.080
with the keys still on, so he decides to ride it.&nbsp;
When he's getting close to his building, however,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.080
a boy suddenly appears in front of him, so&nbsp;
Mathieu turns abruptly to dodge him and crashes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.640
In the capsule, Sarah is trying to call him on&nbsp;
the walkie-talkie to no avail and she freezes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.800
when a mysterious someone enters her room.
On the street, Mathieu is slowly regaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.640
consciousness and notices he has quite a&nbsp;
wound on his head. He retrieves the suit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.160
and the walkie-talkie and limps his way back to&nbsp;
the building while trying to get in contact with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.720
his daughter. He barely manages to take a couple&nbsp;
of steps before he must stop to rest on the floor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.560
because the pain is unbearable, but he forces&nbsp;
himself to stand up when he sees two shadows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:13.520
approaching him: it's Sarah and NoÃ©. Sarah runs&nbsp;
to him and for the first time since she was born,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.000
Mathieu finally gets to hug his daughter. Sarah&nbsp;
explains that NoÃ© came pick her up because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.320
mist doesn't affect youngsters. Mathieu is so&nbsp;
happy that he takes off his mask for a second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.320
so he can kiss Sarah's head while hugging&nbsp;
her again. He tells her she's finally free.&nbsp;

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.960
We cut to the dream one last time, this time&nbsp;
we clearly see it's Sarah the one running on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:35.520
an open field with NoÃ© and her other friends.&nbsp;
Mathieu wakes up then, showing us some time has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.680
passed and things have changed: it's now Mathieu&nbsp;
that stays inside the capsule waiting while Sarah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.160
is outside taking care of him and getting in touch&nbsp;
with the walkie-talkie. Their roles have reversed.
