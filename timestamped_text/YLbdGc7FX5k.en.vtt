00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.960
Welcome to Cinema Summary ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.280
Now, what would you do if you could wish for anything
your heart desired and it would be brought

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.290
to you?

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.540
We’ll be exploring what can happen in such
a situation and the consequences that can

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.150
apply.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.620
This is The Room (2019).

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.800
So the movie starts off with Kate and her
husband, Matt, moving in to their new home

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.319
in Springwell, Upstate New York: its a real fixer
upper that has a mysterious wall blocked off.

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:32.029
While cleaning up the kitchen, Kate finds
a colorful if dead bird, which is just one

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.010
of many weird items that are in the house
like this key that Matt finds.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.870
After Matt finishes removing the barricade,
he notices something weird with the wall and

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.699
after scratching off wallpaper he finds a secret
door with a weird lock.

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:53.820
and after putting together a key, Matt unlocks
the door and together with Kate, go inside.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.539
Though after walking in, the lights start
flickering which gets Matt to call the power

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.539
company.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:04.430
and the next day, the power guy comes and is shown
a mysterious machine beneath the house

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.970
weird cables and wires seem to emerge from it.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.580
It's a weird thing that as the power guy puts it is
“Older than his grandma” that he has never

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.980
seen before in his life

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.910
After looking it over and just before leaving, the power
guy reveals to Matt that the previous owners got killed

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.520
in the house.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.240
Something neither Kate nor Matt knew and so he
does some research on the Springwell House

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.380
Murders and finds that 2 tenants: a married
couple were found murdered and the murderer

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.240
was caught but his identity was unknown.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.450
That night, Matt makes a sketch of the killer’s
portrait and is drawn to the room once more.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.540
As he finishes his bottle of spirits, he glumly
wishes for another one.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.870
Then there’s a hum, a power outage, and
when the power comes on, like magic,

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.330
a bottle of the same spirits he was drinking
appears: full, and unopened.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.740
So the next day is a day of debauchery for
the two of them as Matt demonstrates the wish

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.550
fulfilling properties of the Room to Kate
and the two of them go predictably hog wild

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.550
with wishes.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.500
and the morning after, Kate does some 
thinking outside, and as she's out there

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.690
Matt notices that a necklace that was

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.590
wished for is missing from her neck.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.930
It’s then that Matt decides to surprise
her with a room: a baby’s room and asks

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.230
for one more try and Kate
isn’t too sure about this.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.850
Since they had some difficulty in the past,
having tried twice to no success with both

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.790
times ending in losing the baby.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.040
It was a traumatic experience and Kate
is not willing to try again.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.220
Matt goes off for a drive and when he gets
back he finds Kate with a baby.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.020
and they get into a spat: Matt is upset
with Kate since sure he wanted a kid

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.980
but not through the power of a wish

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.460
they could’ve done this the ‘right’ way
and now that she’s done this

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.310
they need to make this right and get rid of it.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.970
So, the duo go back to the wishing room as
the baby cries and whines for mama and the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.430
rooms lights flicker erratically.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.120
Matt demands she wishes for the baby’s to
disappear before trying to make the wish himself

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.150
but he can’t do it either.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.440
So, they’re stuck with this baby.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.620
Later, as he sits in his studio, Matt’s
eyes are drawn to the portrait he sketched

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.120
of the Springwell House killer.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.280
He does some more research and looking at
a newspaper clipping of the suspect

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.220
he reads a quote that say
 “The Room made me do it”.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.740
Finding out that the killer was also institutionalized
for the rest of his life at a mental hospital.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.910
Under the name John Doe

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.020
After grabbing some money, Matt heads to the
hospital of the killer and asks to visit the man

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.060
Face-to-face, Matt meets John who knows that
Matt’s been living in The House and knows its

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:02.510
wish granting properties before warning Matt
to get out NOW or else bad things might happen.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.910
After leaving the hospital, Matt goes to get
his car refueled and finds out that the money

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.030
from the house turned to dust.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.209
He then has a horrible realization and rushes
home to test his hypothesis and the results

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.370
are in: painting, money, or what have you:
whatever part leaves the threshold of the

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.840
house will age at an accelerated rate, turning
into dust.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.099
It’s much later that Matt goes around The
Room, beating it with a hammer and finds wires

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.340
hidden in the walls leading from the machine
downstairs.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.699
Further investigation leads to him finding
similar lengths of wires and cables as well

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:43.430
as a strange diagram that bears some resemblance
to a circuit board or maybe a magic sigil.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.270
That’s when Kate decides to take the baby
out for some fresh air, and Matt tries to tell

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.180
her it’s a bad idea without explaining why
and she predictably takes the baby out leading

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.180
to it aging.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.099
It almost dies but Matt decides to help save
the child which has now become a young boy.

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.249
Kate confronts Matt about his knowledge of
the house and explains as well as he can that

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:09.919
the house is like a giant 3D printer that
makes things can only survive within the limits

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.589
of the house or else it ages to dust.

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:18.150
Even a child will age because even "it" is a thing.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.190
Some time goes by and Shane, the house made child
is older now and is eager to leave the house

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.460
much to his mother’s consternation.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.999
Kate and Matt having restricted him to the
house due to his ‘sickness’ kind of like

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:31.610
that other movie, Eli.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.819
Of course this restriction makes him bitter
especially towards his mother who has taken

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.080
a much larger role in his life as opposed
to Matt: whose become a shut-in, studying

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.559
the house, trying to figure it out and having
ordered a pistol for reasons we don’t know.

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:49.849
It’s after Shane attempts to leave the house
that Kate takes drastic measures in restraining

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.830
her son: boarding up windows from the outside.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.801
Shane gets curious about himself after hearing
his mom and dad talking about him and how

00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:57.960
he is a figment.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.870
It’s the mystery of himself and the house
that drives him to investigate The Room.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.990
The next day, the parents realize someone’s
been making wishes and when they enter the

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.289
room they find that it’s changed into a
forest where Shane has been making a snowman

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:18.490
and the parents are of two minds: one positive
and the other negative.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.300
Leading to Matt locking the room, taking apart the key

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.210
and leaving it in his desk with his gun.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.099
This gets him in an argument with Kate about
the dangers of Shane’s wishes and his existence.

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:32.600
and that’s when John Doe calls the house, somehow,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.100
and John gets to chatting with Matt about his
connection with the house as Kate listens in

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.860
And something John talks about is that there
is a way for creations of the house to survive

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.479
outside: the creator must be destroyed by
the creation.

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:51.689
As for how he knows this: John Doe is a figment
too, a house created lifeform whose parents

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:54.229
sacrificed themselves for John’s existence.

00:06:54.229 --> 00:07:00.639
Thus, Matt has 2 choices: kill Kate and save
Shane, or kill Shane to save Kate.

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.909
Kate drives off leaving Matt and Shane alone
as she goes off to sacrifice herself only

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:10.619
to stop at the last moment while Matt and
Shane talk about Shane’s status as a figment.

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:14.469
and it’s here that Matt reveals that
Shane is a fake person.

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:19.550
when Kate returns and things get heated between
her and Matt as Shane spies on them.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.779
The next morning, he steals some keys and
runs off.

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:30.710
When Matt and Kate wake up the doors open
and Shane is "found": older, taller, and

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.800
yet still very much a child who has his dad’s gun.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.810
Things happen as Kate is knocked to the ground
while Matt and Shane fight and when she wakes

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.219
up, Matt’s there and tells her that Shane’s
dead and buried outside.

00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:47.229
But then we see Matt on the
floor desperately trying to find Kate.

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:51.801
After he realizes that the lights are flickering
and the Room is locked he makes himself an

00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:53.699
entrance to find her.

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:58.869
As for Kate, she just can’t stay here anymore and wants
out of the house but Matt is pretty okay with

00:07:58.869 --> 00:08:04.319
just staying here and that’s when he does
a few things that the REAL Matt wouldn’t

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.869
do. Something that Kate notices

00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:10.379
As for the real Matt , he crawls through the
wires of the house before he breaks on through

00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:11.869
to the other side.

00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:16.990
Back with Kate, she knocks Shane-pretending-to-be-Matt
away after he makes a move on her and runs

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:24.129
around the home away from Shane who knocks
her down and does "something" to her.

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:28.080
Only for Shane to leave her as Matt breaks
into the fake house and comes in to rescue

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.729
her, but as they try to leave the House Inside
The Room, things become Escherian as Shane

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:35.669
exerts control over the fake house.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:40.789
But the parents manage to trick Shane and
make it back to the real house and trap Shane

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.889
outside leading to his end.

00:08:43.889 --> 00:08:49.990
One month later: at a motel, Kate is in shock
as she realizes she’s pregnant and there’s this

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:56.800
long shot that lingers on her shocked reaction
when all of a sudden the lamp in the room flickers.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.630
So that just happened but
what does it mean?

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:05.600
Nothing good, I assure you and to hammer in
how bad this could be, let’s walk in another

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.750
person’s shoes for a minute.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:12.810
Let’s say you are a mother and you have
had difficulties giving birth: having had a traumatic

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.290
experience that has made you afraid of trying.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:20.329
Then a solution comes along that bypasses
any trauma for the sake of an instantaneously

00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:25.860
granted wish: a child borne from no mother
or father except for that of a magic house.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.280
You raise it, and then the child is magically aged up

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.500
and takes the form of your husband,
and impregnates you 1 month ago

00:09:33.579 --> 00:09:39.550
A month passes, your cycle is funny, you
pee on a stick and it’s positive.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:45.440
I’m going to give you a few more seconds to digest
what I’ve just said, you done?

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.440
Okay.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.930
So what I think happened was that Kate realizes
that she is pregnant and that she is carrying

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.580
her son’s child.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.700
How exactly this would work since anything
created by the house cannot exist outside

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.380
without aging to dust?

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:04.029
Well, remember how John Doe mentions that
you the creator must be sacrificed in order

00:10:04.029 --> 00:10:06.980
for the Creation to live outside the house?

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:13.020
Well, Shane passes on at the very end of the
movie but not before the fertilization process

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:18.900
finishes up inside of Kate as we saw Kate 
stay inside the house to keep Shane out.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.100
In order to, y'know, "terminate" him

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.449
So yeah, that’s a rather icky thing to think about.
Let's move on

00:10:25.449 --> 00:10:28.300
Then there’s the lamp flickering in the
motel room.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.380
This I believe is not the movie saying

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.460
“The Wish Granting Properties
of the Room have moved"

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.320
instead it’s acting as a reminder for Kate 
Reminding her that she has not truly escaped

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.520
the consequences of her wishes.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.420
Now let’s briefly talk about the Wishing
Room for a minute: it’s a very enigmatic

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:48.060
plot device of the film, that has little
to no explanation for who made it, when it

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:53.639
was made, or even why it was created although
I think it can be easily reasoned out as to

00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:55.850
the why, y'know, to grant wishes

00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:00.829
But something to note is that it’s ancient,
probably as old as the house and probably

00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:03.900
created by the person who built 
the house in the first place

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.209
considering how integrated the machine 
is within the walls of the house

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:12.629
Now with that said, what was never elaborated on
are the limitations of the wishing room: Kate

00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:17.180
and Matt wish for smallish things so to speak
although we see that given a wish and the

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:22.259
desire of something, you can literally transform
the interior of the Wishing Room as we see

00:11:22.259 --> 00:11:23.690
in the case of Shane.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:29.420
now I am assuming that age and mindset affects
the scale of a wish as we only see Shane doing

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.790
things like making an entire forest inside
of the room or transforming the interior of

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.880
the fake house into an MC Escher painting.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.490
Though this is merely speculation on my part
though it should be a factor that is considered

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.420
but what do you guys think?

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.829
Do you agree with what I’ve said about the
meaning of the ending?

00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:47.980
My thoughts on the Wishing Room?

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.449
And if you’ve seen it, what do you think
of the movie?

00:11:50.449 --> 00:11:53.519
