Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:06.000
Today I'm going to explain a fantasy, horror,
and mystery film called “Tigers Are Not

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.169
Afraid."

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:08.620
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.620
Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.120
&nbsp;
At the height of the drug war in Mexico, Estrella,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.510
a young student, attends a local elementary
school.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.640
On that day, their teacher assigns them to
write their own version of a fairytale.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.619
Estrella decides to write a story about a
prince who wishes to be a tiger.

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.289
Meanwhile, a street orphan named Shine awaits
the perfect timing to steal valuables from

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.910
people passing by.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.100
He sees a drunken Caco, a henchman of an infamous
crime boss, and sets him as his target.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.620
While Caco is taking a piss, Shine steals
his gun and iPhone from his pants.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.700
Still unnoticed, Shine aims the gun at Caco,
but he is unable to shoot.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.360
Once Caco turns around, Shine hides in the
dark, and breaks into tears because of his

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.800
miserable life.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.219
Back in the classroom, the school is disrupted
by gunfire from outside, causing the kids

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.469
to get down on the floor amid panic.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.800
To calm the poor Estrella, her teacher hands
her three pieces of chalk which, according

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.690
to her, will grant three of her wishes, just
like in fairy tales.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.120
The shootout finally subsides, and classes
are suspended until further notice.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.610
On her way home, Estrella stumbles upon a
dead body covered in a thick carpet in broad

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.340
daylight, but she remains unfazed and continues
to walk home.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.350
Unknowingly, the blood follows her in a thin
line and traces all around her house.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.510
Estrella calls out to her mother several times,
but she does not seem to be at home.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.740
She sits on the couch watching some television,
where she finally notices the traces of blood

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.270
surrounding her.&nbsp;

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.470
&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Shine reunites with his friends

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.990
Pop, Tucsi, and Morro, who are orphans as
well.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.660
Their group is the closest thing they have
to a family, and all of them grew up together

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.910
in the streets.&nbsp;

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.090
At bedtime, Morro, the youngest one, always
asks Shine to tell him stories.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.250
Shine then tells him one about a tiger who
preys on orphans.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.040
That same night, Estrella is still waiting
patiently for her mother’s arrival, but

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.420
to no avail.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.530
She waits until the sun rises and endlessly
tries to reach her through the phone, but

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.890
still, her mother is unresponsive.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.090
She sees Shine walking in the neighborhood
from the balcony and waits for her mother

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.400
until night falls.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.890
While waiting, she recalls when the two of
them were still together, living happily despite

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.260
their modest conditions.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.440
Estrella makes use of one of the three chalks
she has and wishes for her mother to come

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.440
back.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.280
Suddenly, she hears subtle whispers around
the house that sound like her mother.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.360
A ghostly figure touches her from behind,
frightening the little girl, so she spends

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.560
the night outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.420
&nbsp;
The following morning, sounds from inside

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.310
the house awaken Estrella.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.290
She sees a boy in a tiger mask looting their
house.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.600
She tries to stop him from stealing, eventually
unmasking the thief, who happens to be Shine.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.530
Before running away, Shine tells Estrella
that her mother was taken by the huascas,

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.200
a human trafficking ring run by a gang.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.730
She refuses to believe him and chases him
away.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.910
Estrella hears the same whispers again from
the night before, and she runs outside out

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.080
of fear.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.430
She sees the tiger mask from their balcony
and decides to follow Shine’s tracks.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.100
She eventually arrives at their hideout and
sees the four orphans sharing a meal while

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.650
they gather their collection of stolen things.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.020
They hear Estrella coming their way, but they
warn her that she isn’t welcome in their

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.430
territory and tells her to go home.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.210
However, Estrella tells them that she is hungry
and is insistent on staying with them.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.910
Shine tries to kick her out, but her cries
gain sympathy from Pop.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.420
He encourages Shine to let the girl stay with
them because she might get abducted by the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.420
huascas.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.569
Estrella spends the night just outside their
fort, where Morro offers her some blankets

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:35.880
and a piece of biscuit.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.069
Estrella is still hungry so scours through
the trash looking for some food.

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.640
Suddenly, a set of hands drag her.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.560
Her screams wake up Shine.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.190
He gets mad at her for being too loud and
goes back to sleep.&nbsp;

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.320
&nbsp;
The following day, Shine tells Estrella to

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.060
get up as huascas are coming.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.020
A car arrives with men who are planning on
capturing the kids.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.410
Caco and another man chase after them, so
they hurriedly run through the neighborhood

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.410
roofs.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.770
Estrella is afraid of heights, but Shine helps
her flee from the bad guys.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.630
Shine shoots the stolen gun at them, and Caco
realizes that he was the one who stole his

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.120
phone and weapon.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.680
In an empty alley, the two meet with Pop and
Tucsi, who inform Shine that the huascas got

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.700
Morro, and his stuffed toy tiger was the only
thing left behind.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.190
Shine is in a fit of rage, knowing that one
of his closest friends is in great danger.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.590
When Estrella asks what happens to the ones
they take, they tell her that the kids are

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.590
taken to Chino to be chopped off, and then
their body parts are sold.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.090
They also add that the gang is known to practice
rituals, so they must have a deal with the

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.090
devil.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.320
Shine is annoyed by Estrella’s presence
and blames everything on her.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.460
As the three walk away, Estrella says that
she can make the huascas disappear, grabbing

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.030
their attention.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.360
Shine hands her the gun and makes her a deal.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.130
If she kills Caco, she can stay in their group.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.290
Not wanting to waste any time, the four of
them arrive at Caco’s house, where Estrella

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.400
has second thoughts on doing the deed.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.040
After a bit of encouragement, she climbs up
the wall and makes her way inside the house.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.020
The interior is dark, and she hears Caco in
the living room watching the news.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.350
She gathers up all her courage and approaches
from behind him.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.120
While aiming the gun at him, Estrella takes
a piece of chalk and wishes that she didn’t

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.470
have to kill him.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.610
Surprisingly, she sees that Caco is already
dead.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.180
She drops the weapon and it misfires.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.660
Not long after, she stumbles upon the house’s
backdoor, where numerous children are locked

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.180
up in cages, including Morro.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.130
She sets every single one free, and they make
their way outside so the four friends could

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.130
reunite.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.490
Estrella approaches Shine, who is in disbelief
that she made it out alive.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.460
She hands him back the weapon, but he walks
away.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.490
&nbsp;
The group returns to the hideout and celebrates

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.610
their victory, but Shine is still in a cranky
mood.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.610
He asks Estrella how she managed to pull off
the deal, and she simply says that she made

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.840
a wish.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.030
Just then, the phone rings and Shine sees
that a man named Tio is trying to reach him

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.560
from Caco's phone.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.639
He turns it off and walks away while Estrella
celebrates with the other children.

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:03.600
Later that night, Estrella wakes up and sees
insects coming out of her mouth.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.950
She then gets another vision of her mother.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.040
Through an empty cup, a voice warns her that
some people are coming for her.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.310
Estrella insists that she didn’t kill Caco.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.940
The voice then says that “the one who killed
him is looking for you," and she must bring

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.530
the man to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.330
&nbsp;
With the huascas on the lookout for them,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.790
the children decide to pack their stuff and
look for another home.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:28.070
Along the way, they pass by another gang’s
territory led by Brayan to drop the other

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.090
kids who are part of his gang.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.280
They are intimidated by the older members,
but Shine remains unshaken, informing them

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.699
that Estrella killed Caco.

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:39.800
They soon find an abandoned mansion that would
serve as their new hideout, and the group

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.290
is amazed by how big the place is.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:47.180
While alone in her room, the trail of blood
from earlier follows Estrella into the hallways.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.330
As she cleans up, the blood drenches the entire
room.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.479
As Estrella sees the bloodstains soaking up
the walls, she draws a line in the entrance

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.300
using the chalk to prevent the blood from
entering.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.540
From there, she sees Shine sobbing from a
distance and goes to him for consolation.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.870
The phone rings again and they receive a call
from Tio, who is furious about finding out

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.210
that the kids are behind his brother’s death.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.850
The two of them realize that Brayan snitched
on them, putting them in even more danger.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.509
Shine reveals that he keeps the phone because
it contains the only picture of his missing

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:17.509
mother.

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:20.449
Caco took the picture right after kidnapping
her.

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:22.479
&nbsp;
That afternoon, the children find a box of

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:25.160
soccer balls and decide to have fun with it.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.000
They play soccer, write jersey numbers on
their back, and decorate the balls to pass

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.350
the time.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.710
After all, they are still kids who want to
enjoy a little fun in life.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:38.380
Later that day, Morro comes crying to Estrella,
saying that his teddy got ruined, so she fixes

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.660
it for him.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.240
From a distance, Shine sees her comforting
the distressed Morro and looks at her with

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.340
admiration.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.180
Both of them share a conversation about how
a tiger’s abilities are one of a kind.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.530
Estrella says that she feels terrible for
tigers who get caught and put in the zoo,

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:56.870
but Shine tells her that she shouldn’t,
as tigers are not afraid of anything.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.389
Estrella browses through Caco’s phone but
doesn’t find anything.

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:04.400
Shine then shares about how the gang burned
their home and ruined his life completely.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.810
She tells him that the only picture of her
mother left is now at their abandoned home.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.889
Shine asks Estrella if she could use her final
wish to remove the burn marks on his face,

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:18.060
but she refuses to do so, claiming that something
bad happens whenever she makes a wish.&nbsp;

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.210
&nbsp;
To cheer her up, Shine goes to Estrella’s

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.660
house alone to retrieve a picture of her and
her mother.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.560
He soon gets spooked and rushes outside.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:31.110
Unfortunately, Tio, Caco’s brother, is waiting
outside and immediately captures him.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:35.529
While Estrella looks for Shine around the
house, she sees Tio just outside, so she hides

00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:37.199
in one of the rooms.

00:08:37.199 --> 00:08:41.129
She experiences another series of haunting
visions of her mother and other murder victims

00:08:41.129 --> 00:08:43.659
who demand that she brings the gang to them.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:47.550
Greatly frightened by this, Estrella runs
outside, where Tio catches her and brings

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.559
all the children to one area.

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:54.269
In an attempt to save his friends, Morro shoots
Tio, but he gets shot back, resulting in his

00:08:54.269 --> 00:08:55.670
instant death.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.670
Pop stabs Tio in the leg to avenge his friend
before carrying Morro with him as they flee

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.239
from the scene.&nbsp;

00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:03.149
&nbsp;
The group hides in another abandoned place

00:09:03.149 --> 00:09:06.120
where they lay Morro in his favorite blanket
and teddy.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.929
They break into tears as they worry about
how they can get away from the huascas.

00:09:09.929 --> 00:09:13.930
Shine and Estrella begin to wonder why the
gang wants to phone so much.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:19.550
They examine its contents and discover a video
recorded by Caco that shows Chino killing

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:20.610
a woman.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.199
To put an end to their struggle, they call
Chino through the phone and tries to strike

00:09:24.199 --> 00:09:25.480
up a deal.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.600
Chino instructs them to meet him tomorrow
in an old spa by the railroad at 7 A.M.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.490
If they give up the phone, the huascas will
stop bothering them, but if they don’t,

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.100
he will hunt them down.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.660
Chino reveals that he was the one who killed
Caco and not Estrella.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.990
The revelation angers Shine and he calls Estrella
a liar.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.110
He takes the remainder of his group and abandons
her.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.440
&nbsp;
That night, Estrella experiences a haunting

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.600
vision of Morro and his stuffed toy tiger.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.790
Confused, she looks over Morro’s dead body
and sees that it has risen while whispering

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:54.999
her name.

00:09:54.999 --> 00:09:59.249
She sees more dead people around the room,
who were also victims of the huascas, commanding

00:09:59.249 --> 00:10:00.839
her to bring Chino to them.

00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:05.600
She runs to a room and repeatedly says, “tigers
are not afraid," to calm herself, but the

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.149
souls manage to get to her through a drain.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:12.870
As she runs away, a tiny dragon, who seems
to be friendly, follows her around.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.029
Meanwhile, Tucsi steals the phone away from
Shine.

00:10:16.029 --> 00:10:19.920
He manages to convince Pop to turn it over
to the people, thinking that they might help

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.920
them.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.670
The two then show the footage to two police
officers, but they are hesitant to act when

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.700
they see who the murderer is.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.139
Instead of helping the boys, the officers
drive them away.

00:10:30.139 --> 00:10:34.550
Shine grabs the phone back and notices a bracelet
worn by the woman in the video, which is identical

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:38.959
to the one worn by Estrella's mother in the
picture he had found earlier.

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:42.320
Realizing that they should find Estrella,
they go back to where they last saw each other

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.589
but they only find Morro’s corpse.

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:46.920
The boys then decide to give their friend
a proper burial.&nbsp;

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.319
&nbsp;
In a playground, Morro’s ghost informs Estrella

00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:53.600
where she can find the boys, and she follows
his advice.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.529
As they reunite, Shine gives Estrella the
picture he got from their house, which makes

00:10:57.529 --> 00:10:58.929
her teary-eyed.

00:10:58.929 --> 00:11:03.670
She insists that they must meet with Chino
to save themselves and the group finally agrees.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:07.480
After burying Morro in a box that they throw
into the water, the children go to the meeting

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.519
with Tio, Chino, and another man, in an old
building.

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:14.999
Shine gives up the phone and claims that he
doesn’t know the password, Chino suddenly

00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:18.939
executes Tio and the other man before crushing
the phone with his foot.

00:11:18.939 --> 00:11:23.379
Pop and Tucsi run away to avoid the commotion,
while Chino explains to Estrella and Shine

00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:26.779
that he had honored their agreement to make
the huascas disappear.

00:11:26.779 --> 00:11:30.810
Recognizing the old building, Estrella insists
on looking for her mother.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:34.839
However, Shine reveals that Caco’s phone
is still in his hands because he gave Chino

00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:36.310
a different one.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:39.879
He then finally reveals that the woman in
the footage was her mother.

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:44.009
Shine reminds Estrella that wishes are not
real, but she still draws a line on Shine's

00:11:44.009 --> 00:11:47.360
cheek, making her final wish to make his scars
disappear.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.079
The trail of blood appears below him out of
nowhere, and Chino shoots him in the head

00:11:51.079 --> 00:11:53.879
after realizing the deception.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:57.519
Estrella runs around the building as she’s
chased by a bloodthirsty Chino, who grows

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:59.089
more agitated.

00:11:59.089 --> 00:12:02.569
She climbs up to the ceiling to avoid him
and crawls around the vents to see him from

00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:03.569
above.

00:12:03.569 --> 00:12:08.120
Morro’s teddy leads Estrella into a shaft
where she falls into a room full of dead bodies,

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.059
including that of her late mother.

00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:14.259
She tearfully reunites with her mother as
her bloody body briefly reanimates, transferring

00:12:14.259 --> 00:12:16.110
her bracelet to Estrella.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.309
She then uses the phone to lure Chino inside
the room to trap him inside, granting the

00:12:20.309 --> 00:12:21.769
victims’ wishes.

00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:25.540
She hears the ghost of Chino’s victims as
they finally get their revenge.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.220
As she escapes, she sees Shine’s ghost.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.989
She bids him farewell before she hands him
a lighter.

00:12:30.989 --> 00:12:35.420
Shine gives her one last look before going
back into the room and setting it on fire.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:48.110
As Estrella escapes, she encounters a real
tiger before finally arriving at an open field.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:49.110
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.110
