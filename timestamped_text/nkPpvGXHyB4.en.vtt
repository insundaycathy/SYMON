Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.029
Today I'm going to explain an action, adventure,
comedy, science fiction, and fantasy film

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.090
called “Love and Monsters."

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.940
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.830
Watch out and take care.&nbsp;

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.309
&nbsp;
In a futuristic world, the earth is experiencing

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.730
a monster apocalypse caused by the destruction
of a big asteroid, Agatha 6-1-6, and rockets

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.570
fired by humans in hopes of breaking it apart.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.759
The chemical compounds rained back down on
the surface, making some animals mutate into

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.189
cold-blooded monsters and wipe out most of
humanity.

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.899
Since then, the remaining people live in hiding,
mostly in underground bunkers, caves, and

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:37.120
panic rooms.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.410
The groups of people living under these conditions
are called “colonies.”

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.910
Among the survivors is Joel Dawson, an orphaned
teenager who lives in a bunker with several

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.170
people.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.489
Inside the place they call home, they grow
vegetables, tend to a cow for dairy supply,

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.340
and hunt the remaining food whenever they
go outside.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.250
Joel feels a sense of loneliness inside the
bunker.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.720
He is the only resident who is single; living
with couples makes him miss his girlfriend,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.310
Aimee, who got separated from him during the
apocalypse.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.440
To pass the time, he does target practice
for fun.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.470
In one of his sessions, he hears rumbling
noises from above which alarms everyone that

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.120
a creature may be near.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:22.550
Among the top fighters are Anna Lucia, Ray,
Tim, Connor, and Anderson, who refuse to let

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.360
Joel join them because of his lack of fighting
abilities.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.930
Upon his exit, Connor kisses his wife, Kala,
while Joel is still scared of the breach.&nbsp;

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.990
&nbsp;
On a monitor, the rest of the residents watch

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.930
the movements, where one of the fighters gets
eaten.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.120
Willing to help his friends, Joel follows
them despite his fears and lack of practice.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.260
Slowly, he walks to the exit, where a gigantic
insect-like creature hides behind the curtain.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.780
It gradually comes nearer, close enough to
kill him, but Joel can't move because of his

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.920
reactive immobility, which causes him to freeze
when he is afraid.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.740
To his surprise, the monster dies after Anna
Lucia shoots it just in time.&nbsp;

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.830
&nbsp;
Flashback to seven years ago, Joel and Aimee

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.820
go on a car date on the top of a hill where
Aimee gives him art materials.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.910
In the middle of their intimate moment, they
see flare guns fired at a great distance,

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.830
causing them to be alarmed and leave.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.410
To escape from the horrors of the present
time, Joel has developed a love for drawing

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.670
and coloring.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.260
In great detail, he illustrates the monsters
that he has seen in the last seven years using

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.090
Aimee’s gift and takes notes of how to kill
them.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.710
Despite him and Aimee being apart for such
a long time, they still communicate through

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.180
the radio and make the most out of what they
have.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.710
While on call, Aimee’s line gets disrupted
due to a bad signal, cutting their conversation

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.760
abruptly.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.440
On that same night, as Kala grieves over Connor’s
death, Joel recalls the day of the apocalypse

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.800
where he and Aimee shared their last embrace,
which gives him the idea of actually reuniting

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.810
with her.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.310
He brings this up during their colony meeting,
but the members warn him that the journey

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.450
is dangerous and it would take him at least
a week to get there.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.370
Determined to be with the love of his life,
Joel disregards their comments and packs his

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.340
things along with other weapons for defense.&nbsp;

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.150
&nbsp;
For the first time in years, Joel finally

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.650
basks in the sun and breathes fresh air.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.400
He takes some moments to let the fact that
he is out in the open sink in before studying

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.960
the map and starting his journey on foot.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.069
Along the way, he sees the world in ruins
and in complete disaster.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.970
Not long after, he comes across a house where
he enters to check if there are any signs

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.090
of life.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.040
He opens a fridge near the entrance and gets
frightened by a noise from inside it, so he

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.340
runs to the backyard, where a mossy pool is
located.&nbsp;

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.510
Three sets of eyes look at him from the water
before a giant toad reveals itself, trying

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.230
to stick its tongue on Joel.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.380
Luckily, a stray dog named Boy saves him,
which gives him time to run away, but it gets

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.840
a hold of him and drags him toward its mouth.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.430
Boy bites the monster toad’s tongue, making
Joel free as they run away to a small van,

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.740
which is the dog’s shelter.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.420
He spends the night in the minivan and resumes
his journey, but this time, with a friendly

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.480
companion.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.430
They immediately start to make their way through
a forest, where Joel falls into a deep hole

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.120
full of skeletons.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.900
He later finds out that the pit is infested
with worm monsters, but a rope comes from

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.569
above, rescuing him.

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:10.850
Two other survivors, Clyde and Minnow, finish
off the remaining monsters called Sand Gobblers

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.490
in the hole by throwing an explosive inside
after introducing themselves to Joel.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.840
He asks the duo if he could tag along, given
that they are quite skilled in slaying monsters,

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.410
to which Clyde agrees.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.680
All of them continue to get to know each other;
Minnow, who recently lost her father, is now

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.960
under the care of Clyde, who also lost his
child.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.570
Clyde reminds Joel that he should learn more
about fighting and survival for him to keep

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.810
up with them.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.850
He then surveys the area if there are any
monsters around and reveals that a “Chumbler”

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.460
is following Joel’s scent, and they should
not waste any time.&nbsp;

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.410
&nbsp;
Advancing to the woods, Minnow mocks Joel

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.960
for not having any valuable skills and for
having a girlfriend.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.850
While Clyde explains that Minnow is outspoken
because she has been through a lot.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.120
Out of nowhere, Clyde’s expression puts
Joel under the idea that a monster is behind

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.850
him, so he freezes again.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.440
Clyde instructs him to remove his shirt, but
it takes time for him to do it because of

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.090
his panic attack.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.930
Once he hands over his shirt, he turns around
to see a humongous snail leaving them alone

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.800
after Clyde puts Joel’s shirt by its shell.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.700
Minnow then informs him that not all monstrous
creatures are hostile, telling him, “You

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.440
can always tell in their eyes.”

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.970
According to Clyde, the snail is a blessing
in disguise because it now has Joel’s scent,

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.220
leading the Chumbler away from them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.660
&nbsp;
They stopover at a nearby cave; Joel shows

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.400
his illustrations to Clyde, adding notes to
his descriptions.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.120
He shares a bit of his parents, which puts
him in a gloomy mood just as they are about

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.150
to head to their next location.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.200
For the next few days, Minnow trains Joel
to become more precise in shooting with a

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.370
bow, and the two of them become closer.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.340
Clyde also teaches him basic survival skills
that he missed out on in the last years and

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.860
lessons on which monsters to look out for.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.960
Eventually, they have to part ways as Joel
needs to find Aimee while Clyde and Minnow

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.371
find more safety in the mountains.

00:05:52.371 --> 00:05:56.270
The two insist on Joel staying with them,
but he loves Aimee so much that he would rather

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.140
risk his life seeking her.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.900
They split up and go in opposite directions
right after Clyde gives him a grenade if ever

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.480
he needs it.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.100
&nbsp;
Deep into the woods, Boy becomes terrified,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.890
sensing that danger is coming their way.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.600
It hides under a boat, but just as Joel comes
to get him out, he sees tentacles coming from

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.860
below the ground.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.050
Fearfully, he brings out his crossbow, but
the monster smacks him out of the way and

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.199
sees that Boy is trapped by a giant centipede
while it still takes cover.

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.180
He realizes that he is freezing at the moment
despite his desire to get up and save his

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.180
dog.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.100
Dramatically, he recalls the tragic accident
that happened to his parents that entrapped

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.669
them inside the car.

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:36.150
This caused his mother and father to be crushed
to death by one of the monsters on the day

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.790
of the apocalypse.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.350
Joel snaps out of his fear and kills the centipede
with his crossbow.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.980
Boy happily runs to him and is comforted by
Joel’s embrace.&nbsp;

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.960
&nbsp;
On a rainy night,&nbsp; they find shelter in an

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.840
abandoned motel where a robot named Mavis
activates.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.580
Joel used to own these robots back when he
was still in the bunker, making him aware

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.290
of how to interact with it.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.350
The artificial intelligence of Mavis is exceptional
and highly human-like.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.610
It even offers him its remaining power supply
for Joel to fix his radio for him to contact

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.259
Aimee again briefly.

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:11.759
He uses the robot’s system to power the
radio, and he finally reaches Aimee, but their

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:15.210
conversation ends abruptly because of the
limited power source.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.960
Mavis has 15 more minutes before her battery
completely dies, so they both sit outside

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.670
while it shows him a slideshow of his parents.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.150
Realizing that he has not overcome grief,
he sobs in the arms of Mavis while they watch

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.950
vibrant Sky Jellies that are harmless.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.900
Despite the rather sweet moment, Mavis shuts
down, and Joel needs to continue his journey.&nbsp;

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.380
&nbsp;
The following morning, Joel and Boy come across

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.490
another hole, where Sand Gobblers usually
stay.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:44.169
They quickly walk away from it, but Joel sees
a creature emerging from the ground from behind—a

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:45.170
queen Sand Gobbler.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.900
It chases them relentlessly into the woods,
causing Joel to crash near a river, but he

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.580
and Boy manage to hide in an empty tree trunk.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.580
The sound-sensitive monster comes right behind
them, but it crawls away after thinking that

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.169
no one is there.

00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:02.930
Once the coast is clear, Boy barks after spotting
its safety blanket blown by the wind, giving

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.509
away its position.

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:08.820
The monster crawls quickly back to them, but
Joel manages to kill the queen sand gobbler

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.520
with the only grenade he has.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.680
It blasts into pieces, making Joel succeed
with another kill.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.669
He ends up in the river and swims back to
land only to find poisonous leeches all around

00:08:18.669 --> 00:08:19.990
his body.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.830
After removing all of it, he yells at Boy
for putting both of them in danger, causing

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.710
the dog to run away.&nbsp;

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.509
&nbsp;
The leeches have caused Joel to hallucinate

00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:29.259
and lie on the ground.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:34.379
At this moment, he struggles to feel in control
of his body when Aimee appears out of nowhere.

00:08:34.379 --> 00:08:38.560
At last, he feels more successful than ever
but becomes unconscious again because of the

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.019
severe poison.

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:44.169
He gains full consciousness in Aimee’s colony,
where she leads a group of elderly survivors

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:46.029
who heavily rely on her.

00:08:46.029 --> 00:08:49.929
Unlike his colony, theirs is located on a
beach and is more spacious.

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:58.199
Outside, he meets Dana, Rocko, and Brooks,
who they all call Cap, who takes the lead

00:08:58.199 --> 00:09:00.089
in his colony on a yacht.

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:03.899
While Aimee packs her things to leave their
unsafe colony, she confesses that she is glad

00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:07.779
to reunite with Joel but has become a whole
different person, and she is still mourning

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:08.819
someone.

00:09:08.819 --> 00:09:13.019
Taken aback by her confession, Joel realizes
that Aimee cannot reciprocate the love that

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:14.790
he has for her.&nbsp;

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.350
&nbsp;
Moments later, Cap, his crew, and the rest

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.520
of the colony discuss their descent the following
day, but Joel is still unconvinced about the

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.860
idea.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.970
Because of this, he uses a radio to contact
his colony, and one of the elderly serves

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.490
him some food, ordered by the captain.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.240
While waiting for the radio to reach the other
end, he looks at the map that his colony has

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.439
made for him; in there, he finds heartfelt
messages from them and realizes that it is

00:09:37.439 --> 00:09:39.100
where he truly belongs.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.449
Finally, he reaches his colony to update them
about his adventure and learns that it has

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:46.579
become extremely unsafe and that they too
must leave.

00:09:46.579 --> 00:09:49.769
He makes up his mind that he should leave
and packs up his stuff.

00:09:49.769 --> 00:09:54.009
However, the food served to him catches his
attention; he browses through pages of his

00:09:54.009 --> 00:09:58.259
book and finds out that the berries are poisonous,
which means that Cap has bad intentions toward

00:09:58.259 --> 00:09:59.519
Aimee’s colony.

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:03.470
He runs to warn Aimee, but she gets knocked
unconscious because of the drinks, as well

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.939
as the elderly.

00:10:04.939 --> 00:10:08.320
Just as she is about to pass out, Dana punches
him, causing him to blackout.&nbsp;

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.010
&nbsp;
The next day, Joel, Aimee, and the rest of

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.110
her colony wake up as captives tied up on
the beach.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.860
Cap reveals that his crew is there to steal
food and supplies since their yacht is towed

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.540
by a gigantic crab monster controlled with
an electric chain.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:27.269
He releases the crab to feed on the old colonists,
but Joel and Aimee free themselves.

00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:31.139
The agitated Aimee charges at Rocko after
she dodges his shots.

00:10:31.139 --> 00:10:35.050
The crab runs toward Joel, but he manages
to keep it at a distance.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:39.230
He then has the opportunity to kill it, but
Cap electrocutes the creature, causing Joel

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.200
to be thrown across the beach.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.439
The creature becomes more agitated, and just
as the commotion gets bigger, Boy returns

00:10:45.439 --> 00:10:46.589
to help.

00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:50.989
As Dana and Aimee still get on with their
brawl, Cap becomes more impatient and decides

00:10:50.989 --> 00:10:54.499
to deal with the matter in his own hands,
knocking Aimee down.

00:10:54.499 --> 00:10:58.619
Joel finds the opportunity to kill the crab
after it picks him up, but he realizes that

00:10:58.619 --> 00:11:03.029
it is neither dangerous nor hostile by looking
into its eyes, so he shoots the electrified

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:04.949
chain, completely freeing it.

00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:09.579
The giant crab leaves Joel and the colony
unharmed and instead kills Cap and the crew,

00:11:09.579 --> 00:11:11.239
sinking the rundown yacht in the process.&nbsp;

00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:14.019
&nbsp;
Now that they are all safe, he bids goodbye

00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:17.480
to Aimee and shares a romantic kiss before
leaving with Boy.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.329
Aimee promises that she will find him, and
just like that, they part ways once again.

00:11:22.329 --> 00:11:26.369
Feeling accomplished, he treks back to the
bunker, where his colony is ecstatic to see

00:11:26.369 --> 00:11:27.619
him safe.

00:11:27.619 --> 00:11:31.360
They all decide to head to the mountains,
tired of hiding underground.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.939
On the radio, Joel tells his story and inspires
other colonies to go back to the surface.

00:11:35.939 --> 00:11:40.249
As everyone makes their way north, Clyde and
Minnow, who are already in the mountains,

00:11:40.249 --> 00:11:52.839
listen to him as well, jokingly wondering
if Joel can survive the next journey.
