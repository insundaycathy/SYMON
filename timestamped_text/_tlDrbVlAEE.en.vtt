00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.960
A class of assassin students have received the&nbsp;
task to assassinate their teacher the rules&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.960
are simple take out Korosensei before the term&nbsp;
is over, otherwise the world will be destroyed&nbsp;

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.480
we will look at the attempts of&nbsp;
the students to beat their teacher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.080
look at the mistakes they make and&nbsp;
figure out what could have been done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:43.840
to win the fight faster and better to ultimately&nbsp;
beat Koro sensei in assassination classroom&nbsp;

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.840
our government once again failed miserably&nbsp;
and decided to push away their responsibility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.840
onto a class full of delinquents the duty of&nbsp;
each student is to attempt to assassinate him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.000
normal weapons don't work only highly specialized&nbsp;
weaponry crafted by masters that only use the best&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.320
of materials will be able to harm Korosensei&nbsp;
Yes, i'm talking BB pellets and gummy knives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.600
the rules are simple kill Korosensei in&nbsp;
any way you can think of most of you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.120
this is easier said than done and precisely&nbsp;
because of that we need Mrs. Irina Jelavic

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.080
A professional hitman hired by the government&nbsp;
to kill Korosensei now whatever you might have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.760
against live-action adaptations I f-ing love them
okay but how do we kill a horny,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.320
godspeed inherent thing that notoriously dodged&nbsp;
every attack attempted by anyone before especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.600
as mere high schoolers well one of the biggest&nbsp;
advantages we have is that he would never lay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.360
hands on his students another fact that we should&nbsp;
seriously consider is that we are very close to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.360
him and gain his trust easily if i were one of the&nbsp;
students i would do it exactly like Nagisa does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.680
i will note down every little thing&nbsp;
about Korosensei that catches my eye&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.240
this is the best way to go before you&nbsp;
start bombing your attempts which in return&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.040
makes it more and more difficult each time
one person should stay in the back observing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.040
Korosensei's reactions closely perhaps even try&nbsp;
and capture everything with a high speed camera&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.480
meanwhile the others of the class should do their&nbsp;
deed and try out a variety of different attacks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.720
i think it should be clear that shooting&nbsp;
bullet balls directly at him has virtually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.400
no effect because of his speed therefore it&nbsp;
would make sense to try out different tactics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.120
how does he react to liquids, differences&nbsp;
in temperature what about any other element&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.840
how does he respond to physical exhaustion,&nbsp;
verbal abuse and any other attempts to slow down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.240
his psychological and physiological capabilities
it is safe to say that there are countless options&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.400
to try out i would spreadsheet the sh*t out of&nbsp;
those, one week five experiments one day at a time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.080
with full dedication and enthusiasm just like Rock&nbsp;
Lee had for his training with this strategy there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.800
is no way you will not find something quickly&nbsp;
if it turns out that all of your approaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.720
bear no fruits then it would become increasingly&nbsp;
obvious that he has no weaknesses to begin with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:23.920
but we all know he has them our students come&nbsp;
up with the idea to lure Korosensei into a trap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.200
using adult magazines i don't know who&nbsp;
thought of this idea but give that man a medal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.760
this dude understands that in order to prevail in&nbsp;
life you must think outside the box the problem is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.880
once he is trapped our students returned to&nbsp;
being dull idiots and try to shoot him down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.360
with BB projectiles - again i don't get that if&nbsp;
you shot a trillion bullets at something without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.960
success for multiple days straight why would&nbsp;
you even bother how did this quote go again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.520
"insanity is doing the same thing over and&nbsp;
over again while expecting different results"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.960
yeah the smarter way would have been to prepare&nbsp;
the net with sharp objects made with the material&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.160
that can actually harm him in a later scene&nbsp;
we see Akabane Karma has stuck shards like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.760
these onto his hand shook Korosensei's arm and&nbsp;
actually achieved harming him the point here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.000
is the only weakness that we so far have figured&nbsp;
out is the obscene portrayal of the opposite sex&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.600
therefore i am making the following proposition in&nbsp;
order to successfully take him out we need Irina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.440
Jelavic bare herself for the sake of humanity&nbsp;
there is no chance Korosensei could withstand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.400
the temptation and fully lose control even&nbsp;
for just a second which means we could finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.000
blast the bullet ball right through his big round&nbsp;
smiley head and save humanity once again through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.080
the combined efforts of men and women if there&nbsp;
are any people opposing the strategy fight me

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.520
Do you remember the bully of your school? well he&nbsp;
was nothing compared to the bullies in class 3e&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.960
those people will strap homemade bombs around&nbsp;
your torso and send you off without even promising&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.040
you a thousand virgins that's some cold a** sh*t&nbsp;
who has the audacity to do a cruel act like this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.360
without even attempting to comfort the victim&nbsp;
with at least one virgin exactly nobody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.800
anyway Nagisa goes off pretending he has&nbsp;
finished the paper while hiding a knife behind it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.720
Korosensei actually takes the bait and overlooks&nbsp;
the bomb strapped onto Nagisa that was a pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.320
smart move not gonna lie but that too could have&nbsp;
been much more efficient if the students thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.520
it through and perhaps had a second plan on&nbsp;
top of it instead of just one single blow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.200
but i guess you don't become a bully when you are&nbsp;
sufficiently intelligent anyway you see Korosensei&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.800
generally trusts his students therefore if you can&nbsp;
manage to build a bomb filled with anti-teacher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.000
pellets combined with a long-range activation&nbsp;
device then i would recommend you build as many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
bombs as you can and hide them inside classroom&nbsp;
furniture if you can't decide on any good hideouts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.760
i would suggest you go check out Zankyou no terror
since the classroom of class 3e is in an old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.200
shabby and very insecure building it would be very&nbsp;
easy to get in there when no class is being held&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.240
personally i would prepare cluster bombs filled&nbsp;
with anti-teacher ammunition that would cover a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.400
wide area upon detonation Korosensei is fast but&nbsp;
he cannot teleport keep in mind that any failed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.080
attempt to murder your teacher is that he develops&nbsp;
heightened awareness every time thereafter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.960
meaning if you have tried to take him out with a&nbsp;
hidden bomb but failed it's pretty safe to assume&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.560
that this option is now gone too the government&nbsp;
came up with another possibly stupid idea to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.480
the job done this ladies and gentlemen is&nbsp;
why live action adaptations are f-ing weird&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.840
but at the same time so surreal&nbsp;
that it's actually fun to watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.520
even though you constantly bend your head,&nbsp;
lower your eyebrows and think what the f*ck

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.880
now mind you this teenage AI girl has&nbsp;
four gatling guns blasting at Korosensei&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.800
basically another futile attempt to assassinate&nbsp;
him but this scene made me wonder how fast do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.480
those projectiles actually fly turns out that&nbsp;
most projectiles travel about one mile per second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.800
which is pretty fast but nowhere&nbsp;
near Korosensei's hyper velocity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.480
however some crazy scientists back in the 90s at&nbsp;
the sandia national laboratories have developed a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:35.840
magnetic field that shoots pellets at 10 miles per&nbsp;
second yeah that's that's freaking insane i know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.760
that's almost twice as fast as Korosensei's top&nbsp;
speed the only downside of that quote-unquote&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.080
fastest gun in the world is it 60 feet long which&nbsp;
is about 18 meters so, so screw that but our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:57.840
government has yet another plan other than teenage&nbsp;
gunslinger girls blasting bullets at Korosensei

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.160
let me introduce you to Itona supposedly&nbsp;
Korosensei's brother now i don't know about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:16.560
y'all but he looks like a non-binary metal gear&nbsp;
solid 4 boss don't be deceived by this kid's size&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:22.400
he has pretty big balls he challenges Korosensei&nbsp;
to a duel he actually had a real chance to win&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.840
this fight but his cockiness wasn't any support&nbsp;
he could have won if he took it more seriously

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:37.120
okay so by now we have found countless ways on&nbsp;
how to efficiently fight Kooroensei and perhaps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.640
finally finish the job his weakness for voluptuous&nbsp;
female bodies combined with the wide available&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:48.080
selection of japanese JAV merchandise is the&nbsp;
perfect combination to strike merciless with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.520
the power of a sexy attack here goes my&nbsp;
plan we divide the class into four groups&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:59.440
the first group consisting of males, tomboys and&nbsp;
any other life form sexually attracted to women&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:05.120
goes for a shopping spree through Kabukicho the&nbsp;
goal is to make kinky shop owners rich and collect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.960
a wide range of profound and culturally&nbsp;
important things like posters, magazines,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.160
pictures, Dakimakuras, voiceovers, videotapes,&nbsp;
general merchandise and anything else that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:22.000
might be able to get your hands on that could&nbsp;
beat Korosensei mind you this is solely intended&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.400
for professional use and will be eligible for tax&nbsp;
refund the second group stays behind and prepares&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:34.640
the room in a way that Korosensei cannot escape&nbsp;
once our surprise hits here's how to do that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.760
cut anti-teacher fabric in large measurements&nbsp;
and hide them inside the walls under the floor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:45.120
and inside the ceiling if you don't have the&nbsp;
possibility to hide them inside make use of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:51.360
double wall wallpaper or anything else that is&nbsp;
time efficient and of good enough quality it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.880
very important to dispose of any signs that such&nbsp;
preparations have been made so please double check&nbsp;

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.000
The third group will be the scouts hiding&nbsp;
in bushes and trees around the building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.520
trying to spot any suspicious activity that could&nbsp;
prevent our plan from succeeding they get a pair&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:14.960
of binoculars walkie-talkie and seaweed snacks the&nbsp;
fourth and arguably most important group will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:21.360
our special forces they will only be activated&nbsp;
when all is lost and we are in need of drastic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:27.920
action our highly skilled naturally talented&nbsp;
special forces are the hotties of the class they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:33.760
will hide in designated areas and storm out naked&nbsp;
when the sign is being given listen i know that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:39.120
might be not the most desirable outcome for some&nbsp;
but the main weakness of Korosensei is obvious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.240
and the prevention of armageddon more important&nbsp;
than individual dignity once the preparation has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.120
been completed the anti-teacher adult merge&nbsp;
will then be hidden throughout the classroom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:55.200
behind the blackboard under the tables inside&nbsp;
helium-filled balloons and in form of posters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.200
rolled up on the walls that can be pulled down&nbsp;
simultaneously with just one swishhhhh through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.320
all the beautiful merch hanging from the walls&nbsp;
Korosensei's brain will overreact and a huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:11.760
overflow of dopamine will be triggered resulting&nbsp;
in a severe loss of focus this in combination with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.120
the anti-teacher fabric inside the walls will&nbsp;
keep him sufficiently trapped if he somehow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:23.520
miraculously keeps his cool our hot special forces&nbsp;
will join the party at which point it's over&nbsp;

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.360
in my humble opinion this will&nbsp;
suffice in taking him down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.160
because he doesn't stand a chance to notice the&nbsp;
student with the best aim taking a shot at him

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.240
if you have a goal it is important to have&nbsp;
multiple strategies in mind to reach it&nbsp;

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.440
if you just focus on one way and you miss it you&nbsp;
will have to start all over from scratch but if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.480
you hold multiple strategies at the same time you&nbsp;
ensure backup if things won't go straight from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:01.040
beginning even though you might lose efficiency at&nbsp;
first in the long term it will pay out Korosensei&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:07.040
might be the target of each student to kill but he&nbsp;
also is their teacher he encourages them not just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:13.040
to be more creative in their attempts to beat him&nbsp;
but also become better people Korosensei is really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:18.160
great example of what it means to be a good&nbsp;
teacher sometimes bluntness and force are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.040
necessary but more often than not encouragement&nbsp;
and belief are the values that make the real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.240
difference the downside of having such a good&nbsp;
teacher is the emotional attachment we naturally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:34.400
build to assassinate someone is probably easier&nbsp;
when you are emotionally detached and reserved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.920
but if your target and you go sip mocktails after&nbsp;
class and have fancy sleepovers every now and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.320
all the while plotting his assassination&nbsp;
i don't think that will make it easier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.560
therefore one of the most important aspects&nbsp;
our students seem to miss is the strong&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.720
bond they are developing which they probably&nbsp;
shouldn't if they are serious about killing him&nbsp;

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.200
our students enjoy the fireworks and&nbsp;
celebrate the summer they were taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.240
a break from their attempts to beat Korosensei&nbsp;
i think taking a break every now and then is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.640
very important thing and should be part&nbsp;
of every strategy going at something at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:11.600
full speed over and over again won't help&nbsp;
unless you're an idiot or one of these dudes

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.160
Take a break enjoy yourself&nbsp;
and take it easy for a few days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.560
this not only lets you recalibrate and find&nbsp;
new strength but it also lets you come up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.120
with new strategies and ideas on how to&nbsp;
finish the task you have signed up for&nbsp;

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.760
the students of class 3e have had countless&nbsp;
strategies that didn't work out well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.760
either they were futile and attempt&nbsp;
or just not very well thought through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:47.840
let's check out the advantages our students&nbsp;
could derive from this quick but important break

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.520
looks like they got some motivation huh see what a&nbsp;
break can do don't forget your snickers if you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.800
already at it in the next part of the movie&nbsp;
Korosensei has lost a bet and agreed to having&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:14.560
some of his tentacles be temporarily removed which&nbsp;
results in a significant decrease of his speed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.240
but it seems like our students did&nbsp;
not just wait for this moment to come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.920
no they actually put some thought and effort&nbsp;
in as well which is a refreshing surprise they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.960
built a giant homemade fortress that looks&nbsp;
like a castle of one of my childhood dreams&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.120
which is pretty impressive they have&nbsp;
built it in a way that it's practically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:38.880
completely anti-Korosensei i am glad that&nbsp;
this was made in 2015 otherwise we would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.840
have class 3e being cancelled because&nbsp;
of an anime character discrimination

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.280
they almost ended up killing Korosensei&nbsp;
which resulted in a huge explosion that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:04.240
destroyed basically the whole construction&nbsp;
Korosensei survived and took refuge in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.800
pretty epic transparent crystal sphere&nbsp;
that i would instantly buy if i could&nbsp;

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.840
he explains that this is his ultimate defense&nbsp;
and that not even a nuclear bomb could leave a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:19.200
scratch on it the students probably thought am&nbsp;
i a joke to you bro at the same time a bunch of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:24.160
bad people arrive while some of the students&nbsp;
collapse apparently they got poisoned by one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.520
of these evil dudes magically from afar&nbsp;
if you don't know who they are i am sorry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.920
i skipped that part of the movie because i&nbsp;
didn't know it will become important however&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:39.280
the non-binary metal gear solid boy makes a&nbsp;
comeback and starts chasing down Nagisa and Karma&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.760
our two characters escape and climb up a&nbsp;
distribution tower but let's be honest here for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.640
a second they have zero chance against a little&nbsp;
kid strength wise and Korosensei is neutralized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:54.000
for the time being that means the only chance they&nbsp;
would have would be to outsmart that little kid&nbsp;

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.960
since he and Korosensei have the same type of&nbsp;
body they also have the same kind of weakness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:04.080
this is the time to pull out your notes and&nbsp;
come up with a plan at first i thought climbing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:09.440
up this tower is probably the dumbest idea one&nbsp;
could possibly come up with but they proved me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:15.120
wrong when they reach the top and almost get&nbsp;
killed by the final boss it starts to rain&nbsp;

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.840
being on top of this tower makes it impossible&nbsp;
to escape and since rain is one of the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.480
prominent weaknesses of those entities&nbsp;
the fight is pretty much won by our heroes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.920
in the end Nagisa hugs the kid gently cuts&nbsp;
off his tentacles and whispers softly that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:37.520
he can join their class in the next term amazing&nbsp;
apparently love is all you need Nagisa and karma&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.240
storm back to the school where the other dude&nbsp;
is still being a big a**hole turns out he wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.680
to kill Korosensei so he can earn the props
he pressures our students into handing over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.680
Korosensei in return of the antidotes&nbsp;
to save their poisoned classmates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.680 --> 00:17:03.840
however Nagisa tricks him with fake&nbsp;
humility and well his face was priceless

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:15.280
Everyone is having a blast, Irina still looking&nbsp;
hot as f-ck Korosensei is safe and sound until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.920
eventually the ministry of defense joins&nbsp;
the party and takes Korosensei into custody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.040
everyone gets flown into a secret military&nbsp;
base where they are allowed to witness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:30.800
cora sensei's last moments he gets covered with&nbsp;
anti-teacher substance which in theory prevents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:36.560
him from escaping at last a huge bomb goes off&nbsp;
taking his life finally everyone is cheering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:43.600
apart from our students which is understandable&nbsp;
tears flow until our beloved Korosensei of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.080
makes the weirdest comeback possible and&nbsp;
everything goes back to all beautiful and sweet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.600
again like it used to be the next term is about to&nbsp;
start and we can't wait to see the students go all

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.840
again
