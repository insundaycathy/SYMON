hears the footsteps of group approaching,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.520
and he sneaks outside with a pipe, and then&nbsp;
he makes a phone call, but no one answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.200
One of the group members starts&nbsp;
poking iron rod in the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.040
then the priest aggressively grabs an axe, and he&nbsp;
starts destroying the hideout, making it collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.920
The man beneath the ground uses a smoke&nbsp;
grenade to escape and cause distraction.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.360
He then runs from there is sports mode, within the&nbsp;
underground tunnels followed by the armed priest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.520
He sneaks out and runs from there, after a bit,&nbsp;
he stops and he taps on the ground notifying his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.840
friend, Ludwig, about the intruders, and&nbsp;
warns him to answer the phone next time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.560
He then taps the ground again, and he notifies&nbsp;
another friend, Pascal, and warns him to answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.680
his phone calls. The man is named Camiel,&nbsp;
and he makes his way to the Gas Station.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.160
There, he washes his face and then he&nbsp;
makes his way to a rich neighbourhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.800
He goes to a mansion, and then he asks the lady,&nbsp;
if he can take a shower there? She closes the door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.800
on his face, disappointed he walks from there to&nbsp;
another mansion. There, he observes the mansion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.160
that it has a guest house as well. He&nbsp;
rings the bell and, Richard, opens the door&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.920
and he introduces himself as fake name, Anton,&nbsp;
and he asks him, if he can take a shower there?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.680
Richard denies and he wants him to leave,&nbsp;
but Anton says that he is just a traveller,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.440
who needs some help. Richard closes the door, then&nbsp;
Anton claims that he is friend of Richard’s wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.200
They both open the door this time, and she&nbsp;
cannot recall knowing anyone named Anton. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.640
claims further that he knows, Marina, and she&nbsp;
nursed him while he was in hospital. Richard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.400
pushes him away, and Anton asks, if he is doing&nbsp;
this because he knows his wife? Richard heats up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.880
and he starts kicking him, he then beats&nbsp;
him with a stick, like a snake in the grass.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.960
Later, he asks her how she knows him, and&nbsp;
if she is hiding things behind his back?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.840
She denies everything, and she reminds him&nbsp;
about their promise of always being honest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.520
However, she feels bad for the homeless man, and&nbsp;
she suggests Richard should have helped someone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:49.520
in need, and he leaves. Later that day, the&nbsp;
babysitter for the kids, Stine, arrives there and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.120
Richard is seen reading a story to his kids. He&nbsp;
then informs Marina, that he has some urgent work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.240
Once he leaves, Marina sees a light, so she sneaks&nbsp;
out and she goes to the guest house, but she finds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.800
it empty. She then opens the Garage, and she finds&nbsp;
him there. She then takes him to the guest house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.640
and she does the medic for him. The babysitter&nbsp;
Stine shows up there, and Marina orders her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.120
not to tell anyone that she is going to allow&nbsp;
the homeless men to take a shower there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.600
Later, Anton is seen enjoying the tub and having&nbsp;
a meal. She then gives him a pair of clothes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.240
and she is driven by guilt that Richard harmed&nbsp;
an innocent man, so she allows him to stay in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.160
guest house. The next day, their elder daughter&nbsp;
is sick, so she stays at home and Stine takes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.600
kids out. She sees Anton sneaking on them,&nbsp;
she tells her mom that she saw a magician.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.280
Then, Marina goes to the guest house, she suggests&nbsp;
that he should leave, and she can drop him to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.800
private clinic if needed, he denies it by saying,&nbsp;
his heart is in pain from the misbehaviour and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.680
promises to stay locked in the room, he begs&nbsp;
to stay for few more days and have some food,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.400
she agrees and she leaves. Anton gets a text&nbsp;
saying, Has the time come yet? He replies not yet.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.720
Later that day, Anton is taking a&nbsp;
bath, and Marina’s daughter shows up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.080
he offers her to read a fairy-tale and then he&nbsp;
asks her to leave. Richard comes back to home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.160
and he gives Marina, a diamond necklace.&nbsp;
However, she looks more disappointed than happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.240
Later that night, Marina goes&nbsp;
to the guest house with dinner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.760
she goes inside but the room is empty, she finds&nbsp;
a pair of binoculars there and she realizes that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.200
their house is fully seen from there and she&nbsp;
leaves. Meanwhile, Anton is inside the house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.200
and he is reading bedtime story to all three&nbsp;
kids as he promised earlier. Marina shows up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.880
and she asks him to take her seriously&nbsp;
and not to enter the house as he promised.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.120
Later, Marina dreams that Richard is beating her&nbsp;
in a very brutal manner. Anton is seen seating on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.040
top of Marina while she sleeps. The next day, she&nbsp;
goes to the guest house, but she finds it empty,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.080
she then goes to the woods, and she sees Anton&nbsp;
leaving, she asks him, why is he leaving? he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.800
claims that he is tired of living inside the room,&nbsp;
and he wants to eat food with them on the table,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.000
she says it’s not possible, but she wants him to&nbsp;
stay, then he inquiries about the family gardener.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.760
Later, he calls a woman named Ilonka and Brenda,&nbsp;
he tells them about an assignment that they need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.720
to do. He then takes some poison out&nbsp;
of his bag, and he prepares a weapon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.800
He then observes the gardener, and soon he shoots&nbsp;
the gardener with his weapon, the gardener is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.080
suffering, and he falls to the ground. Anton&nbsp;
goes to him, and he offers him to take him home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.480
and then he drives gardener’s car and arrive to&nbsp;
his home. Later, his wife is putting a warm towel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.840
on his head, Anton claims that he already called a&nbsp;
team of doctors, and they should be on their way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.760
In the wife’s absence, he knocks the gardener&nbsp;
down, and both women called earlier, shows up, as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.720
a pair of doctors. Brenda is pretending to check&nbsp;
the gardener and Anton takes off his tie. Sooner,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.320
Ilonka strangles her from behind, killing her.&nbsp;
Then they take two buckets, and put the couple’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.600
head in it, and they fill it with cement. At home,&nbsp;
Marina finds a shoe and she starts collecting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.960
everything, she then gets rid of the shoe. Richard&nbsp;
arrives there and he is shocked to see his wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.200
collecting dirt, he suggests that they should&nbsp;
leave it on their gardener, but she claims that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.240
the gardener resigned from the work today. He&nbsp;
cannot believe it, so she shuts him by a kiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.480
He tells her how much she means to&nbsp;
him, and their all three kids show up.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.360
Later, the wicked group is seen&nbsp;
watching tv in gardener’s home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.680
The next day, the group uses gardener’s car, and&nbsp;
they go to a lake, there they dump their bodies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.680
with cement bucket. Few hours later, Pascal gets&nbsp;
a call from Anton, and they make a sinister plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.760
The next day, Ludwig and Pascal take down a man&nbsp;
who tries to come to the house for a gardener job,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.480
another applicant goes to the house, but&nbsp;
Richard says the N word and closes the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.600
Later that day, Anton is in a fresh look,&nbsp;
and he identifies himself as Camiel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.520
Richard cannot identify him, and he invites&nbsp;
him inside the house. Marina recognizes him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.200
she is impressed, and she seems excited. Stine&nbsp;
is on the way with kids, and little girl notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.960
a body outside the house. Upon arrival, she goes&nbsp;
to the woods, and she finds the man badly injured.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.120
She then brings a giant stone, and she kills&nbsp;
him with it. In the house, Richard shows him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.400
the house and hires him for the job. That night,&nbsp;
Marina finds her daughter’s favourite teddy bear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.160
torned apart. The next day, she asks her&nbsp;
who did it? her daughter is aggressive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.040
and she says it was fun doing it, which&nbsp;
makes Marina to yell at her. In meantime,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.760
the ladies dump one more body in the lake,&nbsp;
and then Ilonka takes a bath in the same lake.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.760
At the house, Excited Marina goes to Camiel, and&nbsp;
she asks him, how many names he has? Strangely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.960
he replies that he is busy, and he needs to&nbsp;
concentrate on work. She brought food for him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.360
but he is not a simp, and he is not interested&nbsp;
anymore. Later, Stine goes to Marina, she wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.000
a leave, since her boyfriend is a soldier and&nbsp;
he is not with her most of the time, but Marina&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.920
denies it by saying she needs to meet him first.&nbsp;
Sooner, Marina goes to the guest house, and Camiel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.880
demands that he needs his team of gardeners,&nbsp;
and then he introduces Ludwig and Pascal to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.400
Later that night, Camiel is telling the kids a&nbsp;
story, against their faith to manipulate them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.480
Then Camiel is sitting on top of Marina,&nbsp;
while the team enters the house. She wakes up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.520
and she starts arguing with Richard, she claims&nbsp;
that he was beating her again in her nightmare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.200
and then she leaves. She then goes to Camiel at&nbsp;
the guest house, and she wants him to kiss her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.840
but he is not interested, and he asks her&nbsp;
to have patience and she’ll get everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.800
The next day, Stine didn’t show up to&nbsp;
work, and the kids are late for school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.120
So, Ludwig and Pascal take them. Then they&nbsp;
both take them to an abandoned bunker,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.360
inside, they offer them some drinks&nbsp;
and Ludwig opens a pair of Scalpels.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:17.200
At the house, Stine brings her boyfriend, Arthur,&nbsp;
to meet Marina. The kids are back but they look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.000
tired and sleepy, Richard gets home for Lunch,&nbsp;
he orders to have some flowers on his dining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.320
table. So, Stine is sent to the backyard, there,&nbsp;
Pascal tells her that he will only give her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:34.640
flowers if she goes inside the guest house. Later,&nbsp;
it’s been hours and Stine is not back, so Arthur&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.080
goes to check on her, but she is not in the guest&nbsp;
house. She comes back with a different attitude,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.240
Pascal did magic on her, and now she is&nbsp;
aggressive, Arthur tries to comfort her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:50.080
but she is aggressive. Then Richard corners&nbsp;
Marina and he gives her a bad news that he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.200
fired from work, and she leaves. Later at&nbsp;
dinner, everyone seems strange and upset,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.560
Marina asks Arthur what his father does for&nbsp;
living, he replies his father owns The Q company,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.600
upon hearing that, Richard rages up and he&nbsp;
reveals it to everyone that his father fired him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.840
and Richard starts insulting Arthur. Then they&nbsp;
both get into a fight and Ludwig takes him down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.760
Stine is compelled by Pascal and she wants to&nbsp;
cuddle with him, but he calmly rejects her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:23.360
and he asks her to leave. In meantime, Ludwig&nbsp;
dumps unconscious Arthur on the side of the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.960
The next day, Stine informs Marina that&nbsp;
all three children are ill. Marina then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.160
calls their family doctor. Upon hearing that,&nbsp;
Sine goes to Pascal and tells them about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.160
Sooner, the ladies go to the family doctor and&nbsp;
take him down. Then they show up to the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.840
as his substitute. Later, Pascal gives Stine the&nbsp;
same orange drink and that makes her fall asleep,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.400
Ludwig comes to the room with the set of&nbsp;
tools, and he performs a surgery on her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.320
Camiel is seen sitting on top of Marina, and she&nbsp;
gets a nightmare, that her husband is forcing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.840
and torturing her. She wakes up and she starts&nbsp;
fighting with Richard and he overpowers her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.720
Once he leaves, she goes to Camiel,&nbsp;
and she orders him to kill Richard.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.240
Later that night, she goes to Richard,&nbsp;
and she asks him if he needs a drink.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.320
Camiel then mixes the poison in the drink.&nbsp;
Their daughter goes and gives him the drink,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:25.440
and he hugs her, she says Bye papa before leaving.&nbsp;
Later, Richard gets inside the house. The sinister&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.560
group is watching them from the guest house,&nbsp;
and Richard dies in front of Marina. Then Camiel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.760
goes inside the house with the whole group,&nbsp;
and he introduces her with the group. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.400
she takes him to a room, and she expresses&nbsp;
her love to him, and she wants to kiss him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:46.800
he denies it calmly. Meanwhile, Ludwig and Pascal&nbsp;
tie Richard’s body, and they go to the water and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:52.400
dump him there. Later, Camiel puts poison in&nbsp;
Marina’s drink, sooner she lies on the bed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.280
he gives her a kiss and he leaves from&nbsp;
there. The ladies dump her body as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.560
then Camiel is seen walking with all three kids,&nbsp;
along with the babysitter, and his Sinister group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:09.840
towards the forest. He looks at now abandoned&nbsp;
mansion and he leaves. Then the movie ends.
