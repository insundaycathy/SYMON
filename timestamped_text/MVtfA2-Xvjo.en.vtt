00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.689
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:07.570
Today, I’m going to show a 2009 horror,
mystery, and thriller film called, “Case

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.570
39.”

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.670
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.590
Watch out and take care.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.940
Emily Jenkins is an optimistic and passionate
social worker living in Oregon.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.840
Because of her damaged past, Emily feels it’s
only right to be helping kids who were once

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.840
like her.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.640
She’s great at her job and is currently
handling an abusive family with a violent

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.640
father.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.849
Despite being swamped with work, her boss,
Wayne, hands Emily her 39th case, the Sullivan

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:31.849
family.

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.589
Later that night, Emily meets up with her
psychologist friend, Doug, for a drink.

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:41.059
They order drinks and talk about Emily’s
job, implying that she’s a workaholic.

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.489
Drunk on cocktails, Doug suggests having a
purely physical relationship, no strings attached.

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.019
She only kisses him on the cheek as an answer.

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.519
When she gets home, she opens up the Sullivan
case file and learns about the parents, Edward

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.119
and Margaret, and their daughter, Lilith.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:59.850
The case file states that Lilith has not been
performing well at school and hasn’t eaten

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.429
anything in weeks.

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.719
This prompts Emily to pay them a visit.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.420
When she arrives, she notices the rundown
state of the house and the bars on the windows.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.979
She meets Lilith, who seems like a scared
and troubled child.

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.900
As they sit in the living room, Emily asks
if Edward can join them.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.560
Margaret says that he’s not at home, but
an electrical whirring sound coming from the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.600
basement proves she’s lying.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.179
Left with no choice, she persuades her husband
to join their talk.

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:30.270
Edward refuses to talk to Emily directly and
instead dictates what his wife is saying.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.740
Emily explains the conditions to them and
notes how absurd the whole situation is.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.490
When she checks in at work, she tells Wayne
about the Sullivan family.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.819
Unfortunately, if there’s no evidence of
abuse, they can’t bring the child in, but

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.979
Wayne compromises and agrees to meet with
the Sullivans.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.210
The next day, Emily is surprised to see the
family dressed up, almost as if they’re

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.549
picture perfect.

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.299
After a quick interrogation, Wayne tells her
that they can’t do anything else if there’s

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.010
no evidence of abuse.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.280
She comes up with an idea and talks to Lilith
separately.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.030
She quickly gains a good rapport with Lilith
and asks her what’s wrong.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.250
With tears in her eyes, Lilith tells her that
her parents are planning on sending her to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.250
hell.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.730
She brings her to Wayne but Lilith instantly
clams up.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.250
Left with no choice, Emily visits her friend,
Detective Mike Barron for help.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.360
Mike is hesitant to help but instructs her
to gather evidence.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.120
Later that night, Lilith watches in terror
as her father drills a hole on the ground

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.659
of their cellar.

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.240
Emily decides to pay Lilith a visit at her
school and hands the child her number and

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.730
tells her to call her if anything happens.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.170
When she gets home from work, she receives
a call.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.260
It’s Lilith and she’s scared.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.040
She tells Emily that she can hear her parents
waiting outside her room.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.239
She apologizes to Emily and starts falling
asleep.

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.620
Emily then calls Mike and runs to her car.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.540
Meanwhile, Lilith is asleep under her bed.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.319
They carry her downstairs and place her into
the oven.

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.659
Lilith wakes up and tries to escape but her
father pins her down as her mother slaps duct

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.319
tape onto her face.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.040
They drag her back in, tape the oven door,
and turn on the gas.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.280
Emily and Mike hear her screams as they break
down the door.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.980
Emily arrives at the kitchen and pushes Margaret
aside, forcing the oven door open.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.090
Mike follows her with his gun out but is tackled
by Edward.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.130
He fights back and smashes the father into
the fridge.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.200
As Emily applies first aid, Margaret comes
up behind her with a knife.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.700
Mike quickly intervenes and takes her down.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.500
They arrived just in time and saved Lilith.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.460
After the arrest, the parents are ordered
to go under psychiatric evaluation to see

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.130
if they’re fit for trial.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.670
The outcome disappoints Emily who thinks they
should go straight to jail.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.970
Later that day, she visits Lilith at the hospital,
who is under Doug’s care.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.480
Lilith begs her if she can go live with her
instead of a state home, but Emily hesitates,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.129
thinking that she’s not mother material.

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.780
However, her fondness for Lilith wins her
over and she manages to convince the court

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.310
to grant her custody of the child.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.590
Emily takes Lilith home and takes her on a
tour of the house.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.090
She gives her chamomile tea and tucks her
in at night in her own bedroom.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.870
The next day, Emily visits the empty Sullivan
house to get a few of Lilith’s belongings.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.829
She enters the master bedroom and notices
the scuff marks on the floor and the multiple

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.700
locks, implying that Lilith’s parents must
have barricaded themselves inside their room

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.780
every night.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.270
Meanwhile, Lilith attends group therapy with
another kid from one of Emily’s cases, Diego.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.270
The next day, after dropping Lilith off school,
Wayne asks for her.

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.450
She learns that over the night, Diego killed
his parents.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.100
Emily goes immediately to the scene of the
crime and meets up with Mike.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.930
He tells her the gruesome details of the slaughter,
how Diego had taken a tire iron from the garage

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.920
and had smashed his parents to death while
they slept.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.700
Emily refuses that Diego was capable of murder
and sees him at a juvenile facility.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.480
He breaks down and admits to killing his parents.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.620
Emily then hangs out with Lilith at a beach
and they talk about her neglected past.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.200
The next morning, Emily catches Lilith going
through her stuff, curious about what Emily’s

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.410
family is like.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.360
Lilith learns that Emily’s mother died from
an accident because she was driving too fast

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.720
on a rainy day.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.920
Later that day, Emily meets up with Mike for
lunch.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.820
He tells her that a call came from Emily’s
house the night before the murders.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.080
She strongly denies making the call and the
detective decides to interrogate Lilith.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.070
Despite his probing, the girl denies the call.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.310
As Mike leaves he tells Emily that he doesn’t
believe Lilith.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.580
Emily investigates further and talks to Diego
again.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.810
She asks him about the phone call but he has
a panic attack before he can answer.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.540
At the infirmary, Diego admits it was Lilith
who made the call with the voice of a man.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.750
As they wait for Lilith’s evaluation, Emily’s
suspicions about her grow.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.330
She feels a deep pit in her stomach that something
is wrong with the child.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.520
Doug arrives and talks to Lilith alone.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.430
Suddenly, Lilith’s personality changes,
she shows her true colors, and she turns around

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.950
the conversation.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.620
She isn’t an innocent little girl like everyone
thinks she is, instead, she’s a more sinister

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.620
entity.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.220
She criticizes Doug and subtly threatens him.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.250
The evaluation ends and Doug tells Emily that
he has never spoken with a child like that

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.340
before.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.110
This alarms her and feeds her fears even more.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.100
When Doug gets home, he receives a call but
thinks it’s the wrong number.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.120
As he studies Lilith’s case, a persistent
buzzing in his ear stops him.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.300
He goes to his bathroom and takes out a hornet
from his ear.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.380
More hornets appear on his shoulder and panic
starts to rise from inside him.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.370
Soon enough, multiple hornets are flying inside
the room and he desperately kills each one.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.860
The buzzing doesn’t stop and a horde of
hornets appear on his back.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.500
With trembling hands, he takes off his shirt,
careful not to disturb the insects, and locks

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.910
it in his shower.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:35.070
The buzzing is now in his head and more hornets
start coming out of his eyes, ears, and mouth.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.100
He swats at them, screaming, breaking the
shower door in the process, and ultimately

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.040
slips back and hits his head on the toilet,
ensuring his death.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.460
After Doug’s funeral, a permanent cold has
wedged itself between them, and Lilith senses

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.460
this.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.680
Emily seeks Mike’s advice and shares her
theory that Lilith might have something to

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.180
do with Doug’s death and Diego’s case.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.400
He dismisses her theory as grief and refuses
to help.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.380
At the office, she steals the Sullivans’
interview tapes and watches Margaret deny

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.910
Lilith as her daughter and that the child
has killed people before.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.690
As soon as Lilith was born, people who knew
her just started dying.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.190
Intrigued by the interview, Emily visits Lilith’s
parents.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.010
With Margaret indisposed, she talks to Edward.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.030
As soon as she starts talking, he asks who
died.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.890
He reveals that Lilith is a demon, feeding
on a person’s kind soul and that it was

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.260
not an accident that Emily found her.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.390
She wants to know what your idea of hell is
and make you live there.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.580
Lilith has planned everything from the start
and plans to bleed Emily dry until she’s

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.180
done with her and moves on to the next family.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.210
Back at home, Emily gets rid of all the dangerous
materials in her house but keeps one knife

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.200
for herself, just in case.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.810
When Lilith gets home, she pretends as if
there’s nothing wrong.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.960
She asks Emily about her mother, sending her
a subtle message that she knows what Emily’s

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.970
up to.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:53.960
The next day, Emily tries to get rid of her
custody rights, but the system refuses, stating

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.940
that it was her in the first place who fought
for those rights and that they’re still

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.440
looking for a foster home for Lilith.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.150
When Emily meets Lilith after group therapy,
she spots her whispering to another kid.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.740
She feels alarmed and drags her out of the
room.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.240
The staff reprimands her and tells her not
to do it again while Lilith feigns innocence.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.830
As they stand in the elevator, the pretenses
are now gone.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:19.930
Lilith berates Emily, provoking her as much
as she can, but Emily doesn’t give in.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.860
Suddenly the elevator stops working and the
cables break, sending them down at a fatal

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:24.860
speed.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.000
Emily grabs the handles, anticipating death,
but is surprised to see that they have landed

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.990
safely on the first floor.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:35.319
She seeks out Mike and asks for her help again,
more convinced this time that Lilith is a

00:08:35.319 --> 00:08:36.319
demon.

00:08:36.319 --> 00:08:40.289
Mike gets mad at her and tells her to seek
help or else he’s going to report her.

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:44.370
Things get worse for Emily at work as she
starts experiencing hallucinations.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.890
When she gets home that night, she ignores
Lilith and barricades herself in her bedroom.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.500
Lilith starts banging at her door, demanding
her to let her in.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.259
Emily grabs a weapon and screams at her to
leave her alone and the knocking suddenly

00:08:56.259 --> 00:08:57.259
stops.

00:08:57.259 --> 00:09:00.509
She hears a noise coming from her closet and
finds a burned woman.

00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:04.040
The woman lunges at her but she manages to
run outside.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.829
Desperate for help, she spots a bus and demands
the driver to let her in.

00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:10.399
The doors open and she gets inside the bus.

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:13.060
The driver tells her that there’s nobody
out there.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.050
When Emily looks out the window, the woman
is gone.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.710
She gets into her car, planning to escape,
but is shocked to see Lilith already there.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:25.029
Lilith threatens her, saying that Emily will
do whatever she wants or else.

00:09:25.029 --> 00:09:29.800
The next morning, Emily is informed that the
system finally found a home for Lilith.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.260
Knowing Lilith’s true nature, she knows
that this family will die.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.920
She talks to Edward again and he tells her
that if Lilith moves, the whole thing will

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.629
start all over again.

00:09:38.629 --> 00:09:41.680
The only way to stop the cycle is to kill
her in her sleep.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.910
The next day, Margaret wakes up in her room
which has now turned into an oven.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.800
She runs around, trying to escape, but her
body catches on fire.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.730
The nurse checks up on her and it’s revealed
that she’s having hallucinations.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.990
Just then, Edward sits across a man at the
cafeteria who starts speaking in Lilith’s

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.990
voice.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.589
He jumps at the man and stabs his neck with
a fork.

00:10:01.589 --> 00:10:05.889
The police try to take him down, but he accidentally
stabs himself in the eye.

00:10:05.889 --> 00:10:09.810
Meanwhile, Emily meets up with Mike again
who has something important to tell her.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:14.149
He has discovered evidence that Lilith did
in fact call Doug the night of his death.

00:10:14.149 --> 00:10:17.740
She then tells Mike that they have to stop
her and he finally agrees.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.279
Mike gears up and grabs a shotgun as Emily
goes home and plans to sedate Lilith.

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:25.430
When she arrives, she finds her house in a
disarray.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.829
Meanwhile, Mike is haunted by a pack of dogs
in the parking lot.

00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:32.480
He escapes to his car but finds one of the
dogs already there with him.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.800
He frantically loads his shotgun as the dog
lunges at him.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.800
He pulls the trigger and ends up blowing his
head off.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.970
Emily finds her case files all over the floor
and pictures of Diego, Doug, and Mike, confirming

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.680
her worst fears, that Lilith is after them.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.670
She goes to Lilith’s bedroom and looks for
the buzzing sound when Wayne calls her, confirming

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.579
that Mike is dead and has shot himself in
the head.

00:10:53.579 --> 00:10:57.300
She breaks down crying and scared, knowing
that she’ll have to do this alone.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.459
Music starts blaring from the living room
and she marches out, throwing the television

00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:05.580
on the floor and slapping Lilith’s bowl
of popcorn away, screaming at her to get out

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.839
of the house.

00:11:06.839 --> 00:11:11.110
Lilith screams back at her, revealing her
deep voice and distorted face.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:15.490
Emily runs away to her bedroom, terrified,
and starts barricading the door.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.980
Lilith arrives at the door and pretends to
apologize, tempting her to open the door.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.589
Suddenly, the door starts banging.

00:11:22.589 --> 00:11:27.439
The hinges are thrown off the floor, the walls
start to crack, and the door is busted open.

00:11:27.439 --> 00:11:30.329
She hides under the bed as Lilith enters the
room.

00:11:30.329 --> 00:11:34.190
She eventually finds her and Emily pretends
to promise that she will love her.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.930
Satisfied, Lilith leaves her alone and asks
her to tuck her in.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.370
Emily mixes sedatives into Lilith’s tea
and urges her to take it.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.779
Once she’s asleep, she grabs a can of gas
and starts dousing the house.

00:11:45.779 --> 00:11:50.970
She sets everything on fire, grabs her fish,
and goes outside, watching the house burn.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:56.009
The firefighters arrive and Emily is shocked
to see Lilith among them, unharmed and alive.

00:11:56.009 --> 00:11:58.970
The police take them and help them find a
place to stay.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:02.389
As they follow the police car, Emily takes
a different route.

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:06.249
Lilith begins taunting her, revealing that
Emily’s mother didn’t die of an accident,

00:12:06.249 --> 00:12:07.249
but of suicide.

00:12:07.249 --> 00:12:11.870
That’s why Emily’s afraid of having children,
afraid of becoming like her mother.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:15.370
Emily feels nothing but hatred now as she
speeds up her driving.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.170
She starts hallucinating and sees herself
as her mother, driving on the day that she

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.170
died.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.120
She sees herself in the backseat as a child,
asking her to slow down.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.600
As she looks out at the road, she sees a truck
coming towards them.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.439
Emily screams that it’s not real and braces
herself for impact.

00:12:31.439 --> 00:12:35.050
She drives through the illusion and sees a
terrified Lilith beside her.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.450
She feels more courage now and isn’t afraid
of her anymore.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.129
Emily drives through the gates and straight
to the docks, launching the car straight into

00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:43.129
the water.

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:46.809
She tries to drown Lilith, sticking her into
the trunk through the backseat.

00:12:46.809 --> 00:12:52.050
Lilith has now transformed into her final
form, a decaying demon with razor-sharp fingers.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.740
Emily struggles as the water fills up the
car but she’s finally able to lock the demon

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.740
in.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.170
She escapes through the passenger door and
swims up when Lilith’s hand breaks through

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.389
the taillight and grabs her legs.

00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:06.870
She pushes upward, grasping at the water,
and kicks herself free off her grasp.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.950
She reaches the water’s surface and takes
a deep breath.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:14.209
She hauls herself out of the water and sits
at the dock, looking at the sunrise, finally

00:13:14.209 --> 00:13:21.059
free from Lilith’s clutches.
