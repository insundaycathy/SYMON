00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.240
Detective Recapped here. Today, I’m going&nbsp;
to explain a Drama-Thriller film called:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.560
"The Good Doctor," which highlights the dangers&nbsp;
of loneliness, ambition, and obsession. Despite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.960
its anxious and mild-mannered protagonist, his&nbsp;
unexpected unpredictability takes the forefront.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.320
With low stakes taken to extremes and&nbsp;
comeuppance always being an arm’s reach away,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.200
the movie is quick to take several dark turns.&nbsp;
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.480
Some doctors say that you’re never truly&nbsp;
a doctor until you lose a patient. Little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.560
does Martin Blake know, he’s about to find out&nbsp;
whether this sordid little saying is true or not.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.240
Six days into his residency at a Southern&nbsp;
California hospital, British doctor Martin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.840
Blake already feels the tension between him&nbsp;
and some of his colleagues. After examining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.600
a patient who can’t speak English, two nurses&nbsp;
irritate Martin when one of them, Nurse Theresa,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.080
asks him to read his own handwriting. The&nbsp;
other one, Nurse Maryanne, refuses to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.000
a patient's blood, saying he has to do it&nbsp;
himself since they're swamped. Taken aback,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.520
Martin draws blood from his patient's arm while&nbsp;
crossly commenting to the patient’s mother that a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.080
phlebotomist is supposed to do this, not a doctor.&nbsp;
Already, it’s clear that Martin feels undermined&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.360
in the hospital. And though he’s annoyed by&nbsp;
the dismissive way the nurses talk to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.560
he still tries his best not to call them&nbsp;
out for their rude behavior. He's still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.600
new at the place, and building a good&nbsp;
relationship with others can take time.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.600
The next day, Martin visits his patient&nbsp;
from the previous day, Diane Nixon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.920
He tells the girl that she has pyelonephritis,&nbsp;
a UTI of the upper tract and kidney, and Diane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.000
writes it down in her journal. During Diane's&nbsp;
check-up, Martin tells her that her condition can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.160
get serious if not treated early. Diane asks if&nbsp;
she can die from that, and Martin assures her that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.400
he has things under control. As they share some&nbsp;
lighthearted banter about doctors, Diane's mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.120
and sister, Valerie, arrive. After Martin informs&nbsp;
them of Diane's condition, her sister teases him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.800
about how smart of a doctor he is. When Diane's&nbsp;
boyfriend, Rich, shows up, too, Martin can't help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.960
but look at the dismissive boy with displeasure&nbsp;
before leaving the room. The almost flirty way the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.720
sisters banter with Martin about his profession&nbsp;
isn’t lost on him. And with the constant crap&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.240
he’s getting from his colleagues, it’s a breath&nbsp;
of fresh air for him to be admired this way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.080
Still, Rich’s uncaring attitude towards&nbsp;
Martin is quick to bring him back to reality.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.240
On his way out, Nurse Theresa asks him to confirm&nbsp;
that he wrote "penicillin" on his patient's admit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.920
sheet before asking him to follow her. They&nbsp;
then go to the room of one of his patients,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.600
Mr. Sanchez, where nurse Theresa tells Martin&nbsp;
that the man is allergic to penicillin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.400
Martin argues that it wasn't mentioned&nbsp;
in the patient's original admit sheet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.920
but when the nurse questions him if he asked&nbsp;
Mr. Sanchez, Martin says the patient doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.560
speak English. Annoyed, Martin demands to know why&nbsp;
she still gave Mr. Sanchez penicillin even though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.640
she knew he was allergic to it, and Nurse Theresa&nbsp;
retorts that she only followed his instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.640
Instead of arguing with her, Martin instructs&nbsp;
her to prepare a Benadryl line for Mr. Sanchez,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.880
but Nurse Theresa says she already took care of&nbsp;
it before walking away. As Martin follows her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.800
Nurse Theresa says she'll file an incident&nbsp;
report. Determined to prove he's right, Martin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.320
starts looking for the original admit sheet,&nbsp;
but the nurse tells him he won't find it there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.920
Once again, Martin feels undermined by his&nbsp;
colleague with the way she’s openly putting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.680
the blame on him and expressing ignorance over&nbsp;
the original admit sheet. It’s a little puzzling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.520
why Nurse Theresa resents Martin, but it's clear&nbsp;
that there's something she doesn't like in him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.600
It may be the way he talks or carries himself, but&nbsp;
the nurse should be professional and set aside her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.680
personal feelings. After all, it’s the patient&nbsp;
who’ll suffer the most from any medical faults.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.920
During his break, Martin joins Dr. Waylans in&nbsp;
the cafeteria and expresses his concern about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.160
the incident report involving Mr. Sanchez. Martin&nbsp;
is worried that it will affect his application&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.440
for the infectious diseases fellowship, but&nbsp;
knowing where their conversation is heading,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.920
Mr. Waylans bluntly tells him he can't undo it.&nbsp;
The next day, Martin hears Diane arguing with Rich&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.400
over the phone as he enters her room. Martin then&nbsp;
checks her up, and as he does, Diane tells him she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.400
wants to break up with her boyfriend. Martin says&nbsp;
it's none of his business, but Diane continues to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.400
talk to him about Rich anyway. While they talk&nbsp;
and Martin advises Theresa what to do with Rich,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.480
Nurse Theresa shows up and asks to speak with him.&nbsp;
Though Martin asserts that he’s with a patient,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.000
Theresa ignores him and gives him his files,&nbsp;
saying she can't follow the orders on those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.160
papers because she can't read his handwriting.&nbsp;
Later, Martin is inside an elevator, and he thinks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.640
about his confrontation with the nurse. When&nbsp;
Jimmy, an orderly, enters the elevator, too,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.400
he asks the doctor what's bothering him. Martin&nbsp;
then says he believes that the staff is supposed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.240
to follow orders and show doctors some respect,&nbsp;
but Jimmy says it's probably not what he thinks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.000
When Martin asks how long Nurse Theresa has been&nbsp;
working there, Jimmy makes a joke and tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.600
to just get rid of her by slipping something in&nbsp;
her food. At this point, Martin’s only getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.760
the respect he wants from Diane, who’s openly&nbsp;
consulting him with her problems. Nothing seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.520
to be going right for him there, and he can’t even&nbsp;
pull any strings to keep the incident report from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.520
tainting his reputation. This may be another&nbsp;
hit to his ego, seeing as he’s not important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.440
enough to play their workplace politics right.&nbsp;
And throughout all this, tensions keep rising&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.200
between him and Theresa as he feels like he’s not&nbsp;
getting the respect that he deserves from her.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.680
Before his shift ends, Martin visits a sleeping&nbsp;
Diane and finds flowers from Rich in her room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.120
When Diane wakes up, she quickly closes her&nbsp;
journal and asks what's his deal with Nurse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.120
Theresa. Martin assures her they just had a&nbsp;
misunderstanding, but Diane implies the nurse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.040
should be fired for disrespecting him, making&nbsp;
Martin smile. When Martin tells Diane she's all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.480
better, the girl gets sad that she doesn't have&nbsp;
to stay at the hospital any longer and that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.120
won't receive any of his helpful bits of advice.&nbsp;
Instead of answering, Martin only smiles at her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.040
and Diane says she'll tell Nurse Theresa that he's&nbsp;
a good doctor. Although they won't say anything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.240
it is pretty clear that Martin and Diane&nbsp;
are attracted to each other. But since&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.040
Martin’s already established that he&nbsp;
values his profession a good deal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.120
he’s not about to jeopardize it further by getting&nbsp;
too close for comfort with a patient. Still,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.800
Diane gives him the ego boost he’s been missing&nbsp;
out on since he started working at the hospital.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.800
During the doctors' morning briefing, Dr.&nbsp;
Waylans informs Martin he's discharging Diane.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.120
When Martin asks if he could let her stay another&nbsp;
day, Dr. Waylans says he's already signed her out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.600
Sure enough, Martin finds Diane's room empty, and&nbsp;
as he's about to leave, Diane's father shows up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.680
and asks him for any last-minute advice. Martin&nbsp;
tells him to make sure Diane finishes her pills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.240
since she could relapse, and Mr. Nixon says he&nbsp;
will. He then invites Martin to dinner, saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.160
Diane has taken a liking to him and wants to&nbsp;
express her gratitude for his taking care of her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.720
Martin accepts the invitation, and Mr. Nixon gives&nbsp;
him his address before thanking him and leaving.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.800
The timing for Mr. Nixon’s invitation can’t be&nbsp;
any better for Martin. Now that Diane isn’t his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.560
patient anymore, he probably thinks that&nbsp;
it won’t be inappropriate to befriend her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.440
Still, it almost feels like Martin&nbsp;
is overstepping his boundaries as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.160
a doctor by asking if he could&nbsp;
let Diane stay for another day.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.120
At the Nixons' house, Martin meets Diane's other&nbsp;
sibling, Donny, then learns that Diane has left to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.840
talk to Rich. At the dinner table, the Nixons ask&nbsp;
Martin about his work, and Martin casually answers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.040
them. While eating, Donny teases Valerie, and the&nbsp;
girl accidentally spills wine on herself. Upset,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.320
Valerie walks out of the dining room,&nbsp;
and Mr. Nixon grabs Donny by the hair,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.960
telling him to stop misbehaving. Embarrassed,&nbsp;
Mrs. Nixon apologizes to Martin, but the doctor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.960
says it's fine. He then excuses himself and asks&nbsp;
where the bathroom is, and on his way there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.960
he accidentally opens the door to Valerie's room&nbsp;
and sees her getting dressed. When Martin finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.600
finds the bathroom, he stares at himself in the&nbsp;
mirror and sees Diane's antibiotics in the closet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.600
After washing up, Martin goes to Diane's room and&nbsp;
looks around before finally picking up a framed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.080
photograph of her. Wanting to go, Martin tells the&nbsp;
Nixons that something came up at the hospital and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.720
leaves. Martin is disappointed that Diane isn't&nbsp;
home, but he keeps quiet about it. Diane is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.320
sole reason why Martin accepted her father's&nbsp;
invitation in the first place, and eating with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.080
her family without her makes the night too long&nbsp;
for him. When Martin sees Diane's medication in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.760
the closet, his facial expression suddenly changes&nbsp;
as if he just thought of something brilliant.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.600
When Martin arrives home, he takes out Diane's&nbsp;
photograph that he's stolen from her room.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.160
The following day, Dr. Waylans talks to Martin&nbsp;
about his first year of residency at the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.320
Dr. Waylans asks Martin why he became a doctor and&nbsp;
if it's what he truly wants, and Martin says he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.480
saw how well-respected his mother's doctor friend&nbsp;
was. Martin tells him he wanted to earn that kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.000
of respect from his colleagues but admits to&nbsp;
having a hard time, especially when it comes to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.160
getting along with Nurse Theresa. Martin expresses&nbsp;
his frustration, saying the nurse treats him as if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.840
he's a nobody. He then assures the doctor that&nbsp;
it's what he wants in life and promises to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.760
better. In the cafeteria, Martin observes how&nbsp;
the other doctors and nurses seem to be getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.680
along just fine. While doctors don’t need to have&nbsp;
the noblest intentions as long as they do their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.000
job right, it’s increasingly evident just how&nbsp;
important respect is to Martin. In fact, it’s the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.680
most important thing to him. Although he doesn't&nbsp;
want to come off as a whiny person, it is obvious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.280
that he wants Dr. Waylans to see how unhappy&nbsp;
he is with the way Nurse Theresa treats him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.040
He receives a call from Valerie, asking him if&nbsp;
he wants her to bring the gift basket her mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.120
has prepared for him to the hospital or if he'd&nbsp;
rather pick it up from their house. Of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.600
Martin goes to their place and greets Mrs. Nixon&nbsp;
before asking if he could use the bathroom. There,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.440
Martin replaces the contents of Diane's pills with&nbsp;
sugar and cleans up before taking the gift from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.520
Mrs. Nixon. The cracks in Martin’s supposed&nbsp;
professionalism are fully showing now. His&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.440
decision to steal Diane's photograph and tamper&nbsp;
with her medicine shows a growing obsession.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.200
Worst of all, he’s willing to jeopardize his&nbsp;
former patient’s health just to get his way.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.440
Sometime later, Diane relapses and goes back to&nbsp;
the hospital. After telling Diane that they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.693
to run more tests on her, Martin sees Jimmy in&nbsp;
the hallway, who is a little too happy that Diane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.693 --> 00:08:06.000
is back. Disgusted, Martin tells Jimmy to mind&nbsp;
his manners before seeing the doctors and nurses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.400
rushing to Mr. Sanchez's room. The staff finds&nbsp;
him having another allergic reaction, and Martin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.640
learns that the patient is allergic to vancomycin&nbsp;
and not penicillin. Later that day, Martin points&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.000
out to Dr. Waylans that what happened to Mr.&nbsp;
Sanchez could actually be Nurse Theresa's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.640
fault and not his. Dr. Waylans promises to look&nbsp;
into it, and when he notes that Diane is back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.880
Martin pretends to be nonchalant about it, saying&nbsp;
he'll do some tests to make sure she's okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.880
At this point, it is evident that Martin has&nbsp;
no problem lying. He must be confident that no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.640
evidence will be traced back to him, so he talks&nbsp;
to Dr. Waylans about Diane's condition without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.560
even stuttering. Aside from that, Martin is&nbsp;
a hypocrite too, for telling Jimmy to stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.880
talking about Diane in a disrespectful way when&nbsp;
he himself is obsessing over her. In the evening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.280
Martin visits Diane in her room and finds out that&nbsp;
she and Rich are over. He then promises the girl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.200
that she'll be better soon, but Diane shows&nbsp;
reluctance to leave the hospital. Once again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.200
Martin tampers with Diane's medication, and as&nbsp;
he hurriedly leaves her room, he bumps into Nurse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.000
Maryanne. The nurse admits that she's just been&nbsp;
fired for messing up Mr. Sanchez's admit sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.840
Nurse Maryanne says Nurse Theresa doesn't know&nbsp;
anything about it, and with nothing else to say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:08.720
Martin goes to the bathroom. There, he disposes of&nbsp;
everything he used on Diane's IV. After learning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.640
that Diane is running a fever the next day,&nbsp;
Martin decides to replace her IV again. He goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.880
to the medicine storage room, where he finds Jimmy&nbsp;
hooking up with a patient. After telling them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.440
leave, Martin proceeds to get Diane's medication,&nbsp;
and for the third time, he tampers with it. Nurse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.600
Theresa shows up as Martin finishes replacing&nbsp;
Diane's IV, but the nurse doesn't seem to suspect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.240
him of doing anything wrong. Before going home,&nbsp;
Martin goes to the laboratory and replaces her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.400
resistance culture test. Martin is desperate to&nbsp;
keep Diane close to him, and he is willing to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.840
extreme measures to do it. He doesn't even take&nbsp;
into consideration that he might be putting the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.840
girl's life in danger. Instead, he focuses on&nbsp;
wanting to be with the girl who makes him feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.320
good about himself. It's selfish of Martin to do&nbsp;
this to Diane, because even if she likes him back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.520
he has no right to play with her health&nbsp;
as if it means nothing to him, a doctor.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.760
In the morning, Dr. Waylans and Martin discuss&nbsp;
what they should do with Diane. After Martin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.520
informs Diane of her condition, the girl asks if&nbsp;
he could operate on her just in case she needs an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.520
operation. However, Martin tells her he doesn't&nbsp;
operate since he doesn't want to cut into people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.680
Rich then calls Diane, but Diane won't answer her&nbsp;
phone, so Martin tells her not to think about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.760
boy too much. When Martin sees Rich in the&nbsp;
hallway, he immediately closes the curtain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.320
in Diane's room and greets Rich. Martin tells him&nbsp;
Diane can't take any visitors, and no matter how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.200
much Rich insists on seeing her, the doctor won't&nbsp;
let him. Defeated, Rich asks Martin to give the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.760
balloon he's brought to Diane, and after taking&nbsp;
it, Martin pops the balloon and throws it away.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.920
It's safe to say that Martin is jealous of Rich.&nbsp;
Not only did he stop him from seeing Diane, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.000
he also stops him from having a chance to patch&nbsp;
things up with her. It's a little petty, and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.920
drives the point home that Martin wants Diane all&nbsp;
to himself, even at the cost of her own happiness.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.640
One night, Diane admits to sleeping with Rich&nbsp;
before finishing her medication. She's worried&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.240
that that's the reason why she's sick again, but&nbsp;
Martin assures her that it's not. The girl is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.840
scared that she might die, and Martin just tells&nbsp;
her that that’s not going to happen. Without a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.760
thought, Diane says she's always thought of dying&nbsp;
by getting shot while stopping a crime, and Martin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.440
can only look at her. She then asks him if he's&nbsp;
ever thought of stuff like that, and Martin says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.040
when he was young, he used to think about going&nbsp;
into the ocean and disappearing as if he never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.240
existed. In a sad voice, Diane tells him she loves&nbsp;
the ocean, and once again, Martin can only nod at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.560
her. Martin probably doesn't expect that Diane&nbsp;
will be sad at the hospital. He's so focused on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.160
making sure she doesn't leave that he's never&nbsp;
given a thought about her feelings. Because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.720
Martin, Diane's physical and emotional conditions&nbsp;
are deteriorating, but he chooses to ignore them.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.920
Before Diane’s operation, he assures&nbsp;
her that everything is going to be fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.000
Once it’s done, Martin makes sure that he's the&nbsp;
first person Diane sees when she opens her eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.160
Diane asks if he is married or has a girlfriend,&nbsp;
but Martin doesn't really answer her question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.760
When Diane mentions that she thought he&nbsp;
liked Valerie, Martin shakes her this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.760
Diane tells him that’s good before falling&nbsp;
back to sleep. Unable to control himself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.880
Martin kisses the unconscious girl,&nbsp;
and when he comes back to his senses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.280
Martin looks around to check if anyone saw&nbsp;
him. Eventually, Martin falls asleep. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.600
a nurse wakes up Martin, and after realizing&nbsp;
that Diane isn't in her room, Martin angrily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.840
asks Nurse Theresa where she is. Martin is worried&nbsp;
after receiving a Code Four, and when he learns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.400
Diane has been taken for an MRI, he immediately&nbsp;
makes his way there. By the time he arrived,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.880
he finds the doctors trying to revive Diane, but&nbsp;
unfortunately, it's already too late for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.360
With tears in his eyes, Martin stares at Diane's&nbsp;
lifeless body and realizes that he's gone too far.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.080
A sweet, young girl has lost her life because of a&nbsp;
selfish doctor, who wanted nothing more than to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.080
with her. If only Martin had thought of other ways&nbsp;
to keep seeing Diane, her life wouldn't have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.640
cut short. He can keep being sorry until he’s blue&nbsp;
in the face, but he only has himself to blame.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:23.040
With patients dying daily at the hospital, Martin&nbsp;
has no other choice but to continue with his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.880
Later on, Mr. Nixon shows up at the hospital&nbsp;
and accuses Martin of killing Diane.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.480
Nurse Theresa is quick to call Jimmy and&nbsp;
the security guard to stop any fighting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.320
When Dr. Waylans arrives, he assures the grieving&nbsp;
father that they did everything they could to save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.080
his daughter. Martin remains speechless&nbsp;
the whole time, and as Mr. Nixon leaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.720
Dr. Waylans apologizes to him for having to deal&nbsp;
with that. It isn't surprising that Mr. Nixon has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:48.720
reacted the way he did. Diane was fine one day,&nbsp;
and the next, she wasn't. Sadly, Mr. Nixon has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.720
no proof that Martin did commit a crime, so he&nbsp;
can only hate the doctor from afar. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.560
Martin must be secretly scared, for his reckless&nbsp;
actions are starting to cause him trouble.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.040
One day, Jimmy asks Martin to meet him in the east&nbsp;
tower basement. There, he shows Martin Diane's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.120
journal. Jimmy reveals that he’s read through it,&nbsp;
and he surmises that she and Martin must have had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.120
some sort of special relationship. He blackmails&nbsp;
Martin into prescribing him certain medicine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.120
or else he’ll turn it over to his superiors.&nbsp;
Threatened, Martin concedes to Jimmy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.760
writes the prescription for him. However, Martin&nbsp;
won't just let Jimmy bully him, so he painted a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.600
different kind of pill to make it look like the&nbsp;
one Jimmy is asking for before giving it to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.960
Martin then asks for the journal,&nbsp;
but Jimmy refuses to hand it over.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.760
Outsmarting Jimmy, Martin puts poison in Jimmy's&nbsp;
pills. After the orderly takes one pill inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.240
hospital premises, Martin lures him into a storage&nbsp;
room for fear that someone might see him dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.680
There, Jimmy starts coughing and realizes&nbsp;
he's been poisoned, and Martin stops him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.320
when he tries to leave. As Jimmy starts having&nbsp;
a seizure, Dr. Waylans arrive and tends to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.400
During the chaos, Martin manages to take&nbsp;
Jimmy's locker keys. When he finally dies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.640
Martin goes to the orderly's locker and steals&nbsp;
Diane's journal. It speaks volumes about Martin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.560
when he would go straight to murdering someone for&nbsp;
getting in his way. Of course, he’d be averse to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.880
having his superiors investigating him in any way&nbsp;
about Diane. Still, he could have bided his time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.360
and explored his options before even considering&nbsp;
killing a person. Then again, Martin’s an extreme&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.760
guy who immediately goes through extreme measures.&nbsp;
If he weren’t, then Diane would still be alive.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.600
During an investigation, Detective&nbsp;
Krauss asks Martin what happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.040
and he lies about trying to help Jimmy when he&nbsp;
started having a seizure. Dr. Waylans believes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.640
Jimmy's death has something to do with substance&nbsp;
abuse, which is obvious to him because of his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.440
erratic behavior. Dr. Waylans then gives Martin&nbsp;
some time off, and Martin is glad to accept it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.760
At home, Martin reads Diane's journal and learns&nbsp;
that the girl had not once mentioned him there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.440
It almost becomes questionable if she ever liked&nbsp;
him in the first place, or if she just saw him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.920
as a wiser figure to look up to. The next day,&nbsp;
Dr. Krauss unexpectedly drops by Martin's house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.760
and asks him questions about Jimmy. He tells&nbsp;
Martin that the pills Jimmy took were spiked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.160
with potassium cyanide, but Martin acts clueless&nbsp;
about it. The detective continues to question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.600
Martin about his relationship with Jimmy and&nbsp;
if he knows where the orderly got the pills.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.520
All the while, Martin remains unaware that&nbsp;
Diane's journal sits on the floor. As he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.840
answers the detective’s questions, Martin seems&nbsp;
a bit distracted and starts talking about Diane,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.680
saying they were close. He then adds that Jimmy&nbsp;
used to make lewd comments about female patients,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.600
which is one of the main reasons why he never&nbsp;
mingled with him. When Martin finally notices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.000
Diane's journal, he excuses himself from the room&nbsp;
and takes the notebook with him to the bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
As a doctor, it was careless of Martin not to&nbsp;
realize that potassium cyanide won't be traced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.720
in Jimmy's system. Then again, Martin isn’t&nbsp;
known for his carelessness. What he’s good at,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.320
though, is using his smarts to get himself&nbsp;
out of the trouble he caused, and this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.840
he uses Diane as a reason to be too distracted&nbsp;
to answer the detective’s questions.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.120
Martin tries flushing the torn&nbsp;
papers from the diary in the toilet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.040
but it only clogs and overflows. Panicking,&nbsp;
Martin escapes through the bathroom window&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.760
and climbs down a tree before heading&nbsp;
to the beach just outside his house.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.400
There, Martin contemplates whether he should&nbsp;
end his life, but he decides against it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.480
Instead, he goes back to his apartment through&nbsp;
his bathroom window and cleans the mess he made.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.000
Once he’s done, he goes to tell Detective&nbsp;
Krauss he's needed at the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.040
After some time, Martin goes&nbsp;
back to his work at the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.080
There, he assures a little girl that he's&nbsp;
getting better at drawing blood from a patient.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.440
Martin is a man of many extremes. He wanted the&nbsp;
respect of people, so he went for being a doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.680
He wanted to get closer to Diane, so he messed&nbsp;
with her medication to trap her in the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.280
He wanted to get Jimmy off his back, he&nbsp;
murdered him. When he saw Diane’s journal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.440
he flushed it down the toilet and contemplated&nbsp;
ending his life. He hardly stops to consider&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.720
less drastic measures, and this could be&nbsp;
a symptom of his deeper insecurities or a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.320
belief that he has no one that he can count&nbsp;
on. Perhaps Martin is just the way he is.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.920
Still, the fact that Martin is able to resume&nbsp;
his work at the hospital as if he didn't just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.920
kill two people is unbelievable. It's frightening&nbsp;
to think that doctors like him roam the hospitals,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.440
offering services to helpless patients.&nbsp;
No matter how good he is at his job,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.040
Martin shouldn't forget that he took two innocent&nbsp;
lives and that one day, he'll pay for them.
