00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.680
Welcome back to Movie Recaps. Today I will show&nbsp;
you a drama, crime film from 2015, titled Loving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.600
Pablo. Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.
The movie starts by telling us this is based on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.080
real, if perhaps exaggerated events. Our narrator&nbsp;
is famous journalist and television presenter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.360
Virginia Vallejo, who currently is on a plane,&nbsp;
leaving her country because of a man in 1993.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.520
A DEA agent called Shepard is there&nbsp;
as well. When they make it to the USA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.080
Virginia is taken to a hotel and once she gets in&nbsp;
her room, Shepard tells her she'll be meeting with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.480
officials from the Justice Department and told the&nbsp;
corresponding procedures, another agent tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.720
she isn't allowed to leave the room or communicate&nbsp;
with anyone for the sake of her own safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.120
Virginia is having a headache so she asks for&nbsp;
an aspirin, but Shepard tells her hotels can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.200
offer it because it's considered a drug. This&nbsp;
makes her laugh and think Pablo would've laughed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.440
too before he would've had them all killed.
The flashbacks start then, so we can see how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.120
all this started. The year is 1981, the country is&nbsp;
Colombia. We meet Pablo Escobar while he's riding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.200
his bike with some friends and employees through&nbsp;
an open field. One of the men crashes his bike&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.840
against a horse, leaving the animal hurt on the&nbsp;
ground. When everyone stops to see what happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.120
they take out their guns and decide to shoot&nbsp;
the horse to take it out of its misery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.680
Moments later they return to Pablo's mansion,&nbsp;
where he is chatting with his wife Victoria&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.680
about the party they are hosting later at night&nbsp;
and all the important people that will be coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.280
Victoria can't stop looking through the window&nbsp;
to watch her son in the pool and a man sitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.080
nearby - she tells Pablo she doesn't like this,&nbsp;
that business and family should stay separate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.400
So Pablo goes out to do something about it. He&nbsp;
throws a coin in the pool to distract his son&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.240
then talks business with the other man: he's&nbsp;
given the mission of destroying some files&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.920
that connect Pablo to the murder of two&nbsp;
dozen agents. The man gets permission to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.240
kill anyone that needs to be killed and a high&nbsp;
amount of money to cover expenses and weapons.&nbsp;

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.560
A few hours later, a younger Virginia&nbsp;
is arriving at Pablo's ranch by plane.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.080
They've all heard about Pablo but never met&nbsp;
him, he's just the top name on the list of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.160
the "new rich". Virginia is freaking out because&nbsp;
she sees people with weapons waiting for them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.480
thinking she's going to be kidnapped. When she&nbsp;
gets out of the plane, Pablo explains the land&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.800
is a zoo and the weapons are for the animals,&nbsp;
Virginia complains to him thinking he's a servant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.240
They take the jeeps to go to the house and&nbsp;
on the way, Pablo shows them the animals.&nbsp;

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.280
Later at night, the party is in full swing.&nbsp;
Virginia is surprised to learn the man from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.600
before is the actual Pablo, and she mentions the&nbsp;
speculation that is going around about his past,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.520
but Pablo doesn't want to talk about it. He&nbsp;
explains the party is to celebrate the founding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.000
of his society, which is building houses for&nbsp;
the poor. She asks where the money comes from,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.320
he avoids the question. What she didn't know back&nbsp;
then it's that what they were truly celebrating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.040
was the founding of the Medellín cartel.
A couple of days later, Pablo takes Virginia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.200
to visit the slums to show her all the houses&nbsp;
he's building. Most kids of the area are named&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.760
Pablo after him. Virginia interviews Pablo&nbsp;
for her show, and when he gives a heartfelt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.600
speech about making Colombia the country they&nbsp;
dream about, Virginia decides that she doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.200
care how Pablo makes his money, only how he uses&nbsp;
it. Later on, the two of them go out for dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.960
Virginia comments she's married but not by&nbsp;
choice, her husband won't sign the divorce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.280
papers. Because Pablo doesn't like hanging out&nbsp;
with married women, he says he'll fix it for her.&nbsp;

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.640
We cut to Virginia's husband being visited at&nbsp;
his job by Pablo's men to threaten him. Next we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.240
jump to Virginia's show, where she's informed&nbsp;
her husband has finally signed the papers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.280
To celebrate her freedom, Pablo takes Virginia&nbsp;
to a private island, where they make love before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.600
attending a congress of drug traffickers.&nbsp;
Virginia is introduced to all of Pablo's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.560
associates and shown off as a trophy, but she's&nbsp;
never felt safer. That night, the men divide the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.800
USA among them for their narco-business.
A year later, we see how the drug arrives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.720
in the states. On the highway, there's a&nbsp;
truck that suddenly turns to block the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.520
and its drivers threaten any&nbsp;
complaining car drivers with their guns.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.040
Now that the road is empty, a plane uses it to&nbsp;
land and release its cargo. Lots of men jump off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.040
their cars to pick it up while Virginia tells us&nbsp;
how a kilo will be cut here to make double profit.&nbsp;

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.600
Now the drug has entered the country, President&nbsp;
Donald Regan must speak to the nation about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.680
subject. Shepard is in the White House&nbsp;
too, overseeing the transmission, when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.440
he's approached by an American and a Colombian&nbsp;
representative that tell him that since most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.360
of the drug is coming from Colombia, they're&nbsp;
working to reactivate the Extradition Treaty:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.760
that would allow Colombia to catch the narcos but&nbsp;
the USA gets to try them, because in Colombia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.920
narcos just pay or threaten the judges.&nbsp;
Shepard accepts to monitor the whole process.&nbsp;

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.360
After hearing about this, Pablo and his associates&nbsp;
get together to discuss how it affects them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.360
The treaty puts them in danger, and they can&nbsp;
hire some lawyers to appeal, but Pablo thinks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.000
this must be fought from the inside. The others&nbsp;
think it's a bad idea to get involved in politics,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.040
but Pablo disagrees: if you enter congress, they&nbsp;
respect you because you're one of them. Besides,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.880
running for office costs a lot of money - it's&nbsp;
not for workers, it's for people like them.&nbsp;

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.680
The cartel starts paying off politicians&nbsp;
on both sides then, so no matter who wins,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.480
they win. Their planes carry candidates during&nbsp;
the day and take the drugs to the states at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.800
Some months later, we find Victoria talking to&nbsp;
Pablo about this, she thinks he's taking things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.880
too far. He doesn't see his family often&nbsp;
and already has lots of money, she doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.360
understand what else he could want - he replies&nbsp;
he wants respect and his son to be proud of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.760
Upset, Victoria rushes to her room, Pablo follows&nbsp;
her and asks her if she wouldn't want to be the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.600
first lady - she replies she wants to be the&nbsp;
only one and demands him to break things up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.240
with Virginia. He promises her it's over, but&nbsp;
days later, he's sleeping with Virginia again.&nbsp;

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.320
Pablo continues to work on his&nbsp;
political campaign with Virginia's help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.720
gaining many followers with his speeches. On&nbsp;
the day of the election, everybody gets together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.880
to watch the results and it's confirmed&nbsp;
Pablo wins as representative of Medellín.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.120
It's July 1982 when Pablo goes to the House&nbsp;
of Representatives for the first time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.680
and while he isn't stopped from entering for being&nbsp;
a trafficker, he is stopped for not wearing a tie.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.160
He borrows one from the journalists&nbsp;
that are dying to help him.&nbsp;

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.360
We then cut to see Pablo filling Virginia's bag&nbsp;
with money. She thinks he wants her to smuggle it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.480
but he says it's actually a gift and she can&nbsp;
spend it all. Time passes and it's now 1983,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.600
Virginia has been using the money to get expensive&nbsp;
accommodations, jewelry and clothes. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.280
Pablo is teaching his son how to make and cut&nbsp;
the drug, but also to never take it himself.&nbsp;

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.760
Back to Virginia, she's arriving at her hotel&nbsp;
when Shepard approaches her and asks her to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.400
join him for a drink. He asks her how Pablo&nbsp;
makes his money, Virginia points out the DEA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.320
doesn't have any authority to interfere&nbsp;
in Colombian politics. Shepard says his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.080
country is worried about all the drug that's&nbsp;
getting in, but Virginia thinks that's a lie:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.000
what worries them is the money going out, that's&nbsp;
why they don't care about the Italian mafia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.320
they keep their money in the USA. Shepard&nbsp;
wonders what Pablo said when Virginia told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.400
him she would be seeing, Virginia replies he&nbsp;
said she should make sure the USA pays the bill.&nbsp;

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.040
Months later, Virginia arrives at the&nbsp;
Medellín airport, but Pablo isn't there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.320
to pick her up because he was called to&nbsp;
a special Congress session in Bogotá:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.640
they want to revoke his appointment. We cut to&nbsp;
the Congress then, where a minister is talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.840
about Pablo's presence among them being&nbsp;
a disgrace because of his shady business.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.640
Pablo replies by saying the minister should&nbsp;
present evidence not only of his accusations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.960
but also of where the money for his own campaign&nbsp;
comes from. He tells the president he can prove&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.960
many of these ministers received shady money for&nbsp;
their campaigns, but then the minister takes over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.600
and makes fun of him in front of everyone. Later&nbsp;
at night, Victoria begs Pablo to resign before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.840
things get worst and tells him she's pregnant.&nbsp;
She makes him promise their baby won't suffer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.040
but they're interrupted by an urgent phone call:&nbsp;
Pablo's past has reached the news. He will pay 500&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.760
pesos for every newspaper taken from the streets&nbsp;
before people see them. We see men following the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.280
newspaper delivery trucks and picking up&nbsp;
everything they drop while Virginia tells&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.520
us the details: the published story backs up the&nbsp;
minister's claims and connects Pablo to the murder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.840
of two policemen in his youth. The man that had&nbsp;
been sent to erase this evidence is tortured and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.880
killed for failing. Days later, the Cartel gets&nbsp;
together to discuss what to do with this minister:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.640
Pablo wants to assassinate him, and everybody&nbsp;
should put money for it so they're all guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.120
Some of his associates don't like this idea,&nbsp;
but he convinces them there's no other choice.&nbsp;

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.240
The next day, Pablo is having dinner with Virginia&nbsp;
when he gifts her a box to celebrate things are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.640
about to change, he wants her to carry this&nbsp;
gift with her all the time. Virginia opens it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.120
and is distressed to find a gun inside, which she&nbsp;
doesn't want. Pablo tells her things are about to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.600
get very complicated and to make her understand,&nbsp;
he starts explaining in detail how she would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.280
raped and tortured if they captured her, and&nbsp;
if she takes the gun, she can either protect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.000
herself from her attackers or shoot herself before&nbsp;
they get to her. This greatly upsets Virginia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.360
who is now crying and asks Pablo to take her home.
We then cut to Pablo visiting a camp of sicarios&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.680
where youngsters from the slums are trained to&nbsp;
kill. He hires two of them, who go to the streets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.080
on their bike and approach the minister's car from&nbsp;
behind. They shoot him when they get close enough,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.240
then quickly drive away. Virginia's show is&nbsp;
interrupted so she can tell the nation about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.880
the news of the minister's death. While Victoria&nbsp;
watches the show and cries, Virginia explains&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.840
the president activates the extradition agreement&nbsp;
and Pablo decides to take his business to Panamá.&nbsp;

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.880
It is now 1984. In Panamá, the Cartel has&nbsp;
a meeting with an ex-president sent by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.680
government to negotiate. Pablo accepts to pay&nbsp;
taxes and take some money to the USA in exchange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.160
for not being extradited to another country. The&nbsp;
ex-president tells him he can't remove the treaty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.320
without talking to the Americans, Pablo replies&nbsp;
he better finds a way to do it or there'll be war.&nbsp;

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.520
Things get worse from then on: Pablo couldn't keep&nbsp;
his promise and his son is born outside Colombia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.200
the editor that published his past gets killed&nbsp;
and Virginia has started to get threats on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.440
phone and being followed. She returns home&nbsp;
one night to find Pablo there, who tells her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.680
this isn't his fault and promises things will&nbsp;
be fine. Virginia thinks he's losing his mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.760
and leaves the room when he tries to kiss her.
The threatening of people becomes a whole genre&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.480
for Pablo. He kills a judge by sending a coffin&nbsp;
to his house, then starts handing out guns in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.600
the slums. He'll pay people for every cop they&nbsp;
kill: the higher the rank, the better the money.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.920
Death is everywhere now, officers keep getting&nbsp;
killed by the second, so they decide to strike&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.560
back by shooting ten teenagers from the slums for&nbsp;
every murdered cop. The Colombian government ends&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.120
up creating a special unit exclusively to deal&nbsp;
with Pablo, so the DEA sends Shepard to check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.440
out the unit's facilities - since the extradition&nbsp;
treaty isn't working, the Americans are coming to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.080
catch him themselves. They install a whole system&nbsp;
to track phone calls and pinpoint Pablo, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.680
people from the slums trick them by calling&nbsp;
all at the same time from different locations.&nbsp;

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.840
Back to Virginia, we find her at&nbsp;
the tv studio talking to her boss,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.160
who's fired her and replaced her with someone&nbsp;
younger. No matter how many times he denies it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.240
Virginia is sure this happened because of her&nbsp;
connection to Pablo. She leaves the office&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.240
making and scene and threatening her boss by&nbsp;
telling him Pablo will get him. When she's out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.000
of the building, she finds Shepard waiting&nbsp;
for her, he takes her to a bar for a drink.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.640
Virginia tells him getting fire is a good thing&nbsp;
and she has an offer waiting for her in Florida,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.520
she also tries to flirt with him. Shepard turns&nbsp;
her down and calls our her lie: she has no offers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.240
nobody will hire her now. He offers her protection&nbsp;
in exchange for her helping them find Pablo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.480
but she stays loyal to him. It's then that&nbsp;
they notice a car spying on them outside,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.680
Shepard runs out with his gun but the&nbsp;
car drives away before he can catch it.&nbsp;

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.080
Virginia calls Pablo to tell him what&nbsp;
happened, he says he isn't following her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.960
Scared and upset, she tries to break up with him,&nbsp;
but he hangs up. We learn then that Pablo has many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.680
teenage girlfriends, young girls handed in by the&nbsp;
parents in exchange of money. It takes only one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.720
them to talk for the search bloc to find him. Some&nbsp;
helicopters arrive at Pablo's ranch and open fire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.720
Pablo's men shoot back and even free some birds&nbsp;
that fly against one of the helicopters and make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.120
it crash. Pablo escapes and becomes unreachable,&nbsp;
and his associates are getting worried about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.440
the business ending, but they start getting&nbsp;
killed as well. Pablo can only stay on the run.&nbsp;

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:01.120
In 1989, he calls a radio station, declaring full&nbsp;
war on the government and threatening to blow up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.640
the station to prove it's him. Meanwhile, Virginia&nbsp;
is in Miami doing an interview on tv. When later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.960
she goes to the airport, the FBI approaches her&nbsp;
and asks her for her passport before she hears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.760
some upsetting news: the Bogotá airport has been&nbsp;
closed because a plane has exploded in mid-flight.&nbsp;

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.240
After all these bombs, the country asks the&nbsp;
government to give Pablo hell. But after even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.120
more bombs, the people ask the government to&nbsp;
give Pablo what he wants. At the US embassy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.960
Shepard gets a clue from another agent by looking&nbsp;
at the names of the passengers that survived&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.360
the plane bombing. Shepard goes to talk to the&nbsp;
ambassador to ask permission to go after Pablo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.800
but Pablo's lawyer is already there,&nbsp;
arranging the details of his surrender.&nbsp;

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.400
In 1991, the extradition treaty is revoked, and&nbsp;
Pablo hands himself to the authorities with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.720
condition he gets to choose his own jail. They&nbsp;
build a special building on his own land, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.120
it's nothing like an actual jail: there are all&nbsp;
kinds of fancy comforts including a soccer field,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.040
he continues to work his business with his&nbsp;
associates there, he has parties with drinks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.440
and women, and on Sundays, he has lunch with his&nbsp;
family. It's during one of these lunches that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.000
his daughter tells him her mom says he can't&nbsp;
leave and she cries all time. Feeling defied,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.160
Pablo picks up his daughter and tells her he'll&nbsp;
take her out for ice-cream. The first guards he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.160
encounters open the doors for him out of fear,&nbsp;
but when he makes it outside, the gate guards&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.720
turn their weapons on him. Pablo cries as Victoria&nbsp;
shows up to stop him and take her daughter back.&nbsp;

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.840
Meanwhile, Virginia is having trouble: all media&nbsp;
has banned her and her advertising contracts have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.240
been canceled, so she has to sell her home to&nbsp;
pay her debts. She rents an apartment where the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.960
first lady is living, hoping her guards will keep&nbsp;
her safe too. With a new phone number, she gets a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.520
break from the phone threats, but not for long.&nbsp;
She ends up visiting Pablo at his "jail" to ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.040
him if she can feel safe and to tell everyone&nbsp;
they aren't together anymore to stop the threat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.920
Since it's his fault that her career is over,&nbsp;
she also asks for money to move to Europe. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.080
Pablo refuses, she threatens him with possibly&nbsp;
going to the police to tell them what she knows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:53.680
but he scares her into taking her words back.
In 1992, Pablo meets with two of his associates,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.160
who owe him money. Since they refuse to pay,&nbsp;
Pablo gets them killed, and these murders reach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.360
the media, making the government an accomplice.&nbsp;
It's decided to transfer Pablo to military prison,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.440
but when the officers make it to his prison,&nbsp;
he's already gone - the switch to the electric&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.360
fence was in his room. In a little house&nbsp;
in the middle of nowhere, Pablo hides.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.520
His men tell him people are turning on them&nbsp;
because he's lost credibility: if he killed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.240
his associates, they think he could kill anyone.&nbsp;
Pablo doesn't think it was a mistake, but it was.&nbsp;

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.040
Pablo's associates cooperate with the government&nbsp;
in exchange for having their records clean.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.200
Dozens of narcos ready to fight him are released&nbsp;
and together with government officers, they start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.520
a lethal hunting party. They start killing any&nbsp;
person who has ever associated themselves with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.000
Pablo and they always leave a message with the&nbsp;
bodies that says "for working for Pablo Escobar".&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.920
This puts Virginia in danger too: one&nbsp;
afternoon, when she's at a pawn shop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.280
trying to sell her jewelry, the hunting&nbsp;
party attacks, and it's only thanks to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.160
the window being bullet-proof that she survives.
Meanwhile, Pablo is hiding in a small apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.720
with his family. While chatting to his daughter,&nbsp;
he notices his wife is crying: turns out their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.400
kid won't be allowed to be in a school show&nbsp;
because the other parents don't want her there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.640
they're afraid Pablo will blow up the school.&nbsp;
Pablo accepts things are getting too dangerous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.480
for them there, so he tells Victoria to take&nbsp;
the kids and fly out of the country so he can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.440
take care of everything. In the meantime, Virginia&nbsp;
goes see Shepard at the embassy, finally willing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.680
to cooperate. She tells him Pablo's weakness is&nbsp;
his family and that they shouldn't be allowed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.200
to leave the country, otherwise Pablo will&nbsp;
start destroying everything when they're gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.080
Shepard takes this information to his boss, who&nbsp;
says they can't do this because of the deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.320
But Shepard explains his plan to use the family&nbsp;
as bait and finally capture Pablo when he tries&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.680
to contact them, so his boss accepts to&nbsp;
break the deal and go with that idea.&nbsp;

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.760
It is now 1993. Pablo's family is denied&nbsp;
entrance to Germany and sent back to Colombia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.680
the DEA takes over them and hides them in an&nbsp;
apartment building where they've set up operations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:46.320
to track incoming calls. Pablo learns about this&nbsp;
by watching the news and calls his family to check&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.480
on them. He's promising he will rescue them&nbsp;
when he realizes they're being listened on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.120
so he starts insulting and threatening the&nbsp;
officers. Victoria asks him not to call again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.480
but he ignores her as he hangs up.&nbsp;
The bait is too powerful though,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.880
so moments later, Pablo is calling them&nbsp;
again. The officers manage to pinpoint his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.720
location and go after him while he talks to&nbsp;
his kids, first he chats with his daughter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.720
then he asks for his son so he can teach him&nbsp;
what to tell the press when all this is over.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.800
He leans against the window while doing so, giving&nbsp;
the cops a full view of where he's staying at.&nbsp;

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.680
The cops break in while he's still on the phone.&nbsp;
Pablo hears them but doesn't even hang up before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.560
he and his partner are moving to the window, guns&nbsp;
ready. They jump out of it when the door explodes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.320
but it's too late: they're shot and killed&nbsp;
right there on the roof, and his son hears it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.360
all through the phone. In the other room, the DEA&nbsp;
agents are celebrating, but Virginia looks sad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.440
Shepard comes by to pick her up and take her&nbsp;
to a safe place, and the movie ends with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.800
flashback to her conversation about the&nbsp;
terms of her cooperation with the police.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.400
She says she loved Pablo, but hated Escobar, so&nbsp;
she accepts to talk to a federal judge - Pablo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.000
wanted her to tell his story after&nbsp;
all. He just never specified to whom.
