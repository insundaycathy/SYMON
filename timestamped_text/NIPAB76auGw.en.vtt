00:00:06.588 --> 00:00:07.932
hey what's up guys

00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:11.244
today I'll show you a thriller film: "Sennentuntschi"

00:00:11.484 --> 00:00:14.316
spoiler ahead, watch out and take care

00:00:14.604 --> 00:00:17.724
a little girl is picking mushrooms in the forest of the Alps

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.124
when a bright ray of light shines through

00:00:20.172 --> 00:00:22.044
seemingly to lead her somewhere

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.596
a boy on a tree is holding a mirror to reflect the sunlight

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.860
the girl follows the light to find a cluster of mushrooms

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.940
she runs over happily for the mushrooms, but accidentally finds a skeleton

00:00:33.204 --> 00:00:35.556
the girl can't help bursting out screaming

00:00:35.748 --> 00:00:38.052
soon after, the police come for investigation

00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:42.468
after an autopsy, the bone belongs to a young man who has died 30 years

00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:46.500
the policeman asks the girl to recognize the boy from missing person reports

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:50.436
surprisingly, they find the boy has been missing since 1975

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.675
it means what the girl saw may be a ghost

00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:55.044
the policeman doesn't believe in ghosts

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:59.748
as a result, the girl's mother tells him a story that happens a long time ago

00:01:00.084 --> 00:01:02.484
time flies back to 1975

00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:06.708
in the village of Grison Alps, Switzerland, there happens an astonishing murder

00:01:06.852 --> 00:01:09.300
a priest is found hanging in the church

00:01:09.492 --> 00:01:12.996
the only sheriff in the village hurries over to take care of the case

00:01:13.188 --> 00:01:16.980
after examination, the coroner finds the body has no other wounds

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.908
people in the village are curious about his cause of death

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.076
but all the clues indicate that the priest commits suicide

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:26.628
the bishop thinks the dead priest must have been bewitched by the devil

00:01:26.772 --> 00:01:29.892
even so, the bishop still holds a funeral for him

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.972
shortly after the funeral, a strange girl shows up in the village

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.004
she looks dirty and unkempt and seems too weak to walk herself

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.828
as the girl is about to faint

00:01:39.972 --> 00:01:44.100
the sheriff takes the girl back to the police station and tries to clean her face

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.900
unexpectedly, the girl wakes up and kisses him when the doctor just comes in

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.732
the situation seems a bit embarrassed for both

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:54.948
so the doctor simply does a quick check for the girl and leaves

00:01:55.188 --> 00:01:56.964
luckily, the girl is quite healthy

00:01:57.156 --> 00:01:59.796
but she acts rude and can't speak any language

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.396
obviously, the girl isn't raised in a civilized environment

00:02:03.588 --> 00:02:07.044
the sheriff wants to find a temporary place for the girl to stay

00:02:07.188 --> 00:02:08.820
he thinks about the mayor's tavern

00:02:08.916 --> 00:02:12.420
where a group of villagers has gathered to discuss the mysterious girl

00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:15.252
one of the villagers says he once came across the girl

00:02:15.348 --> 00:02:17.844
when he was cutting firewood in the forest

00:02:17.988 --> 00:02:20.532
she stared at him for a while and ran away

00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:24.036
the villagers are afraid that the mysterious girl may be a devil

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.292
while they are having a heated discussion

00:02:26.388 --> 00:02:30.660
the sheriff takes the girl in and asks the mayor's wife if she can shelter the girl

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.484
the mayor's wife rejects him

00:02:32.628 --> 00:02:36.132
for people in town doubt that the girl is related to the death of the priest

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.444
she kindly reminds the sheriff that the girl has a wood carving

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.908
which belongs to a young nomad herdsman living with his uncle on the mountain top

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.892
she suggests the sheriff see if the two herdsmen are well first

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:50.900
for the girl's safety, the sheriff puts her in prison

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.844
and hurries to visit the two herdsmen above the mountain

00:02:54.084 --> 00:02:57.060
the nephew is an orphan raised by his herdsman uncle

00:02:57.108 --> 00:02:59.508
they live together on the top of the mountain

00:02:59.604 --> 00:03:02.868
the sheriff gets to their house but finds no one around

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.556
so he leaves a note and prepares to go

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:07.188
as the sheriff is about to leave

00:03:07.284 --> 00:03:10.260
a shaky hand unexpectedly stretches behind the window

00:03:10.308 --> 00:03:12.324
as if someone is asking for help

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.204
however, the sheriff doesn't notice it and leaves

00:03:15.348 --> 00:03:18.948
he returns to the police station only to find the bishop is waiting

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.836
the bishop believes the girl must be a devil and scares her with a cross

00:03:23.076 --> 00:03:25.188
the girl seems to be afraid of the cross

00:03:25.428 --> 00:03:29.412
to protect her, the sheriff chases the bishop away and takes her home

00:03:29.652 --> 00:03:32.100
he tries to comfort the girl and makes her happy

00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:35.124
the girl seems to like him and kisses him again

00:03:35.364 --> 00:03:36.900
though having a crush on her

00:03:36.996 --> 00:03:39.684
the sheriff controls himself and gets her to sleep

00:03:39.924 --> 00:03:43.044
the sheriff determines to find out the truth about the girl

00:03:43.236 --> 00:03:47.028
the next day, he takes the girl to investigate missing persons in town

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:51.348
he eventually finds a woman who has almost the same appearance as the girl

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.380
however, this woman was suspected of arson and burning three herdsmen

00:03:55.476 --> 00:03:57.780
and she disappeared 25 years ago

00:03:57.876 --> 00:04:01.044
to find out the truth, the sheriff entrusts the girl to the mayor

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.404
and goes to the former sheriff who was responsible for this case

00:04:04.548 --> 00:04:07.620
there, the former sheriff is impressed with the missing woman

00:04:07.716 --> 00:04:10.596
as it's the only unsolved case in his career

00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:13.812
but he knows nothing except that the woman was a gypsy

00:04:14.292 --> 00:04:17.172
while the girl is waiting for the sheriff in the mayor's factory

00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:20.772
the bishop suddenly rushes in with a knife and intends to kill her

00:04:21.012 --> 00:04:23.556
fortunately, the mayor stops him in time

00:04:23.748 --> 00:04:27.348
the girl is scared and runs all the way into the mayor's house

00:04:27.732 --> 00:04:30.996
at this time, the mayor's pregnant wife is at home alone

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.364
seeing the hungry girl rushes in, she kindly brings her some food

00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:39.684
as a Christian, the mayor's wife draws a cross on the food as usual to pray

00:04:39.924 --> 00:04:42.132
however, the girl is frightened by the cross

00:04:42.276 --> 00:04:45.348
and suddenly rushes crazy towards the mayor's wife

00:04:45.636 --> 00:04:48.612
when the sheriff gets back finally, the girl has gone

00:04:48.852 --> 00:04:51.060
so does the mayor's unborn child

00:04:51.396 --> 00:04:53.700
feeling guilty about the mayor and his wife

00:04:53.796 --> 00:04:58.068
the sheriff leaves their house and decides to find out the truth on his own

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.012
in the flashback sometime ago, a stranger Martin paid a visit to the small village

00:05:03.108 --> 00:05:05.172
and happened to see the herdsman uncle

00:05:05.316 --> 00:05:08.148
Martin claimed that he just broke up with his girlfriend

00:05:08.436 --> 00:05:10.884
so he wanted to stay away from the noise of the city

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.860
and joined them in the cabin built on the top of the mountain

00:05:14.004 --> 00:05:17.076
the herdsman uncle took his cash and led Martin to their place

00:05:17.316 --> 00:05:20.964
a long quiet night, they were drinking together to kill the boring time

00:05:21.252 --> 00:05:24.276
Martin thought of his ex-girlfriend and fell into sadness

00:05:24.564 --> 00:05:28.020
to cheer him up, the uncle told a legend about Sennentuntschi

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.916
it is said that three lonely and horny herdsmen created a doll using brooms and rags

00:05:33.156 --> 00:05:36.564
the devil met their wishes and made the doll a real woman

00:05:36.756 --> 00:05:40.020
the doll could not only do housework perfectly during the day

00:05:40.164 --> 00:05:42.804
but also satisfy their hormone desires at night

00:05:43.044 --> 00:05:47.412
after finishing the story, the uncle asked his nephew to make a similar doll

00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:49.812
they were so drunk to sing and dance with the doll

00:05:49.908 --> 00:05:52.356
pretending that the doll had become a real woman

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.236
but actually, none of them took the legend seriously

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.460
however, the next day when they woke up, they saw an actual girl in the kitchen

00:05:59.556 --> 00:06:00.852
wearing the clothes of the doll

00:06:00.948 --> 00:06:03.924
as if the doll had truly turned into a real person

00:06:04.404 --> 00:06:07.956
this is the girl that appeared in the village and was rescued by the sheriff

00:06:08.484 --> 00:06:10.068
the uncle is kind of afraid

00:06:10.212 --> 00:06:13.956
as the girl flayed the three herdsmen and turned them into dolls in the legend

00:06:14.244 --> 00:06:16.740
however, Martin didn't believe that smelly shit

00:06:16.932 --> 00:06:19.524
he insisted that the girl must get lost in the mountain

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.164
and they should send her back before the police come for her

00:06:22.356 --> 00:06:26.004
the uncle agreed at first, but when he's going to take the girl down the mountain

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.084
he couldn't control himself anymore and thus give her a hormone assault

00:06:30.084 --> 00:06:33.012
on the other side, the sheriff is worried about the missing girl

00:06:33.156 --> 00:06:34.932
after she runs out of the mayor's house

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:37.284
but he has no idea where she has gone

00:06:37.428 --> 00:06:42.084
at this time, the sheriff sees a wanted warrant that clearly shows Martin on it

00:06:42.228 --> 00:06:45.348
it happens that Martin is wanted for killing his ex-girlfriend

00:06:45.444 --> 00:06:48.180
but he hides the truth from the uncle and his nephew

00:06:48.564 --> 00:06:52.692
in the flashback, Martin was surprised to see the girl still in their cabin

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.860
to avoid the police search, he dragged the girl out

00:06:55.956 --> 00:06:58.116
and intended to push the girl off the mountain

00:06:58.404 --> 00:07:00.948
however, after the push and pull for a while

00:07:01.092 --> 00:07:05.124
he also couldn't control himself and give her a hormone assault on the way

00:07:05.412 --> 00:07:08.964
so he changed his mind and took the girl back to sate their lust

00:07:09.252 --> 00:07:13.668
at that night, the uncle and Martin even forced the nephew to hormone assault the girl as well

00:07:13.956 --> 00:07:17.748
the next morning, the girl took her revenge to flay all the sheep owned by them

00:07:17.844 --> 00:07:20.388
imitating the way the herdsman uncle slaughtered them

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.700
the uncle was so angry to find that his sheep were all dead

00:07:23.892 --> 00:07:25.860
he swore that he must kill the girl

00:07:26.052 --> 00:07:29.508
however, to keep the girl's life, Martin hid her in the storehouse

00:07:29.604 --> 00:07:31.908
then pretended to search for her with the uncle

00:07:32.196 --> 00:07:36.468
when they got home in the evening, Martin found himself infected with tetanus

00:07:36.708 --> 00:07:40.404
it turns out that he was bitten by the girl when he raped her last night

00:07:40.596 --> 00:07:43.284
the uncle tried to take him to the village for treatment

00:07:43.428 --> 00:07:45.876
however, to avoid being caught by the police

00:07:45.972 --> 00:07:49.140
Martin refused and confided to the uncle about his crime

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.172
having no other choice, the uncle decided to take care of Martin's wound

00:07:53.316 --> 00:07:56.868
he asked the nephew to take some medical alcohol from the storehouse

00:07:57.012 --> 00:08:00.852
the nephew went to the storehouse but was knocked out by the girl hiding there

00:08:01.044 --> 00:08:05.556
haven't seen the nephew's return, the uncle ran into the storehouse to look for him

00:08:05.844 --> 00:08:07.620
when he suddenly found the girl there

00:08:07.668 --> 00:08:12.708
the uncle locked her in the storehouse and burned it immediately, trying to kill her that way

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.076
however, the girl climbed out from the chimney, leaving the nephew inside

00:08:17.316 --> 00:08:20.244
it's too late when the uncle finally saw his nephew in the fire

00:08:20.436 --> 00:08:22.260
the nephew was burned to death

00:08:22.548 --> 00:08:27.156
the uncle was so mad and hung the girl on the beam, swearing to kill her by himself

00:08:27.444 --> 00:08:31.380
at the critical moment, Martin showed up and threatened the uncle to free the girl

00:08:31.572 --> 00:08:36.228
as soon as the girl was released, she grabbed a knife to stab into the old man's body

00:08:36.372 --> 00:08:39.012
Martin couldn't believe what happened in front of him

00:08:39.204 --> 00:08:41.508
he was so weak and fainted once again

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.108
he woke up the second time to see the girl around him in panic

00:08:45.396 --> 00:08:48.228
Martin asked her to get some medicine for him from the village

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.676
though she couldn't understand what Martin meant

00:08:50.772 --> 00:08:52.644
the girl still went down the mountain

00:08:53.028 --> 00:08:55.860
and that's how she met the sheriff in the village before long

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.564
it turns out that the shaky hand on the window during the sheriff's first visit is Martin's

00:09:01.092 --> 00:09:03.300
Martin died in a struggle eventually

00:09:03.588 --> 00:09:07.044
meanwhile, the sheriff keeps searching for the girl after she runs away

00:09:07.332 --> 00:09:10.980
he suddenly thinks of the bishop, who tries to kill the girl several times

00:09:11.316 --> 00:09:13.668
so he privately searches the bishop's house

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.652
and as expected, the sheriff finds a secret chamber with a girl's doll in it

00:09:17.844 --> 00:09:21.300
apparently, a little girl was in captivity there for long

00:09:21.636 --> 00:09:24.612
because of that, the sheriff arrests the bishop immediately

00:09:24.852 --> 00:09:27.780
in the police station, the bishop confesses his crimes

00:09:28.164 --> 00:09:31.956
it's revealed that the missing gypsy woman happens to be the mother of the girl

00:09:32.196 --> 00:09:36.400
25 years ago, the gypsy woman was raped and impregnated by the bishop

00:09:36.708 --> 00:09:40.788
so she ran up the mountain to hide in a house of the legendary three herdsmen

00:09:40.932 --> 00:09:44.532
but she was found by the bishop and forced to fall off the cliff

00:09:44.676 --> 00:09:48.420
to cover up his crimes, the bishop killed the herdsmen and burned their house

00:09:48.516 --> 00:09:51.012
and then hid their daughter in the secret chamber

00:09:51.156 --> 00:09:53.316
the dead priest was taking care of the girl

00:09:53.364 --> 00:09:57.252
every time the priest took her the food, he would threaten her with a cross

00:09:57.396 --> 00:10:00.756
which explains why the missing girl is afraid to see a cross

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.292
he didn't commit suicide

00:10:02.484 --> 00:10:05.796
but died accidentally once the girl tried to escape days ago

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.068
the bishop disguises the priest's death as suicidal to cover all things up

00:10:10.212 --> 00:10:12.996
the girl successfully escaped and ran up the mountain

00:10:13.092 --> 00:10:15.204
to hide in the herdsman's house by accident

00:10:15.444 --> 00:10:17.316
that's how the story begins

00:10:17.556 --> 00:10:19.524
while the sheriff interrogates the bishop

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.604
a kid in the village runs over to tell him that the missing girl is seen on the mountain

00:10:23.796 --> 00:10:28.404
after imprisoning the bishop, the sheriff races to the mountain searching for the girl

00:10:28.644 --> 00:10:32.388
in the herdsman's house, he finally finds the girl he has been thinking about

00:10:32.532 --> 00:10:35.316
they are so happy to meet again and hug each other

00:10:35.556 --> 00:10:39.108
the girl is so excited to see the sheriff and shows him her new "toys"

00:10:39.396 --> 00:10:41.940
much to his shock, her toys happen to be dolls

00:10:42.036 --> 00:10:45.156
made of the herdsman uncle, nephew, and Martin's body

00:10:45.492 --> 00:10:47.988
it turns that the girl has no idea of death

00:10:48.228 --> 00:10:51.636
she just makes the men into dolls in the way the nephew did to the brooms

00:10:51.732 --> 00:10:54.084
thinking that they will be alive in this way

00:10:54.324 --> 00:10:56.004
the sheriff is sick by what he saw

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.748
he suddenly thinks of the bishop's words that the girl is a devil

00:10:59.796 --> 00:11:01.956
he shouts at the girl to get rid of her

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.644
the girl has never seen him like this before

00:11:04.884 --> 00:11:07.140
she is frightened and runs into the mountain

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.876
the mountain is shrouded in clouds and mist

00:11:10.164 --> 00:11:13.332
the sheriff follows her, but the girl can't see the road clearly

00:11:13.476 --> 00:11:15.540
and falls in a ravine carelessly

00:11:15.732 --> 00:11:18.900
the sheriff reproaches himself for showing his anger at her

00:11:18.996 --> 00:11:20.724
he rushes down to find her

00:11:20.923 --> 00:11:24.043
however, the last thing he sees is the girl's dead body

00:11:24.187 --> 00:11:27.115
in regret, he shoots himself to end his life

00:11:27.403 --> 00:11:31.531
in the present, the police search the whole woods, and finally reach the whole truth

00:11:31.627 --> 00:11:34.123
they realize that there's no devil at all

00:11:34.171 --> 00:11:38.059
but just a mortal innocent girl killed by the sheriff's mistake

00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:41.083
