00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.070
Welcome back to Movie Recaps.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.390
Today I will show you an action, adventure,
sci-fi film from 2016, titled The 5th Wave.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.510
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.720
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.050
A girl is seen walking toward a store with
a riffle.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.030
Cassie enters the emptied and destroyed market
and grabs everything she can find when she

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.820
hears someone ask for help.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.580
The girl goes in the back to check.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.950
As she enters the room a man points a gun
at her.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.950
Both of them want the other to drop their
weapon.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.400
He does it first then asks her to do it as
well.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.160
She tells him to move his other hand, hidden
under his jacket.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.760
The man tells her that he's wounded.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.989
When moves his hand, the girl sees something
and thinking it might be a weapon, she shoots

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:35.989
him.

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.260
He had a crucifix in his hand.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.469
In a flashback, we see her at a party with
her friends.

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.410
She and her friend talk about her crush.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.649
As Cassie exits the party, she sees Ben, her
crush.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.370
They have a brief exchange.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.149
Cassie gets home and checks in with her dad
Oliver and says goodnight to her brother Sam.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.549
The next day, Cassie has soccer practice.

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:56.569
Her friend wants to show her something strange
on her phone, but they get interrupted by

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:57.719
their teacher.

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.839
All of a sudden, Cassie notices everyone else
is on their phone because something major

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:01.839
is happening.

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.899
Later, Cassie's family watches the news report
about a mysterious UFO.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.960
Sam runs out of the house and the rest follow
him only to be struck by the image of the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.259
UFO in the sky above them.

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.380
During the first 10 days, the aliens made
no attempt at communicating.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.350
People from Cassie's neighborhood begin to
move away from the cities which is noticeable

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.759
the next day at her school.

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.549
Suddenly, all kinds of devices stop working.

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.650
The kids in the class hear a crash outside
and they see a pile up on the road in front

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.770
of the school.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.329
An airplane is also seen falling from the
sky, crashing near the school, and destroying

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:30.329
some of the cars.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.049
This was a reaction to the electromagnetic
pulse that the aliens had activated - the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.840
1st wave meant to kill all the power.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.549
Later, Cassie's dad picks her up from school.

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.450
She looks at Ben and thinks it will be the
last time she'd see him.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.090
Flash forward some time, Cassie and Sam are
getting water, when the 2nd wave hits like

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.090
an earthquake.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.659
They run away from the falling trees when
a giant wave appears behind them.

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.460
Cassie manages to get Sam and herself to safety,
climbing up on a nearby tree.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.159
They were the lucky ones, unlike the cities
close to the ocean.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.479
Tsunamis had hit all the coastal cities and
every island, completely destroying them.

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.289
After the 2nd wave, the 3rd one was a modified
avian flu that the aliens had sent back to

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.499
the planet, decimating the human population.

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:10.450
Cassie arrives at her school which was made
into an additional medical facility.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.710
She sees her friend there and goes to greet
her, but Cassie's mom appears and tells her

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.520
that her friend is quarantined.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.360
She puts a mask on her and makes her go home.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.900
Later, Cassie and the rest of her family have
a funeral for her mom that died from the flu.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.560
After some time, Cassie is packing essential
things and getting ready to leave.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.800
She ties Sam's shoes as their dad packs the
last of the stuff they'll need.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.030
The three of them leave the house and begin
the trek toward a refugee camp.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.500
They get there before nightfall and are greeted
by one of the main people in the camp.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.020
That night, Oliver pulls Cassie aside from
the others and shows her a gun.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.160
He explains how she should use it and when.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.790
Oliver tells her that she has to keep it on
her constantly and hide it from others.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.890
Cassie takes it, saying that she thought they
were safe there, but Oliver tells her that

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.620
nothing is safe anymore.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.610
Sometime later, everyone hears a strange racket
and sees a cloud of dust approaching the camp.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.260
Suddenly, army tanks drive out of the cloud
and park in the center of the place, along

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.780
with school busses.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.840
Colonel Vosch announces that he and his men
are from an army base and are there to help

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.840
them.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.090
The army officers divide the adults from the
children.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.320
The adults go to the mess hall for a briefing
and the children get on the buses.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.050
Oliver is given the same information as he
and his kids move together toward the bus.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.230
Vosch interrupts his argument with an officer
and tells them the reasons behind the separation.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.750
He explains that the camp is in danger and
since they only have limited transportation,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.020
the army has decided to prioritize getting
the kids back to safety.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.660
Oliver decides to listen to the Colonel and
makes Cassie and Sam get on board.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.410
He tells her to take care of her brother and
assures them that he'll arrive at the base

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.700
soon as well.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.260
Once the kids are inside, Sam realizes he's
forgotten his teddy bear and since Cassie

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.480
can't persuade him to leave without it, she
goes to get it, making him stay on the bus.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.550
Cassie enters the sleeping quarters, but as
soon as she finds the bear, she hears the

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.840
busses leave.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.870
She runs toward them, though never manages
to reach the moving bus.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.100
Meanwhile, Vosch informs the adults that the
army believes that the 4th wave has begun.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.310
The aliens have come down from their ships
and are moving among people, possessing the

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.260
ability to inhabit human hosts and control
their actions.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.940
The people from the camp become rattled and
Vosch tells them that even though they can

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.680
detect the aliens in children, they still
can't detect them in adults.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.320
Everyone asks about their children, but the
colonel tells them that they'll be held in

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.230
a different facility than them because there
is no way to differentiate humans from aliens.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.880
Cassie appears outside of the mess hall, but
Oliver signals her not to come inside and

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.880
to hide.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.940
Suddenly, a man antagonizes the army men,
asking to be let out and everyone begins shooting.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.310
Cassie runs into the woods.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.020
A bit later, the soldiers leave the mess hall
without any civilians.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.360
Cassie comes back and picks up Sam's teddy
bear.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.500
She walks inside the mess and finds Oliver
dead among the others.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.380
Before she leaves, Cassie grabs a riffle and
runs into the woods again.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.850
Later, the children arrive at the base.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.870
As they walk out of the buses, they are given
numbers and told to wait.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.800
The first number called is Ben's.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.570
He's taken inside the facility.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.670
An army doctor is examining him as Sergeant
Reznik questions him.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.040
He tells her that his family died in the previous
waves.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.810
Reznik tells him that he's lucky because he
can avenge their deaths.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.320
Like the rest of the kids, he will help in
the fight against the aliens.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.610
She injects a tracker into his neck.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.870
Ben asks how they can fight the aliens if
they don't know what they are.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.620
Reznik brings him to another room to demonstrate
how they're able to detect them.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.930
She shows him a boy attached to wires and
then gives him a special visor to see the

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:05.930
alien.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.380
It is a parasite that infects humans and controls
them.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.150
No extraction method works so the only way
to kill the parasite is to kill the host.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.180
She hands him a switch to kill the boy.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.090
Ben falters but eventually kills him.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.300
Reznik welcomes him to the fight.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.240
Simultaneously, Cassie is surviving by herself.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.980
She hides in the woods and thinks that she
can't trust anyone.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.040
Her main objective is to get to the base and
find her little brother.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.140
After a long journey, she runs out of water
when she sees the store where we saw her first.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.760
That night, Cassie falls asleep with her brother's
bear.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.010
The next day, she reaches a highway filled
with abandoned cars.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.270
She finds dead bodies scattered between the
vehicles and realizes they have been killed

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.310
recently.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.420
Cassie sees an alien drone and immediately
gets shot in the thigh.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.490
She hides under a truck for a moment, but
remembers her brother and decides to shoot

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.010
her way out of the situation.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.200
Unfortunately, she passes out.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.060
Meanwhile, Vosch prepares the children for
the upcoming battle with the aliens.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.100
He tells them that they are planning a final
attack, a 5th wave.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.240
If the aliens succeed in that wave, humanity
will be wiped out.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.040
The children are thought how to be soldiers,
how to fight, defend and kill, with Vosh constantly

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.800
in their ear proclaiming them as the final
hope for humanity.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.110
Vosch asks them if they can do what he asks
them to do and all of them, apart from Ben

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.460
and Sam, confirm that they can.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.919
Cassie wakes up in a bed, with her wound dressed
and attached to an IV.

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.740
Suddenly, someone walks up the stairs and
as he enters, she pretends to be asleep.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.150
The next day, Cassie takes out the needle
from the IV, gets to her backpack to find

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.150
her gun, but falls over because her wound
is still fresh.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.440
She hears the man coming and gets back into
bed.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.360
When the man walks in, he tells her that he
knows she's awake.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.260
He introduces himself as Evan.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.870
Cassie asks where she is, and Evan tells her
how he found her and brought her there.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.260
She asks for her gun, but he says that he
didn't see one where he found her.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.820
Suddenly, Evan realizes that Cassie might
have torn her stitches, and when he confirms

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.570
his suspicion, he picks her up and takes her
to the bathroom to fix her up again.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.139
As he's sanitizing her wound, Evan tells her
that she's been there for a week.

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:54.870
Then Cassie asks how far they are from the
base and he tells her.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.970
Later, he asks her why she asked about the
base and Cassie tells him about Sam.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.550
Evan tells her that he wanted to help her
because he couldn't save his family and he

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.450
needed to feel more human.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.240
At the base, the kids are playing poker, already
settled into their new roles.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.680
They talk about the new recruit joining their
squad when Reznik brings her in and introduces

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.889
her as Ringer.

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:13.350
She shows her to her bunk.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.419
As soon as Ringer puts her stuff down she
goes over to Ben and asks if he's the leader

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:17.610
of the squad.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.110
The girl wants to assert her dominance on
him and everyone else, so she antagonizes

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.710
them by belittling them as a squad and threatening
them.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.730
Ringer asks Ben if he plays chess when one
of the other kids tells her that they don't

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.460
but they can play strip poker.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.710
She punches him in the throat and says that
she won't allow for any demeaning and sexist

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:32.710
remarks.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.440
Teacup likes her attitude.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.650
Simultaneously, Cassie is planning her route
to the base, still staying with Evan.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.180
While he's in the yard, she goes to his room
and finds a secret compartment.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.810
Cassie finds her gun hidden there.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.930
She grabs it, packs in a hurry, and limps
out of the house.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.920
Cassie sets off a booby trap and Evan catches
her, disarms her, and pulls her down, telling

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.110
her to be quiet.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.300
An alien vessel flies over them and a hunter
looks for them in the woods.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.150
When they get back to the house, Evan tells
her that he didn’t' tell her about the gun

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.450
because he was afraid she was an alien.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.930
Cassie's stumped since he's right to be suspicious
too.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.229
Evan tells her that the hunter is an alien
and he tracks people down along with the alien

00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:07.229
drones.

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:09.960
They talk about her going to the base to get
her brother, but Evan says that he might be

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.370
dead already.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.639
Cassie doesn't agree and says that she'll
go get him.

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:16.580
Evan follows her into her room and tells her
that he'll come with her.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.350
He says that he'll get her there, even though
he can't promise what they'll find at the

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.350
base.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.889
In the meantime, Ben gets closer to Ringer.

00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:26.050
She tells him that unlike him, she had to
take care of herself even before the aliens

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.380
came so she was ready for the end of the world.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.250
Ringer was doing fine before they dragged
her into the school bus.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.519
Ben corrects her, saying they were rescued.

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:35.119
She says that they were drafted.

00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:38.459
The two of them are sparring partners and
Ben tells her that if he can take her down,

00:08:38.459 --> 00:08:40.800
she'll teach him and the rest of the squad
how to shoot.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.599
She agrees and takes him down easily.

00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:46.579
Unfortunately, she gets a little cocky, so
he tackles her down second.

00:08:46.579 --> 00:08:48.610
Cassie and Evan are on their way to the base.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.740
She asks him to teach her how to disarm someone
the way he disarmed her.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.069
Evan patronizes her and she calls him out,
telling him that she isn't trying to be tough,

00:08:55.069 --> 00:08:57.800
but that she promised her brother that she
would save him.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.709
Cassie gets her point across so Evan decides
to show her how to do it.

00:09:00.709 --> 00:09:04.620
First, he demonstrates on her, then he lets
her try a few times and also teaches her how

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.220
to subdue her attacker.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.439
She thanks him and they continue their journey
to the base.

00:09:08.439 --> 00:09:11.100
There, Ringer is teaching her squad how to
shoot.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.459
She gives them a few tips and tells them to
try again.

00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:16.550
Reznik joins them and tells Ben that the Colonel
wants to see him.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.480
The boy follows her to a war room.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.069
Vosch calls him over and informs him of several
simultaneous attacks on different cities.

00:09:22.069 --> 00:09:24.740
The 5th wave of the invasion has begun.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.160
He shows him an improved and mobile version
of the visor they used in medical before with

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.360
which they can see the aliens on the battlefront.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.540
Vosch tells him that they need to test the
visors on the field and he'll send Ben's squad

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.589
as one of four to do that the next day.

00:09:35.589 --> 00:09:38.209
He tells him to bring his squad back in one
piece.

00:09:38.209 --> 00:09:40.699
In the woods, Cassie wakes up in the tent
alone.

00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:43.149
She looks for Evan and finds him bathing in
the river.

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:45.550
He notices her watching him and she runs away.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.709
When Evan gets back to their camp and finds
Cassie looking through her photos.

00:09:48.709 --> 00:09:52.439
He asks her about her best friend and recognizes
Ben in a photo from his description in her

00:09:52.439 --> 00:09:53.439
journal.

00:09:53.439 --> 00:09:55.089
Cassie is embarrassed that he's read it.

00:09:55.089 --> 00:09:58.269
Evan then sees a photo of Sam and tells her
that he can't wait to meet him.

00:09:58.269 --> 00:10:01.589
They pack up and leave the campsite, then
follow the train tracks, until night falls

00:10:01.589 --> 00:10:03.009
and they find shelter.

00:10:03.009 --> 00:10:05.920
The same night, Ben and Sam can't sleep and
they talk.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.329
The boy begins to sing the way Cassie sang
to him before everything happened.

00:10:09.329 --> 00:10:12.310
Ben sings with him, annoying the rest of the
squad, except Ringer.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.059
Meanwhile, Evan helps Cassie redress her wound.

00:10:15.059 --> 00:10:16.300
She kisses him and thanks him.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.559
Early that morning, the squad is getting into
a helicopter to get to the testing site.

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:23.800
Ringer asks Ben where Sam is and he tells
her that he has food poisoning, but he actually

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.110
restrained the little boy in the bathroom
so he stays safely in the base.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.110
He's left his locket with Sam as well.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.749
The squad arrives at the location and an officer
asks Ben what their mission is.

00:10:32.749 --> 00:10:35.939
He says that they are to infiltrate the enemy's
nest and terminate them.

00:10:35.939 --> 00:10:38.829
She reminds them that the visors light up
green for aliens and that once they're done

00:10:38.829 --> 00:10:40.600
they should signal for extraction.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.889
The helicopter drops them off and leaves as
they enter enemy territory.

00:10:43.889 --> 00:10:47.749
Ben leads his squad of kids forward when one
of them sees two aliens straight ahead.

00:10:47.749 --> 00:10:50.629
Before the squad can engage, they start shooting
at them.

00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:54.009
Finding themselves in a tight situation, they
hide in an alley and Ben tells them to run

00:10:54.009 --> 00:10:55.740
and take shelter in a bus.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.699
He and Ringer are the last ones in so Ben
closes the doors.

00:10:58.699 --> 00:11:01.319
They receive more enemy fire and one of them
gets shot.

00:11:01.319 --> 00:11:04.649
Ringer realizes that they can't stay there
and acts as a distraction for the enemy until

00:11:04.649 --> 00:11:06.670
the rest can get to another ally.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.240
Ben tells the others to get ready to run on
his call.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.009
Ringer yells for them to run and as they do,
the bus she rigged explodes behind them.

00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:16.720
The squad gets into an abandoned mall and
when they clear it, they settle down.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.699
Ringer joins them and immediately voices her
suspicion that something isn't right with

00:11:19.699 --> 00:11:20.889
the aliens.

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:24.490
She wonders how can they make earthquakes
and yet be afraid of an army of children.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.679
Ringer decides to escape the army, so she
takes out her tracker.

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:31.420
The moment she does, the rest read her as
an alien on their visors and freak out.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.149
They don't know what to do until Ben realizes
what is happening.

00:11:34.149 --> 00:11:37.070
He takes out his tracker and the others see
him as an alien too.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.160
Ben says that he's not an alien and neither
are the people that were shooting at them

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.160
earlier.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.639
Reznik and Vosch lied to them.

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:46.329
He says that green actually means human and
that the visors and the trackers were fake.

00:11:46.329 --> 00:11:49.759
The real test was on them, to see how they
would react to the situation.

00:11:49.759 --> 00:11:53.800
When the others question his logic, he explains
that the army is actually the aliens, manipulating

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.739
kids to do their dirty work and pick off the
rest of the survivors.

00:11:56.739 --> 00:12:00.310
Ben tells them that they're not fighting the
5th wave, but that they are the 5th wave.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.790
Teacup asks what they should do and he tells
all of them to take out their trackers.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.509
Ben will be the only one to go back to the
base to save Sam.

00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:09.019
He tells Ringer to shoot him so it looks real.

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:11.699
Simultaneously, hunters find Evan and Cassie.

00:12:11.699 --> 00:12:14.480
Evan walks out of the truck and one of them
tells him that he's out of his drone sector

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.959
then shoots at him.

00:12:15.959 --> 00:12:19.540
Cassie wakes up to find Eva struggling with
the two men and he tells her to run.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.720
Before she does, Cassie takes out the gun
and is looking for ammo when she sees something

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.339
strange, then Evan falling next to the truck.

00:12:25.339 --> 00:12:28.489
One of the men is going after her and she
manages to escape briefly until he grabs her

00:12:28.489 --> 00:12:30.079
outside of the truck.

00:12:30.079 --> 00:12:32.540
Cassie fires the gun, but Evan comes to her
rescue.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.930
He struggles with the man with incredible
force and kills him in the end.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.149
Cassie figures out something is off, so she
threatens him with her gun.

00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:42.660
Evan tells her that he's both human and alien
- a sleeper agent created long before the

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.110
invasion started.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.220
When the ship arrived in orbit, the alien
part of him woke up.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.459
Cassie asks him if killed his family, but
Evan says it was the disease.

00:12:50.459 --> 00:12:54.089
He tells her that, unlike his kind who don't
believe in love, when he saw her he fell in

00:12:54.089 --> 00:12:56.370
love with her and regained his human side.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.430
Ben had been tracking Cassie before and when
another hunter shot her, he killed him to

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:00.430
save her.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.449
He is now a firm believer in love because
of her.

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:05.649
Cassie prepares to shoot him when he tells
her the truth about the army.

00:13:05.649 --> 00:13:08.420
She walks off and Evan tells her that she
shouldn't be armed when she gets there because

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.730
they'll kill her.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.220
Cassie tells him that if he follows her, she'll
kill him.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.980
Meanwhile, Ben gets to a helicopter and back
to the base.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.360
Later, she fake falls in front of a school
bus and they take her in.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.560
Her number gets called and she gets the same
treatment in the base from Reznik.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.660
As she shows Cassie the alien, she hits Reznik
over the head.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.449
They struggle for a while, but Cassie kills
her, then removes the tracker.

00:13:28.449 --> 00:13:31.399
She takes her clothes and goes through the
base looking for her brother.

00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:34.730
Ben is at a briefing with Colonel Vosch, but
he knows what the boy is up to.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.069
He asks him what he knows and Ben says that
he knows what they are, then realizes that

00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:39.269
they will kill him.

00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:42.509
Vosch says that humans did nothing to deserve
what happened to them other than occupying

00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:45.869
a space they needed, then faces him with another
truth about humans.

00:13:45.869 --> 00:13:48.980
Namely, that we've been doing the same things
to others for centuries.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.730
Suddenly, an officer comes in and tells them
that Reznik has been killed, as well as three

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.209
guards at the west gate.

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:56.339
An explosion is heard from inside the base.

00:13:56.339 --> 00:13:59.899
Vosch orders the child army to be deployed
and for his officers to find out who's attacking

00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:00.899
them.

00:14:00.899 --> 00:14:04.029
Ben fights off and kills the soldier detaining
him and takes off his tracker.

00:14:04.029 --> 00:14:07.799
Simultaneously, Cassie is running through
the hallways as another explosion hits.

00:14:07.799 --> 00:14:11.499
Vosch orders drones to be deployed on the
site so they can see who's attacking them.

00:14:11.499 --> 00:14:13.769
Cassie runs into Ben and disarms him instantly.

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:16.949
They recognize each other and she tells him
that she's looking for Sam.

00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:20.220
Ben tells her that the army is the aliens
and that they are deploying her brother into

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.220
battle.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.990
He says that they need to get to him fast
or she won't see him again.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.110
Cassie trusts him and they go to find him
together.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.279
Two soldiers stop them when Evan shows up
and incapacitates them.

00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:32.369
Evan tells them that he planted the bombs
and once the last of the planes with the kids'

00:14:32.369 --> 00:14:34.509
leaves, he'll take the base down for good.

00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:38.160
He's sorry that he lied to Cassie and says
that he chose his human side because of her.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.110
Ben and Cassie run to find Sam before Evan
blows the base up.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.489
They get to the transport lines only to find
that all of the children are there.

00:14:44.489 --> 00:14:47.930
Both of them move between the lines to locate
Sam when Cassie finally sees him and gets

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:48.930
to him.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.509
Ben shows them to an escape door and once
they reunite Cassie gives him his teddy bear.

00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:54.679
Ben takes his tracker out and they run out.

00:14:54.679 --> 00:14:57.389
Simultaneously, Vosch is evacuating the base.

00:14:57.389 --> 00:15:00.990
He sees Ben and the others running, gets in
the helicopter, and goes after them, but he

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:03.559
doesn't manage to kill them before the base
explodes.

00:15:03.559 --> 00:15:07.689
Suddenly, Ringer and the rest of Ben's squad
appear in an army truck and save them.

00:15:07.689 --> 00:15:09.879
Cassie watches the base explode and thinks
about Evan.

00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:13.379
Later, the squad has set up someplace, resting
and eating.

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:15.860
Ben talks to Cassie and asks her what they
should do.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.480
She says that they need to save the other
kids, but she still doesn't know how to.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.019
Ben tells her that they should worry about
that the next day.

00:15:22.019 --> 00:15:26.809
They join the others of the squad and hope
for a better tomorrow.
