00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.880
Story Recapped here. Today, I'm going to&nbsp;
explain a Horror film called "Session 9."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.600
Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.000
Danvers State Hospital, a psychiatric institution&nbsp;
that has remained empty for more than a decade,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.280
is being turned into a town hall. The&nbsp;
government invites several companies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.960
to submit their proposals to clean up the&nbsp;
asbestos from the building. One of the companies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.800
interested in submitting a bid is the Hazmat&nbsp;
Elimination Company, owned by Gordon Flemming.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.200
Gordon is stressed with his newborn baby Emma,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.120
and it is evident from the tired look on his&nbsp;
face when he shows up with his associate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.760
Phil, to survey the hospital. Phil notices his&nbsp;
weariness, so he tells Gordon that he's there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.840
for him if he needs help. Soon, the security&nbsp;
guard at the facility approaches them and lets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.920
them know that Bill Griggs, who will lead the&nbsp;
tour at the hospital, will be arriving soon.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.240
As they drive to the complex, Gordon tells Phil&nbsp;
that they're not the first company that showed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.240
up to survey the hospital. A company called&nbsp;
American Yankees has made quite a low bid with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.480
a promise to do the job quickly. Phil points&nbsp;
out that Griggs likes the bids fast and low,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.240
so Phil asks Gordon if he could do the&nbsp;
negotiations, but Gordon says he'll do it himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.840
As they pass by the hospital, Phil&nbsp;
is dazzled by the buildingâ€™s facade.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.920
Griggs starts the tour by pointing out that the&nbsp;
layout of the building, which was finished in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.560
1871, looks like a bat, with one wing for&nbsp;
female patients and the other for males.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.400
Griggs couldn't tear down the place because it&nbsp;
is listed in the national historic register.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.760
Griggs leads them to the dining area and tells&nbsp;
them that it will be turned into the municipal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.680
archives. Phil and Gordon point out that the&nbsp;
tiles in the room are loaded with asbestos,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.440
so they have to be removed. Griggs tells them&nbsp;
that the other companies did not mention that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.440
to him. Griggs then takes the two men to&nbsp;
the female wing, known as Ward C, but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.760
have to go through Ward A, where the most extreme&nbsp;
patients were once confined. While Gordon stares&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.760
at the chair across the hall, he hears an eerie&nbsp;
voice call out to him. They continue the tour&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.440
down the tunnel once used as a fallout shelter,&nbsp;
where Gordon notices ducts that need some work.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.760
After the tour, Phil tells Griggs that the&nbsp;
whole building can be cleaned up of asbestos&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.720
within three weeks, but Gordon insists&nbsp;
that it can be done within two weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.320
Phil comes across a room filled with&nbsp;
magazine cut-outs pasted to the walls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.160
and calls the attention of the two other men.&nbsp;
Griggs discloses that it was a room used for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.080
art therapy and creative expression to boost&nbsp;
the patients' self-esteem. Gordon stares at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.520
the pictures on the wall, wondering what went&nbsp;
wrong with the patient confined to that room.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.080
Upon exiting the building, Phil realizes that he&nbsp;
left his bag inside, so he goes back to retrieve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.200
it. While waiting for Phil, Gordon&nbsp;
tells Griggs that he wants to match&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.320
the bid made by the American Yankees&nbsp;
because he really needs the job.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.560
He assures Griggs that the&nbsp;
clean-up can be done within a week.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.440
Later, Gordon looks at photos of his family while&nbsp;
he's sitting in his car outside their house.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.720
When he looks outside, he sees his wife, Wendy,&nbsp;
taking their baby inside their home, greeting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.600
him with a faint smile. Soon, he gets out of the&nbsp;
vehicle carrying his bag and a bundle of flowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.720
His wife tells him that the flowers are&nbsp;
lovely and asks him what the occasion is.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.360
Soon, Gordon and his employees start working&nbsp;
to remove the asbestos at the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.320
Gordon's nephew, Jeff, tries to operate the&nbsp;
floor removal machine, but the vehicle suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.280
shuts down, so Mike, another member of the&nbsp;
crew, tells Jeff to check the breaker box.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.280
Jeff reluctantly tells Mike that he can't do it&nbsp;
because he has nyctophobia, a fear of the dark.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.120
Mike goes down to the basement to plug in&nbsp;
the machine, but he notices a light in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.080
storage room, so he goes inside to investigate. He&nbsp;
notices a box marked "evidence" on top of a shelf,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.160
so he gets curious and opens it with a box cutter.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.800
During their break, their friend, Hank,&nbsp;
sarcastically tells Gordon that they got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.640
a perfect gig because they're working in an&nbsp;
insane asylum. Phil tells him to be grateful,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.600
pointing out that they'll make a lot&nbsp;
of money if they finish the gig early.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.520
He discloses that they'll get a $10,000&nbsp;
bonus if they finish the job within the week.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.840
When the guard brings them the keys to the gates,&nbsp;
Jeff asks him why the hospital was shut down. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.520
guard explains that several mental institutions&nbsp;
were closed during the '80s due to budget cuts.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.440
Mike points out that it wasn't just the&nbsp;
budget cuts that caused the shutdown.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.760
He recounts that there was a scandal involving&nbsp;
a patient named Patricia Willard in 1984.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.200
Patricia was committed to the hospital&nbsp;
in the 1970s due to manic depression,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.800
but when she underwent Repressed Memory Therapy,&nbsp;
she recalled the horrible things that happened to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.840
her. Her father forced himself on her three times&nbsp;
a week when she was 10. On top of that, he also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.600
brought her into the woods, where her parents and&nbsp;
grandparents performed horrific rituals wearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.360
black robes. They would make her watch while they&nbsp;
cut out the heart of a baby and drink the blood.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.320
Mike tells them that the phenomenon, known as the&nbsp;
Satanic Ritual Abuse Syndrome, happened across the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.200
U.S. in the '80s. Patricia was about to sue her&nbsp;
own parents, but she abruptly dropped the lawsuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.720
Her parents have apparently discovered that a&nbsp;
physical examination on Patricia the previous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.080
year indicated that she was a virgin. Mike&nbsp;
discloses that the parents countersued&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.120
and won the case because the memories&nbsp;
gleaned from the therapy never happened.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.720
While carrying equipment to the building,&nbsp;
Phil notices that Gordon has a limp. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.960
he asks about it, Gordon tells him that he pulled&nbsp;
a muscle. Phil is worried about losing the bonus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.280
so he suggests replacing someone on the team&nbsp;
with Craig Mcmanus, who works American Yankees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.720
He assures Gordon that Craig will leave&nbsp;
the company when he hears about the bonus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.720
He points out that Craig is more experienced&nbsp;
than Hank, and he cares more about the job.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.480
Gordon is displeased with Phil's suggestion&nbsp;
and refuses to let Hank go given their history,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.080
but he promises Phil that he'll fire&nbsp;
Hank once he becomes a liability.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.000
After the rest of the crew leaves, Mike stays&nbsp;
behind to listen to an audiotape he found inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.720
the evidence box. He learns that the tape is a&nbsp;
counseling session of a patient named Mary Hobbes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.840
who seems to be suffering from a&nbsp;
dissociative identity disorder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.280
Mary sobs uncontrollably while she&nbsp;
tells the doctor that she misses Peter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.520
The doctor then asks her to recount what happened&nbsp;
22 years ago on Christmas night in Lowell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.280
Mary tells him that nothing happened, but the&nbsp;
doctor insists that something did transpire that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.600
night, and they're doing the sessions to help her&nbsp;
remember. Mary grows agitated from the session,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.640
with the doctor noting that Mary is putting&nbsp;
her fingers inside her mouth to cope.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.840
Suddenly, Mike hears a higher-pitched voice asking&nbsp;
the doctor if he wants to share a doll. The doctor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.360
addresses her as Princess, which is listed as&nbsp;
one of the alternate personalities of Mary.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.360
The doctor asks Princess what happened that&nbsp;
Christmas night, so Princess tells him that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.920
they received presents. Mary got a china doll&nbsp;
while Peter received a big knife. While their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.600
parents were asleep, they went upstairs to&nbsp;
play hide and seek. When the doctor asks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.880
who's playing the game, Princess tells&nbsp;
him that she was joined by Mary, Peter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.360
and Billy. When the doctor asks about Simon, she&nbsp;
tells him that she doesn't know anyone by that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.760
name. Princess tells the doctor that she's tired,&nbsp;
so he tells her that he'd like to talk to Billy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.920
However, Princess tells him that Billy is&nbsp;
asleep. Meanwhile, Gordon parks in front of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.160
his house and sits by the car waiting. He winces&nbsp;
in pain when his pants brush up against his leg.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.920
On Tuesday, Gordon suddenly hears a&nbsp;
voice as he stares out the window,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.680
but he gets startled by Phil banging on the&nbsp;
ceiling. Jeff asks Mike about the tension&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.840
between Phil and Hank the previous day, so Mike&nbsp;
explains that Hank stole Phil's girlfriend, Amy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.240
He warns him not to get on Phil's bad side because&nbsp;
Phil will give him the most exhausting tasks.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.640
Down in the tunnel, Hank comes across an antique&nbsp;
coin on the floor while he's tagging the ducts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.040
As he walks further, he finds another coin&nbsp;
marked 1883, so he looks around and sees another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.200
coin sticking out from a brick. He removes the&nbsp;
brick with a palette knife, and a pile of coins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.360
pours out of the wall along with a few other&nbsp;
items. As he gleefully inspects his discovery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.120
Phil calls him on the radio, telling him to bring&nbsp;
his gear and work with Jeff and Mike after lunch.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.520
During lunchtime, Mike listens to the audiotapes&nbsp;
in the basement instead of eating with the rest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.480
of the crew. This time, the doctor meets Billy and&nbsp;
asks him where the alters reside in Mary's body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.360
Billy tells him that Princess is in&nbsp;
the tongue because she talks too much,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.200
while he lives in the eyes because he can see&nbsp;
everything. When the doctor asks about Simon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.400
he doesn't get a response. When Mike&nbsp;
goes out to have lunch with the crew,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.640
Gordon scolds him for not being there on time.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.640
Gordon calls his wife on the phone, but she hangs&nbsp;
up on him before he could say what he wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.400
While looking through the window, he sees Phil&nbsp;
talking with two young men by the generator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.960
He observes Phil suspiciously as&nbsp;
the two men walk away from him.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.960
That night, Hank drives back to collect&nbsp;
the coins hidden behind the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.880
While inspecting the items, he hears a noise&nbsp;
close by even though he's wearing headphones.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.400
He soon continues retrieving items from the&nbsp;
wall and finds a sharp lobotomy tool called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.960
the orbitoclast. He puts coins and other items&nbsp;
in the bag and starts looking for the exit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.240
While walking around the corridor, he hears a&nbsp;
noise behind him while he's inspecting a bottle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.680
of peanut butter he found on the floor.&nbsp;
He nervously shines the light at the end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.560
of the corridor but sees nothing. As soon as he&nbsp;
walks away, he hears the noise again. This time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.280
he sees a dark figure emerging,&nbsp;
so he runs toward the exit.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.520
Hank calms down after seeing birds flying around&nbsp;
the corridors, thinking that he just imagined&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.840
the figure he saw earlier. He gathers his breath&nbsp;
as he slowly walks toward the exit, but when he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.160
reaches the corner, someone intercepts him. The&nbsp;
following day, Hank does not show up for work.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.720
Gordon calls him on the phone, but he couldn't&nbsp;
even get the answering machine. Mike suggests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.440
calling Amy, so Phil asks Gordon to hand over the&nbsp;
phone to him. After the phone call, Phil tells the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.880
crew that Hank went to Miami to Casino School&nbsp;
after bragging about finding his meal ticket.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.200
Phil asks Mike to call Craig to see if he still&nbsp;
wants to work with them. He tells Gordon that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.120
Hank's disappearance is a blessing, but Gordon&nbsp;
suspects that something terrible has happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.920
He asks Phil what he talked about with&nbsp;
the two men he met the previous day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.000
Phil walks away feeling insulted that Gordon&nbsp;
is questioning his performance and integrity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.160
but Gordon grabs him, telling Phil not to walk&nbsp;
away from him. Phil taunts Gordon to hit him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.600
but Gordon leaves so he could calm&nbsp;
himself down. While sitting on the stairs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.320
he notices his fingers bleeding and&nbsp;
wonders how he got those injuries.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.200
Outside, Phil vents to Mike, asserting that Gordon&nbsp;
has been losing gigs because he's too stressed by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.600
the newborn baby. He surmises that Gordon didn't&nbsp;
really want to have a baby, and it's compromising&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.840
his ability to do his job. Mike soon gets tired&nbsp;
of listening to Phil, so he goes down to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.240
basement to look at Mary's file. Gordon tries&nbsp;
calling his wife, asking her to forgive him, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.400
he doesn't get a response. Jeff arrives and tells&nbsp;
Gordon that he's grateful that he gave him a job.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.800
Jeff promises that he will work hard, so he&nbsp;
advises his uncle not to stress himself out.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.320
Mike listens to more tapes of Mary's&nbsp;
counseling sessions and hears Mary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.440
crying because her family wouldn't pay her&nbsp;
a visit. The doctor asks her how she got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.040
the scars on her chest, so she explains&nbsp;
that she got them from a bike accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.040
He proceeds to inquire about her alters, but&nbsp;
Mary claims she doesn't know any of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.360
Mary tells the doctor that she's tired and wants&nbsp;
to go back to her room, so Billy takes over.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.960
When the doctor asks Billy what happened in&nbsp;
Lowell, he contends that the doctor already knows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.040
exactly what transpired that night. The doctor&nbsp;
stresses that Mary needs to know what happened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.040
but Billy strongly objects. The doctor then&nbsp;
instructs Billy to wake up Simon because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.240
he might want to recount what occurred that&nbsp;
Christmas night, but Billy tells him he's scared.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.480
While getting ready to go home, Gordon asks&nbsp;
Phil the stupidest thing he's done in his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.760
Phil says that he regrets introducing Amy to Hank.&nbsp;
Gordon suddenly blurts out that he hit his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.400
He explains that he brought flowers&nbsp;
and champagne home last Friday to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.680
celebrate getting the job from Griggs.&nbsp;
When he approached to kiss Wendy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.520
she turned around and accidentally poured&nbsp;
boiling water on his leg, so he slapped her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.880
He regrets hitting Wendy over an accident&nbsp;
and assures Phil that he loves her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.320
He reveals that he's been staying at a motel&nbsp;
since that night and asks Phil not to let the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.920
other crew members know about it. Phil tells&nbsp;
Gordon that the young men he was talking to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.440
other day were graffiti artists, and he told&nbsp;
him never to set foot in the hospital again.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.400
That night, Gordon hears the&nbsp;
voice again while he's sleeping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.160
in the van. He recalls bringing home&nbsp;
flowers to his wife, but this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.680
the voice urges him to "Do it," and&nbsp;
he hears his wife scream. Suddenly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.680
he wakes up from the horrible dream in his van&nbsp;
parked just outside the hospital. He takes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.360
bottle of hydrogen peroxide and pours it on&nbsp;
his burnt leg, causing him to yell out in pain.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.080
In the morning, Phil lights up a funny cigarette&nbsp;
and takes a puff, but he puts it away when he sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.600
Gordon's van arriving. He tells Gordon that&nbsp;
Craig will start working for them the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.760
day. When he asks Gordon if he's okay, Gordon&nbsp;
tearfully tells him that he wants to go home.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.680
While Jeff operates the tile remover,&nbsp;
the machine abruptly turns off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.360
so Mike tells Jeff that he's going to check&nbsp;
the breakers. However, Phil comes in and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.600
tells Mike to take a break with him. He tells&nbsp;
Jeff to go downstairs despite his nyctophobia.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.920
Phil tells Mike that they need to deal with&nbsp;
Gordon because he's becoming a liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.320
Mike contends that Phil is just being paranoid,&nbsp;
so Phil divulges that Gordon struck his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.920
Unbeknownst to Phil, Gordon is downstairs&nbsp;
overhearing their conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.200
Phil tells Mike that he'll take over&nbsp;
because he doesn't want to lose the bonus.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.320
When Gordon approaches them, Mike tells&nbsp;
him that they're just talking about Jeff.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.560
Meanwhile, Jeff goes down to the basement to&nbsp;
check the circuit breakers. After plugging in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.400
the machine, he sees Hank by the window on the&nbsp;
stairwell, but he's unresponsive when Jeff talks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.800
to him. Jeff tells him that he's in trouble with&nbsp;
Phil and Gordon, but Hank just asks him, "What&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.800
are you doing here?" Hank repeats the question&nbsp;
when Jeff asks him if he scored big on a lottery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.200
scratch-off ticket. When Jeff sees blood on Hank's&nbsp;
finger, he leaves Hank so he could tell the crew.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.800
Gordon notes that it's lunchtime,&nbsp;
so he tells Phil to place an order.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.920
Phil, however, tells Mike that they should flip&nbsp;
a coin. After throwing it in the air, Mike calls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.720
heads, but it lands on tails. Gordon looks at the&nbsp;
coin they used and looks suspiciously at Phil.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.480
Before Gordon could say anything, Jeff&nbsp;
arrives and tells them that he found Hank.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.680
However, Phil refuses to believe&nbsp;
him, saying Hank's already in Miami.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.320
When the crew goes to the staircase, Hank is&nbsp;
nowhere to be seen, but Gordon notices a coin on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.560
the floor, hinting that someone was there. Phil&nbsp;
insists that Hank is in Miami, noting that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.800
all heard it over the phone when he talked with&nbsp;
Amy. Gordon, however, points out that Phil was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.280
only one who heard it. Gordon asks Mike to give&nbsp;
him a phone so that he could talk to Amy himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.440
As they continue to argue, they hear footsteps&nbsp;
above them. Gordon tells Mike and Jeff to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.960
downstairs to make sure they don't lose Hank,&nbsp;
but Phil tells Gordon that he's going with Jeff.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.880
Jeff tells Phil that he heard the footsteps&nbsp;
going through the corridors of Ward A,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.320
but Phil tells him that it's safer down the&nbsp;
tunnels. Mike tells Gordon that he's heading&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.320
to the tunnels because he heard something down&nbsp;
there. Before Gordon could object, Mike is long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.400
gone. Instead of searching for Hank, Mike goes&nbsp;
to the storage room to listen to Mary's tapes.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.960
Phil goes further down the tunnels and asks&nbsp;
Jeff to wait for him. Before Phil could leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.680
Jeff mentions that Hank had blood on&nbsp;
his hand when he was at the staircase.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.920
In the audiotape for session 9, the doctor&nbsp;
asks Billy if he could recount what happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.360
on Christmas eve. Billy recalls that&nbsp;
Mary was looking at her new doll,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.840
and she's trying to find Peter in&nbsp;
the dark while playing hide and seek.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.080
Billy refuses to talk about the incident any&nbsp;
further, saying Mary doesn't know what Simon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.240
did to Peter. Mike skips through the tape after&nbsp;
hearing Billy refuse to reveal what Simon did.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.800
While Jeff waits for Phil to come back, the lights&nbsp;
suddenly go dim because the fuel for the generator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.120
is running low. Meanwhile, Gordon hears the&nbsp;
mysterious voice while searching for Hank.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.800
Down in the tunnels, Phil sees Hank's clothes&nbsp;
scattered on the floor and hears him repeating,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.640
"What are you doing here?" Elsewhere in the&nbsp;
tunnels, Jeff reaches the narrow corridors of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.840
the tunnel and sees the lights go out behind&nbsp;
him, so he runs away screaming in terror.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.560
Gordon tells Phil over the C.B. radio that&nbsp;
he thinks he found Hank, but Phil sees Hank&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.520
in front of him sitting in the dark wearing&nbsp;
nothing but his underwear and sunglasses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.680
Outside the building, Mike puts fuel&nbsp;
in the generator and turns it back on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.320
When the tape starts playing again, a deep male&nbsp;
voice greets the doctor. When the doctor asks the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.560
alter, Simon, what happened on Christmas night,&nbsp;
he tells the doctor to use his imagination.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.520
Simon recounts that Peter had been naughty because&nbsp;
he scared Mary. Peter crept up behind her and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.400
scared her, causing her to fall on her doll. Simon&nbsp;
recalls that the accident injured Mary real bad,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.040
noting that Mary needed help,&nbsp;
so he introduced himself to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.040
Meanwhile, Gordon has reached room #444, where&nbsp;
Mary was once confined. Simon urged Mary to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.360
cut Peter up with his own knife. Afterward, he&nbsp;
feared that Mary's parents would get mad at her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.520
so he told her to cut them up as well. Simon&nbsp;
then tells the doctor that Mary wanted to do it.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.840
Phil soon finds Gordon in Mary's room,&nbsp;
staring at the pictures of Wendy and Emma.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.400
Jeff runs outside crying hysterically because&nbsp;
of his nyctophobia. Soon, he reaches the van and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.040
grabs the C.B. radio to tell Gordon that he's by&nbsp;
the van. When an unseen crew member arrives, Jeff&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.400
explains that he freaked out because the lights&nbsp;
went out, but then the crew member attacks him.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.680
On Friday, Phil asks Gordon&nbsp;
to come back to the building,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.120
saying he found the one responsible&nbsp;
for mysterious incidents. Meanwhile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.560
Craig arrives at the facility and marvels&nbsp;
at the beauty of the building's facade.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.720
While walking around the Ward, Gordon is shocked&nbsp;
to see Hank lying on the floor. Phil tells him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.640
that Hank has become a liability, adding that&nbsp;
Hank brought it upon himself. When Gordon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.240
accuses Phil of killing Hank, Phil tells him&nbsp;
to wake up and take a good look at Hank's body.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.640
Gordon removes Hank's glasses and learns that he&nbsp;
is still alive, but he has been stabbed with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.520
orbitoclast in the eye. He tells Hank to hold on&nbsp;
and promises to get help. Phil hints that Gordon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.680
shouldn't tell anyone about Hank because if people&nbsp;
find out about him, they will discover the others.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.440
Gordon suspects that Phil hired the two men to&nbsp;
kill Hank, but Phil insists that Gordon's asleep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.680
and needs to wake up. When Gordon yells that he's&nbsp;
wide awake, Craig arrives and calls out to him.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.960
Gordon turns around, but when he looks back at&nbsp;
Phil, he is no longer there. When Craig approaches&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.800
him, Gordon holds him down with a headlock&nbsp;
and stabs him in the eye with the orbitoclast.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:07.280
In the audiotape, the doctor asks Simon why he&nbsp;
urged Mary to kill her own parents, so Simon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.120
explains that Mary allowed him to do it. Gordon&nbsp;
starts recalling that he attacked Hank at night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.440
while he was wandering around in the tunnels,&nbsp;
disoriented. Simon tells the doctor that all his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.840
other hosts always allow him to use them to murder&nbsp;
people. Soon, Gordon finds the dead bodies of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.920
other crew members lying on the floor. He recalls&nbsp;
killing them one by one without the victims&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.920
even suspecting him, except for Phil, who was&nbsp;
killed when he accused Gordon of attacking Hank.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.080
As he stares out into space, he hears Phil's&nbsp;
voice telling him to wake up and remember.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.800
Soon, he recalls going home bringing roses&nbsp;
to his wife. When she accidentally spills&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.040
boiling water on his leg, he slaps her.&nbsp;
But Gordon didn't stop there. He keeps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.800
attacking his wife and stabs her to death while&nbsp;
hearing Simon's voice urging him to "Do it."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.080
Later on, Gordon calls his wife with&nbsp;
an empty cellphone case, asking for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.080
forgiveness and telling her that he wants to&nbsp;
go home and hold his baby. On the audiotape,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.160
the doctor asks Simon where he lives, so he&nbsp;
discloses that he resides in the weak and wounded.
