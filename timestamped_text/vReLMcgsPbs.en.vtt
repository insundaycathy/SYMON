00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.360
Welcome to Slash Forward. In this episode we’re&nbsp;
going to explore man’s hubris via the Roger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.320
Corman-produced environmentalist cautionary tale,&nbsp;
Piranha. When a couple of youngsters go missing in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.280
the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest, Maggie&nbsp;
is hired to try to track down their whereabouts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.560
But with a vast wilderness in front of her, she is&nbsp;
forced to rely on the expertise of local bushman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.760
Paul Grogan, a true American badass. As they&nbsp;
get closer and closer to discovering the truth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.080
they run into more and more resistance from the&nbsp;
local military outpost to keep the potential&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.680
environmental fallout under wraps. However, with&nbsp;
a waterborne menace making its way down river and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.280
potentially emptying into the ocean, the unlikely&nbsp;
pair find themselves in a race to warn and save&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.200
as many people as possible from the terrifying&nbsp;
and painful natural process of being converted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.080
into fish poop. Aside from the environmental&nbsp;
aspects, this movie also speaks strongly to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.360
value in ensuring governmental leaders divest&nbsp;
themselves of private business interests. Feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.040
free to chew on that topic and discuss it in&nbsp;
the comments below. And, while you’re here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.120
check out some of my other videos - this&nbsp;
one would pair nicely with The Prophecy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.120
or The Host, a duo of water-monster-based films&nbsp;
with environmental undertones. Let’s get to it.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.160
We open on a quaint and serene wilderness where&nbsp;
Barb and David make their way through the foliage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.640
looking for a prime spot to bed down for the&nbsp;
night. They arrive at a sign of warning that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.920
they treat as an encouragement, as it clearly&nbsp;
indicates that something cool lies yonder. Sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.760
enough, they find some far out industrial ruins.&nbsp;
Despite the almost assured presence of tetanus,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.320
they elect to bathe in the silty waters, which is&nbsp;
sexy AF. After diving in, David immediately feels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.800
a couple of stingy, little nibbles that become&nbsp;
too distracting to continue swimming. And soon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.760
he is dragged below the blood red water.&nbsp;
Then, as the moon passes behind some clouds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.000
we learn that ignoring warning signs&nbsp;
is not groovy, not groovy a’tall.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.040
We then transition to the plane station where&nbsp;
Maggie is enjoying the video arcade as her final&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.760
rental car arrangements are made. As she’s seen&nbsp;
off, we learn that she’s heading to Indian Springs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.240
and that she’s been hired to find something,&nbsp;
but we don’t need to know what quite yet.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.200
Then we move on to big Paul Grogan, receiving&nbsp;
his delivery of party materials from Jack.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.880
The cost? However much he can peel&nbsp;
off before Jack says stop. You see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.360
‘ole Jack doesn’t need much in this life. And&nbsp;
what he does need is provided by the great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.240
river - she bathes him, nourishes him with&nbsp;
her fish, swaddles him in her watery bosom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.960
and even rocks him to sleep at night. Yep,&nbsp;
Jack’s living a life of simple contentment.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.560
Then we catch up with Maggie in a Jeep&nbsp;
that there’s no way she rented from Hertz.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.120
After some engine troubles she finds herself&nbsp;
at the doorstep of rustic Paul Grogan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.560
Despite the lack of invitation, she&nbsp;
immediately notifies him that she’s a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.320
skip-tracer and has traveled up to his&nbsp;
hovel to look for some missing teens.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.800
But Paul’s used to being alone, other than his&nbsp;
daughter, and he’s not much for conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.160
He points her in the direction of Jack’s cabin,&nbsp;
or the old, abandoned military facility up river.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.280
Being a woodland noob, she insists he show&nbsp;
her the way. Her tenacity is unassailable,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.840
which is demonstrated further as she gains entry&nbsp;
to the facility. After a bit of searching and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.160
cold calling, they eventually arrive at the&nbsp;
pool. She finds a locket with Barb’s initials.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.520
Convinced they’re resting at the bottom of the&nbsp;
pool, they look for a way to drain it. They are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.000
surprised to find some warm coffee in this&nbsp;
old, abandoned post. Upon entering the lab,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.680
it becomes apparent there is still some testing&nbsp;
going on, and some of the subjects roam free.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.080
But all this Dr. Moreau shit creeps Paul&nbsp;
out, and he is eager to leave. On the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.440
Maggie finds even more evidence that the couple&nbsp;
had been there, and likely still are. Paul balks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.600
at the thought of draining the water sans&nbsp;
permission - and his concerns are confirmed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.560
when Dr. Hoak shows up and starts to choke a&nbsp;
bitch. Luckily, an alarm goes off, taking his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.280
attention and allowing Paul to deliver a firm&nbsp;
hammer fist to the shoulder, inciting a swoon.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.960
As Paul cools his mostly unused knuckles,&nbsp;
he gives them a customary lick and realizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.240
the water is salty. So good thing they drained it&nbsp;
without any preparation. They do find some bones,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.760
but presume them to be the remains&nbsp;
of a dog, and then hear as Dr. Hoak&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.360
takes off in their wheels. But he’s&nbsp;
still woozy from that shoulder injury,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.600
and he flips that sucker. Despite all&nbsp;
this head trauma, they do find him alive.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.760
He wakes up later, lashed to a table, and&nbsp;
insists they’ve unleashed a pox upon the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.400
local wildlife. However, he declines to&nbsp;
elaborate before bedtime. The unlikely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.400
pair try to puzzle out what’s going on&nbsp;
and, in sharing some personal details,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.360
we learn that Paul’s daughter&nbsp;
is away at camp across the lake.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.120
The next morning they confront the complexities&nbsp;
of getting their captive to the police without&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.400
a vehicle. They opt to travel to the dam,&nbsp;
which alway has a ranger on duty. Because Paul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.960
wasn’t joking about his commitment to primitive&nbsp;
living, they are forced to travel via river raft.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.360
We then transition to Paul’s daughter, little&nbsp;
Susie, as a counselor tries to work out how to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.680
convince her to overcome her fears of the&nbsp;
water. She’s irrationally afraid of there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.360
being something in the water. Mr. Dumont&nbsp;
doesn’t have time for coddling, though&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.720
because there is an upcoming water competition&nbsp;
and he’s pushing for peak performance.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.920
We then check in with Jack, doing&nbsp;
some drinking and some storytelling,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.080
which he barely concludes before&nbsp;
getting mobbed by a gang of things.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.560
Elsewhere, Dr. Hoak wakes up on the raft and&nbsp;
insists they stay away from the water, for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.400
it’s filled with Ooohh, it’s Piranya&nbsp;
- and for no reason in particular,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.800
they choose not to believe him. He did&nbsp;
suffer a multitude of recent head injuries,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.080
but then they float by ‘ole Jack’s&nbsp;
place. After securing the raft,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.800
they stumble upon Jack. We never learn&nbsp;
how they manage their grief, because Paul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.360
immediately transitions to digging a shallow&nbsp;
grave for his old friend, which seems hasty.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.840
At camp, another counselor works to find a way&nbsp;
to help Susie get out of the swimming race.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.520
She ultimately settles on adorning&nbsp;
her with a fake contusion to the knee.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.520
Meanwhile, to pad out the body count, Pa&nbsp;
reaches in to free a net and we observe a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.720
little nibble turn into a full-on frothing frenzy&nbsp;
as the relentless school collects their meal.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.280
Back with the main crew, Hoak reveals that he was&nbsp;
involved in genetically modifying the fish to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.160
them adaptable and quick to breed so they could&nbsp;
be used as a biological weapon in the Vietnam war.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.800
When the war ended, the military poisoned&nbsp;
the water. But Hoak did too damn good a job,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.640
and some of the stronger ones survived&nbsp;
and proliferated. This story jogs loose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.920
something in Paul’s memory and he&nbsp;
suddenly realizes that every so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.720
often they open the dam a little to even&nbsp;
out the lake. So, catastrophe is imminent.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.480
As they continue on, we learn that Hoak really&nbsp;
has a hang up with the thought that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.120
may hold him responsible for this fiasco. And&nbsp;
then they run across our friend, little Joshua,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.640
calling out for daddy and hoping not&nbsp;
to sink. Eager for his redemption arc,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.360
Hoak leaps into the water and swims at a&nbsp;
snail’s pace so as to ensure Joshua’s safe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.480
passage to the raft before sinking. He also&nbsp;
ensures that Joshua gets a good, full view&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.880
of death before the day is done. They manage to&nbsp;
pull him aboard, but he’s really messed up now.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.720
Continuing further along, they come&nbsp;
to regret declining a burial at sea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.760
as transporting a bloody corpse only attracts&nbsp;
and frenzies the predators, who begin to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.800
loosen the lashes as they attempt to feed. They&nbsp;
jettison the corpse and consolidate the raft,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.280
aiming for shore before it falls apart and&nbsp;
just barely making it. Paul then breaks into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.880
an all out sprint toward the dam as the air horn&nbsp;
sounds - signaling a gratifying release impending.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.440
Luckily for Paul, the ranger is fairly&nbsp;
inept, allowing him to make it just in time.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.640
Upon notification, the military&nbsp;
rolls up with their specialty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.080
meat-bait division. The meat boys quickly find&nbsp;
strong evidence of Piranha activity. Easy solve,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.960
it’s just a matter of overwhelming the river with&nbsp;
poison. Colonel Waxman offers the civilians a job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.480
to try to keep them quiet as the grunts work to&nbsp;
fill the river with a couple of garden hoses.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.720
But Paul knows this river like he knows&nbsp;
the nooks and crannies of his own body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.040
and he believes there’s an alternate route to the&nbsp;
lake. Dr. Mengers is not concerned about this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.880
because of how stupid fish are - and&nbsp;
this is despite her familiarity with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.400
Dr. Hoak’s good work. In light of&nbsp;
Paul’s continued protestations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.520
they learn that their retention&nbsp;
that evening will not be voluntary.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.920
That night, Paul resolves to leave post&nbsp;
haste, and sends Maggie out to employ her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.800
feminine wiles on the guard, which consists&nbsp;
of exposing her tas so they can acquire a Jeep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.360
and roll out. Paul makes a courtesy call to Mr.&nbsp;
Dumont to warn of the danger heading their way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.520
He doesn’t believe a word of it, but judging by&nbsp;
the late hour, they have plenty of time to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.920
there. Unfortunately, they zoom too greatly&nbsp;
and get pulled over in their stolen vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.600
They hope to convince the officer of what’s&nbsp;
going down, but he pulls a dang gun on ‘em.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.720
He circles back with the Colonel,&nbsp;
who confirms the need to hold them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.240
and prevent them from communicating&nbsp;
with the outside world - you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.880
justice? So Officer Hickey tells them to cool&nbsp;
out for the night and he leaves for his patrol.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.040
As we find out, the Colonel has a vested&nbsp;
interest in keeping a lid on this thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.920
because he happens to be the silent partner in a&nbsp;
business venture poised for a grand opening the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.800
next day. Back at camp, the counselors discuss&nbsp;
how nice it would be to get in a night swim.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.800
You know, just feel free in the water&nbsp;
as it laps up your body. But Mr. Dumont&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.280
ruins the mood with his general presence&nbsp;
and disdain for off-hours entertainment.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.400
At the holding cell Maggie opts to&nbsp;
mimic an escape routine she learned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.680
from an old salt she put in jail a&nbsp;
couple of times. She makes it work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.240
and acquires the keys so they can leave&nbsp;
in yet another stolen government vehicle.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.160
Before you know it, it’s the next afternoon&nbsp;
and the grand opening of the new business&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.920
pavilion. The festivities wind up, and&nbsp;
they hope to wrangle in some business by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.720
giving everyone a bunch of free shwag. As&nbsp;
the celebration of commercialism unfolds,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.120
the kids line up for their water games. The&nbsp;
little blood-filled meat sacks all go hopping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.840
into the water while Mr. Dumont prepares to&nbsp;
officiate the biggest competition of his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.120
Susie uses the commotion to slip&nbsp;
away and hide under a canoe.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.520
Knowing his daughter’s well-being is in jeopardy,&nbsp;
Paul drives it like he stole it and recklessly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.880
flies down the road like a cannonball. The games&nbsp;
do get underway, and the kids frolic about as Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:47.280
Dumont screams his lungs out while brandishing&nbsp;
a gun. Shortly thereafter the bites begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.040
You thought they wouldn’t do it, but sure&nbsp;
enough the kids are getting gnawed up - lending&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.920
credence to Susie’s irrational fear of the&nbsp;
water, which has to be encouraging for her.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.800
Of course, now is also when she decides&nbsp;
to grab a soft-bottomed raft and venture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.280
in to rescue her two favorite counselors.&nbsp;
However, her plan only ends up working for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.440
one of them. Paul and Maggie arrive just in&nbsp;
time to observe the bloody aftermath. Maggie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.840
calls the new Aquarena to let them know of the&nbsp;
potential danger that is about to be actualized,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:19.280
but no dice. They just can’t make the business&nbsp;
case for closing down on grand opening day. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.680
Paul shames Mr. Dumont before heading that&nbsp;
way. Despite being a complete stranger to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.720
Maggie gives Susie a little shoulder&nbsp;
squeeze and then tags along.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.200
They race there in a similar fashion to before,&nbsp;
with various beach shenanigans in full swing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.840
The three business partners conspire to continue&nbsp;
to cover up, completely unwilling to accept the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.480
potential risk. But we know what’s coming, and&nbsp;
the first victims are a trio of scuba divers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.880
checking out the various river weeds growing&nbsp;
down below. The aftermath is witnessed by a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.760
hotshot monoskier - whose cries to go in&nbsp;
are unheeded by these rambunctious ladies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.760
who refuse to stop until he proves his&nbsp;
worth to them. But then they do stop, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.400
he insists they get going again, causing enough&nbsp;
confusion to result in a midriver catastrophe.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.480
The swarm then moves in on the swimmers,&nbsp;
who begin going down left and right as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.680
already murky waters become filled with chum. Of&nbsp;
course, this begins right as Buck Gardner was on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.560
the horn with the local papers, telling them the&nbsp;
rumors of water danger are completely unfounded.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.880
The patrons rush to get out, but it’s really&nbsp;
quite a nibblerific bloodbath out there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.520
with people losing little bits of themselves&nbsp;
all over. They continue to run overland,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.560
despite the relative safety from fish. Amidst&nbsp;
the bedlam, the Colonel gets his comeuppance.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.640
Paul and Maggie arrive just in time&nbsp;
to save no one, and go joyriding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.600
in someone’s speedboat - hoping to head&nbsp;
off the swarm at a bottleneck where they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.840
can then smother them in pollution. Paul has&nbsp;
to open the floodgate manually, so he ropes up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.000
and gives instructions to count to 100 before&nbsp;
tugging him out. Once it gets past that time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.080
he’s pretty much dead regardless of&nbsp;
whether the Piranha get him or not.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.840
He makes his way into the underwater&nbsp;
office and reaches the wheel just in time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.920
Those little suckers get to pickin at him,&nbsp;
but he focuses in good and hard and opens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.720
the pipes right as Maggie hits 100. She then&nbsp;
jet boats his lilly white ass out of there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.720
leaving the Piranha behind to choke on it.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.400
Back at the resort, the courtyard looks&nbsp;
like a medic’s tent from World War II,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.840
except there’s children lying about&nbsp;
as well. Susie faithfully delivers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.320
her old pop some of his daddy juice to revive him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.960
while Dr. Mengers gets back on her bullshit&nbsp;
- proclaiming there’s no way the swarm could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.920
have survived the blast of pollution or reached&nbsp;
the ocean. But the end title implies otherwise.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.600
Originally created to suckle off that&nbsp;
Jaws clout, Piranha actually ended up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.440
being a reasonably well-done movie. It&nbsp;
has a nice mixture of humor elements and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.240
was conservative enough in its effects that Joe&nbsp;
Dante, who eventually went on to direct Gremlins,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.480
didn’t have to skimp out on the scenes of&nbsp;
destruction, which were plentiful and expansive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.800
They originally intended to have Rick Baker do the&nbsp;
effects, but he recommended they get in touch with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.520
Rob Bottin, who eventually went on to do the&nbsp;
effects work for John Carpenter’s The Thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.920
Basically, the movie borrows a strong premise&nbsp;
from a huge blockbuster, and then is put&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.560
together by a group of first-timers who would&nbsp;
eventually go on to create massive hits. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.840
despite any underlying issues or&nbsp;
weaknesses, the movie can’t help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.080
but to entertain and be of a generally higher&nbsp;
quality than it really has any right to be.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.080
Before we go, I’d like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;
my donors, memorialized in the hall of headshots.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.560
