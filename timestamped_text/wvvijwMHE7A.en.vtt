00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.600
If you started investigating a local bear
poacher and got attacked by a mythical troll,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.770
what would you do?

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.480
In this How to Beat video, we’ll follow
the journalism students, see if we can make

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.570
better decisions, and ultimately attempt to
beat the Trolls in, Trollhunter.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.660
Think you can do better, let us know in the
comments!

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:41.079
E njoy these How 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:56.840

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:44.600
this comment!

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:53.200
Let’s get to it.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.110
We start out following the found footage of
a group of bored-ass student reporters investigating

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.000
a bear poacher in Norway.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.750
Remind me to never travel through the Norwegion
mountains.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.170
There’s Nazi Zombies, evil Norse gods like
Moder, and now Trolls.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.370
The students get some comments from the local
bear hunters, who are also hunting the bear

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.150
poacher because the poacher is illegally hunting
the bear they wanted to hunt.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.099
The hunters point the students in the direction
of where he might be.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.400
They arrive at the suspected campgrounds and
ask around.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.819
One of the snoops says that every night the
stranger poacher hunter leaves, and doesn’t

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.469
come back before sunrise.

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:33.390
This is odd, usually you’d hunt bears during
the day when they are out looking for food.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.200
Just before sundown the assumed poacher shows
up in his shredded Land Rover.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.840
I don’t think a bear would or could do that.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.340
Hard to say what could.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.370
He’s not the friendly type, and tells them
to get lost.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.630
Probably a good idea.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.120
This bear poacher story sucks ass anyways.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.290
The amateur investigative reporters don’t
have any other real stories to cover, so they

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.579
trail the pissed off bear poacher into the
woods at night by themselves.

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.709
Probably a bad idea, is this shitty story
really worth getting buried in the woods over?

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.359
No, the answer is no.

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.219
And they lost him.

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:06.219
Great.

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.400
Some of the other students hung back so they
could sleuth around his camper.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.439
There’s furry shit on the ceiling and a
shotgun.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:13.999
Nothing too weird for a hunter.

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:18.250
I will say, knowing that this guy is a Troll
hunter who wants to keep his profession on

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.349
the down low, maybe he should have pulled
the window curtains.

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.159
The next morning the students hear reports
of another bear killed by a poacher and go

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.370
in to investigate.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.999
The local hunters say this was the poacher’s
doing.

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:32.010
Another lead on the riveting front-page story
they’re building.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.560
Armed with this evidence, they confront Hansel
about his shady deeds.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.049
Surely this will elicit an informative response.

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.209
These students are too young and dumb to take
the hint, and trail him into the dark forest

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.209
again.

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.650
This is how people go missing.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.680
If I was the hunter, I’d just leave a tire
puncher on the road behind me to pop their

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.730
tires and shake them off my tail.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.400
Hunting trolls is serious business, and these
kids are liable to get you or themselves killed.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.829
They lost him again.

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.409
With a lucky guess they take the left road
which leads them to a gate with a no trespassing,

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.129
blasting area sign.

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.340
Normal people would say, damn, guess we need
to turn back.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.200
Not these kids, they take it as a good sign.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.180
Turns out, it was.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.489
His truck is parked further up the dirt road.

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.760
He must be out hunting.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.030
A totally viable option is to hang out here
and wait for him to come back with any bear

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.030
accoutrements.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.360
Thomas and his camera crew choose to boldly,
and loudly, stumble through the forest at

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.720
night in hopes that they’ll catch who they
think is a bear poacher illegally killing

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.200
his prey so they can be the small town heroes
who made the citizen arrest.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.910
God this is such a dumb idea.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.530
Did they ever stop to think about the danger
of confronting a sketchy man who is potentially

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.240
doing something that could land him in prison
for a year?

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.830
He’s not even the only danger.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.970
The predator he’s hunting could easily kill
them as well.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:58.440
Hell, the poacher could just accidentally
shoot them.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.540
The hunter rallies them all to his Land Rover
to escape whatever was back there.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.010
For all they know, it could have been a bear.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.350
I thought he’d mow them down or leave them.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.410
He’s actually a good guy and leads them
out, patches up Thomas’s bite wound, and

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.530
gives them a ride to the scrap metal that
used to be their car.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.910
Not only is it completely shredded, but it
has weird slime all over it.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.420
Definitely wasn’t a bear.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.680
Thomas starts pressing the hunter about what
was out there and why he yelled, Troll.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.360
Hans could shoot straight with them, or toe
the Norwegion Wildlife Board line and continue

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.550
the lie about it being a giant bear, and that
he only yelled Troll as a metaphor.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.360
Thomas and his amateur film crew won’t stop
trailing him until they figure out what’s

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.150
going on, especially now.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.620
They could have been in that car.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.780
Hans is weighing the human cost of keeping
the lie, and the troll cost of letting word

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.780
get out.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.740
Frankly, it’s only a matter of time before
someone captures the trolls on film or they

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.740
roam into town.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.620
I say Hans tells these kids to fuck off since
they’re just liabilities and GoPros everything

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.620
himself.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.560
Once the public is aware, round the trolls
up and create the Norse Mythological equivalent

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.640
of Jurassic Park.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.590
Just don’t fuck the security up like they
habitually do.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.740
Hans agrees to let them join his expedition
and film the trolls he’s hunting as long

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.460
as none of them are Christian or believe in
God.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.220
They all say they aren’t, and why wouldn’t
they.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.020
They have no idea why they can’t be Christian
or the danger it poses, because Hans doesn’t

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.210
feel compelled to clarify why this is a prerequisite.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.190
That Trolls can sniff out the blood of Christians.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.970
Before anyone goes out on another hunting
trip at night, they need to spend at least

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.750
a day getting trained up.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.790
Troll 101, troll types, characteristics, dangers,
how to survive, strategies, tactics, equipment,

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.940
contingency plans.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.940
1 day won’t set Hans back much, and it will
be crucial for them not getting Hans or themselves

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.940
killed.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.530
Thomas also needs to get that bite wound checked
out at a hospital.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.490
Of course, they don’t do this.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.960
Thomas and his crew just jump into his Land
Rover and head out into the desolate wilderness

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.060
without any weapons or intel.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.330
Tommy complains about sitting on something,
and pulls out a land mine.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.020
It’s okay though, Hans says it wasn’t
armed..

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:10.840
This is the start of the greatest troll hunter
movie ever.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.780
When they get to the insertion point Hans
instructs them to remove their body odor by

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.530
bathing in the stream and rubbing his secret
troll stench recipe all over their bodies.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.590
Still firing from the hip as they go.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.650
If Trolls have an excellent sense of smell,
there are numerous preparations that most

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.440
likely need to be executed prior to coming
out here.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.100
The clothing they wear, how it’s washed,
their personal hygiene procedures, what they

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.870
eat, if any of them are chewing gum, scent
control products, procedures for their urination

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.020
and defecation when on the hunt, etc.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.870
I’m guessing Trolls have eyes too, so it
also might be a good idea to take off your

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.300
yellow and red jacket so they don’t also
see you from a mile away, Ronald Mcdonald.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.010
Hans grabs his UV flash gun from his truck.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.830
Based on his weapon of choice, I'm assuming
sunlight deters or kills them.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.220
I don’t know though, because the expert
won’t take a minute to tell me.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.300
The students still don’t believe Hans’s
Troll stories.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.720
They joke about how this is all fairy tail
nonsense and Han’s big flashlight will turn

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.080
the trolls into stone.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.340
Hans plainly responds that depending on how
old they are, some just explode.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:16.860
He then calls in to his Troll veterinarian
to let them know he’s hunting a sick Ringlefinch

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.700
whose marking its territory by pissing everywhere.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.420
The vet wants a blood sample but Hans says
he doesn’t have the right equipment.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.830
He hangs up and tells his film crew to wait
while he chases the troll out.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.270
The balls on this dude.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.259
It might be nice to know which way the troll
will be running, where to go if shit goes

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:35.719
south, and what to do if Hans becomes troll
food.

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:39.370
It’d also be nice to have some radio’s
in case they get separated.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.620
After Hans disappears into the treeline, Johanna
says that she feels sorry for the man for

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.470
believing in trolls.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:46.470
You dumb bitch.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:50.649
Have you been on instagram the entire time
that Thomas was attacked, your car mangled,

00:08:50.649 --> 00:08:55.310
the weird substance he had that smelled and
looked like nothing you know, or the slime.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.920
Not to mention the irony of you saying that
while following him out here into the middle

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:06.129
of nowhere to hunt the thing you don’t believe
in.

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:10.490
You know when you hear and see trees getting
shoved around like a man in a cornfield, you’re

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:11.519
in deep shit.

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:25.240
They need to get down, shut up, and stop standing
around verbally flailing like deer in headlights.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.610
That thing is huge.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.990
Hans needs to ditch that flashlight pole for
a bazooka.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.610
Maybe having an agreed upon exit strategy
laid out in the beginning would have been

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.870
a good idea, so you didn’t all just have
to run in some direction while in full panic

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.240
at night in the woods.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.699
It’s easy to get turned down in that situation.

00:09:41.699 --> 00:09:45.519
If they had brought compasses, and knew what
direction they needed to run in, their retreat

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:46.920
would be a lot more orderly.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.639
I’m always impressed at people’s ability
to hold onto all their camera gear when shit

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:51.639
hits the fan.

00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:53.709
Those would be the first things I’d drop.

00:09:53.709 --> 00:09:56.180
Well, not the camera, that’s holding important
footage.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.019
But the sound boom and stuff.

00:09:58.019 --> 00:09:59.019
Forget it.

00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:00.370
Everyone gets separated and lost.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:04.540
Can’t exactly call out to your friends unless
you want to get ground up in a troll’s back

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.540
molars.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.110
You know what would be nice, those little
cricket clickers the allied paratroopers used

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:10.249
in world war 2.

00:10:10.249 --> 00:10:13.730
It sounds like wildlife noise unless you know
your friends have them.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.450
Thomas links up with Kalle, and then Hans
finds them and gestures that they are right

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.730
under the troll’s ass.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.220
The woodland trolls have excellent camo.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.910
Almost like Moder from The Ritual.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:30.490
They are lucky Hans found them and knew which
direction his truck was in.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:34.009
The trees don’t slow it down at all and
Hans’ light bulb gun is ineffective.

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:37.930
There’s no fighting or hiding, they need
to sprint to the rover and get the hell out

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.370
of there.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.529
Oh.

00:10:40.529 --> 00:10:44.009
He wasn’t kidding.

00:10:44.009 --> 00:10:49.249
UV does turn trolls into stone, if you have
a powerful vehicle mounted spotlight.

00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:51.399
His flashgun isn’t that reliable.

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:55.759
If I was on the Troll Security Service, I'd
be bringing thermal and night vision goggles.

00:10:55.759 --> 00:11:00.389
I mean, the students had a night vision video
camera for fucks sake, and you, a professional

00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:04.629
troll hunter, are wandering dark forests at
night with your naked eyes looking for well

00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:06.139
camouflaged woodland trolls.

00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:10.710
I’d also bring a partner for backup, an
amped up version of the flash gun since it’s

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:16.259
current power level is clearly insufficient,
and a backup .600 nitro express double barrel

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:19.329
elephant gun in case the batteries were having
trouble in the cold.

00:11:19.329 --> 00:11:23.750
I’d also put far more effort into concealing
my body odor, briefing my team, and giving

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:28.029
them UV flashlights they could use to defend
themselves if they got separated from Hans

00:11:28.029 --> 00:11:29.470
or he was killed.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.709
Something like Kyle Crane had in Dying Light.

00:11:31.709 --> 00:11:35.589
Hans radios in the kill and Finn from the
wildlife board shows up with a dead bear to

00:11:35.589 --> 00:11:39.629
cover up the cattle killings in the area,
plant some fake bear tracks, and have Han’s

00:11:39.629 --> 00:11:42.320
put the finishing touches on.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.889
Finn is pretty pissed that Hans let the students
in on their secret.

00:11:46.889 --> 00:11:51.490
I’m guessing Hans hasn't filmed the trolls
himself and gathered evidence of their existence,

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.589
but he should have.

00:11:52.589 --> 00:11:56.869
His government employer is willing to let
innocent people die and cover up their deaths.

00:11:56.869 --> 00:12:00.879
It’d be wise to keep the troll information
on a dead man's trigger in the event that

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:04.430
the government wants to tie up loose ends
and make him go missing as well.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.709
They shouldn’t even be keeping all the film
on their person in the first place with how

00:12:07.709 --> 00:12:09.910
close they are to getting killed on a daily
basis.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.209
Hans finally briefs them on the situation.

00:12:12.209 --> 00:12:16.149
He’s hired to hunt the trolls that come
out of their designated territories and threaten

00:12:16.149 --> 00:12:17.569
livestock or people.

00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:22.170
He tells them that there are different types,
subgroups, and variations of trolls, but they

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.180
all are unintelligent predator animals.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.540
Still, he doesn’t provide any useful tactical
information.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.559
Hans then gives them the tiny home tour of
his camper.

00:12:30.559 --> 00:12:34.920
The furry shit he had on his ceiling is a
troll tail which he uses to maintain the troll

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.570
stench so he can approach them with them noticing.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:41.879
Why not use a troll hide to make a hat, jacket,
pants, boots, or cape?

00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:44.649
Then you wouldn’t have to muck up your stove
with troll goo.

00:12:44.649 --> 00:12:45.759
Onto the living quarters.

00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:51.449
His bed is lit up with UV lights, which are
on 24/7, even while he sleeps, because he’s

00:12:51.449 --> 00:12:52.569
afraid of the dark.

00:12:52.569 --> 00:12:57.899
That’s insanely unhealthy, and if anything,
a lit up camper would attract the trolls.

00:12:57.899 --> 00:13:02.190
If you truly lived in immense fear of a troll
stomping out your camper while you slept,

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:06.879
it’d make more sense to have uv lights on
the outside like Will Smith in I Am Legend.

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:11.149
At his dining table he’s got a map and the
local newspapers which he uses to find any

00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:16.209
suspicious events like dead livestock, smashed
bridges, ripping out trees, etc.

00:13:16.209 --> 00:13:18.779
Anything that’s a potential lead for the
troll’s he’s hunting.

00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:22.889
It’s honestly not surprising that nobody
thought to implement satellite tracking.

00:13:22.889 --> 00:13:27.209
Hans and the TSS could track all the trolls
with a computer, and know exactly where the

00:13:27.209 --> 00:13:28.209
strays are.

00:13:28.209 --> 00:13:32.680
The gestation for trolls is 15 years, so it’s
not like they’re trying to track rabbits.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.440
Hans concludes the tour and the team heads
out to find the sick Ringlefinch they were

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.570
hunting before the Tusseladd almost made a
meal out of them.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:43.670
Since they aren’t satellite tracking the
trolls, Hans has to drive around aimlessly,

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:48.180
climb up trees to find deformations in the
forest, use crude sketches of valleys to see

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:52.190
if anything large has moved, and check if
his tire and charcoal traps were tripped by

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:53.240
the roaming troll.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.189
It’s incredibly inefficient.

00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:58.399
This is the Ringlefinch the troll vet wanted
a blood sample from.

00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:02.000
Hans ropes some sheep up as bait and dons
his medieval armor.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.980
Don’t tell me his grand plan is to poke
it in the ass when it’s chomping on the

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.980
sheep.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.699
I get that he can’t use the flash gun because
turning the troll into stone kind of ruins

00:14:10.699 --> 00:14:14.910
the whole blood sample thing, but you could
use that landmine you left on your passenger

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.329
chair which Thomas accidentally sat on.

00:14:17.329 --> 00:14:20.930
The troll doesn’t need to be alive or in
one piece to get some blood.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.339
That or hit it with the elephant gun.

00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:26.889
Since this is a state-sponsored hunting trip
and trolls are serious big-game, I don’t

00:14:26.889 --> 00:14:31.860
even think it’d be crazy to requisition
some military surplus anti-tank weaponry like

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:37.300
an M72 LAW Rocket-propelled grenade launcher
or Carl Gustav recoilless rifle.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:42.810
A center mass shot from one of these bad-boys
is going to be game over for the troll.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:50.910
I don’t even want to get started on how
useless his armor is.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.019
Did we forget what happened to Thomas’s
car.

00:14:53.019 --> 00:14:55.339
At this point, he’s on a suicide mission.

00:14:55.339 --> 00:15:01.730
The camera crew gets into position and rolls
tape.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:06.990
Could everyone shut the fuck up and stop moving
when the troll is near the kill-zone please.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:14.050
Yep, Han’s plan really was to walk up and
give the Raglefant a colonoscopy while it’s

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:15.940
eating.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.600
Gee, who could have seen that coming.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.170
Worst strategy ever.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:25.319
He should’ve just poured the Christian blood
on the old french landmine and kicked back.

00:15:25.319 --> 00:15:27.129
Wow, the armor actually worked.

00:15:27.129 --> 00:15:28.819
This was sheer luck though.

00:15:28.819 --> 00:15:33.660
If the troll had put any more effort into
chewing or decided to tenderize Hans’ meat,

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.920
the armor would only succeed in being a ground
meat container.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.749
Rocky wants to go another round.

00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:44.600
This time, he’s bringing the flash gun.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.529
It wasn’t clean, but they got the blood
sample.

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:51.239
Hans brings it to the troll vet, who I hope
is a troll professional operating under the

00:15:51.239 --> 00:15:55.920
cover of a small animal clinic and isn’t
doing this as a side hobby.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.489
In her unauthorized interview she says that
trolls can’t convert vitamin-d from sunlight

00:16:00.489 --> 00:16:04.470
into calcium, so when they are exposed to
sunlight, their bodies overreact.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:08.769
Their stomachs expand, gas is forced into
their intestines and veins, then they pop

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:10.449
like an egg in a microwave.

00:16:10.449 --> 00:16:14.480
The older ones turn into stone because their
veins are too constricted so the expansion

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.330
occurs in their bones.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.500
In seconds, everything calcifies.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.670
She says that she’s working on a lethal
injection as a more humane way to put them

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:27.389
down because stoning or exploding is quite
painful for them.

00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:33.079
Uh, pretty sure lethal injections cause severe
pain, take minutes to kill, and fail quite

00:16:33.079 --> 00:16:34.079
often.

00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:38.879
The flash gun or a high explosive RPG round
to the chest is honestly pretty humane.

00:16:38.879 --> 00:16:41.920
More reports come in about trolls leaving
their reservations.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:47.290
Hans remarks that usually they don’t leave,
and something may be chasing them off en masse.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.199
If that’s the case, you’re definitely
going to need a bigger gun.

00:16:50.199 --> 00:16:54.220
With how many trolls are wandering around
populated areas, it’s a surprise that the

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.959
locals don’t know about them yet.

00:16:55.959 --> 00:17:00.119
It’s only a matter of time before one strolls
into town and engorges in an all you can eat

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:01.119
buffet.

00:17:01.119 --> 00:17:04.459
It’s high time the government makes a Norwegion
troll version of Jurassic Park.

00:17:04.459 --> 00:17:05.459
I know.

00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:06.459
I know.

00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:11.040
Jurassic Park always ends badly, but as long
as they hire a competent security advisor,

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.149
sat-track the trolls, implement redundant
lines of defense, and station a couple Leopard

00:17:15.149 --> 00:17:20.220
2A4 tanks outfitted with coax UV spotlights
nearby they should be good to go.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.050
Based on the deforestation, Hans thinks it
was a few trolls running North.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:27.870
Do Hans and company do any prep-work or up-gun
themselves at all.

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:28.880
Of course not.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.420
Hans walks into the forest at night without
any weapons at the ready.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.140
If three trolls stampede out of that treeline
you won’t have time to fumble getting that

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.010
flash gun out of your ass before you become
part of Earth’s crust.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:42.940
Hans didn’t even go down to the electronics
store and pick up a video camera that had

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.970
a night vision mode after seeing the kids
put it to good use.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:49.970
I think it’s safe to say we’re using the
term professional very loosely.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:52.169
The students need to get closer to Hans.

00:17:52.169 --> 00:17:56.590
Sadly, he’s the only person that could potentially
protect them, and he can’t do that if they’re

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.659
50 yards away.

00:17:57.659 --> 00:18:00.630
Hans tracks the troll footprints to an abandoned
mine.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.899
He wants to go in and search it, but his crew
is justifiably concerned.

00:18:04.899 --> 00:18:08.360
Hans confidently says, don’t worry, there’s
no trolls inside.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.360
One.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.360
How would you know?

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.360
Two.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.490
What if they come back while you’re inside?

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:13.490
Three.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:17.850
If this is a search and destroy mission, there’s
no reason to go inside an empty mine cave.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.720
Just trap the entrance or ambush them at sun
up when they come back to sleep.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.990
You have access to explosives too, I'm sure
you could get your hands on enough TNT to

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:33.350
collapse the mine entrance and entomb the
Trolls.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.480
So you didn’t know if the trolls were home.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.020
I’m getting those vibes that the guy who
you think knows his shit, doesn’t know as

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.390
much as he lets on or would like you to think.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.769
Hans says a whole pack of trolls lives here.

00:18:43.769 --> 00:18:47.230
Yah, I figured that out without going into
the cave at night.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:53.230
What are we doing in here again?

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:56.070
The flash gun won’t have enough juice to
stone them all.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:00.340
Better find a small tunnel to cozy into until
daybreak when you can make a break for it.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.350
Just their luck.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.049
One of the trolls lays down right infront
of their exit.

00:19:04.049 --> 00:19:06.520
The trolls don’t seem to have sniffed them
out yet.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.990
Maybe they are too tired.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.740
Kalle isn’t taking any chances.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.610
Dude’s going hard on the troll stench.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:16.110
With how antsy Thomas, Johanna, and Kalle
are, there’s no way they are surviving until

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:17.110
morning.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:20.630
It’s also a giant risk that a troll wakes
up and smells their ever increasing stench

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.000
of human body odor.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.159
They need to wait a little longer until the
sun rises before they make their escape.

00:19:26.159 --> 00:19:30.000
They might be able to tiptoe out without the
trolls noticing, but it’s too risky.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.470
If one of these morons accidentally bounces
the boom mic off one of the troll's noses,

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:40.980
even if they escape the mine, they will get
run down in the dark forest.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.289
Kalle is only leaving them with two options.

00:19:43.289 --> 00:19:45.610
They can either put him down, or run.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.390
Nobody has the stomach for the first option,
so they break for it.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.450
The trolls wake up from all the commotion
and start chasing them.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.990
Hans' flash gun barely has enough power to
keep the trolls off their asses.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:20:05.970
If anyone stumbles or falls behind, they’re
dead.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.029
I feel obligated to say, “Where is your
god now”?

00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:12.049
It’s a good thing the sun was up or they’d
all have been troll food.

00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:16.080
Kalle should have known that being Christian
was going to get him or everyone else killed.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.179
That was a dick move.

00:20:17.179 --> 00:20:18.320
He knew the danger.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.580
Hans knows that if he doesn’t figure out
why trolls keep roaming into populated areas,

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.690
Kalle’s death is just the beginning.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:28.230
When they get back to their camper they find
Finn rifling through it looking for their

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.230
films.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.929
They’re going to need to watch their backs
and start distributing the films to secure

00:20:31.929 --> 00:20:35.970
locations which will be released if they aren’t
heard from in 24 hours.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.980
It’s clear that the government is willing
to sacrifice some human life to keep their

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:40.980
secret.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.580
Thomas calls up his friend to fill the open
camera position because he can’t hold the

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.289
camera himself and it’s totally worth risking
some random person’s life so he doesn’t

00:20:49.289 --> 00:20:50.289
have to.

00:20:50.289 --> 00:20:53.630
When she arrives, Thomas asks her if she is
Christian or believes in God.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:56.529
Bro, why didn’t you ask her before she showed
up.

00:20:56.529 --> 00:21:00.320
Hans says he doesn’t know if her being Muslim
is will be a problem, so fuck it.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.840
Let’s do it live.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:08.769
They are potentially going to be up against
either multiple Trolls, or the infamous Jotnar.

00:21:08.769 --> 00:21:12.519
A giant 200 foot tall troll that only Hans
has seen.

00:21:12.519 --> 00:21:17.360
Hans preps his Land Rover with a spiked roll
cage and a UV spotlight turret on the roof.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:22.029
The cage looks cool, but I doubt it’s effectiveness
against a pack of trolls that mangled Thomas’s

00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:23.200
car like it was nothing.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.630
If they need the cage, they’re dead anyways.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:29.020
They would be better off lightening the car
so they can evade the trolls if shit hits

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.020
the fan.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:34.480
The UV mounted spotlight is a solid addition,
but given the threat they’re facing, I’d

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.679
try to requisition a chopper with a UV mounted
searchlight.

00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:41.250
Personally, I wouldn’t want to be on the
ground facing off with a Jotnar.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:46.100
The TSS’s budget is unreasonably tight,
so the Rover will have to suffice.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:50.889
Hans drives them to where the Jotnar is kept,
inside a region surrounded by power lines

00:21:50.889 --> 00:21:53.840
which are serving as a giant electrical fence.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.409
That is, until the Jotnar walked through it
or ducked under it.

00:21:57.409 --> 00:22:01.429
In order to find out which direction the Jotnar
is headed, they pop by the power station to

00:22:01.429 --> 00:22:04.340
see which section of powerline was knocked
out recently.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:09.060
For some inexplicable reason, the powerstation
manager fields questions from the poverty

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.940
troll hunting version of Blade.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:14.600
Hans wasn’t even given a non-TSS government
badge or anything.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:19.000
Thomas, knowing the real reason but being
a cheeky punk, asks the manager why the power

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.779
lines run in a circle in a desolate region.

00:22:21.779 --> 00:22:23.580
The manager honestly has no clue.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.230
Hey, as long as you get your paycheck and
don’t ask too many questions, right?

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:31.440
I know Hans and Finn are at odds right now,
but you’d think with a Jotnar on the loose

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.429
Finn could procure some military hardware
for Hans.

00:22:34.429 --> 00:22:38.410
What’s a couple rocket launchers when you
had installed miles of power lines to fence

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:41.440
this thing in and keep it from massacring
entire cities.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:46.010
Hans and his film crew arrive at a remote
TSS cabin where they’ll hang out until night

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.299
when the hunt begins.

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:51.590
Thomas gets light-headed and almost collapses
just as they hear the Jotnar heading towards

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.630
them in the distance.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:23:00.710
Yah, you should have gotten that disgusting
pus filled bite wound checked out a long time

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:01.710
ago.

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.170
You know you were bit by a troll, you know
they’re disgusting creatures.

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.690
Getting checked out at the hospital was a
no brainer.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.130
Now you’re succumbing to it at the worst
time possible.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:14.519
Hilde from the small animal clinic rings Hans
and tells him that the troll had rabies in

00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:15.519
it’s blood.

00:23:15.519 --> 00:23:19.669
Hans speculates that this was what was causing
the Jotnar and other trolls to behave erratically

00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:20.690
and aggressively.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.899
That’s really bad news for Thomas.

00:23:22.899 --> 00:23:31.490
Once a person begins showing signs and symptoms
of rabies, the disease nearly always causes

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:35.440
death.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.520
Hans unveils his roof-mounted UV spotlight
turret.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.460
Alright, that’s pretty badass.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.230
Hans is like the Norwegion troll hunting version
of Burt Gummer from Tremors.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.159
I only see one problem with it.

00:23:46.159 --> 00:23:48.289
Who’s going to drive while you shoot?

00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:52.090
Because there’s no way you can assume this
will reliably kill the Jotnar.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:53.980
Definitely not one of the dipshit students.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.540
See, this is where having a partner comes
in handy.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:00.230
He drives head-on at the giant troll without
telling his camera crew, so they run after

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.320
him yelling thinking he’s leaving them.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.980
As expected, they didn’t use the precious
time before nightfall to strategize together.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.940
Now everyone is getting caught off guard by
each other's actions.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.090
Unbeknownst to his crew, Hans was trying to
lure the giant away from them and 1v1 it.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:18.029
If you didn’t want the crew to come with
you, you should have said that earlier.

00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:21.040
Now they are running around like chickens
with their heads cut off, and left the lights

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.040
on in the cabin.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:29.460
If the Jotnar didn’t see them before, it
does now.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:33.690
Hans continues to try to lure the giant away
from the students with some gospel music so

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.640
he can safely fight it in the open.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.000
Apparently none of the kids got the message,
because they’re still running around and

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.850
screaming like jackasses.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:47.679
Despite them, Hans gets his dance.

00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:49.769
The searchlight doesn’t have the power to
stop it.

00:24:49.769 --> 00:24:53.029
While it’s stunned he jumps back behind
the wheel to get the hell out of there before

00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:55.539
he turns into red gum at the bottom of it’s
foot.

00:24:55.539 --> 00:24:59.380
This is exactly why I said he needs to have
someone drive while he shoots.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:03.610
Hans swoops back to pick up his camera crew
and reloads his spotlight with another set

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:04.610
of batteries.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.880
He hops back in and guns it with the beast
right on their asses.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.179
It’s closing in on them even with the Rover
at full speed.

00:25:13.179 --> 00:25:17.730
What’d I say about removing the spike cage
to lighten the vehicle so it could go faster.

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:20.330
That puny cage won’t do shit to stop this
thing.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:24.210
Some moron runs out in front of their car
to catch a ride out of the giants path.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:29.030
Dude, why would you want to get into the vehicle
that’s about to get stomped on by the Jotnar.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:33.190
Just let it pass and lure the giant away from
you, then get out of dodge.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.450
Now they have to slow down for him or he’ll
become food.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.500
Driving away isn’t an option anymore.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:42.509
Hans mans the turret to buy them some time.

00:25:42.509 --> 00:25:45.710
Here’s a bright idea.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.940
How about one of you idiots starts driving
this Rover out of here while Hans shoots.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.630
The UV spotlight stuns the Jotnar again, forcing
it to run away.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.409
Hans isn’t going to let this guy go.

00:25:55.409 --> 00:26:00.430
He tries to drive out in front of it, because
tactically that makes complete sense.

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:04.029
If I was someone in the camera crew i’d
pop the door and roll out of this suicide

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:05.529
mission.

00:26:05.529 --> 00:26:12.289
Lucky for them, the Jotnar doesn't stay to
finish them off.

00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:13.450
Looks like it hurt it’s hand.

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.550
Hans rucks up and hikes toward it while it’s
licking its wounds.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:20.500
He better have something bigger than the flash
gun from earlier.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:27.919
Why didn’t you fire that up it’s gooch
while you were driving behind and underneath

00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:28.919
it.

00:26:28.919 --> 00:26:30.039
Driving infront of it was just dumb.

00:26:30.039 --> 00:26:32.309
Also, it’s kind of a shame he stoned it.

00:26:32.309 --> 00:26:33.630
That’s a lot of good meat wasted.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:38.399
If he just used conventional firepower, they
could have harvested it’s remains.

00:26:38.399 --> 00:26:41.590
Guess selling troll meat on the market would
blow the whole secret though.

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.570
Finn and his government goons arrive to tie
up the loose ends.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:48.789
Thomas grabs the camera and everyone runs,
but only Thomas successfully escapes their

00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:49.789
grasp.

00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:54.070
What we watched was the footage that was leaked
out by Thomas before he died from his Rabies

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.070
infection.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:57.779
Hans and the rest of the film crew were never
heard from again.

00:26:57.779 --> 00:27:01.050
Safe to say they’re buried somewhere out
there by the deceased Jotnar.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:04.900
Despite this footage being discovered, the
government still somehow managed to keep a

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.210
lid on the existence of trolls in Norway.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:11.259
I don’t see that being possible since the
roaming trolls are still a problem and the

00:27:11.259 --> 00:27:14.570
found footage contains enough evidence to
blow this thing wide open.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:18.529
Let’s recap the pivotal points where different
decisions could have altered who lived and

00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:19.529
died.

00:27:19.529 --> 00:27:23.690
If Hans had a partner, reasonable access to
decent weaponry, or decided to film and gather

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:28.159
evidence of the troll's existence himself
which he could discretely release to the public

00:27:28.159 --> 00:27:32.539
later, himself, Kalle, Thomas, Johanna, and
Malica wouldn’t have been killed by trolls

00:27:32.539 --> 00:27:33.610
or government henchmen.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.829
I mean, they had GoPro’s in 2010.

00:27:35.829 --> 00:27:37.440
The film crew was unnecessary.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:42.110
I’d actually say footage isn’t worth anything
because people will just say it’s fake.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.690
Hans’s information about troll locations
is infinitely more valuable.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:50.080
All said and done, I think we could have beaten
the trolls and shady government from Trollhunter.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.740
Thanks for watching, and remember, if you’re
going to hunt trolls, bigfoot, the loch ness,

00:27:54.740 --> 00:28:00.369
or whatever monster, you need to prepare for
the unlikely event that you do run into it.
