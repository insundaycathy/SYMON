00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.510
Story Recapped here.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.230
Today, I'm going to explain an adventure,
drama, and romance film called "Monsters."

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.509
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.030
Watch out and take care.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.240
Six years ago, NASA discovers the first sign
of alien life within the solar system.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.010
They initiate a plan to send a space probe
to collect samples of the foreign specimen.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.440
However, the probe malfunctions and crashlands
in Mexico.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.640
Aliens start appearing in the area; this is
known as the infected zone.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.590
The war between the alien lifeforms and the
U.S. and Mexican Military persists up to the

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.590
present.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.869
Photojournalist Andrew Kaulder sets foot in
a ruined building.

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.210
Debris covers a massive tentacle.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.379
Firefighters surround the area looking for
potential bodies or survivors.

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.769
Andrew tries communicating with them, but
the firefighters don’t understand him.

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:42.969
Luckily, someone in the group knows a little
English.

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.000
Andrew is looking for the injured survivors,
and they point him towards the hospital.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.469
Riding as a passenger on a motorcycle, Andrew
sees the colorful rural community of Mexico.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.979
A tank passes nonchalantly, indicating that
the situation there took a turn for the worse.

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.609
Andrew enters the hospital and asks for Samantha
Wynden.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.109
The nurse leads him to a room, and as he walks
through the hospital, he sees the people suffering.

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.560
Andrew sees Samantha, or Sam, sitting in a
room.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.880
He introduces himself as an employee in her
father’s publishing company.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.630
He asks about her broken arm, and she assures
him that everything is okay.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.020
Andrew leaves immediately, not even a goodbye.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.510
He talks to a man on a payphone; he appears
frustrated as the person he's talking to wants

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.979
Andrew to take Sam to the U.S.

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.549
However, he has other plans; Andrew intends
to cover the story in Mexico because this

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.020
can be his big break.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.280
In the end, he has no other choice but to
escort Sam back home.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.549
In a car, the two sit at the back, looking
out the window.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.570
Sam observes the destruction and chaos in
the community while Andrew takes pictures

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.979
with his camera.

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.351
Sam asks the driver if he feels safe living
in the area, to which he replies that they

00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:43.220
have nowhere else to go, so they make do with
what they have.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.689
They arrive at a train station, and Sam talks
to her father on the payphone.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.819
She says everything is fine with her, but
her father begs to differ.

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.719
He wants her to call her fiance, but Sam seems
reluctant.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.100
Meanwhile, Andrew fights through the crowd
to get to the ticket booth.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.609
He sees a poster showing an infected zone
between the U.S. and Mexico.

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:02.409
He then buys two tickets to the coast for
himself and Sam.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.119
The train arrives, Sam is still on the phone,
and Andrew tells Sam to hurry as the train

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.470
would leave soon.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.349
Sam's father hears Andrew's voice and asks
to talk to him.

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.400
Despite Andrew not wanting to speak to her
father, Sam gives him the phone.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.900
With a tone of a caring father, he makes Andrew
understand what's at stake.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.040
In under no circumstance shall he fail to
deliver Sam to safety.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.980
They enter the train and sit down, feeling
relieved.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.989
Sam converses with Andrew; they talk about
his photography and his desire to get his

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.250
photos on the publication's front page.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.510
He helps remove her arm sling, and they proceed
with some small talk.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.959
They get to know more about each other, then
Andrew catches a glance at Sam's engagement

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.260
ring, which quickly changes his mood.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.989
Sam's fatigue finally catches up to her while
Andrew continues to take photographs.

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.580
He takes photos of the scenery, military helicopters,
and abandoned toxic materials.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.500
Flashes of light from explosions can be seen
beyond the mountains in the train's direction.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.490
Sam carefully makes her way to Andrew to inform
him that the train will turn back because

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.000
of mishaps in the way.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.940
They get off the train, but Sam thinks it's
a bad idea.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.629
Andrew assures her that they're miles away
from the infected zone.

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.099
The train leaves, and there they start their
journey on the cold dark road.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.150
Andrew tries to talk to a local, but Sam interrupts;
she speaks Spanish and tells the woman they're

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.150
lost.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.430
The woman invites them to her home and provides
them a map.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.379
They communicate and find out that they're
far from the coast and can't get there by

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.459
train because the tracks are damaged.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.189
In the next 48 hours, Sam and Andrew need
to reach the coast as the military will soon

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:21.459
initiate a 6-month border lockdown.

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.750
Knowing the journey ahead will be gruesome
and tiring, they spend the night in the woman's

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.209
home, eating and having a bit of banter with
one another.

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.769
The woman asks if the two are married, and
Sam laughingly says no.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.709
Andrew voices out that he's single.

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.190
Andrew contemplates something while watching
the news but soon falls asleep.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.459
Andrew takes a picture of a bunch of kids
playing.

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.769
He instructs them to put on a mask depicting
a scene of how a war-torn environment can

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.650
affect the lives of innocent youth.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.959
They say their goodbyes, and the two go on
their way, with Andrew seeming to be in a

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:47.959
hurry.

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.209
Andrew asks if Sam is married, she replies
that she's only engaged.

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.739
They walk along the long road, trying to hitch
a ride with the passing vehicles.

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.980
A kind-hearted driver allows them to ride
the back of his pickup truck.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.569
Multiple signs show they're nearing the infected
area.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.560
They talk with another man at the back of
the pickup truck, and they find out that there's

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.550
a bus stop at a nearby village.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.780
They speak with the locals, and Andrew takes
more photographs of the conditions of the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.950
community.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.290
Sam confronts Andrew and asks if he's okay
with the fact that he profits from bad things

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.290
happening.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.790
He jokingly rebuts that it's the same thing
with doctors.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.100
They ride the bus and continue on their journey.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.440
Along their journey, they ride numerous vehicles
up until they reach the coast.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.590
Andrew tries to purchase ferry tickets but
finds out they’re too expensive.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.420
He tries haggling with the man to no avail
and still ends up buying the tickets.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.600
After a while,&nbsp; Sam and Andrew begin being
flirty with each other.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.040
The night comes, and Andrew finds himself
in Sam's room while waiting for his room to

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.220
be ready.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.360
Sam says that she needs a bath; Andrew teases
Sam by offering to scrub her back for her.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.060
But she's quick to turn him down.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.060
The news grows scarier as they announce that
the movement of the creatures is becoming

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.540
more and more rampant.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.190
They talk for a while; then Sam takes the
bath that she's been longing for.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.840
Andrew takes this opportunity to make a call
to his son to wish him a happy birthday.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.530
Sam asks who he's talking to, but he lies
and says that it's just reception.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.900
He gives Sam her privacy, and they meet outside
a couple of minutes later.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.220
They take this time together to enjoy the
culture of the community.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.480
They eat, drink, and experience all the wonders
the place can offer, seeming like this is

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.890
the calm before the storm.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.250
However, the vibe suddenly changes when they
enter a cemetery.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.470
What meets them is the heartbreaking sight
of men, women, and children who died because

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.730
of the aliens and the military’s bombs.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.040
The happiness in their faces is quickly replaced
by sorrow and grief.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.610
They sit in a local shop while drinking alcohol.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.790
They talk about what lies ahead for Sam.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.060
She plans to get home to her fiance, get married,
living their version of a happily ever after.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.770
Andrew is jealous, but not because she's getting
married, but because her future looks more

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.010
fun than his.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.840
They celebrate the night away, drinking and
laughing.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.210
Andrew rambles on about dolphins, and the
random conversations continue, leading them

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.210
to Sam's room.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.500
Words from his mouth seem to be endlessly
pouring out, feeling as if he doesn't want

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.720
the night to end.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.010
He jokes about his room not having air conditioning
and Sam's room having a king-sized bed.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.420
Even though Sam laughs at all his jokes, she
doesn't give in to his quips.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.530
Andrew's patience grows thinner, so he asks
if she wants to make out.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.500
But like all his past advances, it fails,
and she leaves him hanging once again.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.130
Sam lays in her bed, and she opens the television
that coincidentally plays a documentary about

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.310
the alien creatures' mating process.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.780
This leads to her calling her fiance, who
is too busy to pick up.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.060
Meanwhile, Andrew's night is just getting
started.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.390
He's at the local shop, drinking as many shots
of tequila as he can.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.580
The morning comes, Andrew awakens on his bed
naked with a woman.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.020
He hears a knock and opens the door to see
Sam.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.420
They say their good mornings, and she invites
him for a cup of coffee.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.770
Andrew accepts her invitation and asks for
a moment so he can get ready.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.930
Sam sees the woman in Andrew’s bed and quickly
retracts her invitation.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.310
Sam is visibly hurt, appearing that the sight
of a woman in Andrew’s bed had ruined her

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.310
morning.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.530
Sam leaves in a hurry, and a half-naked Andrew
chases after her.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.690
Andrew confronts her as she stands by the
pier.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.060
He asks her if this is the end for them, to
which she replies yes.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.460
Andrew then questions why she isn't on the
boat yet.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.680
Sam says she can't, leaving Andrew feeling
a rollercoaster of emotions.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.670
However, she further clears things up by saying
Andrew has her passport.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.920
Andrew hurries back to his room to get the
passport.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.680
He scours his room but couldn’t find their
passports.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.610
Feeling defeated, they return to the ticketing
booth and resort to demanding another ticket.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.720
The man cannot give another ticket because
the military has begun initiating the lockdown.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.250
Sam butts in, suggesting that she'll travel
by land if she needs to.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.830
They negotiate the price for the journey,
accounting for transportation, protection,

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.460
and bribery; they will need 10 thousand dollars.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.830
Andrew tries to trade in his watch and camera,
but the man doesn't accept.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.050
Leaving her with no choice, Sam gives up her
engagement ring.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.360
Andrew is shocked; he finally realizes the
consequences of his actions, and the guilt

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.360
eats him up.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.560
The man accepts the ring and gives tickets
to both Andrew and Sam.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.660
The two arrive at the checkpoint of the entrance
into the infected zone.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.680
They get through after bribing a guard.&nbsp;

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.970
More negotiation occurs, and they finally
board a small boat.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.520
As the group sail through the body of water,
peace radiates as the relaxing sound of birds

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.930
chirping and the motor running fills the silence.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.430
They dock the boat for a while to refill gas.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.340
Sam relieves himself behind a building.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.550
Suddenly, they hear a creature howling.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.140
The guards are on high alert, readying their
weapons.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.550
The two return to the boat, but Sam looks
uneasy and keeps turning back to the direction

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.130
of where the howl came from.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.530
On the boat, they talk about Andrew's son,
Tommy.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.870
Delving more into his personal life, Andrew
tells a story about his ex.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.470
And how it took her two years to let Andrew
know that he has a son, only to tell him not

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.790
to consider himself as Tommy's father.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.510
Andrew then changes the subject.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.970
In the middle of the river, the boat breaks
down.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.160
The sun starts to set, and the boat remains
at a standstill.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.350
Darkness isn't the only thing that stalks
the group, as a disturbance in the water alerts

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.360
them.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.260
Sam shines a light into the water while Andrew
takes photographs.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.750
A fighter jet ascends from the depths of the
river.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.190
Not long after, tentacles come rising, pulling
the plane down.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.389
Sam tells the men fixing the motor to hurry
up.

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:38.680
Luckily, the engine starts back up, and they
speed away.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.169
The sun rises, and along with it is Sam, waking
herself up to see the beautiful scenery.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:46.170
As they pass along sunken vessels, they see
bloody handprints.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.230
A group of armed men meets the two; they're
the next group that'll escort them through

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.620
the infected zone.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.180
The night arrives, and the group camps out
in the wilderness.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.330
Their destination is close, and they will
soon start their journey after another family

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.560
accompanies them.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.769
The group tells tales about the creatures'
appearance and behavior.

00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:04.139
American planes drop chemicals around that
area, and the creatures despise it.

00:09:04.139 --> 00:09:07.939
Andrew asks why they drop chemicals, to which
a man replies that it's to rid of the infected

00:09:07.939 --> 00:09:09.189
environment.

00:09:09.189 --> 00:09:12.319
Andrew and Sam soon find out that the creatures
aren't the only thing that makes up the infected

00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:16.190
zone, but rather, the trees in the area are
extra-terrestrial as well.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.250
With every touch, the trees react.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.589
The man further explains that these are pre-mature
alien lifeforms.

00:09:21.589 --> 00:09:25.420
When they mature, they submerge into the river
and into the oceans to reproduce.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.560
Back at the camp, the two share an intimate
moment as Andrew rebandages Sam's arm.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.779
The danger of their situation continues to
grow, but their feelings for one another prosper.

00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:37.670
The night resumes, and a man uses Andrew's
camera without his permission.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.279
Chaos and gunshots from a walkie-talkie wake
up the group.

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:44.269
They quickly ride out, interrupting Andrew,
who frantically looks for his camera.

00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:48.310
Vehicles line up, and in one of them, Andrew
and Sam sit all confused and worried.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.319
They ask what's going on, but a man denies
an answer and demands them to stay quiet.

00:09:52.319 --> 00:09:55.730
The men start putting gas masks on, and Andrew
complains why they don't get to wear them

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:56.759
as well.

00:09:56.759 --> 00:10:00.009
They hear a creature screech, and the vehicle
in front of them gets abducted by the monster's

00:10:00.009 --> 00:10:01.009
tentacles.

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:04.040
The group of men exit the vehicle and start
firing at the monster.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.080
The gunshots stop, and the creatures close
in on the two.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.129
Andrew punches the lights out, hoping that'll
be enough to eliminate any trace that they're

00:10:10.129 --> 00:10:11.129
there.

00:10:11.129 --> 00:10:13.310
The creature walks past them, and they are
relieved.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.250
The following day, Andrew exits the vehicle
and inspects the area around them.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.819
He sees a car stuck in the branches of a tree
and calls out for any survivors.

00:10:20.819 --> 00:10:23.850
He throws up as he tries to get near the remains
of a mangled man.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.449
He then retrieves his camera.

00:10:25.449 --> 00:10:27.870
They find that they’re the only ones left
alive.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.740
Sam continues to call out Andrew, but he still
ignores her.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.730
He sees the corpse of a young girl while walking
through the destruction that the creature

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:34.730
left.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.810
He pays his respects and covers her up.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.800
Sam struggles to hide her shock.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.389
Andrew grabs another gas mask, and the two
continue to reach their destination.

00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:45.240
They walk along the hills, the grass, and
the forest.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.569
Sam asks Andrew to stop as she has to pee.

00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:50.100
As she relieves herself, Sam sees a temple.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.430
They climb up and see the wall separating
America from the infected zone.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.990
They contemplate their experiences, realizing
a different perspective of looking at America

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.769
from the other side of the wall.

00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:02.269
And that the difficulties and horror won't
matter as soon as they get to the other side.

00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:05.069
With a teary eye, Sam changes the topic this
time around.

00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:08.980
They talk about something funny, like how
Sam practiced laughing when she was young.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.819
Andrew teases her because of this, and they
share an even more intimate moment than the

00:11:11.819 --> 00:11:13.209
last time.

00:11:13.209 --> 00:11:15.480
The next day, they begin their final trek.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.959
The two talk more about Andrew's personal
life until they reach the border.

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:22.889
No one is there, so they climb up, making
their way to the evacuation site.

00:11:22.889 --> 00:11:26.749
A rotting creature lays on top of a house,
and Andrew ventures in to take more pictures.

00:11:26.749 --> 00:11:29.140
Suddenly, they hear a squeaking noise.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.070
They cautiously investigate to find out the
origin of the sound.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.639
To their surprise, they see someone pushing
a cart.

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:37.269
The woman halts as soon as she hears Sam call
out to her.

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:40.560
The two take a closer look, and the woman
is seen wearing an American flag around her

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.560
neck.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.370
Sam asks if the woman has seen anyone else.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.519
Weirdly enough, she replies by furiously quacking.

00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:48.910
The two are taken aback by what the woman
did.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.499
She goes on his way, saying she has something
to do.

00:11:51.499 --> 00:11:54.509
They find themselves 3 miles away from the
evacuation site.

00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:57.220
In the distance, they see the light from a
gas station.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.490
They dial 9.1.1.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.309
And reports that they need assistance.

00:12:00.309 --> 00:12:03.540
The woman advises them to stay where they
are as an army patrol is nearby and is on

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.720
their way.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.860
Andrew makes a phone call outside to greet
Tommy with a happy birthday.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.740
Tommy says he misses him, making Andrew choke
up a bit.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.430
Andrew becomes more emotional as he talks
more with Tommy.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.040
He promises to catch up with him as soon as
he gets home.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.000
Meanwhile, Sam is inside also making a phone
call to her fiance.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.690
While talking, she sees a frustrated Andrew
sitting outside.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:26.069
She says goodbye to her fiance and tells him
she loves him but looks at Andrew as she speaks

00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:27.069
the words.

00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:30.819
Unbeknownst to the two, a monster has appeared
on top of the gas station.

00:12:30.819 --> 00:12:33.000
Sam is unaware and hears the door opening.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.569
She sees tentacles making their way into the
store.

00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:38.999
Sam notices that the creature's tentacles
absorb energy from the television.

00:12:38.999 --> 00:12:41.620
She turns it off, and the creature leaves
the store.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.990
Outside, another creature appears, and the
two monsters interact.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.230
They connect and mate with one another, displaying
a mesmerizing scene.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.690
The two went their separate paths, leaving
Andrew and Sam dumbfounded by what happened.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:54.529
Military vehicles then approach them.

00:12:54.529 --> 00:12:56.370
Sam says she doesn't want to go home.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:00.230
They both lean in for a kiss; everything leading
up to that moment made it even more special,

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.019
giving the same feeling like the connection
that happened between the two creatures.

00:13:03.019 --> 00:13:14.809
On the radio, a man reports that they have
sight of one male and one female, and they're

00:13:14.809 --> 00:13:16.410
heading in to retrieve them.
