00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.450
It's time for something incredible!

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.760
Welcome back Ladies and Gentlemen, to another episode of Cinema Summary.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.820
Today we’re summarizing the deconstructive-reconstruction of the superhero genre!

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.590
Suit up folks!

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.780
It’s showtime!

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.710
In a world full of super-powered people called
“Supers”, the public are turning against

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.550
them as the collateral damage caused by their
crime-fighting reaches an all time high.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.760
Mr. Incredible is one of these heroes whose
fall from grace reached it’s peak after

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.060
he saved a willful ledge-jumper, and stopped
a monorail from derailing.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.800
After several lawsuits, the government suddenly initiates the Superhero Relocation

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.880
Program, which forces Supers to permanently
put down their capes and just be their ordinary,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.660
secret identities.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.781
Fifteen years later, Bob and Helen Parr—formerly
known as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl—and

00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:54.579
their children Violet, Dash, and baby Jack-Jack
are a suburban family.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.620
Bob dislikes the mundanity of suburbia and
his not-so incredible, white-collar job.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.700
but still intends to do some good.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.580
Together with his friend Lucius Best, formerly
known as Frozone, Bob occasionally relives

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.100
"the glory days" by moonlighting as a vigilante
(telling their wives that they are going “bowling”).

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.920
Who hasn't done that?

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.400
After his supervisor prevents him from stopping
a mugging, Bob loses his temper

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.500
and injures him, and predictably gets fired, as you would.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.450
When he returns home, Bob finds a message
from a mysterious woman named Mirage who convinces

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.530
him to become Mr. Incredible again, and gives
him a mission to destroy a renegade robot

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.729
called the Omnidroid (trademark Lucasarts)
on the remote island of Nomanisan,

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.110
a very scenic place if you ignore the murderous killbot.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.180
Bob finds the Omnidroid, and after getting
into a heated battle, tricks it into ripping

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.469
out its own power source, defeating it.

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:49.800
This new gig appeals to Bob:

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.220
All the excitement of the good ole days while getting paid

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.260
He improves his relationship with his family
and begins gymming...

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
The dude lifts trains! Hah!

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.140
Trains! Once he lifts ships, then we can talk!

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.580
...while awaiting more work from Mirage for the next two months.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.980
Discovering a tear in his suit, he visits
superhero costume designer Edna Mode.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.640
Mode, assuming that Helen knows what Bob is
doing,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.380
She doesn't

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.610
makes new suits for the entire family.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.800
with a new suit and a new mission, he heads for Nomanisan once again,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.590
and this time Bob discovers Mirage

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.709
is working for Buddy Pine, a technological
genius and a former fan whom Mr. Incredible

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.700
had rejected as his sidekick back in the good
ole days.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.830
No longer ‘Incrediboy’ as he once hoped
to be, he is now Syndrome!

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.920
His time was spent making weapons and perfecting the Omnidroid,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.130
hiring different Supers to fight it, and upgrading

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.420
it on the occasion that a Super wins.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.660
Now that it is capable of defeating Bob, Syndrome reveals his evil plan: "Operation Kronos";

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.460
to send the machine to the city of Metroville.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.770
There, he will secretly manipulate its controls
to defeat it in public, becoming a hero himself.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.900
Later, he will sell his inventions so that
everyone will become equally "super",

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.960
making the term meaningless.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.820
Anyways!

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.080
Meanwhile, Helen visits Edna and learns what

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.680
Bob has been up to (and gets to see the new costumes she made!).

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.840
Ta-Daaa!

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.740
Edna activates a beacon she built into the
suits so Helen can find Bob, and uh reveals

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.400
his location and gets him captured.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.769
Nice going, Edna!

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.620
Helen borrows a private plane to head for
Nomanisan, but Violet and Dash have stowed

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.220
away wearing their own suits, leaving Jack-Jack
with a babysitter

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.500
Someone call CPS please.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.140
Syndrome has his SAM launchers shoot down
Helen's plane, but she and the children survive

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.500
and reach the island.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.370
Helen infiltrates the base, discovering Syndrome's
plan to send the Omnidroid to Metroville in

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.370
a rocket.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.010
Mirage has a change of heart, with Syndrome's
callousness when her life was threatened,

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.310
Mirage releases Bob and informs
him of his family's survival.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.800
At the same time, Helen arrives and races off with Bob to find their children.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.599
“So you must be Mrs. Incredi-”

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.050
Dash and Violet, meanwhile, are spotted and
chased by some of Syndrome's guards, but fend

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.240
them off with their powers before reuniting
with their parents.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.370
However, Syndrome captures them, leaving them
imprisoned on Nomanisan while he follows the

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.110
rocket to Metroville.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.680
The Parrs escape and travel to Metroville
in a spare rocket (with Mirage’s help).

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.000
The Omnidroid is programmed to identify and
take out the biggest threat, and recognizes

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.900
Syndrome as such and attacks the remote
on his wrist, making him incapable of controlling

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.180
it, while simultaneously knocking him out

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.550
as it was made to adapt to all threats and challenges

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.710
The Parrs and Frozone team up to fight the
Omnidroid; it seems like there’s no winning

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.820
until Bob comes across the remote, allowing
him to control one of the robot's arms and

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.440
just like before uses it (and the power of
family and friendship) to destroy its power source.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.040
Returning home, the Parrs find Syndrome, who
plans to kidnap and raise Jack-Jack as his

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.920
own sidekick to exact revenge on the family.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.180
As Syndrome is flies to reach his airplane,
Jack-Jack's own superpowers start to manifest

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.060
and he escapes from Syndrome midair

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.980
he's a 'jack of all trades' if you will.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.460
Syndrome manages to get on the plane and gloats,
but Bob throws his own car towards the plane,

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.430
causing Syndrome to lose his balance and get
sucked into the plane's jet engine,

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.600
destroying the aircraft and killing him, while
Helen catches Jack-Jack.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.240
In the words of Edna -- NO CAPES

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.940
While watching Dash compete in a race, the
Parrs witness the arrival of a new villain

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.080
called the Underminer.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.180
They put on their superhero masks, ready to
face a new threat.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.800
