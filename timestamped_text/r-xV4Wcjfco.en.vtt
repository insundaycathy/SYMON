00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.550
Detective Recapped here.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.040
Today, I'm going to explain a sensual drama
film called, "Fifty Shades of Grey”.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.179
Rich with depravity and sadomasochism, this
movie adds a twist to the usual love story.

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:11.469
Spoilers ahead!

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.330
Watch out and take care.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.210
21-year-old Anastasia "Ana" Steele is an English
literature major at Washington State University's

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.690
satellite campus.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.560
Meek and mild-mannered, she contrasts the
direct and driven Christian Grey, who is the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.400
27-year old billionaire entrepreneur she's
set to interview.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.860
The man sits atop his towering skyscraper,
ready for his ten-minute interview with Miss

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.860
Kavanaugh.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.590
But Kate Kavanaugh, Ana's roommate, has fallen
sick, leaving Ana to interview him in her

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.590
stead.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.080
Kate teases Ana about her wholesome outfit,
and in turn, she kisses Kate's forehead before

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.280
taking her leave.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.850
At the lobby of Mr. Grey's office, Ana is
greeted by a plethora of beautiful blonde

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.780
women wearing sleek and fitted attires.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.610
Already, she's feeling out of place with her
more homely-looking ensemble.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.290
It’s quickly made clear that Ana’s not
like other girls, she’s badly dressed.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.620
But on a more serious note, Ana sticks out
like a sore thumb because she contrasts the

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.330
professional and self-assured women there
with her more fidgety and awkward demeanor.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.270
One of the women directs Ana to Christian's
room.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.400
As the door opens, Ana abruptly trips, interrupting
Christian's contemplation by the window.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.880
When Christian approaches her, Ana is immediately
dazed by his overwhelming yet eloquent aura.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.740
Throughout the interview, Christian intently
stares at Ana, making her feel uncomfortable.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.119
She monotonously reads out the questions that
Kate had prepared, which are unoriginal, to

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.119
say the least.

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.380
But after Christian’s answers, Ana always
has her own little quip for them, showing

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.240
that she has a heaping spoonful of bluntness
to go with her awkwardness.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.820
For instance, she asks Christian to what he
owes his success, and when Christian answers

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.729
that he's good at people, Ana retorts that
maybe he's just lucky.

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.600
And when Christian emphasizes that he has
a way with knowing what makes people tick

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.060
and harnessing talented people's efforts,
Ana correctly and openly surmises that he's

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.310
a control freak.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.960
Instead of being offended, Christian seems
amused by Ana.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.040
Given his status, it’s likely that there’s
not much people who have the candor to speak

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.040
against him.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.719
Besides, Christian seems to wear his control
freak title with a badge of pride.

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.060
Almost forebodingly, he tells her that he
exercises control in all things.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.859
After Ana asks if he feels passionate about
the charity projects he does, Christian dismisses

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.009
the projects as a smart business move.

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.469
Unable to hide her disapproval, Ana doubles
down on her question and proposes that Christian

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:01.779
cares more than he lets on.

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:04.490
He replies that some people say he has no
heart and they say that because they know

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.490
him well.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.140
For the next couple of questions, Ana stumbles
over her words and even mentions that Christian’s

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.180
adopted, which she quickly apologizes for.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.830
This prompts Christian to ask if she has an
actual question for him.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.930
Then, Ana clumsily blurts out, "Are you gay,"
making the both of them chuckle awkwardly.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.459
Ana apologizes for the question, explaining
that Kate wrote it, but Christian does reply

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.860
that he's not gay.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.840
At this point, Christian sits down, instructing
Ana to forget Kate's questions and ask him

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.660
something that she wants to know instead.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.590
Ana then alludes to an earlier statement that
Christian made, that there are people who

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.870
know him well.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.340
Ana says that she has a feeling that that
isn't true.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.500
This strikes a chord with Christian, who’s
growing more and more fascinated by Ana's

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.980
unexpected defiance and her astute mind.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.900
One of Christian's secretaries comes through
the door to inform him that his next meeting's

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.900
coming up.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.209
However, Christian abruptly cancels this to
spend more time with Ana.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.450
With Christian saying that he wants to know
more about her, their roles switch, and Christian's

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.340
now the one asking questions.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.159
After asking her about literature, her education
and her plans after college, he offers her

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.239
a place in their local internship program.

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.260
Ana is flustered by this, and she says that
she doesn't think she'd fit in.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.430
When Christian asked her about literature,
it wasn’t just him flexing how cultured

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.760
and well-read he is.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.780
He may have made a connection between Ana’s
interest in literature and the way she tried

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.400
to see if there’s anything behind his enigmatic
and loveless façade.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.579
It’s either Ana’s an optimist who sees
the good in people or literature has taught

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.610
her that there’s always something more behind
that rich and smouldering jerk you’re talking

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.610
to.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.940
When the interview concludes, Ana steps out
of the building, unbothered by the rain.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.450
Finally, she feels that she can truly breathe
after their intense meeting.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.060
The following day, Ana goes to work in her
job at Clayton's, a hardware store.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.330
Ana receives a call from her mother, who informs
her that she won't be able to come to her

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.599
graduation, much to Ana's disappointment.

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.599
Suddenly, her boss calls her to help in another
aisle.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.780
Ana follows him and is surprised to see Christian
Grey right then and there in her hardware

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.780
store.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.870
After getting over her initial shock, Ana
assists Christian with purchasing a couple

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.709
of peculiar items, including some cable wire,
tape, and rope.

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.540
At the checkout counter, Ana mentions that
Kate had a hard time clearing a photo of him.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.760
To this, Christian offers to have a photo
shoot, and he invites her and Kate.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.370
The photoshoot is held at the Heathman Hotel,
where Christian is currently staying at.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.500
There, Ana's photographer friend, Jose, holds
the photoshoot.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.010
Right after, Christian invites Ana for coffee.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.959
Christian asks if Jose's her boyfriend, noting
how he would look at Ana.

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.319
Then, he confirms if she's together with her
boss at Clayton's, and Ana chuckles before

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.750
saying that she isn't.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.530
As they go for coffee, the pair starts talking
some more.

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.650
It almost feels like a repeat of their first
encounter.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.120
Ana remains as blunt and awkward as before,
while Christian behaves like he has control

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.170
over the conversation.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.860
Still, Ana never fails to point out that he’s
high-handed, and he’d refute her by saying

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.400
he’s used to getting his way.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.040
Christian then tells her to tell him about
her family, so Ana does.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.050
She talks about how her stepfather raised
her and how her mother is on husband number

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.170
four as she's an incurable romantic.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.020
When Christian asks if she's romantic, too,
Ana offhandedly says that she has to be since

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.230
she’s a literature major.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.980
In the middle of her talking, Christian cuts
her off, saying he can't do this before offering

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.190
to walk her out.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.920
As they walk outside, Ana asks if he has a
girlfriend, and Christian responds that he

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.230
doesn't do the girlfriend thing.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.930
Suddenly, a biker almost hits Ana, so Christian
pulls her out of the way.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.450
She closes her eyes when he touches her face,
but Christian softly tells her that he's not

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.710
the man for her and that he has to let her
go.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.700
With a look of hurt, Ana bids him goodbye
and walks away.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.350
Later that evening, Ana receives a package
from Christian.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.580
Kate reads the note aloud, which contains
a quote about how women know of the dangers

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.840
of relationships because they read novels
telling of them, and Ana identifies it as

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.910
a quote from Tess of the d'Urbervilles.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.720
When she opens the package, she finds first
edition copies of two Thomas Hardy novels,

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.220
including Tess of the d'Urbervilles.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.510
Though she's stunned by the books, she resolves
to return them, saying that they're too much.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.060
Frustrated with Christian's come-and-go behavior,
she drinks.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.070
True to her name, Ana has a steely personality
herself when provoked.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.910
She’s not interested in tolerating a wishy-washy
man like Christian, especially after he got

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.500
her hopes up then dipped when he realized
that she’s a nerd.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.200
Kidding aside, it’s clear that the two are
at odds with each other.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.350
Ana’s a believer of romance, and she’s
looking for something serious while Christian

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.840
is daunted even by the prospect.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.640
At a bar, Ana and her friends have their graduation
celebration.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.710
She drinks a lot more than usual then goes
to line up for the women's bathroom.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.721
There, she spontaneously gives Christian a
drunken call, sarcastically thanking him for

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:57.560
the expensive books before informing him that
she's returning them.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.100
Noticing her strange speech, Christian asks
if she's been drinking, and when she confirms

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.080
this, he orders her to go home.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.420
After calling him bossy, Ana starts doing
impressions of Christian ordering her around

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.160
and flip-flopping between wanting her to come
closer and demanding her to go away.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.390
Despite Christian's adamance to know where
she is, Ana refuses to tell him then hangs

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.850
up on her phone.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.820
After a few seconds, Christian calls her,
telling her not to go anywhere.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.540
It’s a wonder how on Earth Christian managed
to figure out which bar Ana’s in.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.340
Does he have IT guys on his beck and call
ready to track her down?

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.380
Is he just Creep Extraordinaire?

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.910
We may never know.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.940
Later, Ana steps out of the bar to get some
air.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.100
Ana is shivering from the cold night when
Jose follows her outside and puts a denim

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.360
jacket over her.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.520
Suddenly, Jose confesses that he's always
had feelings for her.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.810
He asks for a kiss, but Ana refuses.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.490
Insistent, Jose holds her tight to try and
get a kiss from her, but Christian steps in

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.310
just in time to push Jose away.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.830
Ana abruptly vomits on the ground, and while
Christian's tending to her, Jose disappointedly

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.260
walks away.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.040
Christian tells her that he'll take her back
to his place, but Ana's worried about leaving

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.170
Kate alone.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.760
To assure her, Christian says that he brought
his brother, Elliot, along to tell Kate he's

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.760
taking Ana with her.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.220
On the dance floor, Kate and Elliot are already
dancing and having a good time together.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.450
Ana suddenly passes out, and Christian takes
her to his hotel room.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.860
When Ana wakes up, she's wearing a different
set of clothes.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.580
On the bedside table, there are two blue pills
with a note "Eat me" written next to them

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.810
and a glass of orange juice, which also has
a note that says, "Drink me".

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.401
As always, Christian has a high-handed approach
with people, and it even shows in the way

00:07:18.401 --> 00:07:19.930
he wrote his memos.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.360
Ana complies with the notes, and Christian
walks in from his morning jog.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.080
Ana is surprised when she finds out that Christian
had undressed her and changed her clothes,

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.770
and even more so when he reveals that he slept
beside her.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.490
But Christian assures her that they didn't
hook up since he's not into sleeping with

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.580
corpses.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.080
After handing Ana a piece of bread, Christian
takes his shirt off in front of her.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.470
As he gets on top of the bed with her, he
comments about how if she were his, she wouldn't

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.280
be able to sit down for a week.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.250
The two are locked in an intense moment, and
Christian starts clarifying his intentions.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.560
He doesn't get involved in romantic relationships
since his interests are very singular.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.200
Now, it’s becoming more and more apparent
that Christian’s preference lies in something

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.250
more sensual.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.990
But if he’s just in it for the hook-ups,
then it should be easy for him to just say

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.990
it outright.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.550
Later, the two of them prepare to go outside
with plans to meet again that evening.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.330
Christian flirts around with Ana, telling
her how he wants to bite her lip.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.250
However, he says he won't be doing that without
Ana's written consent.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.670
This takes Ana aback, but Christian saves
the explanation for later.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.240
They enter the hotel elevator, and as soon
as the doors close, Christian can no longer

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.860
restrain himself, and he starts kissing Ana.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.060
But their little session is interrupted when
the elevator doors open once again to let

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.700
in several businessmen.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.170
Christian and Ana arrive at her apartment.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:27.000
There, a naked Elliot and a barely clothed
Kate are hooking up on the couch.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.860
With an audience there, Elliot puts his pants
back on before telling Kate, 'Laters, baby'.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.530
Christian finds this funny, so he decides
to mimic his brother.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.800
Looking at Ana, he repeats 'Laters, baby'
in the same tone.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.630
Once the Greys are gone, Kate starts interrogating
Ana.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.870
But Ana only reports that Christian had just
kissed her once and nothing more, and she

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.670
comments on how odd everything is with him.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.010
It’s hard to blame Ana for being confused.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.090
After all, it’s not every day that someone
tells you that they need your written consent

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.240
to bite your lip.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.760
Consent is fine, but written?

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.780
That feels like overkill.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.930
Then again, everything about Christian feels
like overkill.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.140
During her shift at Clayton's, Ana can't stop
thinking about what happened earlier, and

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.290
she can barely contain her excitement for
her upcoming night with Christian.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.690
Finally, evening comes, and Christian's driver,
Taylor, goes to pick her up.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.820
Taylor takes Ana to the very top of a building
where Christian is waiting with a helicopter

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.000
next to him.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.620
As Christian buckles Ana onto the helicopter
seat, Ana's heart starts to race when he moves

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.070
his hand near her stomach.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.940
Adding to Ana's surprise, Christian tells
her that he will be the one to maneuver the

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.090
helicopter.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.060
The two of them head out, and they hover through
the night and over New York City.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.500
The two of them eventually make their way
to Christian's place.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.040
There, he makes Ana sign a non-disclosure
agreement, keeping her from telling anyone

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.530
about their relationship.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.140
Afterwards, he takes her to a door down the
hall.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.120
He calls the room his playroom, and Ana wonders
if he's talking about his Xbox.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.700
Cautious, Christian emphasizes that Ana can
leave anytime she wants, not wanting to make

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.200
her do anything against her will.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.660
Catching wind of his odd cautiousness, Ana
demands him to open the door.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.340
Finally, Christian takes his well-kept key
and opens the door, revealing a striking room

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.990
with red, velvet walls.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.980
In the room are several kinds of toys and
equipment ranging from whips, cuffs, collars,

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:57.980
and more.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.731
Ana is stunned into silence, still processing
the wave of emotions flooding her, while Christian

00:10:01.731 --> 00:10:03.520
worries that he might have upset her.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.920
It was certainly a jarring thing.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.130
Ana seems like the kind of woman with modest
sensibilities, so this is a lot for her to

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.130
take in.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.910
Not to mention the room is just flat-out tacky,
so maybe she finds it too gaudy for words.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:16.770
He begs Ana to say something, and finally,
Ana asks if women do those things to him or

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.560
if it's the other way around.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.700
After answering that he does it on willing
women, he explains that he's a dominant, and

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.110
he wants Ana to be his submissive.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.970
He wants her to surrender herself willingly
and completely to him.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.400
Despite his explanation, Ana's still having
a hard time following, and she asks what she'll

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.620
get out of being a sub.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.290
To this, Christian confidently replies that
she'll have him.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:36.390
He adds that Ana would have to stay in a room
of her own wherever he is for three days a

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.020
week, and the two of them won't be sleeping
in the same bed.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.940
When Ana asks what would happen if she declines
these conditions, Christian says he'll understand

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:47.710
completely, especially since he believes himself
to be incapable of forming romantic relationships.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:50.600
After all that, Christian starts discussing
the contract.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.330
There will be a contract specifying everything
Ana would and would not be willing to do.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.820
This is when Ana admits that she's never slept
with anyone before, much to Christian's surprise.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.820
Hearing this, Christian decides to be her
first, and with that, they hook up.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.270
Early in the morning, Ana wakes up without
Christian in bed, just as he promised.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.440
Unaccepting of this, Ana looks for Christian,
and she finds him playing the piano in the

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.620
living room.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.680
Ana coaxes him by approaching him naked, and
they hook up again.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.250
After that, Ana succeeds in having Christian
fall asleep next to her.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.450
Finally, after many days of going back and
forth, the two get a part of what they want

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:21.830
from each other.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.480
Christian got to be Ana’s first, and he
got to sleep with the woman who intrigued

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.480
him so.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.380
As for Ana, she plucked out a semblance of
romance from Christian.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.680
Later, Ana makes breakfast for Christian while
wearing nothing but her top.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.020
She dances to some music while cooking, unaware
that Christian is watching her with great

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.020
amusement.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.330
Later that day, Christian's mother makes an
unannounced visit, interrupting yet another

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.450
session between Christian and Ana.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.380
After greeting his mother, he introduces Ana
to her.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.890
Christian's mother is pleased by this as Ana's
the first girl that he's introduced to her.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.800
She then leaves after their brief encounter.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.280
When Christian and Ana get the chance to talk
again, Ana asks how many women have stayed

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.600
in Christian's apartment, and he says 15.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.120
Ana's taken aback, but she explains that she
doesn't want out, she's just not keen on being

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.110
whipped in Christian's red room of pain.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.750
She starts asking if they can go to movies
and dinners, but they're not Christian's thing.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.360
Still, he cups her face, promising her that
if she agrees to be his submissive, he'll

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.690
be devoted to her.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.160
But the more Christian makes it clear that
their arrangement is unconventional and unromantic,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.770
the more Ana gets put off.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.660
She quips about wanting to hold on to her
free will before asking Christian if she can

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.820
go home.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.030
Despite her undeniable attraction towards
Christian, Ana still has her sights set on

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.030
what she wants.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.070
She’s not difficult to please, she just
wants to have a normal relationship with the

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.120
man she likes.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.470
Ironically, Christian’s offering her something
that runs a little deeper than romance, which

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:31.470
is devotion.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.270
But ultimately, they’re still at odds with
each other.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.600
Before heading to Ana's apartment, Christian
brings her to a lake, where he tries to convince

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.650
her to agree to be his submissive.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.620
Christian starts telling Ana about how one
of his mother's friends made him her submissive

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.870
for six years ever since he was fifteen.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.820
This is a troubling bit of information.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.750
Christian was clearly underaged when he’s
thrusted into the world of sadomasochism.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.060
Still, he plays this off as if there’s no
problem with it.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:57.050
After their detour, Christian drops Ana by
her apartment, where he hands her the contract.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.400
For the next couple of weeks, Ana has been
reading through the contract and researching

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.570
submission, dominance, and sadomasochism.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:05.730
The contract contains a tedious number of
rules to keep both parties in an agreeable

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.610
position so neither can be harmed.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.040
Meanwhile, Christian has been continually
showering Ana with excessive and lavish gifts

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.779
in order to get her to say yes.

00:13:12.779 --> 00:13:16.320
Eventually, Ana plays a joke on Christian,
telling him that she doesn't want to go through

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.410
with it.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.760
This offends Christian, so he decides to barge
into Ana's apartment.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.560
In an attempt to convince her, he hooks up
with her again.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.290
But this time, Christian adds some ice to
their foreplay.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.430
Though Ana's enjoying herself, she's still
unable to come to a decision.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:33.240
Eventually, Ana arrives at an alternative
solution that does away with the contract:

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.350
she'll be the one to negotiate the terms.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.760
Ana suggests this to Christian, and he welcomes
it.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.440
However, instead of having an informal dinner,
Ana insists on discussing the terms over a

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.690
formal business meeting.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.480
For this, Ana turns up in Christian's office
in a sleek and enticing maroon dress.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.510
During their negotiation, they clear off most
of the more extreme practices involved, and

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.210
Christian even offers to take Ana out on a
date once a week.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:56.960
She'll get to decide where to go and what
to do during their dates, pleasing Ana greatly.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.380
With that, Christian tries to convince Ana
to stay so they can hook up again.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.880
However, Ana just pretends to seduce him,
trying to frustrate Christian.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.700
And just as Christian is ready to pounce on
her, she leaves.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.570
With Ana exploring more with Christian, she’s
growing more and more confident in her skin.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:13.730
She can take a bit of charge now with their
intimate affairs, and she even has Christian

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:14.750
blueballed.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.140
As for Christian, he’s slowly learning to
compromise.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.590
The time for Ana and Kate's graduation comes,
and Christian Grey is the guest speaker at

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.890
the ceremony.

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.260
After receiving her diploma on stage, Ana
shakes Christian's hands as the others do.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:29.400
Once again, he tries to persuade her to go
through with the contract, and Ana gives him

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.400
an ‘okay’.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.899
She then chuckles and steps down the stage.

00:14:31.899 --> 00:14:35.260
Later at Ana's apartment, Christian warns
Ana that the next time she rolls her eyes

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.120
at him, he'll spank her.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.990
Christian then motions Ana toward the door
to reveal a brand-new car that he bought as

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.839
a graduation gift for her.

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:45.660
Ana is absolutely flustered with the expensive
gift, and without noticing it, she rolls her

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.770
eyes.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.040
Because of this, Christian leads Ana back
into the living room, and he slaps her backside

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.480
a couple of times.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.529
But right after this, Christian has to leave
for his office, so he goes, leaving Ana confused

00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:56.880
and disappointed.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.440
Ana then receives a call from her mother,
asking about her new boyfriend, and Ana sadly

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.730
admits that it's complicated.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.740
Aside from being unromantic, Christian is
also a very busy person.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.330
Though their unlabelled relationship has its
share of thrills and glamor, they’re still,

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.850
at their core, very different people with
very different priorities and interests.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:15.149
The following day, Christian finally takes
Ana into the Red Room.

00:15:15.149 --> 00:15:18.520
Christian orders her to put her hands above
her head, and when he does, he starts undressing

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.520
her.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.529
Then, he ties her hair in a braid before telling
her to kneel in front of the doorway every

00:15:22.529 --> 00:15:23.930
time he comes in.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:27.279
He retrieves a pair of leather cuffs and a
riding crop, and with the crop, he lightly

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:29.100
spanks Ana several times.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.470
This dispels Ana's fear about the practice
as she realizes that there won't be any real

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.470
harm.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.340
Christian then sets up a contraption so that
Ana's hands would be tied to the ceiling.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.290
With Ana completely vulnerable, the two engage
in intense and vigorous lovemaking.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.709
After they've had their fill of each other,
Christian carries a tired Ana to her room,

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:45.540
and he kisses her before he leaves.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:49.180
Now that she's alone again, she starts realizing
just what she had agreed to, and she suddenly

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.930
feels how lonesome it is to lie in bed without
Christian.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.540
The next evening, the Grey family is set to
have their dinner.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.130
Elliot invites Kate, and Christian invites
Ana.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:01.040
During the dinner, Christian continually touches
Ana's thighs and crotch underneath the table,

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.520
unbeknownst to all the other guests and family
members.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.089
Through a conversation between Ana and Christian's
mom, Christian finds out that Ana will be

00:16:07.089 --> 00:16:09.240
leaving for Georgia to visit her mother.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.130
With how Ana purposely kept this from Christian,
it’s almost as if she’s spiting him.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.030
She could be showing him that he doesn’t
have full access to her, especially with the

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:17.920
current state of their relationship.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.340
Frustrated, Christian excuses himself and
Ana.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.660
Once alone, he carries her over his shoulder
and spanks Ana again while expressing how

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.150
annoyed he is.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.500
Setting her down, Christian kisses her and
tells her that she’s his, but Ana eventually

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.690
pulls away from him.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:32.970
She expresses her desire to have a normal
romantic relationship with him, her desire

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.680
to touch him and know him since he’s still
so closed off.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.020
Ana tries asking him about the scars on his
chest, but Christian just says he had a rough

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.149
start in life.

00:16:40.149 --> 00:16:43.310
Later, Ana is asleep when Christian sits on
the bed.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.980
Solemn, he talks to the sleeping woman about
his birth mother, who was a crack addict and

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:47.980
an escort.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.140
Though she's been dead for most of his life,
he says that he can still remember terrible

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.140
things.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.930
Now, it’s evident that Christian’s had
a very troubled life.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:58.660
All the tragedies in his life forged an impenetrable
guard around Christian, and it’s one that

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.529
Ana wants nothing more than to chip at.

00:17:00.529 --> 00:17:04.310
Eventually, Ana arrives in Georgia to be with
her lovely mother and stepfather.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.329
One afternoon, Christian shows up out of nowhere
there in Georgia, surprising Ana.

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:12.039
He takes her to fly in a small plane, and
they enjoy their impromptu time together.

00:17:12.039 --> 00:17:16.019
Ana tries to convince him to be more romantic,
but he suddenly receives a call from work.

00:17:16.019 --> 00:17:18.079
With that, the man leaves in a hurry.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:21.319
After returning home, Ana continues seeing
Christian, and she keeps consenting to the

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:22.850
intimate acts between them.

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:26.870
However, she's also continually frustrated
by Christian's emotional coldness.

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:30.000
In an attempt to understand him better, she
tries asking why he wants to hurt her and

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.279
punish her.

00:17:31.279 --> 00:17:34.610
Christian refuses to answer at first, but
eventually, he erupts, snapping that this

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.059
is the way that he is and that he's fifty
shades of messed up.

00:17:37.059 --> 00:17:40.269
In the heat of the moment, Ana tells him to
show her what he wants to do to her, to punish

00:17:40.269 --> 00:17:43.470
her and show her the worst, so she can finally
understand him.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:46.950
Christian takes Ana to the playroom, and there,
he whips Ana's buttocks six times, making

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.320
Ana cry.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.970
Upset and disgusted, Ana realizes that Christian
is the wrong man for her.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:53.869
Because of this, she breaks up with him.

00:17:53.869 --> 00:17:57.269
Ana walks to the elevator, and when Christian
tries following her, she firmly tells him

00:17:57.269 --> 00:17:58.399
to stop.

00:17:58.399 --> 00:18:01.480
And with tears in Ana’s eyes, the elevator
door closes.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.040
While Fifty Shades of Grey is known for the
whips, cuffs, spanking, and everything in

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.149
between, its core story is about two people
who can’t be together.

00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:10.649
Christian knew from the start that he can’t
be the man that Ana needs.

00:18:10.649 --> 00:18:14.200
If he just listened to his instincts, then
he would have spared them both the heart ache.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.419
But at the same time, their time together
were some of the moments they had.

00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:28.730
Still, even if what you want is each other,
it’s hard to make things work if you’re

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.350
looking for different things.
