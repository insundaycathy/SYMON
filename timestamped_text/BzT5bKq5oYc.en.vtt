00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
down and used that just you know just
 

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.660 align:start position:0%
down and used that just you know just
pull<00:14:42.110><c> a</c><00:14:42.140><c> guy</c><00:14:42.380><c> in</c><00:14:42.590><c> and</c><00:14:42.770><c> be</c><00:14:43.130><c> the</c><00:14:43.280><c> [ __ ]</c><00:14:43.490><c> out</c><00:14:43.640><c> of</c>

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:46.610 align:start position:0%
them and so there is sort of a hit and
 

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.060 align:start position:0%
them and so there is sort of a hit and
miss<00:14:46.790><c> thing</c><00:14:47.630><c> there</c><00:14:48.050><c> with</c><00:14:48.260><c> them</c><00:14:48.440><c> likewise</c><00:14:48.860><c> I</c>

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:56.540 align:start position:0%
lot of strategic moments like that in
 

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.470 align:start position:0%
lot of strategic moments like that in
games<00:14:56.900><c> now</c><00:14:57.290><c> like</c><00:14:57.650><c> if</c><00:14:58.100><c> you</c><00:14:58.280><c> play</c><00:14:58.430><c> Splinter</c><00:14:59.240><c> Cell</c>

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:02.420 align:start position:0%
you can build up combo takedowns like
 

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.410 align:start position:0%
you can build up combo takedowns like
that<00:15:02.690><c> if</c><00:15:02.960><c> you</c><00:15:03.170><c> if</c><00:15:03.380><c> you</c><00:15:03.500><c> have</c><00:15:03.620><c> a</c><00:15:03.650><c> stealth</c><00:15:04.010><c> one</c>

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:04.420 align:start position:0%
that if you if you have a stealth one
 

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
that if you if you have a stealth one
and<00:15:05.420><c> it</c><00:15:05.570><c> just</c><00:15:05.780><c> speeds</c><00:15:06.200><c> up</c><00:15:06.380><c> the</c><00:15:06.530><c> gameplay</c>

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:06.770 align:start position:0%
